 **Section 3.7** **Final Closing Purchase Price Statement.**

 



 

(a) As soon as practicable, but not later than ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall deliver a written statement (the " **Final
Purchase Price Calculation Statement** ") to the Sellers Agents, on behalf of
the Sellers, setting forth its good faith calculations of (i) the Closing
Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 3.7, the " **Final Closing Working Capital** ") to be calculated on a
basis consistent with the calculation of Estimated Closing Working Capital in
Section 3.2(b) (including the Sample Calculation of Working Capital); (ii) the
Closing Cash (as finally determined pursuant to the provisions of this Section
3.7, the " **Final Closing Cash** " **)** ; (iii) the Closing Indebtedness (as

determined pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.7, the " **Final
Closing Indebtedness** "); (iv) the Closing Transaction Expenses (as finally
determined pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.7, the " **Final
Closing Transaction Expenses** ") and (v) a recalculation of the Purchase

Sellers Agents shall reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser and its
accountants to the extent required to prepare the Final Purchase Price
Calculation Statement.

 



 

(b) If the Purchaser fails to timely deliver the Final Purchase Price
Calculation Statement in accordance with Section 3.7(a), the Sellers Agents
(on behalf of the Sellers) shall be entitled to retain, at the expense of the
Purchaser, a nationally-recognized, independent firm of chartered accountants
to provide an audit of the Books and Records of the Acquired Entities and the
Subsidiaries (which Books and Records shall be made available by the
Purchaser), review the calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price and make
any adjustments necessary thereto consistent with the provisions of this
Section 3.7 to determine the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Cash, the
Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Transaction Expenses, and the
determination of such items by the accounting firm shall be final, conclusive
and binding on the Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties reserve
any and all other rights granted to them in this Agreement.

 



 

(c) During the period from the date the Final Purchase Price Calculation
Statement is delivered by the Purchaser to the Sellers Agents through the
date the Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement is finally determined in
accordance with the terms of this Section 3.7, the Purchaser shall and shall
cause each of the Purchasers, the Acquired Entities and the Subsidiaries
respective Representatives to reasonably cooperate, during normal working
hours and with advance notice, with the Sellers Agents and the Sellers
Agents Representatives and to provide the Sellers Agents and the Sellers
Agents Representatives access to the work papers of the Purchaser, the
Acquired Entities and the Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to
the extent required in connection with their review of the Final Purchase
Price Calculation Statement, and the Purchaser shall make available to the
Sellers Agents, those individuals responsible for the preparation of the
Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement in order to respond to inquiries of
the Sellers Agents related thereto.

 



 

(d) If the Sellers Agents disagree with any aspect of the Final Purchase
Price Calculation Statement, then the Sellers Agents shall deliver written
notice to the Purchaser (the " **Dispute Notice** ") within thirty (30) days
after receipt of the Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement, setting
forth, with reasonable particulars, each item with which the Sellers Agents
disagree and the dollar amounts thereof (each, a " **Disputed Item** "),
including the Sellers Agents position on each Disputed Item (and the
Sellers Agents resulting position on the amount of the Closing Working
Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and/or Closing Transaction
Expenses, as applicable). Any item set forth in the Final Purchase Price
Calculation Statement not objected to by the Sellers Agents in the Dispute
Notice shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties.

 



 

(e) If the Sellers Agents either (i) notify the Purchaser in writing that the
Sellers agree with the Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement within
thirty (30) days after receipt thereof or (ii) fails to deliver a Dispute
Notice within such thirty (30) day period, the Final Purchase Price
Calculation Statement delivered by the Purchaser shall become final,
conclusive and binding on

 



      
 

 



 

the Parties and the Parties shall be deemed to have agreed thereto, in the
case of (i), on the date the Purchaser receives such written notice, and in
the case of (ii), on such thirtieth (30th) day; _provided_ that, in the event
that the Purchaser does not provide, during normal working hours and with
advance notice, reasonable access to the work papers and personnel, as
requested by the Sellers Agents pursuant to Section 3.7(c) within five (5)
days of request therefor, such thirty (30) day period shall be extended by one
(1) day for each day after the fifth (5th) day following such request for the
Purchaser to provide such access.

 



 

(f) In the event that the Sellers Agents deliver a Dispute Notice, the
Sellers Agents and the Purchaser shall attempt, in good faith, to resolve the
Disputed Items within fifteen (15) days after the receipt by the Purchaser of
the Dispute Notice and make any amendments to the Final Purchase Price
Calculation Statement as mutually agreed to by the Parties. Any Disputed Items
not resolved by the Purchaser and the Sellers Agents within such fifteen (15)
day period (or such other period as the Parties may agree) shall be submitted
to the dispute resolution practice of the Independent Auditor to determine,
and such determination shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties.
The Independent Auditor shall allow the Purchaser and the Sellers Agents to
present their respective positions regarding the Disputed Items (provided
that, for greater certainty, such presentations are limited to the Disputed
Items described in the Dispute Notice and that have not been resolved by the
Purchaser and the Sellers Agents as aforesaid) and each of the Purchaser and
the Sellers Agents shall have the right to present additional documents,
materials and other information, and make an oral presentation to the
Independent Auditor, regarding such Disputed Items and the Independent Auditor
shall consider such additional documents, materials and other information and
such oral presentation. Any such other documents, materials or other
information shall be copied to each of the Purchaser and the Sellers Agents
and each of the Sellers Agents and the Purchaser shall be entitled to attend
any such oral presentation.

 



 

(g) The Independent Auditor shall determine, based solely on such
presentations from the Sellers Agents and the Purchaser and not by
independent review, the unresolved Disputed Items and, acting as experts and
not arbitrators, shall render a written report (the " **Adjustment Report** ")
to the Sellers Agents and the Purchaser in which the Independent Auditor
shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the Independent Auditors determination
with respect to each of the Disputed Items, and the revisions, if any, to be
made to the Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement as a result thereof,
together with supporting calculations, and the Parties shall make such
revisions to the Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement, as applicable. In
resolving the Disputed Items, the Independent Auditor: (i) shall be bound to
the principles of this Section 3.7 (including the Sample Calculation of
Working Capital and related definitions in this Agreement), (ii) shall limit
its review and determination to the Disputed Items specifically set forth in
the Dispute Notice and submitted to the Independent Auditor for determination
and (iii) shall not assign a value to any Disputed Item higher than the
highest value for such Disputed Item claimed by either Party or lower than the
lowest value for such Disputed Item claimed by either Party. The Parties shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Auditor to
complete its work and render the Adjustment Report within thirty (30) days of
its engagement. The costs, fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall
be allocated to and borne by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers
as a group, on the other hand, (with each Seller responsible only for its Pro
Rata Share of the Sellers portion) based on the inverse of the percentage
that the Independent Auditors determination (before such allocation) bears to
the total amount of the Disputed Items as originally

 



      
 

 



 

submitted to the Independent Auditor. For example, should the Disputed Items
total in amount to $1,000 and the Independent Auditor awards $600 in favor of
the Purchasers position, 60% of the costs of the Independent Auditors review
would be borne by the Sellers as a group (with each Seller responsible only
for its Pro Rata Share of such costs) and 40% of the costs would be borne by
the Purchaser.

 



 

(h) For greater certainty, each of the Closing Working Capital and Estimated
Closing Working Capital are to be calculated and prepared in a manner
consistent, and in accordance with, the indicative Working Capital calculation
set forth in the Sample Calculation of Working Capital.

 



 

 **Section 3.8** **Payment of Purchase Price Adjustments.**

 



 

(a) On the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Final
Purchase Price Calculation Statement has been determined in accordance with
Section 3.7 (whether by agreement of the Parties, deemed agreement or by
determination made by the Independent Auditor) (such date, the " **Settlement
Date** "), the payments contemplated by Section 3.8(b) shall be made.

 



 

(b) On the Settlement Date:

 



 

(i) if the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price,
the Purchaser shall pay such surplus amount to the Sellers Agents on behalf
of the Partnership Sellers, US Blocker Seller and OptionCo Sellers to be
distributed to each Partnership Seller, US Blocker Seller and OptionCo Seller
in each case in accordance with its respective Pro Rata Share; and

 



 

(ii) if the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price,
such shortfall shall first be satisfied from the Adjustment Escrow Account,
and if the Adjustment Escrow Account is insufficient to cover such shortfall,
each Partnership Seller, US Blocker Seller and OptionCo Seller shall pay to
the Purchaser its respective Pro Rata Share of such shortfall.

 



 

 **Section 3.9** **Payments and Location of Closing.**

 



 

Any reference in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement to payment shall mean payment by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in Canadian dollars to the bank account or accounts designated
by the recipient of such payment in writing to the Purchaser or to the
Sellers Agents, as the case may be, not less than three (3) Business Days
prior to the date of such payment. The Closing shall be held at the offices of
Torys LLP, 33rd Floor, 79 Wellington Street West, TD Centre, Toronto, Ontario
M5K 1N2 at 10:00 a.m. (Toronto time) on the Closing Date or such other place
or time as may be agreed by the Purchaser and the Sellers Agents.

 



 

 **Section 3.10** **Withholding Taxes.**

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the Purchaser and
its Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct or withhold any amount from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to the extent
required by the Tax Act or any provision of any

 



      
 

 



 

other Tax Law. To the extent that the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
deducts or withholds any amount from the consideration payable to the Sellers
or Sellers Agents pursuant to this Agreement, such withheld or deducted
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the Sellers or Sellers Agents, as the case may be; provided, that the
amounts so deducted or withheld are timely remitted to the applicable Taxing
Authority. The Purchaser will provide written notice to the Sellers Agents,
not more than ten (10) Business Days prior to Closing, if the Purchaser
determines that any such withholding or deduction is required.

 



 

(b) The Acquired Entities shall, and/or shall cause the Subsidiaries to,
deduct and withhold from any payments required to be made to current or former
directors, officers, employees and consultants or holders of Options pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts that are required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payments under the Tax Act or any provision
of any other Tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld, (i) such amounts
shall be remitted by the applicable Acquired Entity or Subsidiary to the
applicable Taxing Authority, and (ii) the withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the current or
former director, officer, employee or consultant or holder of an Option in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

 **Section 3.11** **Determination of Pro Rata Share and Cash Pro Rata
Share.**

 



 

Each of the Sellers hereby agrees that, notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary in the terms of the Purchased Securities and Governing Documents, its
respective Pro Rata Share and Cash Pro Rata Share set forth in Schedule 1(b),
as may be amended by the Sellers after the date hereof in accordance with
Section 3.1, and any related conversion of Purchased Securities into other
classes of Purchased Securities shall be determined based on the Estimated
Purchase Price set forth in the Estimated Purchase Price Calculation
Statement, and not the final Purchase Price. The terms of the Purchased
Securities are hereby automatically amended to give effect to the foregoing,
without any further act required on the part of any Seller.

exemptions under Canadian provincial securities laws and that the Purchaser is
relying upon the truth and accuracy of, and each Management Equityholders
compliance with, the representations, warranties, acknowledgments and
understandings of such Management Equityholder set forth herein in order to
determine the availability of such exemptions and the eligibility of such
Management Equityholder to acquire the Management Share Consideration
exchangeable into Management GMS Shares.

information), to pay the Purchase Price and all other necessary fees, expenses

Commitment Letters are and will remain up to and including the Closing, in

 



      
 

 



 

full force and effect, constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Purchaser and each of the other parties thereto, and have not been
modified, amended, restated or replaced. As of the date hereof, none of the
respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitment Letters have been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in whole or in part. As of the date hereof,
the Purchaser is not in breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth in
the Financing Commitment Letters and no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to
constitute such a breach by the Purchaser or a failure by the Purchaser to
satisfy a condition precedent set forth therein. The Purchaser has fully paid
any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing Commitment
Letters to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. As of the date
hereof, there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to
the funding of the full amount of the financing provided for in the Financing
Commitment Letters other than as specified in the Financing Commitment Letters
and the Purchaser has no reason to believe that the conditions set forth in
the Financing Commitment Letters will not be satisfied, that such available
cash will not be available at the Closing or that the Financing Commitment
Letters will not be funded at the Closing. As of the date hereof, the
aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters, together
with available cash on hand, shall be sufficient to enable the Purchaser to
pay the Purchase Price and consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. As of the date hereof, the
Purchaser does not know of any reason (i) that any of the conditions to the
financing under the Financing Commitment Letters will not be satisfied or that
the financing under the Financing Commitment Letters will not be available on
the Closing Date or (ii) that the Purchaser will not have sufficient funds
otherwise available at the Closing to satisfy the Purchasers obligations
under Section 3.3. As of the Closing Date, assuming that the Financing Sources
advance the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Financing Commitment
Letters, the Purchaser will have sufficient funds available at the Closing to
satisfy the Purchasers obligations under Section 3.3. The Purchaser
acknowledges that it is not a condition to Closing or any of its other
obligations under this Agreement that Purchaser obtain financing pursuant to
any or all of the Financing Commitment Letters or from any other source for or
related to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents.

agreement dated October 21, 2017 (the " **Confidentiality Agreement** ")
between the Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser, as applicable, and
Master LP (or a Representative of Master LP on its behalf, as applicable)
shall continue to apply notwithstanding the execution of this Agreement by the
Parties or the announcement of this Agreement, and agrees to fulfill its
obligations thereunder in accordance with the terms thereof. For the avoidance
of doubt, if this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full
force and effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Financing Sources
confidentiality obligations shall be governed by the Financing Commitment
Letters, rather than the Confidentiality Agreement, and "click-through"
confidentiality arrangements customarily in syndicated financings of this
type.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 8.2** **Regulatory and Third Party Approvals.**

 



 

(a) Subject to Section 8.2(b) and (c), the Purchaser shall, as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts
to give all notices to, make all filings and applications with, obtain all
consents and approvals of and take any action in respect of, any Persons and
Governmental Authorities that are required of the Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents set forth in Section 6.3 of Schedule 6, (ii) provide such other
information and communications to such Governmental Authorities or other
Persons as such Governmental Authorities or other Persons may reasonably
request in connection therewith and (iii) provide such necessary information
and reasonable cooperation to the Acquired Entities, the Subsidiaries and
their outside counsel as reasonably requested by the Acquired Entities in
connection with the performance of the Acquired Entities obligations under
Section 7.3. The Purchaser shall provide prompt notification to the Acquired
Entities and the Sellers when any such consent, approval, action, filing or
notice referred to in clause (i) above is obtained, taken, made or given, as
applicable, and shall advise the Acquired Entities and the Sellers of any
communications (and, unless precluded by Law, provide copies of any such
communications that are in writing to the Acquired Entities and the Sellers
and their respective outside counsels) with any Governmental Authority or
other Person regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the other Transaction Documents.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall
consult and cooperate with the Acquired Entities, the Subsidiaries and the
Sellers in connection with all notices, filings, applications, analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of the Purchaser in connection
with obtaining all consents and approvals from any Governmental Authority
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or under the
other Transaction Documents. The Purchaser will not make any notification,
filing, application or other submission in relation to the transactions
contemplated hereby or under the other Transaction Documents without first
providing the Acquired Entities and the Sellers with a copy of such
notification, filing, application or other submission in draft form (subject
to reasonable redactions or limiting the sharing of such draft, or parts
thereof, to an outside-counsel-only basis where appropriate) and giving the
Acquired Entities and the Sellers a reasonable opportunity to consider its
content before it is filed with the relevant Governmental Authority, and the
Purchaser shall consider and take account of all reasonable comments timely
made in this respect. The Purchaser shall promptly notify the Acquired
Entities and the Sellers of any substantive communications from or with any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure, to the extent permitted by Law, that the
Acquired Entities and the Sellers, or their outside counsel where appropriate,
are involved in any substantive communications and invited to attend meetings
with, or other appearances before, any Governmental Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the obligations
of the Purchaser under this Section 8.2 shall include committing to any and
all undertakings, divestitures, licenses or hold separate or similar
arrangements with respect to its assets or the assets of the Acquired Entities
and/or any Subsidiaries and committing to any undertakings or other
arrangements relating to conduct of its business or the business of the
Acquired Entities and/or any

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries as a condition to obtaining any and all approvals or clearances
from any Governmental Authority or Person necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or under the other Transaction Documents,
including taking any and all actions necessary in order to ensure the receipt
of the necessary consents, approvals, clearances or forbearances, or the
termination, waiver or expiration of the necessary waiting periods, under, as
applicable, the Competition Act or any other applicable antitrust,
competition, foreign investment or similar Law. The Purchaser shall not
knowingly take or cause to be taken any action which would be expected to
prevent or delay the obtaining of any consent or approval required hereunder,
including entering into any timing or other agreements with any Governmental
Authority without the express written consent of the Acquired Entities and the
Sellers, for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or under
the other Transaction Documents. No action taken under this Section 8.2 shall
entitle the Purchaser to any reduction in the Purchase Price.

 



 

 **Section 8.3** **Financing.**

 



 

(a) The Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall
cause its Affiliates to use commercially reasonable efforts to, take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary
to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitment Letters, (ii) consummate
the financings contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters on the terms
and conditions described therein as promptly as possible following the date
hereof, including the negotiation and execution of definitive credit or loan
or other agreements and all other documentation with respect to the financings
contemplated in the Financing Commitment Letters (correct and complete copies
of which shall be delivered to the Sellers promptly upon execution thereof and
from time to time upon request of the Sellers) and (iii) cause the Financing
Sources to fund the financings under the Financing Commitment Letters required
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents on the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser shall not amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter, any
Financing Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement or documentation
referred to in this Section 8.3 in any manner that would reasonably be
expected to materially impair, delay or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, in each case without the prior written consent of the Sellers. The
Purchaser shall keep the Sellers reasonably informed with respect to all
material activity concerning the status of the financings under the Financing
Commitment Letters and shall promptly (and in any event, within three (3)
Business Days) notify the Sellers of (i) the expiration or termination (or
attempted or purported termination, whether or not valid) of the Financing
Commitment Letters or (ii) any refusal in writing of any Financing Source to
provide or any stated intent in writing by such Financing Sources to refuse to
provide the full financings contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters,
in each case, notwithstanding the efforts of the Purchaser to satisfy its
obligations under this Section 8.3. If funds in the amounts set forth in the
Financing Commitment Letters became unavailable to the Purchaser on the terms
set forth therein, the Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to promptly arrange for alternative financing (the " **Alternative Financing**
") on terms not materially less favorable to the Purchaser and the Acquired
Entities than those contained in the Financing Commitment Letters (which shall
be in an amount sufficient to pay, when added with the other financing under
the Financing Commitment Letters, the Purchase Price and all necessary fees,
expenses and other amounts in connection with the consummation of

 



      
 

 



 

the transactions contemplated hereunder or under the other Transaction
Documents) to replace the financings contemplated by such expired or
terminated commitments or arrangements or for which such Financing Source has
refused to provide such financing on the terms set forth in the Financing
Commitment Letter. The Purchaser shall deliver correct and complete copies of
any modified or replacement Financing Commitment Letters to the Sellers as
promptly as practicable following the execution thereof.

 



 

(c) The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that except as set forth in Section
7.4, none of the Acquired Entities or their respective Affiliates and
Representatives shall have any responsibility for any financing that the
Purchaser may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or
under the other Transaction Documents ( _provided_ , that nothing in this
Section 8.3 shall limit the ability of the Acquired Entities to incur
liabilities with respect to such financing on or following the Closing Date).
The Purchaser also acknowledges and agrees that its obtaining financing is not
a condition to the Closing.

 



 

 **Section 8.4** **Fulfillment of Conditions.**

 



 

Except as otherwise set forth herein, the Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate actions, to
do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated hereunder or under the other Transaction Documents, including the
satisfaction, but not the waiver, of each condition to the obligations of the
Acquired Entities and the Sellers contained in Article 11.

 



 

 **Section 8.5** **Officers  and Directors Insurance and Indemnification.**

 



 

(a) The Sellers or the Acquired Entities shall, or shall cause the
Subsidiaries to, purchase, prior to the Closing, for the period from the
Closing Date until six (6) years after the Closing Date, a tail directors and
officers liability insurance policy (the " **D andO Insurance**") providing
coverage for the present and former directors and officers of the Acquired
Entities and the Subsidiaries with respect to any claims arising from facts or
events that occurred prior to the Closing Date (including in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or under the other
Transaction Documents) on terms comparable to those contained in the current
insurance policy of the Acquired Entities and the Subsidiaries. For the
avoidance of doubt, the cost of the DandO Insurance shall be included as a
Transaction Expense to the extent not paid in full prior to the time as of
which Closing Cash is determined.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause the Acquired
Entities and the Subsidiaries (or any successor(s)) to, until the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Closing Date (or, in the case of clause (ii), for so long
thereafter as any claim for indemnification asserted on or prior to such date
has not been finally adjudicated) (i) keep and not amend, modify or repeal any
provision of the indemnity agreements for the current directors and officers
of the Acquired Entities and the Subsidiaries in effect as of the date hereof
and (ii) except to the extent required by Law, not take any action so as to
amend, modify or repeal the provisions for indemnification of directors,
officers or employees contained in the Governing Documents of any Acquired
Entity or Subsidiary as of the date hereof in such a manner as would adversely
affect the rights of any

 



      
 

 



 

individual who shall have served as a director or officer of any Acquired
Entity and/or Subsidiary prior to the Closing to be indemnified by such
corporations in respect of their serving in such capacities at or prior to the
Closing.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this Section 8.5 shall survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each individual referred to in this Section 8.5, his or her heirs and
successors and his or her legal representatives (collectively, the "
**Directors and Officers** "). The Acquired Entities and the Subsidiaries
agree to pay from time to time as necessary all expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the Directors and Officers in
enforcing the obligations provided for in this Section 8.5.

 



 

(d) If any Acquired Entity, Subsidiary or any of their respective successors
or assigns shall (i) amalgamate, consolidate with or merge or wind up into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity or (ii)
transfer all or substantially all of its prospective assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Purchaser, the Acquired Entities or any of the
Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in
this Section 8.5.

 



 

 **Section 8.6** **Preservation of Books and Records.**

 



 

The Purchaser and the Acquired Entities shall, and shall cause the
Subsidiaries to, preserve and keep the records held by them as of the Closing
Date relating to the respective businesses of the Acquired Entities and the
Subsidiaries for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date (or longer
if required by applicable Law) and shall make such records and personnel
available to the Sellers (in a manner and only to the extent so as not to
unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of the Acquired
Entities and the Subsidiaries) (including the right to make copies thereof),
at the Sellers own cost and expense and, as may be reasonably required by the
Sellers in connection with any insurance claims by, Legal Proceedings
(including with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement) or Tax audits
against or investigations by any Governmental Authority of the Sellers or any
of their Affiliates with respect to their ownership of the Acquired Entities
and the Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents (other than in connection with any Legal
Proceedings, claims or disputes under this Agreement between the Purchaser,
the Acquired Entities or the Subsidiaries or any of its or their Affiliates on
the one hand, and the Seller(s) on the other hand).

 



 

 **Section 8.7** **Letter of Credit.**

 



 

The Acquired Entities and the Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to arrange for the termination of the Letter of Credit. If the Letter
of Credit is terminated following the Closing, and the GIC is returned to the
Acquired Entities, the Purchaser shall, within five (5) Business Days of such
termination, cause the Acquired Entities to, at the direction of the Sellers
Agents, either (i) liquidate the GIC and pay the proceeds thereof to the
Sellers Agents on behalf of the Sellers, or (ii) transfer the GIC to the
Sellers Agents on behalf of the Sellers.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 8.8** **R andW Policies.**

 



 

The Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not amend, waive or otherwise modify
the RandW Policies, in any manner that would allow the insurer thereunder or any
other Person to subrogate or otherwise make or bring any claim or Legal
Proceeding against any Seller or any of its Affiliates or any past, present or
future director, manager, officer, employee or advisor of any of the foregoing
based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement that the insurer would not have the
right to bring absent such amendment, waiver or modification. Each Party and
its Representatives shall reasonably cooperate with the insurer under the RandW
Policies in connection with the defense of any claim which might reasonably
constitute a Loss under such RandW Policies. The insurers under the RandW Policies
shall have the right to participate in the investigation, defense and
settlement of claims reasonably likely to be covered under the RandW Policies.

 



 

 **Section 8.9** **Assignment.**

 



 

Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall assign its rights under this
Agreement to the Purchaser Assignee, provided that such assignment shall not
relieve Purchaser of its obligations hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Purchaser Assignee shall not be an entity described in any of paragraphs
100(1.1)(a) to (d) of the Tax Act. Further, the Purchaser Assignee shall at
all times up to and including Closing, be a "taxable Canadian corporation" as
defined in the Tax Act. Following such assignment, GMS Inc. shall cause the
Purchaser Assignee to fulfill its obligations herein and in furtherance of
this obligation all references in this Agreement to the Purchaser shall be
read as references to the Purchaser Assignee. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Purchaser Assignee shall satisfy the payment obligation in Section 3.3(v) to
deliver the Management Share Consideration to the Sellers Agents on behalf of
the Management Equityholders by delivering (or procuring the delivery of)
certificated Purchaser Assignee Exchangeable Shares.

 



 

 **Section 8.10** **GMS Inc. Prospectus Supplement.**

 



 

GMS Inc. will use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the
SEC prior to the date that is one (1) year from the Closing Date a prospectus
supplement (the " **Pro Sup** ") to GMS Inc.s prospectus dated December 11,
2017, constituting part of the Purchasers Registration Statement on Form S-3
(No. 333-221986) (the " **Registration Statement** "), to cover the resale by
the Management Equityholders from time-to-time of the Management GMS Shares
that they may receive in exchange for their Management Share Consideration. If
a Pro Sup to cover the resale by the Management Equityholders from time to
time of the Management GMS Shares, has not been prepared and filed prior to
the date that is one (1) year from the Closing Date, GMS Inc. will use
commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC, as soon as
possible, a Pro Sup to cover the resale by the Management Equityholders from
time to time of the Management GMS Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GMS
Inc. shall not be required to include in the Pro Sup any shares of a
Management Equityholder who does not furnish to the Purchaser, within a
reasonable time after written request therefor by GMS Inc., such information
regarding such Management Equityholder as shall be required as a matter of US
or Canadian securities laws. In the event that securities may not be offered
and sold under the Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 415(a)(5) under the
US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the " **Securities Act** ") while any
of the Management GMS Shares to be covered by the Pro Sup or Management Share
Consideration

 



      
 

 



 

have not been disposed of by the Management Equityholders, and GMS Inc.
remains eligible to register its securities for sale by the Management
Equityholders on Form S-3, GMS Inc. shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to prepare and file a replacement registration statement with the SEC and file
a prospectus supplement with the SEC covering such shares prior to the time
that the Registration Statement ceases to be effective. Such obligation to
file successor registration statements and prospectus supplements shall
continue so long as any of the Management Share Consideration or, upon the
exchange of such shares, the Management GMS Shares, has not been disposed of.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of GMS Inc. established in this
Section 8.10 shall terminate and shall have no further force or effect at such
time as the Management GMS Shares to be covered by the Pro Sup have been sold,
or may be sold pursuant to Rule 144(b)(i) of the Securities Act without
restriction.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 9**

 

 ** **

 

 **MUTUAL COVENANTS OF THE ACQUIRED ENTITIES AND THE PURCHASER**

 



 

 **Section 9.1** **Regulatory Filings and Other Actions.**

 



 

(a) In addition to, and not in limitation of the covenants contained in
Section 7.3 and Section 8.2, the Acquired Entities and the Purchaser shall
prepare and file, as promptly as practicable and (i) in any event within ten
(10) Business Days after the execution of this Agreement, the notification
required under section 114 of the Competition Act, together with an
application for an Advance Ruling Certificate, or, if the Purchaser so
decides, an application for an Advance Ruling Certificate alone and (ii) in
any event within twenty (20) Business Days after the execution of this
Agreement, such other filings, notices and applications required to obtain the
consents, approvals and authorizations from Persons and Governmental
Authorities that are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. Each of the Acquired
Entities and the Purchaser shall also certify compliance with any supplemental
information request under the Competition Act (also known as a supplementary
information request) that it receives within ninety (90) calendar days of
receipt of such request.

 



 

(b) Each of the Acquired Entities and the Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to oppose, lift or rescind any injunction or restraining or
other order seeking to stop, or otherwise adversely affecting its ability to
consummate, this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby or under the other Transaction Documents and
to defend, or cause to be defended, any proceedings to which it is a party or
brought against it or its directors or officers challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or under the other
Transaction Documents.

 



 

 **Section 9.2** **Tax Matters**

 



 

(a) _Tax Returns_. The Tax Returns to be filed for the Acquired Entities and
the Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods, other than
Tax Returns filed prior to the Closing Date, will be prepared and filed on a
timely basis by the Acquired Entities and the Subsidiaries. Such returns will
be prepared consistent with prior practice, except where otherwise required
under applicable Laws. For the avoidance of doubt, either the Purchaser or the
Sellers

 



      
 

 



 

Agents may cause any Acquired Entity or Subsidiary that is a corporation to
make an election pursuant to subsection 256(9) of the Tax Act (and
corresponding provincial Law) in respect of the taxation year of such Acquired
Entity or Subsidiary, as the case may be, ending on the acquisition of control
of it by the Purchaser. The Sellers will cooperate with the Purchaser to
effect such filings on a timely basis. The Acquired Entities and the
Subsidiaries will timely remit any Taxes shown as owing on such Tax Returns
that are owing by the Acquired Entities and the Subsidiaries, as applicable.
In respect of Pre-Closing Tax Periods for which original Tax Returns will be
filed on or after the Closing Date and in respect of Straddle Periods, the
Acquired Entities and the Subsidiaries will deduct the maximum capital cost
allowances in respect of depreciable property of the Acquired Entities and the
Subsidiaries and the maximum amount of other deductions and reserves as is
permitted under the Tax Act.

 



 

(b) _Allocation of Income or Loss_. The Parties agree to cause the Master LP
Partnership Agreement and Feeder LP Partnership Agreement to be amended prior
to Closing in order to allocate for Tax purposes income, gain, deduction, loss
or credit of Master LP and Feeder LP for a Straddle Period to each partner of
Master LP and Feeder LP (as applicable) at any time during the Straddle Period
(which, for greater certainty, includes a partner at any time in the fiscal
period of Master LP and Feeder LP in which the Closing Date occurs) on the
basis that the Straddle Period consisted of two hypothetical taxable periods,
the first of which ended immediately before the Closing and the second of
which began at the Closing, with such income, gain, deduction, loss or credit
being allocated between the two hypothetical taxable periods on a "closing of
the books basis", with such income gain, deduction, loss or credit being
allocated to the hypothetical taxable period to which they reasonably relate
(provided, however, that the exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis will be apportioned between the two hypothetical
taxable periods on a daily basis). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, (i) the Parties agree to cause the limited partnership agreement
governing each partnership of which Master LP is a direct or indirect partner
to be amended prior to Closing such that any income, gain, deduction, loss or
credit of Master LP in respect of a period shall include its share of any
income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of such Subsidiary partnership on the
basis that any income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of such subsidiary
partnership were allocated on the basis set out in this paragraph, _mutatis
mutandis_ , and (ii) except to the extent taken into account in an earlier
period, any Transaction Expenses incurred by Master LP or a Subsidiary in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be allocated
to the first such hypothetical taxable period and, to the extent permitted by
the Tax Act and the provisions of any other applicable Tax Law, be deducted or
otherwise recognized in computing income in the first such hypothetical
taxable period.

 



 

(c) _Responsibility for Taxes_. The Sellers will be liable for any Taxes of
the Acquired Entities under the Tax Act or any other Taxes whatsoever that are
in respect of, or attributed to any income earned in, a Pre-Closing Tax Period
or the portion of a Straddle Period ending immediately before the Closing
except to the extent reflected in the Final Closing Working Capital. For
greater certainty and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Sellers will be liable for any Taxes payable in respect of a Tax year that is
not a Pre-Closing Tax Period by any of the Acquired Entities that is a
corporation and that is a partner of Feeder LP, Master LP or any Subsidiary
that is a partnership and that relate to such Acquired Entitys share of any
income or gain of Feeder LP, Master LP or any Subsidiary that is a partnership
that is allocated to the

 



      
 

 



 

hypothetical taxable period referenced in Section 9.2(b) that ended
immediately prior to the Closing. The Purchasers will be liable for any all
Taxes of the Acquired Entities under the Tax Act or any other Taxes whatsoever
that are in respect of, or attributed to any income earned in, the portion of
a Straddle Period that began on the Closing Date and all other fiscal and
taxable periods ending on or after the Closing. In determining the liability
of the Sellers and the Purchasers for Taxes, any bonuses payable to employees
which are contingent as of the Closing Date but otherwise incurred or accrued
by any Acquired Entity or Subsidiary in a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
allocated on a daily basis over the period to which such bonuses relate.

 



 

(d) _Tax Refunds_. If the Purchaser, Master LP or any Subsidiary receives any
refund of Taxes (in cash or as a reduction of Taxes otherwise due) in respect
of any Pre-Closing Tax Period (any such refund, a " **Pre-Closing Tax Refund**
"), including for greater certainty, a refund resulting from the recovery of
GST/HST in connection with the Closing Transaction Expenses, the Purchaser
will calculate the difference between the amount of the Pre-Closing Tax Refund
and any amount in respect of the Pre-Closing Tax Refund recorded as an asset
in Working Capital. The Purchaser will pay the Sellers Agents or their
designee (for the benefit of the Sellers) the applicable portion of the amount
of the difference, net of any Taxes incurred in respect of the receipt of any
refund interest and any costs incurred in respect of such Pre-Closing Tax
Refund, by way of wire transfer of immediately available funds within fifteen
(15) Business Days of receiving the refund. Any amounts payable under this
Section 9.2(d) shall constitute an adjustment in the Purchase Price. Nothing
in this Section 9.2(d) shall require that the Purchaser make any payment with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Refund (and such Pre-Closing Tax Refund shall
be for the benefit of the Purchaser) that is the result of the carrying back
of any net operating loss, non-capital loss or other Tax attribute or Tax
credit incurred or generated in any period other than a Pre-Closing Tax
Period. The Purchaser shall cooperate with the Sellers, to the extent
reasonably requested by the Sellers, in obtaining such Pre-Closing Tax Refund,
it being understood that any such Pre-Closing Tax Refunds will be claimed in
cash rather than as a credit against future Tax liabilities. Any references
throughout this Agreement to Taxes for which the Sellers may be liable under
Section 9.2(c) include any Taxes that would otherwise result as a refund to
the Sellers under this Section 9.2(d).

 



 

(e) _Actions after Closing_. Without the prior written consent of the Sellers
Agents, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, the Purchaser will not, and will ensure that no Acquired Entity or
Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Purchaser, any Acquired Entity or any
Subsidiary will:

 



 

(i) voluntarily approach any Governmental Authority regarding any Taxes or Tax
Returns of any Acquired Entity or any Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period;

 



 

(ii) amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in
part to any Acquired Entity or any Subsidiary with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period if such amendment, refiling or modification would reasonably be
expected to have an adverse impact on the Sellers;

 



 

(iii) surrender any claim for material Tax refunds of any Acquired Entity or
Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period; or

 



       
 

 



 

(iv) except as otherwise required by applicable Tax Law, make or change any
Tax elections or change any annual Tax accounting period or adopt or change
any method of Tax accounting of any Acquired Entity or any Subsidiary in a
manner that results in any material increased Tax liability or any material
increase in income or reduction of any deduction, credit or loss carryover,
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period if such amendment, refiling or
modification would have a material adverse impact on the Sellers.

 



 

(f) _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes shall be borne by the Purchaser. The
Purchaser shall timely file, to the extent required by applicable Law, all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes and provide to the Sellers Agents upon request evidence of
payment of all Transfer Taxes.

 



 

(g) _Tax Audit_.

 



 

(i) The Sellers Agents, at the Sellers sole cost and expense, shall control
any audit or other Legal Proceeding in respect of any Tax Return or Taxes of
any Acquired Entity or Subsidiary (a " **Tax Contest** ") to the extent it
relates solely to Taxes for which the Sellers may be liable under this
Agreement; provided, however: (A) the Sellers Agents shall keep the Purchaser
reasonably informed regarding the status of such Tax Contest and the Purchaser
shall be provided copies of any material correspondence relating to such Tax
Contest; (B) the Sellers Agents shall consult in good faith with the
Purchaser regarding the defense of such Tax Contest and the Purchaser shall
have the right to participate, or cause the applicable Acquired Entity or
Subsidiary to participate, in such Tax Contest; (C) the Sellers Agents will
provide the Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to comment on any
representations or submissions proposed to be made to a Governmental Authority
in respect of such Tax Contest and to attend any meeting with any such
Governmental Authority with respect to such matters; and (D) the Sellers
Agents shall not settle, resolve or abandon (and shall not allow any Acquired
Entity or any Subsidiary to settle, resolve or abandon) such Tax Contest
without the prior written consent of the Purchaser (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). If the Sellers Agents choose
not to exercise its right to assume control of a Tax Contest, the Purchaser
will provide the Sellers Agents a reasonable opportunity to comment on any
representations or submissions proposed to be made to a Governmental Authority
in respect of such Tax Contest and to attend any meeting with any such Taxing
Authority with respect to such matters. If any Governmental Authority is
entitled to take collection action in respect of any Tax Contest,
notwithstanding the defense relating thereto or if an amount has to be paid in
order to advance the Tax Contest, the Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid
such amount that is subject to such collection action or that is required to
be so paid to the relevant Governmental Authority within the time required by
applicable Law. The Sellers shall have the right to pay or cause the
applicable Acquired Entity or Subsidiary to pay the

 



      
 

 



 

balance of the amount subject to a Tax Contest to the relevant Governmental
Authority on behalf of the applicable Acquired Entity or Subsidiary.

 



 

(ii) The Purchaser will provide notice to the Sellers Agents of any inquiries
made by any Governmental Authority (including any proposed or actual
assessments or reassessments) to the extent that the subject matter thereof
would reasonably be expected to give rise to a liability of the Sellers under
this Agreement (a " **Tax Claim** "). The Purchaser will forthwith advise the
Sellers of the substance of any such inquiries or discussions and provide the
Sellers with copies of any material written communications from any
Governmental Authority relating to such inquiries or discussions. The failure
of the Purchaser to provide any such notice shall not release the Sellers from
any of their obligations under this Agreement except to the extent the Sellers
are actually materially prejudiced by such failure.

 



 

(iii) The Sellers and the Purchaser (a) shall cooperate fully with each other
and make available to each other in a timely fashion such data, personnel or
other information as may reasonably be required to respond to or defend any
Tax Contest, (b) shall preserve such data and other information until the

and 2032068 agrees that it shall not, directly or indirectly, engage in, own,

Restrictive Covenants are integral to this Agreement and have been granted to
maintain or preserve the fair market value of the Purchased Securities; (iii)
the Purchaser would not purchase the Purchased Securities without having the
benefit of the Restrictive Covenants; and (iv) each of the Sellers is
receiving, directly or indirectly, substantial and sufficient consideration

(a) In the event that any Person shall incur or suffer any Losses in respect
of which indemnification may be sought by such Person pursuant to the
provisions of this Article 12, the Person seeking to be indemnified hereunder
(the " **Indemnified Party** ") shall assert a claim for indemnification by
written notice to the Person from whom indemnification is sought (the "
**Indemnifying Party** ") stating with reasonable specificity the nature and
basis of such claim (including the breach, inaccuracy, nonperformance or
provision of the Agreement to which such claim relates), a reasonable estimate
of the amount of such claim and including copies of all relevant pleadings and
other demands (a " **Notice** "). In the case of Losses arising by reason of
any claim or Legal Proceeding by a third party (a " **Third Party Claim** "),
the Notice shall be given within fifteen (15) days of the filing or other
written assertion of any such claim against the Indemnified Party and in all
other cases with reasonable promptness, but the failure of the Indemnified
Party to give the Notice within such time period shall not relieve the
Indemnifying

 



       
 

 



 

Party of any liability that the Indemnifying Party may have to the Indemnified
Party unless the Indemnifying Party can demonstrate actual loss or prejudice
as a result of such failure.

 



 

(b) The Indemnified Party shall provide to the Indemnifying Party on request
all information and documentation in its possession reasonably necessary to
support and verify any Losses which the Indemnified Party believes give rise
to a claim for indemnification hereunder and shall give the Indemnifying Party
reasonable access to all premises, books, records and personnel in the
possession or under the control of the Indemnified Party which would have
bearing on such claim.

 



 

(c) In the case of any Third Party Claim (other than for a Tax Claim) for
which indemnification is sought, subject to the provisions of this Section
12.6(c), the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to (i) conduct and
control any proceedings or negotiations with such third party, (ii) perform
and control or direct the performance of any required activities, (iii) take
all other steps to settle or defend any such claim (provided that the
Indemnifying Party shall not settle any such claim without the consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) unless the settlement involves only money damages and
includes a complete release of the Indemnified Party with respect to the
claim, and does not include any statement as to or an admission of fact,
culpability, or failure to act, by or on behalf of an Indemnified Party) and
(iv) employ counsel at its own cost and expense to contest any such claim or
liability. In the event the Indemnifying Party elects to conduct and control
any proceedings itself, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to fully
participate at its own cost and expense and by its own separate counsel in any
proceedings relating to any third-party claim, except that the Indemnifying
Party shall pay the costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (x) in the
Indemnified Partys reasonable judgment, based on the advice of counsel, it is
advisable for the Indemnified Party to be represented by separate counsel
because a conflict or potential conflict exists between the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party, (y) in the Indemnified Partys reasonable judgment,
based on the advice of counsel, with respect to such claims or liability, the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party may have different, conflicting
or adverse legal positions or interests or (z) the named parties to such Third
Party Claim include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnified Party determines in its reasonable judgment, based on the
advice of counsel, that defenses are available to it that are unavailable to
the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a
Seller is the Indemnifying Party, they shall not have the right to assume the
defense and control of any Third Party Claim involving (A) any claim involving
breach of representation in Section 4.18 ( _Environmental Matters_ ) relating
to any Facility, (B) any claim involving a criminal matter or Legal Proceeding
in which the third party is a Governmental Authority,(C) any claim seeking an
injunction or other equitable relief or, that in the Indemnified Partys
reasonable judgment, would have a continuing material adverse effect on the
Indemnified Partys business (including any material impairment of its
relationships with customers, suppliers or landlords) and (D) a claim which
could reasonably be expected to pose significant legal, financial, regulatory
or reputational risk to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall,
within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Notice to Indemnifying Party
(the " **Dispute Period** "), notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its
intention to the conduct and control of the defense of such claim and its
acknowledgement and agreement that the Indemnifying Party is responsible for
any Losses incurred by the Indemnified Party as a result of such Third Party
Claim in accordance with this

 



      
 

 



 

Article 12, _provided_ , that the Indemnified Party and its counsel shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel. Until the Indemnified
Party has received notice of the Indemnifying Partys election whether to
defend any claim, the Indemnified Party shall take reasonable steps to defend
(but may not settle) such claim. If the Indemnifying Party shall decline to
assume the defense of any such claim, or the Indemnifying Party shall fail to
notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period of the Indemnifying
Partys election to defend such claim, the Indemnified Party shall defend
against such claim (provided that the Indemnified Party shall not settle such
claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)). The expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses) of all proceedings, contests or lawsuits in
respect of such claims shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party but only if
the Indemnifying Party is responsible pursuant hereto to indemnify the
Indemnified Party in respect of the Third Party Claim and, if applicable, only
to the extent required by Section 12.3 and Section 12.5, as the case may be,
and subject to the limitations of this Section 12.6 and Section 12.7.
Regardless of whether the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party shall
assume the defense of the claim, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party agree to cooperate fully with one another in connection therewith and to
keep each other reasonably informed of the status of the claim and any related
proceeding and the Indemnified Party shall take no action or make any
admissions or statements not required by applicable Law which would adversely
affect the defense of any such claim.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not
dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party with respect any claim under
this Article 12 or fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute
Period, the Losses arising from any such claim shall, subject to the
provisions of Section 12.3, Section 12.5 and Section 12.7, be conclusively
deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party shall,
subject to the provisions of Section 12.3, Section 12.5 and Section 12.7, pay
the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified Party on demand following the final
determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its
liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of
such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, either party may seek
a resolution of such dispute by litigation in a court of competent
jurisdiction in accordance with Section 14.10 and Section 14.11.

 



 

 **Section 12.7** **Further Limitations and Qualifications on
Indemnification.**

 



 

(a) _Damages_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Indemnified Party shall have no right to indemnification with respect to (i)
any punitive, exemplary or special damages or (ii) any Losses (other than
Losses in respect of Taxes) to the extent not a reasonably foreseeable result
of any breach by the Indemnifying Party of a representation and warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Tax Benefit or Loss_.

 



 

(i) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to any Tax Benefit realized by
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates as a consequence of any Loss or
Taxes (including any circumstance giving rise to such Loss or Taxes) that the
Indemnifying Party or any of its affiliates is responsible for under this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to Article 12).
Unless such Tax Benefit cannot be claimed directly by the Indemnifying Party,
the Indemnified Party shall claim (or shall cause its relevant subsidiary or
affiliate to claim) such Tax Benefit and pay to the Indemnifying Party the
amount of such Tax Benefit within fifteen (15) days after such Tax Benefit is
realized.

 



 

(ii) Any amounts payable by an Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of an
Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss or Taxes pursuant to Section 12.3
shall be increased to take account of any net Tax cost incurred by the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates arising from the receipt of
indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up for such increase). The amount of any
Loss or Taxes for which indemnification is provided hereunder and the amount
of any such Tax cost on the receipt of indemnity payments shall be determined
net of any item of loss, deduction, credit or other Tax asset or attribute
arising in or attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period available to reduce
the amount of any Tax liability.

 



 

(c) _Right to Recover_. The Indemnifying Party shall make any indemnification
payments determined to be payable to the Indemnified Party hereunder without
regard to any expectation that the Indemnified Party (including, for this
Section 12.7(c) in the case of the Purchaser, the Acquired Entities and the
Subsidiaries) will recover insurance proceeds (including under the RandW
Policies) or other amounts (whether by payment, discount, credit, relief,
insurance or otherwise) as a result of the matter giving rise to the claim for
which indemnification payments are to be made. In addition, the Indemnifying
Party shall, to the extent of any indemnification payment made by it, be
subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party against any third party in
respect of the claim to which the indemnification payment relates. If the
Indemnified Party receives any insurance proceeds (including under the RandW
Policies) or other amounts as a result of the matter giving rise to any
indemnification claim of the Indemnified Party prior to the date upon which
the Indemnifying Party is given notice of the claim, the Indemnifying Partys
indemnification obligation with respect to such claim shall be reduced by the
amount of any such insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified
Party (including under the RandW Policies). If the Indemnified Party receives
any insurance proceeds (including under the RandW Policies) or other amounts as
a result of the matter giving rise to any indemnification claim of the
Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party after the Indemnifying Party
has paid such indemnification claim to the Indemnified Party, then the
Indemnified Party shall promptly turn over any such insurance proceeds or
other amounts received to the Indemnifying Party to the extent of the payments
made by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party on the claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any such insurance proceeds
received by the Indemnified Party under the RandW Policies, the Indemnified
Party shall only be responsible to turn over amounts received with respect to
such claim that were in excess of the Deductible to the extent that the
Deductible applied to such claim.

 



 

(d) _Exclusive Remedies_. Subject to the rights of the Parties pursuant to
Section 14.6, from and after Closing, except with respect to matters covered
by Section 3.7, the sole recourse and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties arising out of this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated

 



      
 

 



 

hereunder or thereunder, whether based on tort, contract, statutory or common
law remedy or equitable remedy or otherwise, including any misrepresentation,
breach of warranty, non-fulfillment or failure to perform a covenant or
agreement or otherwise, shall be to assert a claim for indemnification under
the indemnification provisions of this Article 12 and the Purchaser and the
Sellers each covenant that it (and the Indemnified Parties) will not seek to
obtain any remedy except as provided in this Article 12.

 



 

(e) _Duration of Claim_. The indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to a specific claim for which
indemnification is provided under this Agreement shall extend beyond the time
period for indemnification set forth herein with respect to such specific
claim until it has been fully discharged or resolved or settled provided that
a Notice shall have been given to the Indemnifying Party on or prior to the
end of such time period.

 



 

(f) _Mitigation of Losses_. The Indemnified Party shall take commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate any Losses upon and after becoming aware of any
event, fact or circumstance which would reasonably be expected to give rise to
Losses.

 



 

(g) _Contingent Liabilities_. No Indemnifying Party shall be liable under this
Article 12 in respect of any Loss which is contingent unless and until such
contingent Loss becomes an actual liability and is due and payable; _provided_
, _however_ , that an Indemnified Party shall not be prohibited from asserting
a claim for indemnification hereunder in respect of any contingent Losses, and
such claim, if otherwise made timely in accordance with this Article 12, will
survive until finally resolved pursuant to this Article 12.

 



 

(h) _GPco Sellers_. No indemnification shall be payable by any GPco Seller
pursuant to this Article 12.

 



 

 **Section 12.8** **Indemnification Adjustment to Purchase Price.**

 



 

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any amounts payable
under this Article 12 shall constitute an adjustment in the Purchase Price.

 



 

 **Section 12.9** **Indemnity Procedure.**

 



 

To the extent that there is any inconsistency between Section 9.2 ( _Tax
Matters_ ), on the one hand, and Section 12.6 and Section 12.7, on the other
hand, as it relates to any Tax Contest, the provisions of Section 9.2 ( _Tax
Matters_ ) shall govern.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 13 

**

 

 **TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT**

 



 

 **Section 13.1** **Termination.**

 



 

At any time prior to the Closing, this Agreement may be terminated:

 



 

(a) by the mutual written agreement of the Purchaser and the Sellers;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) by the Sellers, if the Acquired Entities and the Sellers are then not in
material breach of this Agreement and the Purchaser shall have breached any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in Article 11, and (ii) remains uncured on the earlier of (A) the date
which is thirty (30) days following the Purchasers receipt of written notice
thereof from the Sellers and (B) the Outside Date;

 



 

(c) by the Purchaser, if the Purchaser is then not in material breach of this
Agreement and the Sellers or the Acquired Entities shall have breached any of
their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in Article 10, and (ii) remains uncured on the earlier of (A) the date
which is thirty (30) days following the Acquired Entities or the Sellers
receipt of written notice thereof from the Purchaser and (B) the Outside Date;

 



 

(d) by the Purchaser or the Sellers in the event that any Governmental
Authority shall have issued any Order or Law or taken any other action
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder or under the other
Transaction Documents, and such Order or Law has become final and non-
appealable; _provided_ , that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 13.1(d) shall have complied in all material respects
with its obligations under Section 9.1 of this Agreement; or

 



 

(e) by the Purchaser or the Sellers if the Closing has not occurred before the
close of business on the date that is one hundred and twenty (120) days after
the date of this Agreement (the " **Outside Date** ") unless, in the case of
the Purchaser, the Purchasers breach of this Agreement results in the failure
of the Closing to occur by such date or, in the case of the Acquired Entities
and the Sellers, the Acquired Entities or the Sellers breach of this
Agreement results in the failure to close by such date.

 



 

 **Section 13.2** **Notice of Termination.**

 



 

In the event of termination by any party pursuant to Section 13.1, written
notice setting forth the reasons therefor shall be given by the terminating
Party to the other Parties and termination of this Agreement shall be
immediately effective upon receipt of such notice.

 



 

 **Section 13.3** **Effect of Termination.**

 



 

If this Agreement shall be validly terminated pursuant to this Article 13,
this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and all obligations of the
Parties hereunder shall terminate without liability of any Party to the other
(or any of their respective Representatives or Affiliates), other than Section
7.7 ( _Confidentiality of the Sellers_ ), Section 8.1 ( _Confidentiality of
the Purchaser_ ), this Section 13.3 ( _Effect of Termination_ ) and Article 14
( _Miscellaneous_ ); _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Article 13, upon termination of this Agreement, each
party shall remain liable to the other for any material breach of this
Agreement existing at the time of such termination, and each party may seek
such remedies, including for Losses, against the other with respect to any
such breach as are available at Law or in equity.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE 14 

**

 

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

 **Section 14.1** **Expenses.**

 **Section 14.3** **Amendments and Waivers.**

 



 

No amendment to this Agreement may be made unless agreed to by the Parties in
writing. The Parties may, by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
Party, waive compliance by any other Party with any term or provision of this
Agreement that such other Party was or is obligated to comply with or perform;
_provided_ , that no amendment or waiver of the provisions of which the
Financing Sources are expressly made third party beneficiaries pursuant to
Section 14.9 (or any other provision or definition of this Agreement to the
extent such amendment or waiver would amend, waive, modify or terminate the
substance of any such provisions), shall be permitted to be made in a manner
that is adverse in any respect to the Financing Sources without the prior
written consent of the Financing Sources that are party to the Financing
Commitment Letters. At any time prior to the Closing, any Party may, in
writing, (a) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
any other Party, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or acts of any other Party or (c) waive compliance by any other
Party with any of the agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise
provided herein, waive any of such Partys conditions. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. No waiver of any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed, or shall constitute, a waiver of
any other provision of this Agreement, whether or not similar, nor shall such
waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 14.4** **Disclosure Schedule and Exhibits.**

 



 

(a) The Schedules shall be deemed to be attached hereto and made a part
hereof. All references herein to this Agreement shall include the Schedules.

 



 

(b) Nothing in the Schedules is intended to broaden the scope of any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement. The Schedules and the
information and disclosures contained therein are intended only to qualify and
limit the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
Acquired Entities, the Sellers or the Purchaser, as the case may be, contained
in this Agreement and shall not be deemed to expand in any way the scope or
effect of any of such representations, warranties, covenants or agreements.

 



 

(c) The disclosure of any item in any Schedule (or section thereof) is a
disclosure of that item for purposes of any other Schedule (or section
thereof) for which such disclosure is required under this Agreement to the
extent that the relevance of such disclosure to such other Schedule (or
section thereof) is reasonably apparent on its face.

 



 

(d) No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in any Schedule
(or any section thereof) shall be construed as an admission or indication that
such item is required to be referred to or disclosed in any Schedule (or any
section thereof). Inclusion of any item in a Schedule (or any section thereof)
does not constitute a determination by the representing party that such item
is material and shall not be deemed to establish a standard of materiality. No
disclosure in a Schedule (or any section thereof) relating to any possible
breach or violation of any Contract, Law or any potential adverse contingency
shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or
violation exists or has actually occurred or that such adverse contingency
will actually occur.

 



 

(e) The Sellers may, following notice to the Purchaser prior to the Closing
Date, amend any section of the Disclosure Schedule to qualify the applicable
representations and warranties in respect of any matter (i) first occurring
after the date of this Agreement, and (ii) which arises through no fault of
the Sellers, the Acquired Entities or the Subsidiaries. The Purchaser hereby
accepts and agrees that any such update shall be included in the
representations and warranties of the Acquired Entities and the Sellers herein
which are provided as of the Closing Date and will not be taken into account
in assessing whether any condition set forth in Article 10 has been satisfied
(including for purposes of any related certificate to be delivered by Sellers)
and for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be taken into account in assessing
whether the condition set forth in Section 10.7 has been satisfied.

 



 

 **Section 14.5** **Disclaimer of Other Representations; Projections.**

 



 

The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties made by the Acquired Entities or the Sellers expressly set forth in
Article 4 and Article 5, respectively, none of the Acquired Entities, the
Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives has made, and
shall not be construed as having made, to the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives, any representation or warranty of any kind,
express or implied, written or oral, at law or in equity, in respect of the
Acquired Entities, the Sellers or any of the Subsidiaries, the Purchased
Securities or any of the assets, properties, liabilities, business,

 



       
 

 



 

operations or affairs of the Acquired Entities, the Sellers or any of the
Subsidiaries, including with respect to (i) merchantability or fitness for any
particular purpose, (ii) the operation of the Acquired Entities and the
Subsidiaries by the Purchaser after the Closing or (iii) the probable success
or profitability of the Acquired Entities and the Subsidiaries after the
Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding
any otherwise express representations and warranties made by the Acquired
Entities or the Sellers in Article 4 and Article 5, respectively, the
Purchaser agrees that (x) neither the Acquired Entities, the Sellers nor any
of their respective Affiliates or Representatives makes or has made any
representation or warranty to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives with respect to and (y) none of the Sellers, the Acquired
Entities or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall have
or be subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to the Purchaser
or to any other Person resulting from the distribution to Purchaser or its
Affiliates or Representatives of, or the Purchasers use of:

 



 

(i) (x) any projections, financial models, estimates, forecasts or budgets
contained in that certain confidential offering memorandum relating to the
Acquired Entities or any of the Subsidiaries (the " **Confidential
Memorandum** ") or (y) any projections, financial models, estimates, forecasts
or budgets relating to the business of either of the Acquired Entities or any
of the Subsidiaries otherwise heretofore or hereafter delivered to, presented
to (including, for greater certainty, in any management presentation) or made
available to the Purchaser or its Representatives or Affiliates; and

 



 

(ii) any other information, statement or documents heretofore or hereafter
delivered to, presented to (including, for greater certainty, in any
management presentation) or made available to the Purchaser or its Affiliates
or Representatives, whether orally or in writing (including in the
Confidential Memorandum, the "data room", functional "break-out" discussions,
responses to questions submitted on behalf of the Purchaser or otherwise),
with respect to the Acquired Entities, the Sellers or any of the Subsidiaries,
the Purchased Securities or any of the assets, properties, liabilities,
business, operations or affairs of the Acquired Entities, the Sellers or any
of the Subsidiaries, except to the extent and as expressly covered by a
representation and warranty contained in Article 4 or Article 5.

 



 

 **Section 14.6** **Enforcement of Agreement.**

 



 

The Parties agree that there would be irreparable damage to the Parties for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement (including the failure
by any party to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents) was not performed in accordance with its specified
terms or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the
valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.1, the Parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case without
posting any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or
other equitable relief, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in the foregoing, in no event shall the Sellers or the
Acquired Entities (a)

 



      
 

 



 

seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this
Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Financing
Source in connection with this Agreement or (b) seek to enforce the
commitments against, make any claims for breach of the Financing against, or
seek to recover monetary damages from, or otherwise sue, the Financing Sources
in connection with this Agreement or the Financing or the obligations of the
Financing Sources thereunder. Nothing in this Section 14.6 shall in any way
limit or qualify the rights and obligations of the parties to the Financing
Commitment Letters to each other thereunder.

 



 

 **Section 14.7** **Severability.**

 



 

Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in
such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law. If any
portion of this Agreement is declared invalid for any reason in any
jurisdiction, such declaration shall have no effect upon the remaining
portions of this Agreement which shall continue in full force and effect as if
this Agreement had been executed with the invalid portions thereof deleted;
_provided_ , _however_ , if such severability will negate in any material
respect the monetary terms of this Agreement, then the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to amend the invalid terms in a manner so that such terms shall
not be invalid and will not modify in any material respect the monetary terms
of this Agreement unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties. Furthermore, the
entirety of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in all
other jurisdictions.

 



 

 **Section 14.8** **Entire Understanding.**

 



 

This Agreement, including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the other Transaction Documents sets forth the
entire agreement and understanding between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior discussions,
negotiations, letters of intent or agreements in principle between them, other
than the Confidentiality Agreement which shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 



 

 **Section 14.9** **Binding Effect; No Third Party Beneficiaries.**

 



 

Except for the rights expressly provided to the Persons described in Section
8.5, Article 12 and Section 14.20, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the exclusive benefit of the Parties and their respective
heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and
permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to, nor
shall it, confer in any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement;
_provided_ , that (i) the Financing Sources shall be express third-party
beneficiaries of Section 14.3, Section 14.6, Section 14.10, Section 14.11,
Section 14.12, Section 14.20 and this Section 14.9 and (ii) the Indemnified
Parties shall be express third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement, whether
party hereto. The Parties agree that, for the purpose of giving enforceable
rights under this Agreement to the Directors and Officers who are not party to
this Agreement, the Sellers Agents are contracting as the agents of such
Persons and will hold the rights of such Persons in trust for them.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 14.10** **Governing Law.**

 



 

This Agreement is and shall be deemed to be a contract entered into and made
pursuant to the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada
applicable therein and shall in all respects be governed, construed, applied
and enforced in accordance with said laws, without reference to applicable
conflict of laws rules or principles; _provided_ , that all claims or causes
of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise)
against any of the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Financing
Commitment Letters, the Financing (or any Alternative Financing) or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be
exclusively governed by, construed, applied and enforced in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law
or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of New York or
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

 



 

 **Section 14.11** **Choice of Forum and Consent to Jurisdiction.**

 



 

Any action arising out of or under this Agreement, any other document,
instrument or agreement contemplated herein or delivered pursuant hereto, or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents or any of such other documents, instruments or agreements, shall be
brought only in a federal or provincial court having jurisdiction and venue in
Ontario, Canada, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that venue in Ontario is
proper. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, final judgment against such
party (a certified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and
of the amount of any indebtedness of such party hereunder) in any such legal
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on an unsatisfied judgment or similar proceeding. Each
of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense, or otherwise, in any legal action or proceeding, any
defense or any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of
the above-named Ontario courts for any reason, including claims that such
party may be immune from the above-described legal process (whether through
service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution, or otherwise), or that such proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient or otherwise improper forum or that this Agreement or any of the
other aforementioned documents, instruments or agreements, or the subject
matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts, or that
the same are governed by the laws of a jurisdiction other than Ontario. Each
of the Parties hereby specifically agrees that it shall not bring any actions,
suits or proceedings arising out of or under this Agreement, any other
document, instrument or agreement contemplated herein or delivered pursuant
hereto, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents or any of such other documents, instruments or
agreements, in the courts of any jurisdiction other than the above-named
courts of Ontario, that any such action brought by any party shall be
dismissed upon the basis of the agreements, terms and provisions set forth in
this Section 14.11, and that any order or judgment obtained in any such action
from a court other than the courts of Ontario shall be void _ab initio_ ;
_provided_ , that, for greater certainty, the foregoing shall not prevent any
party from bringing an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to
enforce a judgment rendered in any federal or provincial court having
jurisdiction and venue in Ontario. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the
Parties (i) agrees that they will not bring or support any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether

 



      
 

 



 

in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the
Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Financing Commitment Letters, the Financing
(or any Alternative Financing) or the performance thereof of the financings
contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the New York Supreme Court
located in New York County or the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York and the appellate courts having jurisdiction of
appeals in such courts and (ii) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying
of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of,
any such action, suit or proceeding in any such court. Each of the Parties
hereby agrees that a final judgment in any action, suit or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

 



 

 **Section 14.12** **Waiver of Trial by Jury.**

 



 

EACH PARTY HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM, SUIT, LITIGATION,
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) (I) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY OR
(II) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE
PARTIES OR ANY FINANCING SOURCES IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE FINANCING
OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, THE FINANCING
COMMITMENT LETTERS, THE FINANCING (OR ANY ALTERNATIVE FINANCING) OR THE
PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR THE FINANCINGS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY. THE PARTIES AGREE
THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PROVISION WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED FOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE
PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY, AND THAT SUCH PROCEEDING
WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM SHALL INSTEAD BE TRIED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT
JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

 



 

 **Section 14.13** **Assignability.**

 



 

No Party shall sell, pledge, assign or otherwise transfer its rights under
this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Parties and any
attempt to do so shall be void; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall
assign its rights under this Agreement to a Purchaser Assignee pursuant to
Section 8.9, which shall not release Purchaser of its obligations hereunder,
and may assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement without
consent to any lender providing financing in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereunder to the Purchaser under the Financing Commitment Letters
as collateral security for Purchasers obligations thereunder, which shall not
release Purchaser of its obligations hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 14.14** **Counterparts; Delivery by Electronic Transmission.**

 



 

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (including by facsimile or
other means of electronic transmission, such as by electronic mail in " _.pdf_
" form), all of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and
all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile transmission or other electronic transmission shall be as effective
as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 14.15** **Public Announcements.**

 



 

No public announcements or other publicity regarding the transactions referred
to herein shall be made by the Purchaser, the Acquired Entities, the Sellers
or any of the Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Closing without the prior
written consent of the other Parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) as to form, content, timing and manner of
distribution or publication, except (i) to the extent otherwise required by
Law or the rules or regulations of any exchange to which a Party is subject,
(ii) each Party may disclose to its current and prospective banks,
shareholders, partners, investors and advisors the name of the other party,
the date of the transaction, the price and the key terms under this Agreement
and (iii) the Sellers, the Acquired Entities and the Subsidiaries may
disclose, in their communications to employees, customers and suppliers, the
name of the other party, the date of the transaction and the key terms under
this Agreement (other than the Purchase Price, except to the extent an
employee is a Seller hereunder); _provided_ , that the Party proposing to
issue any public announcement or other publicity in compliance with any
disclosure obligations shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consult in
good faith with the other Party before doing so. The Parties shall also obtain
the other Parties prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of any press release to be
issued immediately following the Closing announcing the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, the Purchaser may disclose any
information concerning the transactions contemplated hereby that it deems
appropriate in its reasonable judgment, in light of its status as a publicly
owned company, including to securities analysts and in press interviews.

 



 

 **Section 14.16** **Appointment of Sellers  Agents.**

 



 

(a) By execution of this Agreement, each Seller hereby exclusively and
irrevocably appoints the Sellers Agents as its true and lawful agents and
attorneys-in-fact such that Sellers Agents have the authority, for and on
behalf of such Seller, to take such actions and exercise such discretion as
are required of such Seller pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents and any related document or instrument, and any such
actions shall be binding on such Seller, including, without limitation, the
following:

 



 

(i) to receive, hold, execute and deliver to the Purchaser, on behalf of such
Seller, securities powers, assignment agreements and the certificates
representing the Purchased Securities held by such Seller, and any other
documents relating thereto;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) to give and receive communications and notices on behalf of such Seller;

 



 

(iii) to negotiate, agree to, enter into settlements and compromises of, and
comply with orders and awards of courts with respect to claims against such
Seller;

 



 

(iv) to negotiate, agree to, enter into settlements and compromises of, and
comply with orders and awards of courts with respect to any claims of disputes
related to this Agreement, including claims against the Purchaser by such
Seller;

 



 

(v) to receive, or direct the payment of, payments on behalf of such Seller
due and owing pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and
acknowledge receipt thereof, including holding back such amount of the
Estimated Purchase Price as may be necessary to pay any adjustments to the
Purchase Price required under Section 3.8;

 



 

(vi) make all decisions and take all actions relating to the respective
rights, obligations and remedies of the Sellers under this Agreement including
to receive and make payments, to receive and send notices, to receive and
deliver documents, to exercise, enforce or waive rights or conditions, to give
releases and discharges, to seek indemnification on behalf of the Sellers and
to negotiate, agree to, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply
with order and awards of courts with respect to claims against the Sellers;

 



 

(vii) to amend, supplement or change this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents, or waive any provision hereof or thereof, provided that such
amendment, supplement, change or waiver applies to all Sellers;

 



 

(viii) resolve on behalf of the Sellers, all questions, disputes, conflicts
and controversies concerning the determination of any amounts pursuant to
Article 3 and indemnification claims pursuant to Article 12;

 



 

(ix) to receive service of process on behalf of such Seller in connection with
any claims under this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or any
related document or instrument;

 



 

(x) to execute any Transaction Documents, including to execute and deliver the
Escrow Agreement;

 



 

(xi) to enforce payment from the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Indemnity
Escrow Amount and of any other amounts payable to Sellers (via Sellers
Agents), in each case on behalf of the Sellers;

 



 

(xii) to authorize and cause to be paid in favor of the Purchaser any amounts
(i) from the Adjustment Escrow Account to be paid pursuant to this Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

and the Escrow Agreement, (ii) from the Indemnity Escrow Amount to be paid
pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and (iii) any other
amounts to be paid pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; and

 



 

(xiii) to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of
Sellers Agents to accomplish any of the foregoing.

 



 

(b) Each Seller agrees that upon payment of the Purchase Price being made to
the Sellers Agents for such Sellers Purchased Securities in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, all right, title, benefit and
interest of such Seller in such Purchased Securities shall be deemed to have
been transferred to the Purchaser and the Purchaser shall be entitled to have
such shares registered in its name in the registry of the Acquired Entities,
as applicable, even where such Seller fails to deliver at Closing the
certificates, if applicable, representing such Sellers Purchased Securities,
or other document otherwise contemplated herein to be delivered at Closing by
such Seller.

 



 

(c) The Sellers Agents shall not be liable for any act done or omitted to be
taken as Sellers Agents except expressly as set forth herein. By execution of
this Agreement, each Seller shall have and shall be deemed to have agreed that
the Sellers shall severally, and not jointly and severally or jointly,
indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers Agents and their partners,
stockholders, Affiliates, directors, officers, fiduciaries, employees and
agents and each of the partners, stockholders, Affiliates, directors,
officers, fiduciaries, employees and agents of each of the foregoing (each, an
" **Agent Indemnified Party** ") from and against all losses, liabilities,
claims or expenses incurred or suffered by the Agent Indemnified Parties as a
result of, or arising out of, or relating to any and all actions taken or
omitted to be taken by the Sellers Agents under this Agreement or in
connection with the incurrence, payment, discharge or settlement of any of the
obligations of the Sellers, except for any such losses, liabilities, claims or
expenses that arise on account of the Sellers Agents fraud, gross negligence
or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a
final adjudication. None of the Agent Indemnified Parties shall be liable to
any Seller in respect of such arrangements or actions or omissions in
connection therewith, except to the extent that such acts or omissions
constitute fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction in a final adjudication. A decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Sellers Agents shall constitute a decision for
all Sellers hereunder, and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each
Seller and the Purchaser and the Acquired Entities may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of Sellers Agents as being the
decision, act, consent or instruction of such Seller and treat such Sellers
Agents as the duly appointed attorneys-in-fact of each Seller and as having
the duties, power and authority provided for in this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. The Purchaser and the Acquired Entities are hereby relieved from
any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers Agents.

 



 

(d) The Sellers Agents shall be entitled at any time and from time to time to
reimbursement from the Sellers for any Sellers Agent Expenses (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, will not constitute Transaction Expenses).

 



      
 

 



 

(e) The Sellers Agents shall be protected in acting upon any written notice,
request, waiver, consent, certificate, receipt, statutory declaration or other
paper or document furnished to them hereunder, not only as to its due
execution and the validity and the effectiveness of its provisions but also as
to the truth and acceptability of any information therein contained which they
in good faith believe to be genuine and what it purports to be.

 



 

(f) The Sellers Agents will at all times be entitled to rely on any
directions received from the Sellers (acting by an affirmative vote of the
Sellers whose aggregate Pro Rata Share immediately prior to the date hereof
was greater than 50%); provided, however, that the Sellers Agents shall not
be required to follow any such direction, and shall be under no obligation to
take any action in their capacity as the Sellers Agents, unless the Sellers
Agents have been provided with the funds, security or indemnities which, in
the sole determination of the Sellers Agents, are sufficient to protect the
Sellers Agents against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred by the Sellers Agents in responding to such direction or taking such
action.

 



 

(g) (A) if Doug Skrepnek becomes unable to serve as a Sellers Agent, TorQuest
III GP shall be deemed to be the sole Sellers Agent and (B) if TorQuest III
GP becomes unable to serve as a Sellers Agent, such other Person or Persons
may be designated by the Sellers (acting by an affirmative vote of the Sellers
whose aggregate Pro Rata Share immediately prior to the date hereof was
greater than 50%), and such Person or Persons shall succeed as Sellers
Agents.

 



 

(h) Any notice given to the Sellers Agents hereunder in accordance with
Section 14.2 or under the Escrow Agreement will constitute notice to each and
all of the Sellers at the time notice is given to the Sellers Agents (other
than notice to a Seller for service of process relating to a Legal Proceeding
before a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction, which notice must
be given to such Seller individually, as applicable). Any action taken by, or
notice or instruction received from, the Sellers Agents hereunder in
accordance with Section 14.2 or under the Escrow Agreement will be deemed to
be an action by, or notice or instruction from, each and all of the Sellers.
The Purchaser and the Acquired Entities may, and the Escrow Agent will,
disregard any notice or instruction received from any one or more individual
Sellers, other than the Sellers Agents.

 



 

(i) The Sellers Agents shall have the discretion to take such action as the
Sellers Agents shall unanimously determine to be in the best interests of all
of the Sellers; provided, however, that in any event, all Sellers are treated
in a substantially proportionate manner.

 



 

(j) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the Sellers
Agents under this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(k) All decisions and actions of the Sellers Agents must be approved and/or
authorized by both Sellers Agents; _provided_ that in the event Doug Skrepnek
has delegated his authority to TorQuest III GP for any reason, only the
approval or authorization of TorQuest III GP will be required.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 14.17** **Mutual Drafting.**

 



 

The Parties are sophisticated and have been represented by lawyers who have
carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. It is the intention of the Parties
that no Party shall be considered the drafter hereof and that this Agreement
not be construed more strictly with the regard to one Party than to any other.

 



 

 **Section 14.18** **Legal Representation.**

 



 

The Purchaser, the Acquired Entities and the Sellers hereby agree, on their
own behalf and on behalf of their directors, shareholders, members, partners,
officers, employees and Affiliates, and each of their successors and assigns
(all such parties, the " **Waiving Parties** "), that (i) Torys LLP may
represent any of the Sellers and each of their Affiliates, other than the
Acquired Entities and the Subsidiaries (individually and collectively, the "
**Seller Group** "), on the one hand, and the Acquired Entities and the
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other documents
contemplated hereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereunder or under the other Transaction Documents (such representation, the "
**Current Representation** "), and (ii) Torys LLP (or any successor) may
represent the Seller Group or any member of the Seller Group or any director,
shareholder, member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of the Seller
Group or any member of the Seller Group, other than the Acquired Entities and
the Subsidiaries, in each case in connection with any dispute, litigation,
claim, proceeding or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
the other Transaction Documents and the other documents contemplated hereunder
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder or under the
other Transaction Documents following the Closing (any such representation,
the " **Post-Closing Representation** ") even though the interests of Sellers
may be directly adverse to the Acquired Entities, notwithstanding such
representation (or any continued representation) of the Acquired Entities or
the Subsidiaries, and each of the Purchaser and the Acquired Entities on
behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto and
irrevocably waives (and will not assert) any conflict of interest or any
objection arising therefrom or relating thereto. Each of the Purchaser and the
Acquired Entities acknowledge that the foregoing provision applies whether or
not Torys LLP provides legal services to either of the Acquired Entities or
any of the Subsidiaries after the Closing Date. Each of the Purchaser and the
Acquired Entities, for itself and the Waiving Parties, hereby irrevocably
acknowledges and agrees that all communications between the Seller Group and
their counsel, including Torys LLP, made in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or any dispute or
proceeding arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents and the other documents contemplated hereunder and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder or under the other
Transaction Documents, or any matter relating to any of the foregoing, are
privileged communications between the Seller Group and such counsel and none
of the Purchaser, the Acquired Entities, or any Person purporting to act on
behalf of or through the Purchaser or the Acquired Entities or any of the
Waiving Parties, will seek to obtain the same by any process. From and after
the Closing, each of the Purchaser and the Acquired Entities, on behalf of
itself and the Waiving Parties, waives and will not assert any attorney-client
privilege with respect to any communication between Torys LLP and the Acquired
Entities or any Person in the Seller Group occurring during the Current
Representation in connection with any Post-Closing Representation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 14.18, neither the
Sellers Agents nor any

 



      
 

 



 

Seller may assert (or cause to be asserted on their behalf) the attorney-
client privilege with respect to any communication that reflects any fraud
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder or under the other
Transaction Documents. Further, in the event that a dispute arises between the
Purchaser, the Acquired Entities or any of the Subsidiaries and a third party
other than a party to this Agreement after the Closing, the Acquired Entities
and the Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by Torys LLP (or any successors),
the Sellers Agents or any of the Sellers to such third party; provided,
however, that the Acquired Entities and the Subsidiaries may not waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the Sellers Agents (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

 **Section 14.19** **Limited Partnership.**

 



 

(a) (i) Master GPco, in its capacity as the sole general partner of Master LP,
shall cause Master LP to perform all of its obligations under this Agreement
and (ii) Feeder GPco, in its capacity as the sole general partner of Feeder
LP, shall cause Feeder LP to perform all of its obligations under this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser acknowledges that (i) Master LP is a limited partnership
formed under the laws of the Province of Manitoba, the sole general partner of
which is Master GPco, (ii) the only Person with whom the Purchaser has had or
will have dealings on behalf of Master LP is its general partner, Master GPco
and (iii) in the case of the obligations and liabilities of Master LP, in no
event will Master LP have any recourse against the assets of any Person
(including the Sellers or any director, officer, employee or representative of
Master GPco) other than recourse against the assets of Master LP itself and
the assets of Master GPco.

 



 

(c) The Purchaser acknowledges that (i) Feeder LP is a limited partnership
formed under the laws of the Province of Manitoba, the sole general partner of
which is Feeder GPco, (ii) the only Person with whom the Purchaser has had or
will have dealings on behalf of Feeder LP is its general partner, Feeder GPco
and (iii) in the case of the obligations and liabilities of Feeder LP, in no
event will Feeder LP have any recourse against the assets of any Person
(including the Sellers or any director, officer, employee or representative of
Feeder GPco) other than recourse against the assets of Feeder LP itself and
the assets of Feeder GPco.

 



 

 **Section 14.20** **Non-Recourse**

 



 

All claims or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in
equity) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as
an inducement to enter into this Agreement), may be made only against the
entities that are expressly identified as Parties. No Person who is not a
named party to this Agreement, including without limitation any past, present
or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
equityholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any named party
to this Agreement (" **Non-Party Affiliates** "), shall have any liability
(whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or based upon any theory
that seeks to impose liability of an entity party against its owners or
Affiliates) for any obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection
with or related to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason

 



      
 

 



 

of this Agreement or its negotiation or execution; and each party waives and
releases all such liabilities, claims and obligations against any such Non-
Party Affiliates. Nothing in this Section 14.20 shall in any way limit or
qualify the rights and obligations of the parties to the Financing Commitment
Letters to each other thereunder.
