 **ARTICLE 2 
PURCHASE AND SALE**

 



 

2.1 _Purchase and Sale_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Buyer agrees to purchase from Seller at Closing, and Seller agrees
to sell, assign and deliver to Buyer at Closing, the Assets for the
consideration specified in this _ARTICLE 2_.

 



 

2.2 _Purchase Price_. The unadjusted purchase price for the Assets shall be
$265,000,000 (the " ** _Purchase Price_** "). The Purchase Price shall be
payable as follows:

 



 

(a) On the date that this Agreement is fully executed by all Parties, Buyer
shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to Sellers
designated account, $13,250,000 (the " ** _Performance Deposit_** "). The
Performance Deposit shall be held by Seller in accordance with this Agreement
in order to secure Buyers performance of this Agreement. Subject to _Section
11.2(b)_ and _Section 11.2(c)_ , all interest earned on the Performance
Deposit shall be retained by Seller.

 



 

(b) At Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller the Closing Amount by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to Sellers designated account.

 



 

(c) After Closing, final adjustments to the Purchase Price shall be made (1)
pursuant to the Final Settlement Statement to be delivered pursuant to
_Section 13.1(a)_ and the payments made by the owing Party as provided in
_Section 13.1(a)_ , and (2) upon final resolution of any Title Disputed
Matters and any Environmental Disputed Matters, in accordance with _ARTICLE 4_
and _ARTICLE 5_ , respectively.

 



 

2.3 _Allocation of the Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) Solely for the purposes of _ARTICLE 4_ , _ARTICLE 5_ and **_Schedule
1.1(e)_** , Buyer and Seller have agreed upon an allocation of the Purchase
Price among (1) the Target Formation Net Mineral Acres held by Seller with
respect to the Leases set forth on **_Exhibit A_** and (2) the

 



      
 

 



 

Wells set forth on **_Exhibit B_** (collectively, the " ** _Allocated
Values_** "), in each case, as set forth on **_Schedule 2.3_**.

 



 

(b) Seller may (but is not obligated to) prepare an allocation of the Final
Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to _Article 13_ , on a schedule (the " **
_Proposed Section 1060 Allocation Schedule_** ") for purposes of, and in
accordance with, Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, within 30 days after the Final Settlement Date. Within 60 days
after delivery of such Proposed Section 1060 Allocation Schedule, if so
prepared by Seller in accordance with the preceding sentence, Buyer and Seller
shall reasonably endeavor to agree to a final allocation schedule to be used
for income Tax reporting purposes (the " ** _Final Section 1060 Allocation
Schedule_** "); provided that if the Parties are unable to reach agreement
within such 60-day period, then, immediately after the expiration of such
period, either Party may invoke the Dispute resolution provisions immediately
below upon the delivery of written notice thereof to the other Party and,
within ten days thereafter, the Parties shall mutually appoint an independent
expert having the qualifications specified below (the " ** _Property Valuation
Expert_** "), failing which the Parties shall, within ten days after the
expiration of such foregoing ten day period, request (and either Party may so
request alone if the other Party refuses to jointly act in good faith to do so
during such ten day period) that the AAA, acting through its offices in
Houston, Texas, appoint the Property Valuation Expert. The Property Valuation
Expert shall be a licensed petroleum engineer, having a minimum of ten years
experience with regard to the types of oil and assets involved in the Proposed
Section 1060 Allocation Schedule Dispute, shall be without any conflicts of
interest as to the Parties, and shall not have been employed by or undertaken
more than $50,000 of work, in the aggregate, for any Party (including its
Affiliates) within the five year period preceding the submission of the
Dispute. Within 15 days following the appointment of the Property Valuation
Expert, Seller and/or Buyer shall provide the Property Valuation Expert with a
copy of this Agreement, and each Party shall provide, both to the Property
Valuation Expert and to each other, a summary of its position with regard to
the Proposed Section 1060 Allocation Schedule in a written document of ten
pages or less. The Parties shall instruct the Property Valuation Expert that,
within 30 days after receiving the last of the Parties respective submissions
or the expiration of such 15 day period if either Party fails to make a
submission, the Property Valuation Expert shall render a written decision,
choosing only either Buyers position or Sellers position with respect to
each Disputed matter. Any decision rendered by the Property Valuation Expert
pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive and binding on Seller and Buyer,
and will be enforceable against each Party in any court having jurisdiction
hereof or jurisdiction of either or both Parties, but is not reviewable by, or
appealable to, any court except in the event of fraud. The Parties shall each
bear one-half of the costs of the Property Valuation Expert and of the
associated Dispute resolution process and proceedings. In the case of such a
Dispute resolution process regarding Sellers Proposed Section 1060 Allocation
Schedule Dispute, Seller will issue the Final Section 1060 Allocation Schedule
consistent with the Property Valuation Experts decision, within 30 days after
receiving the Property Valuation Experts decision with respect thereto. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Property Valuation Expert will function as an
expert in accordance with the foregoing procedure, not as an arbitrator.
Seller and Buyer shall file all Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue
Service Form 8594) consistent with any such Final Section 1060 Allocation
Schedule. Seller and Buyer shall take no position inconsistent with such
allocations on any applicable Tax Return in any audit by or proceeding before
any Governmental Entity related to Taxes, unless required by Law or with the
written consent of the other Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed

 



      
 

 



 

or conditioned) provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent
Buyer or Seller from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Governmental Entity based upon or arising out of the allocation, and neither
Buyer nor Seller shall be required to litigate before any court any proposed
deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Entity challenging such
allocation. In the event that the allocation described herein is disputed by
any Governmental Entity, then the Party receiving notice of the dispute shall
promptly notify, consult with and obtain the consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) of the other Party concerning resolution of
the dispute. If either (i) Seller fails to deliver to Buyer a Proposed Section
1060 Allocation Schedule within 30 days after the Final Settlement Date or
(ii) a Final Section 1060 Allocation Schedule is not agreed by the Parties (or
otherwise determined by a Dispute resolution process in accordance with the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.3(b)_ ), then each Party shall be
responsible for its reporting requirements under Code Section 1060 and any
other provisions that may apply; provided that the Parties shall reasonably
coordinate with each other regarding any such filings, in order to avoid any
material inconsistencies.

 



 

2.4 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted
according to this _Section 2.4_ without duplication.

Society standards, except as otherwise specified herein.

 



 

(4) For purposes of allocating production (and proceeds and accounts

Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be " ** _from or attributable to_** " the
Properties when they pass through the pipeline connecting into the storage
facilities into which they are run and (B) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be
deemed to be " ** _from or attributable to_** " the Properties when they pass
through the royalty measurement meters, delivery point sales meters or custody

 



      
 

 



 

transfer meters on the gathering lines or pipelines through which they are
transported (whichever meter is closest to the well). Seller shall utilize
reasonable interpolative procedures, consistent with industry practice, to
arrive at an allocation of production when exact meter readings or gauging and
strapping data are not available.

 



 

(5) After the Final Settlement Date, to the extent not taken into account in
either the Preliminary Settlement Statement or the Final Settlement Statement,

Effective Time shall be paid by Seller to Buyer within 30 days after receipt
of such proceeds, and (2) any proceeds received by Buyer from the sale of any
Hydrocarbons that were produced from and saved, or attributable to, the Assets
prior to the Effective Time shall be paid to Seller within 30 days after
receipt of such proceeds, and (B)(1) each invoice (or a copy thereof) received
by Buyer for Property Expenses applicable to time periods prior to the
Effective Time shall be forwarded by Buyer to Seller following Buyers receipt
thereof and, if such invoice has been paid by Buyer, Seller shall reimburse
Buyer for such amounts paid by Buyer within 30 days after Sellers receipt of
such invoice or a copy thereof, and (2) each invoice (or a copy thereof)
received by Seller for Property Expenses applicable to time periods from and
after the Effective Time shall be forwarded by Seller to Buyer following
Sellers receipt thereof and, if such invoice has been paid by Seller, Buyer
shall reimburse Seller for such amounts paid by Seller within 30 days after
Buyers receipt of such invoice or a copy thereof.

 



 

(6) If, prior to the Final Settlement Date, any (A) proceeds are received by
Seller that are attributable to the sale of any Hydrocarbons that were
produced from and saved, or attributable to, the Assets and, in each case,
from and after the Effective Time, (B) Property Expenses are paid by Seller
that are attributable to the Assets from and after the Effective Time, (C)
royalties, overriding royalties, net profit interests and similar burdens on
or measured by production, in each case, attributable to the Assets from and
after the Effective Time are paid by Seller, or (D) all prepaid expenses
(including pre-paid bonuses, rentals, cash calls and advances to Third Party
operators for expenses not yet incurred, prepaid Taxes, and scheduled
payments) paid by Seller and attributable to the ownership or operation of the
Assets from and after the Effective Time, and, in each of the cases in clauses
(A), (B), (C) and (D) above, are properly accounted for pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement during the term of such agreement, then such
amounts shall not be taken into account for the purposes of _Section 2.4(c)_
or _Section 2.4(d)_.

 



 

(b) _Property Expenses_. The term " ** _Property Expenses_** " means all (1)
capital expenses attributable to the Assets in the ordinary course of
business, (2) Asset Taxes (as apportioned as of the Effective Time pursuant to
_ARTICLE 9_ ), (3) operating expenses incurred in the ownership, development,
operation and production of the Assets in the ordinary course of business and,
where applicable, in accordance with any relevant joint operating agreement
(including lease rentals, if any), (4) overhead costs charged to the Assets
under the applicable joint operating agreement and (5) extension and renewal
payments with respect to the Leases, but excluding (in all cases) costs and
expenses attributable to (A) obligations to pay an owner of any working
interest, royalty, overriding royalty, net profits interests or other similar
burdens on or measured by production any revenues or proceeds attributable to
sales of Hydrocarbons

 



      
 

 



 

relating to the Assets, including those held in suspense, (B) Losses for
personal injury or death, property damage or loss (other than damage to
structures, fences, irrigation systems and other fixtures, crops, livestock
and other personal property in the ordinary course of business), torts, breach
of Contract (other than failure to make payments due under the terms of a
Contract) or violation of any Lease or Law (or private rights of action under
any Law), (C) obligations to plug wells (including the Wells), dismantle or
decommission facilities, close pits and restore the surface around such wells,
facilities and pits, (D) Environmental Liabilities, including obligations to
remediate any contamination of groundwater, surface water, soil, sediments or

clauses (A) through (E), whether such claims are made pursuant to Contract or
otherwise.

Final Purchase Price, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward, without
duplication, by the following:

 



 

(1) an amount equal to any proceeds received by Buyer from the sale of any

saved from, or attributable to, the Assets that are in storage or existing in

of the Effective Time (or if there is no Contract price, then the market price
in effect as of the Effective Time in the field in which such Hydrocarbons
were produced), net of (A) all amounts payable as royalties, overriding
royalties, net profit interests and other similar burdens on or measured by
production and (B) all applicable severance Taxes;

the Final Purchase Price, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward,

 **ARTICLE 3 
BUYERS INSPECTION; DUE DILIGENCE REVIEW**

 



 

3.1 _Due Diligence_. Subject to the provisions of this _ARTICLE 3_ , from and
after the Execution Date up to the Defect Notice Date (the " ** _Due Diligence
Period_** "), Seller will make the Assets available to Buyer and its
Representatives for inspection and review to permit Buyer, at Buyers sole
cost, to perform its due diligence with respect to the Assets (" ** _Due
Diligence Review_** ").

 



 

3.2 _Access to Records_. For purposes of the Due Diligence Review, Seller
consents to, and agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
facilitate, Buyers discussions with

 



      
 

 



 

Third Parties in connection with its Due Diligence Review (provided that a
representative of Seller is present for any such discussions, unless Seller
has consented in writing to be absent from such discussion) and will, upon
reasonable (being no less than three Business Days) advance notice from
Buyer, make the Records available to Buyer for inspection or copying and shall
provide a reasonable means of copying to Buyer at Sellers offices, in each
case, at Buyers sole cost and expense, at the offices of Seller located in
Houston, Texas during normal business hours. For the avoidance of doubt, any
and all such Records inspected and/or copied by Buyer pursuant to this
_Section 3.2_ remain subject to the provisions of _Section 8.3(h)_.

 



 

3.3 _On-Site Inspection_.

 



 

(a) Seller hereby consents to Buyer conducting, during the Due Diligence
Period and for purposes of the Due Diligence Review, upon reasonable (being no
less than three Business Days) advance notice to Seller and at Buyers sole
risk and expense, on-site inspections of the Assets and a Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment, (each such inspection or assessment, an " **
_Environmental Assessment_** "); provided, however, that if the consent of any
Third Party is required to provide Buyer such access, and such consent is not
granted following the commercially reasonable efforts of Seller, Buyer shall
not have access to such affected Assets. Should any such Third Party not grant
such access following the commercially reasonable efforts of Seller, Buyer
shall have the right, at its sole discretion, upon delivery of written notice
to Seller on or before three Business Days prior to Closing, to exclude the
Assets to which it was unable to receive access from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in which case the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of such Assets and such Assets shall become
Excluded Assets for all purposes hereunder. Buyer shall not conduct any
sampling, boring or other invasive activities without prior written notice to,
and the written consent of, Seller. If Seller does not give its consent for
such invasive activity, then (A) Buyer shall have the right, at its sole
discretion, upon delivery of written notice to Seller on or before three
Business Days prior to Closing, to exclude such Asset from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (B) the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of such Asset if it is so excluded, and (C) such Asset shall
become an Excluded Asset for all purposes hereunder. In connection with any
Environmental Assessment or other inspection pursuant to this _Section 3.3_ ,
Buyer agrees to comply with all safety policies and other requirements of
Seller and the operator of the Assets (whether such operator is Seller, an
Affiliate of Seller or a Third Party). Buyer shall coordinate its access
rights and Environmental Assessments of the Assets with Seller and any Third
Party operator of the Assets to reasonably minimize any inconvenience to or
interruption of the conduct of business by Seller or any such Third Party
operator of the Assets.

 



 

(b) If Buyer or any of its Representatives prepares a written report with
respect to any Environmental Assessment, Buyer will furnish a copy thereof to
Seller as soon as practicable following the receipt thereof by Buyer, and in
any event by the Defect Notice Date. Within five Business Days following the
Execution Date, Seller shall provide Buyer with copies of all Records that
constitute environmental reports and records generated by Sellers or its
Affiliates consultants engaged in such parties acquisition or ownership of
the Assets, and Seller shall allow Buyer to discuss such reports with such
consultants. Except (1) as may be required or permitted pursuant to the
exercise of the rights and fulfillment of the obligation of a Party under this
Agreement, including in connection with the resolution of any Environmental
Disputed Matter pursuant to _Section 5.3(f)_ , (2) as may be required by
applicable Law, (3) for information

 



      
 

 



 

which is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the Person against
whom this sentence is sought to be enforced, or (4) as may be required by a
Party in order to defend or prosecute any Claim related to the Assets, the
Parties shall maintain the confidentiality of any Environmental Assessments
conducted hereunder, and any reports created with respect thereto; provided
that Buyers obligations with respect to such confidentiality shall cease upon
the Closing.

 



 

(c) EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT
OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES AND SUBJECT TO _SECTION 3.3(e)_ , BUYER
HEREBY WAIVES, RELEASES AND AGREES TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS
SELLER AND THE OTHER SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL
LOSSES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF OR ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACCESS AFFORDED TO
BUYER AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES PURSUANT TO THIS _ARTICLE 3_ OR THE ACTIVITIES
(OR ACTS OF OMISSION) OF BUYER OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES RELATED TO SUCH ACCESS,
INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO ANY ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT (BUT NOT INCLUDING
LOSSES RELATING TO ANY CONDITION DISCOVERED AS A RESULT OF SUCH ENVIRONMENTAL
ASSESSMENT), IN EACH CASE, EVEN IF SUCH LOSSES ARISE OUT OF OR ARE
ATTRIBUTABLE TO, SOLELY OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR
COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF
OR BY ANY OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES.

 



 

(d) Upon completion of any Environmental Assessment, Buyer shall, at its sole
cost and expense and without any cost or expense to Seller or its Affiliates
(1) repair all physical damage, if any, done to the Assets or to the
Environment in connection with Buyers Environmental Assessment, (2) restore
each Asset to approximately the same physical condition that it was in prior
to commencement of Buyers Environmental Assessment (if any such restoration
is necessary as a result of Buyers Environmental Assessment) and (3) remove
all equipment, tools or other property brought onto, and any wastes generated
on, the Assets in connection with Buyers Environmental Assessment. Any
disturbance to the Assets (including the real property associated with the
Assets) resulting from Buyers Environmental Assessment will be promptly
corrected by Buyer.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section 3.3_ , subject to _Section
5.3(e)_ , prior to Closing, Buyer shall not be responsible for curing or
Remediating any Condition existing at or on the Assets, even if the same were
disturbed or released during Buyers Environmental Assessment or any invasive
activity conducted by Buyer or its Representatives on the Assets and permitted
by Seller pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_. Buyer shall be solely responsible for
properly disposing of any drilling, soils or other material generated or
removed from the Assets in connection with its Environmental Assessment or any
invasive activity conducted by Buyer or its Representatives on the Assets,
including all costs related thereto; provided, however, that, prior to
Closing, Buyer will not be obligated to execute any documents identifying
Buyer as the owner or generator of these materials, which status will continue
to be held by the owner of the Assets.

A_** or **_Exhibit B_** , as applicable, with respect to the Target Formation
for such Lease or Well; (B) obligate Seller to bear a Working Interest with
respect to the Target Formation throughout the productive life of such Well
greater than the Working Interest set forth on **_Exhibit B_** with respect to

greater than the Net Revenue Interest with respect to the Target Formation set
forth in on **_Exhibit B_** in the same or greater proportion as any increase
in such Working Interest); or (C) reduce the aggregate number of Target
Formation Net Mineral Acres below the Target Formation Net Mineral Acre
Threshold;

Asset, as the same is currently used, owned and operated;

 



 

(7) the terms and conditions of the Leases, Applicable Contracts or Surface
Contracts or of any compulsory pooling or other order of the Texas Railroad
Commission or any other Governmental Entity; provided, however, that the net
cumulative effect of

 



      
 

 



 

such items does not: (A) reduce the Net Revenue Interest with respect to the
Target Formation throughout the productive life of any such Lease or Well
below the Net Revenue Interest set forth on **_Exhibit A_** or **_Exhibit B_**
, as applicable, with respect to the Target Formation for such Lease or Well;
(B) obligate Seller to bear a Working Interest with respect to the Target
Formation throughout the productive life of any Well greater than the Working
Interest set forth on **_Exhibit B_** with respect to the Target Formation for
such Well (unless the Net Revenue Interest with respect to such Well is
greater than the Net Revenue Interest with respect to the Target Formation set
forth in on **_Exhibit B_** in the same or greater proportion as any increase
in such Working Interest); or (C) reduce the aggregate number of Target
Formation Net Mineral Acres below the Target Formation Net Mineral Acre
Threshold;

 



 

(8) materialmens, mechanics, operators or other similar Liens arising (A)

landowners;

 



 

(17) all other Liens, Contracts, obligations, defects and irregularities
affecting the Assets, provided that the net cumulative effect of such items

Net Revenue Interest with respect to the Target Formation throughout the
productive life of any Lease or Well below the Net Revenue Interest set forth
on **_Exhibit A_** or **_Exhibit B_** , as applicable, with respect to the

Defect Notice Date that could have been claimed as a Title Defect pursuant to
_Section 4.2(c)_ but for which Buyer failed to deliver a Notice of Defective
Interests with respect thereto in accordance with _Section 4.2(c)_ prior to
the Defect Notice Date.

 



 

4.2 _Title Defects and Title Benefits_.

 



 

(a) _Title Defect_. The term " ** _Title Defect_** " means any Lien,
obligation, defect, or other matter that causes Seller not to have Defensible
Title to any Property, provided, however, that none of the following shall be
considered Title Defects:

 



 

(1) defects in the chain of title consisting of the failure to recite marital
status in a document, unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such
failure could reasonably be expected to result in another Persons superior
claim of title to the relevant Assets;

 



 

(2) defects arising out of lack of survey or lack of metes and bounds
description;

 



 

(3) defects asserting a change in Working Interest or Net Revenue Interest in
a Well based on a change in drilling and spacing units, tract allocation or
other changes in pool or unit participation occurring after the Effective Time
by a Person other than Seller;

 



 

(4) defects arising out of lack of corporate or other entity authorization,
unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such failure could reasonably
be expected to result in another Persons superior claim of title to the
relevant Assets;

 



 

(5) defects that have been cured by applicable Laws of limitations,
prescription, laches or otherwise;

 



 

(6) defects arising as a result of non-consent interests in any Well not being
held of record by Seller;

 



 

(7) defects based on a gap in Sellers chain of title in the State of Texas
records as to any applicable Lease where the State of Texas or its agent is
the lessor thereunder, or in the applicable county records in the State of
Texas as to the other Leases,

 



      
 

 



 

unless such gap is affirmatively shown to exist in such records by an abstract
of title, title opinion or landmans title chain or runsheet, which documents
shall be provided with delivery of a Title Defect Notice with respect to such
defects;

 



 

(8) defects as a consequence of cessation of production, insufficient
production, or failure to conduct operations on any of the Properties held by
production, or lands pooled, communitized or unitized therewith, unless Buyer
provides affirmative evidence that causes Buyer to reasonably believe the
cessation of production, insufficient production or failure to conduct
operations would give rise to a right to terminate the Lease in question,
which evidence shall be provided with delivery of a Title Defect Notice with
respect to such defects;

 



 

(9) defects or irregularities resulting from or related to probate proceedings
or lack thereof, unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such failure
could reasonably be expected to result in another Persons superior claim of
title to the relevant Assets;

 



 

(10) defects arising from prior oil and gas leases relating to the Lands that
are terminated, expired or invalid but not surrendered of record;

 



 

(11) any defect that affects only which Person has the right to receive
royalty payments (rather than the amount of such royalty) and that could not
reasonably be expected to affect the validity or enforceability of the
underlying Lease;

 



 

(12) defects based on references to lack of information (unless such
information (A) is not reflected in the records of the applicable county and
(B) is not in the Records made available to Buyer); and

 



 

(13) the expiration, pursuant to its terms, of any Expiring Lease listed on
**_Exhibit A-2_**.

 



 

(b) _Title Benefit_. The term " ** _Title Benefit_** " means any right,
circumstance or condition that operates to (1) increase the Net Revenue
Interest of Seller with respect to the Target Formation in any Lease or Well
above that shown in **_Exhibit A_** or **_Exhibit B_** , as applicable, with
respect to the Target Formation for such Lease or Well, to the extent the same
does not cause a greater than proportionate increase in Sellers Working
Interest with respect to the Target Formation for any such Well above that
shown in **_Exhibit B_** with respect to the Target Formation for such Well or
(2) increase the aggregate number of Target Formation Net Mineral Acres to
which Seller is entitled with respect to the Assets above the Target Formation
Net Mineral Acre Threshold.

 



 

(c) _Notice of Defective Interest_. On or before the Defect Notice Date, Buyer
shall notify Seller in writing of any matters that, in Buyers reasonable
opinion, constitute a Title Defect (such notice, a " ** _Notice of Defective
Interests_** "). To be effective, each Notice of Defective Interests shall be
in writing and contain the following: (1) a clear description of the alleged
Title Defect, (2) each Property affected by the alleged Title Defect (each
such Property, a " ** _Title Defect Property_** "), (3) the Allocated Value of
each Title Defect Property, (4) supporting documents reasonably necessary for
Seller (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by

 



      
 

 



 

Seller) to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect, and (5) the
amount which Buyer reasonably believes to be the Title Defect Amount as
provided for in _Section 4.2(e)_ , and the computations and information upon
which Buyers beliefs are based. To give Seller an opportunity to commence
reviewing and curing Title Defects, prior to the Defect Notice Date, Buyer
agrees to use its reasonable efforts to give Seller weekly notices of all
Title Defects discovered by Buyer during the preceding week; provided that any
such notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Defect
Notice Date. Other than with respect to Buyers (A) remedies for breaches of
_Section 8.1(b)(1)_ and _Section 8.1(b)(3)_ , and (B) rights under the special
warranty set forth in the Assignment, any matters that may otherwise
constitute a Title Defect, but of which Seller has not been notified by Buyer
in a Notice of Defective Interests delivered in accordance with this _Section
4.2(c)_ prior to the Defect Notice Date, shall be deemed to have been waived
by Buyer for all purposes.

 



 

(d) _Notice of Title Benefits_. On or prior to the Defect Notice Date, Buyer
will promptly furnish Seller with written notice (in accordance with the
requirements for a Title Benefit Notice below) of any matters that, in Buyers
reasonable opinion, could constitute a Title Benefit, and that is discovered
by any of Buyers or any of its Representatives (for the avoidance of doubt,
including any title attorneys, landmen or other title examiners) while
conducting Buyers Due Diligence Review. On or before the Defect Notice Date,
Seller shall advise Buyer in writing of any matters that, in Sellers
reasonable opinion, constitute a Title Benefit (each such notice, a " **
_Title Benefit Notice_** "). Each Title Benefit Notice shall be in writing and
contain the following: (1) a clear description of the Title Benefit, (2) each
Property affected by the Title Benefit (each such Property, a " ** _Title
Benefit Property_** "), (3) the Allocated Value of each Title Benefit
Property, (4) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Buyer (as well as
any title attorney or examiner hired by Buyer) to verify the existence of the
Title Benefit, and (5) the amount which Seller reasonably believes to be the
Title Benefit Amount for each Title Benefit Property and the computations and
information upon which Sellers belief is based. Subject to Sellers remedy
for a breach of this _Section 4.2(d)_ by Buyer, Seller shall be deemed to have
waived all Title Benefits of which it has not given, or received, notice on or
before the Defect Notice Date.

 



 

(e) _Title Defect Amount_. Subject to the provisions of _Section 4.2(f)_ , the
" ** _Title Defect Amount_** " means the amount by which the Allocated Value
of a Title Defect Property affected by a Title Defect is reduced as a result
of the existence of such Title Defect, which amount shall be determined in
accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:

 



 

(1) if Buyer and Seller agree in writing on the Title Defect Amount, that
amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 



 

(2) if the Title Defect is a Lien that is undisputed and liquidated in amount,
then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount of the payment necessary to
remove such Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

 



 

(3) in the event that the Title Defect is the actual failure of Seller to own
a number of Target Formation Net Mineral Acres equal to the Target Formation
Net Mineral Acre Threshold in the aggregate, then the Title Defect Amount
shall be an amount equal to the Allocated Value of the Leases _multiplied by_
a fraction, (A) the

 



      
 

 



 

numerator of which is the difference between (i) the actual aggregate number
of Target Formation Net Mineral Acres covered by the Leases, and (ii) the
Target Formation Net Mineral Acre Threshold, and (B) the denominator of which
shall be the Target Formation Net Mineral Acre Threshold;

 



 

(4) in the event that the Title Defect for any Lease or Well is the actual
failure of Seller to own the represented Net Revenue Interest with respect to
the Target Formation for such Lease or Well set forth on **_Exhibit A_** or
**_Exhibit B_** , as applicable, then the Title Defect Amount shall be equal
to the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property _multiplied_ by a
fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the difference between (i) the actual
Net Revenue Interest with respect to the Target Formation for the Title Defect
Property, and (ii) the Net Revenue Interest with respect to the Target
Formation for such Title Defect Property as set forth on **_Exhibit A_** or
**_Exhibit B_** , as applicable, and (B) the denominator of which is the Net
Revenue Interest with respect to the Target Formation for such Title Defect
Property as set forth on **_Exhibit A_** or **_Exhibit B_** , as applicable;
and

 



 

(5) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type
not described in subsections (1), (2), (3) or (4) above, the Title Defect
Amount shall be determined by taking into account the following factors: (A)
any potential discrepancy between (i) the Net Revenue Interest with respect to
the Target Formation or Working Interest with respect to the Target Formation
for such Title Defect Property and (ii) the Net Revenue Interest with respect
to the Target Formation or Working Interest with respect to the Target
Formation as stated on **_Exhibit A_** or **_Exhibit B_** , as applicable; (B)
the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property; (C) the portion of the Title
Defect Property affected by the Title Defect; (D) the legal effect of the
Title Defect; (E) the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller;
and (F) such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _ARTICLE 4_ , the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any
Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of the Title Defect
Property and if a Title Defect is reasonably susceptible to being cured, the
Title Defect Amount attributable to such Title Defect shall not exceed the
cost and expense to cure such Title Defect.

 



 

(f) _Title Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (1) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase
Price or other remedies provided by Seller in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby for any Title Defect affecting a Title Defect Property for
which the Title Defect Amount attributable thereto does not exceed $50,000 ("
** _Individual Title Threshold_** "); and (2) in no event shall there be any
adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby for any Title Defect
Amount attributable to a Title Defect affecting a Title Defect Property that
exceeds the Individual Title Threshold unless (A) the sum of (i) the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts of all such Title Defects exceeding the Individual Title
Threshold (i.e. the entire amount of any such Title Defect Amounts from the
first dollar for those Title Defects which exceed the Individual Title
Threshold), excluding any Title Defects cured by Seller, _plus_ (ii) the
aggregate Environmental Defect Values of all Environmental Defects that

 



      
 

 



 

exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold (i.e. the entire amount of any
such Environmental Defect Values from the first dollar for those Environmental
Defects which exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold), excluding any
Environmental Defects Remediated by Seller, _minus_ (iii) all Title Benefit
Amounts (the amount obtained pursuant to subsections (i) - (iii) above, the "
** _Total Defect Sum_** "), exceeds (B) the Aggregate Defect Deductible, after
which point, Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or
other remedies only with respect to the amount by which the Total Defect Sum
exceeds the Aggregate Defect Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt (I) in no
event will Buyer be entitled to claim any remedies under _Section 4.2(f)_ ,
_Section 4.2(j)_ , _Section 5.3(b)_ or _Section 5.3(e)_ for any Title Defects
and/or Environmental Defects to the extent any Title Defect Amounts or
Environmental Defect Values attributable thereto, in the aggregate, exceed the
Total Defect Sum _minus_ the Aggregate Defect Deductible, and (II) once the
Individual Title Threshold has been met with respect to a Title Defect Amount
or the Individual Environmental Threshold has been met with respect to an
Environmental Defect Value all of such amounts (relating back to the first
dollar) shall be included in the determination of the Total Defect Sum. If any
Asset is excluded pursuant to _Section 4.2(j)(2)_ or **_Schedule 1.1(e)_** ,
any Title Defect Amount relating to such excluded Asset will not be counted
towards the Aggregate Defect Deductible.

 



 

(g) _Title Benefit Amount_. The " ** _Title Benefit Amount_** " means the
amount by which the Allocated Value of a Title Benefit Property affected by a
Title Benefit is increased as a result of the existence of such Title Benefit.
Each Title Benefit Amount shall be determined in accordance with the same
methodology, terms and conditions for determining each Title Defect Amount.
With respect to any Title Benefit reported under _Section 4.2(d)_ and provided
that the Title Benefit Amount with respect thereto is in excess of the
Individual Title Threshold, the Title Benefit Amount attributable to such
Title Benefit shall be used to reduce the amount of the aggregate Title Defect
Amounts and Environmental Defect Values attributable to Title Defects and
Environmental Defects properly and timely raised by Buyer after taking into
account the Individual Title Threshold and the Individual Environmental
Threshold, as applicable. If the Parties cannot reach an agreement on alleged
Title Benefits or Title Benefit Amounts by the scheduled Closing, then (1) the
average of Sellers and Buyers good faith estimate of such disputed Title
Benefit Amount shall be used in calculating the reduction to the Title Defect
Amounts and Environmental Defect Values pursuant to this _Section 4.2(g)_ to
the extent applicable, and (2) the provisions of _Section 4.3_ shall apply.
For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not be entitled to any remedy with
respect to any claimed Title Benefit if the applicable Title Benefit Amount
with respect thereto is not in excess of the Individual Title Threshold.

 



 

(h) _Title Adjustment Amount_. The amount by which the Purchase Price is to be
adjusted in accordance with this _ARTICLE 4_ for Title Defect Amounts (after,
for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account any offsetting Title Benefit
Amounts) shall be referred to as the " ** _Title Adjustment Amount_** ". For
the avoidance of doubt, any Title Defect Amount attributable to any Asset
excluded pursuant to **_Schedule 1.1(e)_ **shall not be counted in determining
the Title Adjustment Amount, including determining the Title Adjustment Amount
for purposes of _Section 2.4(d)(1)_ and _Section 11.1(g)_.

 



 

(i) _Seller s Right to Cure_. Continuing until four Business Days prior to
Closing (such period of time, the " ** _Cure Period_** "), Seller shall have
the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure or
remove any Title Defects timely asserted by Buyer pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 4.2(c)_. If Seller believes that it has cured any applicable Title
Defect, Seller shall deliver written notice thereof to Buyer, together with
supporting documents available to Seller and reasonably necessary for Buyer
(as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Buyer) to verify the cure
of such Title Defect. Buyer shall, at or prior to the end of the Cure Period,
advise Seller in writing whether it agrees or (pursuant to a Title Dispute
Notice, as described in _Section 4.3_ ) Disputes that any such Title Defect
has been so cured; provided that Buyers failure to timely respond to Sellers
notice of cure shall be deemed Buyers rejection that such Title Defect has
been cured. If Buyer timely notifies Seller of a Dispute as to Sellers
attempted cure of any Title Defect or is deemed to reject such claim through
its failure to timely respond, then (subject to _Section 4.2(j)_ ), the
provisions of _Section 4.3_ shall apply to such Title Defect.

 



 

(j) _Remedies for Title Defects_. Subject to Sellers continuing right to
dispute the existence of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Amount
asserted with respect thereto and subject to _Section 4.2(f)_ , in the event
that any Title Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with _Section
4.2(c)_ is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured by Seller prior to the end
of the Cure Period, then the Parties shall mutually agree in writing to one of
the following remedies with respect to such Title Defect:

 



 

(1) reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Amount applicable to such
Title Defect;

 



 

(2) require Seller to retain the entirety of the Title Defect Property that is
subject to such Title Defect (together with all related Assets) and reduce the
Purchase Price by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of the Assets so
retained; or

 



 

(3) require Seller to indemnify Buyer against all Losses resulting from such
Title Defect with respect to the applicable Title Defect Property pursuant to
an indemnity agreement mutually acceptable to the Parties;

 



 

provided, however, that in the event the Parties do not agree in writing by
Closing on an election of alternative (1), (2) or (3) above with respect to
any Title Defect, the Parties shall be deemed to have agreed to alternative
(2) above with respect to such Title Defect. As to any Title Defect timely
asserted by Buyer in accordance with _Section 4.2(c)_ which remains uncured by
Seller prior to the end of the Cure Period and for which a corresponding Title
Defect Amount is included in the Title Adjustment Amount at Closing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Title Defect which Seller has
chosen to dispute pursuant to _Section 4.3_ ), Seller also shall retain the
right, but not the obligation, to attempt to cure each such Title Defect after
Closing at Sellers sole cost and expense; provided that Seller shall furnish
notice to Buyer of Sellers belief that it has cured any such Title Defect
(together with supporting documents available to Seller and reasonably
necessary for Buyer, as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by it, to
verify the cure of any such Title Defect), by no later 15 days prior to the
Final Settlement Statement Due Date. If Buyer disagrees that the Title Defect
has been cured, it shall so advise Seller in writing within five Business Days
after receipt of Sellers notice as provided above, following which the
provisions of _Section 4.3_ will apply to resolve such Dispute, and the Final
Settlement Statement Due Date shall be extended to the extent necessary to
complete the Dispute resolution procedure as provided for in _Section 4.3_.
Should Buyer (A) fail to respond to Sellers notice of cure in such five
Business Day period, then Buyer shall be deemed to have (i) agreed that the
Title Defect has

 



      
 

 



 

been cured and (ii) waived its Claim with respect to such Title Defect, or (B)
agree that the Title Defect has been cured, and then, in each case, the Title
Defect Amount attributable thereto and included in the Title Adjustment Amount
used to adjust the Purchase Price at Closing shall be credited to Seller in
the Final Settlement Statement.

 



 

4.3 _Title Dispute Resolution_. If prior to the Closing or, with respect to
the adequacy of Sellers Title Defect curative actions after Closing, after
the Closing, the Parties are unable to resolve any Title Disputed Matter, then
either Party shall have the right, upon the delivery of written notice to the
other Party (each, a " ** _Title Dispute Notice_** "), to Dispute such Title
Disputed Matter and to invoke the Dispute resolution provisions below in this
_Section 4.3_ in order to resolve any such Dispute. As used herein, the term "
** _Title Disputed Matter_** " means a Dispute regarding any of the following:
(w) the existence and scope of a Title Defect or Title Benefit; (x) any Title
Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount, as the case may be; (y) the Title
Adjustment Amount, if any; and (z) the adequacy of Sellers Title Defect
curative actions. As to any Dispute regarding the adequacy of Sellers Title
Defect curative actions after Closing as provided for in _Section 4.2(j)_ ,
the Final Settlement Statement Due Date shall be extended to the extent
necessary to complete the Dispute resolution procedure as provided for below
in this _Section 4.3_. Any Title Dispute Notice must be delivered on or before
the tenth Business Day after Closing except with respect to Disputes relating
to any of Sellers Title Defect curative actions conducted post-Closing. Any
Title Dispute Notice relating to any of Sellers Title Defect curative actions
conducted post-Closing must be delivered within ten Business Days following
Buyers receipt of notice from Seller that it has cured the applicable Title
Defect. In no event will Closing be delayed on account of any Title Disputed
Matter and, if the Title Defect Property affected thereby is transferred to
Buyer at Closing, the average of the Parties respective good faith estimates
of the Title Defect Amounts attributable to such Title Defect Property shall
be used in the calculation and determination of the Title Adjustment Amount to
be used at Closing.

 



 

(a) The Parties shall attempt to resolve all Title Disputed Matters through
good faith negotiations for a period of 20 days after the delivery of a Title
Dispute Notice by either Party. Following such negotiation period, if the
Title Disputed Matter at issue remains in Dispute, such Title Disputed Matter
shall be resolved pursuant to this _Section 4.3_ and the Parties shall
mutually appoint an independent expert having the qualifications specified
below (the " ** _Title Defect Expert_** "). If the Parties are unable to
mutually agree upon the Title Defect Expert, then the Parties shall, within
ten days after the expiration of such negotiation period, request (and either
Party may so request alone if the other Party refuses to jointly act in good
faith to do so during such ten day period) that the AAA, acting through its
offices in Houston, Texas, appoint the Title Defect Expert. The Title Defect
Expert shall be a licensed title attorney having a minimum of ten years
experience with regard to the types of title defects affecting the Properties
involved in the Title Disputed Matter, shall be without any conflicts of
interest as to the Parties, and shall not have been employed by or undertaken
more than $50,000 of work, in the aggregate, for either Party or its
Affiliates within the five year period preceding the submission of the
Dispute. For the avoidance of doubt, the Title Defect Expert will function as
an expert in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 4.3_ ,
and not as an arbitrator.

 



 

(b) Within 30 days following the appointment of the Title Defect Expert,
Seller and/or Buyer shall provide the Title Defect Expert with a copy of this
Agreement, and each Party shall provide, both to the Title Defect Expert and
each other, a summary of its position with

 



      
 

 



 

regard to each such outstanding Title Disputed Matter in a written document of
five pages or less per Title Disputed Matter. The Parties shall instruct the
Title Defect Expert that, within 30 days after receiving the Parties
respective submissions, the Title Defect Expert shall render a written
decision. In rendering its decision, the Title Defect Expert shall not award
(1) a higher Title Defect Amount than the lower of (A) the Allocated Value of
the applicable Property or (B) the amount claimed by Buyer in its summary, (2)
a higher Title Benefit Amount than the amount claimed by Seller in its
summary, (3) a lower Title Benefit Amount than the amount claimed by Buyer in
its summary or (4) a lower Title Defect Amount than that amount claimed by
Seller in its summary, as applicable. The Title Defect Expert shall determine
the specific disputed Title Defect, Title Benefit, Title Defect Amount, Title
Benefit Amount or the adequacy of Sellers Title Defect curative actions, as
the case may be, submitted by either Party and may not award damages, interest
or penalties to either Party with respect to any other matter. Any decision
rendered by the Title Defect Expert pursuant hereto shall be final,
conclusive, and binding on Seller and Buyer, and will be enforceable against
each Party in any court having jurisdiction hereof or jurisdiction of either
or both Parties, but is not reviewable by, or appealable to, any court except
in the event of fraud. The Parties shall each bear one-half of the costs of
the Title Defect Expert and of any associated dispute resolution process and
proceedings, except that the Parties shall each bear its own legal fees with
respect to any Dispute.

 



 

(c) If the Title Defect Expert determines that a Title Defect did not exist or
that a Title Defect existed but was cured by Seller, then any Title Defect
Amount attributable thereto that was included in the Title Adjustment Amount
used at Closing, if any, shall be credited to Seller in the Final Settlement
Statement.

 



 

(d) If the Title Defect Expert determines that a Title Defect exists, but that
the Title Defect Amount attributable thereto is a lesser amount than any Title
Defect Amount with respect thereto that was included in the Title Adjustment
Amount used at Closing, if any, then the difference thereof shall be credited
to Seller in the Final Settlement Statement.

 



 

(e) If the Title Defect Expert determines that a Title Defect exists, such
Title Defect has not been cured by Seller and the Title Defect Amount
attributable thereto is a greater amount than any Title Defect Amount with
respect thereto that was included in the Title Adjustment Amount used at
Closing, if any, then the difference thereof shall be credited to Buyer in the
Final Settlement Statement.

 



 

(f) Any such adjustments to the amount of the Purchase Price will be reflected
in the Final Settlement Statement as applicable.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, if any Asset is retained by Seller pursuant to
_Section 4.2(j)(2)_ , the Dispute resolution provisions set forth in this
_Section 4.3_ will not apply and no conveyance of such Asset will thereafter
be made to Buyer and no payment shall be required of Buyer in connection with
any such Asset so retained.

 



 

4.4 _Preferential Rights and Consents_.

 



 

(a) _Preferential Purchase Rights_. Promptly following the Execution Date, and
in any event within five Business Days following the Execution Date, Seller
shall send notices to the

 



       
 

 



 

holder of each Preferential Right listed on **_Schedule 6.6_** in accordance
with the terms of the instruments giving rise to such Preferential Rights.
Seller shall promptly provide a copy of each such notice to Buyer following
the delivery thereof by Seller. Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause written waivers of such Preferential Rights to be obtained
and delivered prior to Closing; provided that Seller shall not be required to
make payments or undertake other obligations to or for the benefit of the
holders of such Preferential Rights in order to obtain the required waivers.
Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in seeking to obtain such waivers
of Preferential Rights; provided that Buyer shall not be required to make
payments or undertake other obligations to or for the benefit of the holders
of such Preferential Rights in order to obtain the required waivers. Any
Preferential Right must be exercised subject to all terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement (including all thresholds, deductibles and other
amounts except for the cash consideration, which shall equal the Allocated
Value for such property), including the successful Closing of this Agreement
pursuant to _ARTICLE 12_ as to those Assets for which Preferential Rights have
not been exercised. The consideration payable under this Agreement for any
particular Asset for purposes of Preferential Rights notices shall be the
Allocated Value for such Asset, subject to adjustment pursuant to _Section
2.4_ and _Section 13.1_. If, prior to the Closing Date, either Party discovers
any required Preferential Right for which notices have not been delivered
pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 4.4(a)_ , then (x) the Party
making such discovery shall provide the other Party with written notification
of such Preferential Right, (y) Seller, following delivery or receipt of such
written notification, as applicable, will promptly send notices to the holders
of such Preferential Rights in accordance with the terms of the instrument
giving rise to such Preferential Right, and (z) the terms and conditions of
this _Section 4.4(a)_ shall apply to the Assets subject to such Preferential
Right.

 



 

(1) If, prior to Closing, any holder of a Preferential Right notifies Seller
that it intends to consummate the purchase of the Assets to which its
Preferential Right applies or if the time for exercising such Preferential
Right has not expired, then the Assets subject to such Preferential Right
(together with all related Assets) shall be excluded from the Assets to be
assigned to Buyer at Closing, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
sum of the Allocated Values of such Assets so excluded.

 



 

(2) Seller shall be entitled to all proceeds paid by any Person exercising a
Preferential Right prior to Closing. If such holder of such Preferential Right
thereafter fails to consummate the purchase of the Assets subject to such
Preferential Right (together with all related Assets) on or before the end of
the time period for closing such sale or the time for exercising such
Preferential Right expires without exercise by the holder thereof, then (A)
Seller shall so notify Buyer, (B) Seller shall assign to Buyer, on the tenth
Business Day following the end of such time period or termination of such
right without exercise, such Assets that were so excluded at Closing pursuant
to an instrument in substantially the same form as the Assignment, and (C)
Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with respect to
such excluded Assets, as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.4_ and _Section
13.1_.

 



 

(3) All Assets for which any applicable Preferential Right has been waived in
writing, or as to which the time for exercising the applicable Preferential
Right has

 



      
 

 



 

expired, in each case, prior to Closing, shall be transferred to Buyer at
Closing, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Consents_. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, and in any
event within five Business Days following the Execution Date, Seller shall
send notices to the holder of each Consent listed on **_Schedule 6.5_**
requesting such holders applicable written Consent to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
such Consents to be obtained and delivered prior to Closing; provided that
Seller shall not be required to make payments or undertake other obligations
to or for the benefit of the holders of such Consents in order to obtain the
required Consents. Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in seeking to
obtain such Consents to assignment; provided that Buyer shall not be required
to make payments or undertake other obligations to or for the benefit of the
holders of such Consents in order to obtain the required Consents. If, prior
to the Closing Date, either Party discovers any Consents for which notices
have not been delivered pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section
4.4(b)_ , then (x) the Party making such discovery shall provide the other
Party with written notification of such Consents, (y) Seller, following
delivery or receipt of such written notification, as applicable, will promptly
send notices to the holders of Consents requesting such Consents, and (z) the
terms and conditions of this _Section 4.4(b)_ shall apply to the Assets
subject to such Consents.

 



 

(1) If (A) Seller fails to obtain any such Consent prior to Closing and the
failure to obtain such Consent would (i) cause the assignment of the Assets
affected thereby to Buyer to be void, (ii) give the holder of such Consent the
right to terminate the applicable underlying Lease, Surface Contract or
Applicable Contract under the express terms thereof or (iii) give the holder
of such Consent a Claim for liquidated damages pursuant to the express terms
of the applicable underlying Lease, Surface Contract or Applicable Contract,
(B) Seller fails to obtain a Consent held by a Governmental Entity prior to
Closing, or (C) a Consent requested by Seller is denied in writing, then, in
each case, the Assets affected by such un-obtained Consent (together with all
related Assets, the " ** _Affected Assets_** ") shall be excluded from the
Assets to be assigned to Buyer at Closing, and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the sum of the Allocated Value of such Affected Assets.

 



 

(2) If any such Consent relating to Affected Assets that was not obtained
prior to Closing is obtained within 60 days following the Closing, then (A) on
the 15th Business Day after such Consent is obtained, Seller shall assign such
Affected Assets to Buyer pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same
form as the Assignment, and (B) Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the amount by which the Purchase Price was
reduced at Closing with respect to such Affected Assets, as adjusted pursuant
to _Section 2.4_ and _Section 13.1_ , and as would be further adjusted for
such Affected Asset pursuant to _Section 2.4_ and _Section 13.1_ as if the
Closing had occurred on the date of such assignment such that Buyer shall
receive the benefit of such transferred asset and bear the burden of such
transferred asset from the Effective Time.

 



 

(3) If Seller fails to obtain any such Consent prior to Closing and (A) the
failure to obtain such Consent would not (i) cause the assignment of the
Assets affected thereby to Buyer to be void, (ii) give the holder of such
Consent the right to terminate the

 



      
 

 



 

applicable underlying Lease, Surface Contract or Applicable Contract under the
express terms thereof or (iii) give the holder of such Consent a Claim for
liquidated damages pursuant to the express terms of the applicable underlying
Lease, Surface Contract or Applicable Contract, (B) the holder of such Consent
is not a Governmental Entity and (C) such Consent requested by Seller is not
denied in writing by the holder thereof, then (I) the Assets subject to such
un-obtained Consent shall nevertheless be assigned by Seller to Buyer at
Closing as part of the Assets and Seller (for a period of 60 days following
Closing) and Buyer shall each use their commercially reasonable efforts
following Closing to obtain such Consent, (II) Buyer shall have no claim
against Seller, and Seller shall have no liability for, the failure to obtain
any such Consent and (III) Buyer shall be responsible from and after the
Closing for any and all Losses arising from the failure to obtain such
Consent.

Assets, the Remediation of any such Environmental Defect or Condition, or
Sellers or its predecessors failure to comply with Environmental Laws with
respect to the Assets.

 



 

5.3 _Environmental Defects_.

 



 

(a) _Environmental Defect Notices_. On or before the Defect Notice Date, Buyer
shall notify Seller in writing of any matters that, in Buyers reasonable
opinion, constitute an Environmental Defect (such notice, an " **
_Environmental Defect Notice_** "). To be effective, each Environmental Defect
Notice shall be in writing and contain the following: (1) a clear description
of the alleged Environmental Defect, (2) each Asset affected by the alleged
Environmental Defect (each such Asset, an " ** _Environmental Defect
Property_** "), (3) the Allocated Value, if any, of each Environmental Defect
Property, (4) supporting documents that are in Buyers or its Representatives
possession, if any, that are reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any
environmental consultant hired by Seller) to verify the existence of the
alleged Environmental Defect, and (5) the amount that Buyer reasonably
believes is the cost to Remediate each alleged Environmental Defect, net to
Sellers interest in the applicable Assets (the " ** _Environmental Defect
Value_** "), and the computations and information upon which Buyers belief is
based. To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing
Environmental Defects prior to the Defect Notice Date, Buyer agrees to use its
reasonable efforts to give Seller weekly notices of all Environmental Defects
discovered by Buyer during the preceding week; provided that any such notice
may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to or on the Defect Notice
Date. Buyers failure to provide such weekly notices shall not constitute a
waiver of an Environmental Defect provided an Environmental Defect Notice is
delivered to Seller prior to the Defect Notice Date. Other than with respect
to Buyers remedies for breaches of _Section 6.15_ , any matters that may
otherwise constitute an Environmental Defect, but of which Seller has not been
notified by Buyer in an Environmental Defect Notice delivered in accordance
with this _Section 5.3(a)_ prior to the Defect Notice Date, shall be deemed to
have been waived by Buyer for all purposes.

 



 

(b) _Environmental Deductibles_. Other than with respect to Buyers remedies
for breaches of _Section 6.15_ , notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, (1) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase
Price or other remedies provided by Seller in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby for any Environmental Defect affecting an Environmental
Defect Property for which the Environmental Defect Value attributable thereto
does not exceed $100,000 (" ** _Individual Environmental Threshold_** "); and
(2) in no event shall

 



      
 

 



 

there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by
Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby for any
Environmental Defect Value attributable to an Environmental Defect affecting
an Environmental Defect Property that exceeds the Individual Environmental
Threshold unless the Total Defect Sum exceeds the Aggregate Defect Deductible,
after which point, Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase
Price or other remedies only with respect to the amount by which the Total
Defect Sum exceeds the Aggregate Defect Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt
(I) in no event will Buyer be entitled to claim any remedies under _Section
4.2(f)_ , _Section 4.2(j)_ , _Section 5.3(b)_ or _Section 5.3(e)_ for any
Title Defects or Environmental Defects to the extent any Title Defect Amounts
and/or Environmental Defect Values attributable thereto, in the aggregate,
exceed the Total Defect Sum minus the Aggregate Defect Deductible, and (II)
once the Individual Title Threshold has been met with respect to a Title
Defect Amount or the Individual Environmental Threshold has been met with
respect to an Environmental Defect Value all of such amounts (relating back to
the first dollar) shall be included in the determination of the Total Defect
Sum. If any Asset is excluded pursuant to _Section 5.3(e)(3)_ or **_Schedule
1.1(e)_** , any Environmental Defect Value relating to such excluded Asset
will not be counted towards the Aggregate Defect Deductible.

 



 

(c) _Environmental Adjustment Amount_. The amount by which the Purchase Price
is to be adjusted in accordance with this _ARTICLE 5_ for Environmental Defect
Values shall be referred to as the " ** _Environmental Adjustment Amount_** ".
For the avoidance of doubt, any Environmental Defect Value attributable to any
Asset excluded pursuant to **_Schedule 1.1(e)_ **shall not be counted in
determining the Environmental Adjustment Amount, including determining the
Environmental Adjustment Amount for purposes of _Section 2.4(d)(2)_ and
_Section 11.1(g)_.

 



 

(d) _Seller s Right to Remediate_. Continuing until the end of the Cure
Period, Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at
its sole cost, to Remediate any Environmental Defects timely asserted by Buyer
pursuant to _Section 5.3(a)_. If Seller believes that it has Remediated any
applicable Environmental Defect, Seller shall deliver written notice thereof
to Buyer, together with supporting documents available to Seller and
reasonably necessary for Buyer (as well as any environmental consultant hired
by Buyer) to verify the Remediation of the Environmental Defects. Buyer shall,
within two Business Days following the end of the Cure Period, advise Seller
in writing whether it agrees or (pursuant to an Environmental Dispute Notice,
as described in _Section 5.3(f)_ ) Disputes that the Environmental Defect has
been so Remediated; provided that Buyers failure to timely respond to
Sellers notice of Remediation shall be deemed Buyers rejection of the claim
that the Environmental Defect has been Remediated. If Buyer timely notifies
Seller of a Dispute as to Sellers attempted Remediation of any Environmental
Defect or is deemed to reject such claim through its failure to timely
respond, then (subject to _Section 5.3(e)_ ) the provisions of _Section
5.3(f)_ shall apply to such Environmental Defect.

 



 

(e) _Remedies for Environmental Defects_. Subject to Sellers continuing right
to dispute the existence of an Environmental Defect and/or the Environmental
Defect Value asserted with respect thereto and subject to _Section 5.3(b)_ ,
in the event that any Environmental Defect timely asserted by Buyer in
accordance with _Section 5.3(a)_ is not waived in writing by Buyer or
Remediated by Seller prior to the end of the Cure Period, then the Parties
shall mutually agree in writing to one of the following remedies with respect
to such Environmental Defect:

 



      
 

 



 

(1) reduce the Purchase Price by the Environmental Defect Value applicable to
such Environmental Defect;

 



 

(2) require Seller to indemnify Buyer against all Losses resulting from such
Environmental Defect and associated Remediation pursuant to an indemnity
agreement mutually agreed by the Parties, under which Seller agrees to fully,
unconditionally and irrevocably indemnify and hold harmless Buyer from any and
all Losses arising out of or resulting from such Environmental Defect; or

 



 

(3) require Seller to retain the entirety of the Asset that is subject to such
Environmental Defect (together with all related Assets), and reduce the
Purchase Price by an amount equal to the sum of the Allocated Value of the
Assets so retained;

 



 

provided, however, that in the event the Parties do not agree in writing by
Closing on an election of alternative (1), (2) or (3) above with respect to
any Environmental Defect, the Parties shall be deemed to have agreed to
alternative (3) above with respect to such Environmental Defect. If the
Parties elect the option set forth in clause (1) above, then Buyer shall be
deemed to have assumed responsibility for all costs and expenses attributable
to the Remediation of the applicable Environmental Defect and all Losses with
respect thereto, and Buyers obligations with respect thereto shall be deemed
to constitute Assumed Liabilities. If the Parties elect the option set forth
in clause (2) above, Seller shall have the right to elect to assume
responsibility for the Remediation of such Environmental Defect following
Closing and, if Seller so elects (A) Seller shall use its reasonable efforts
to implement such Remediation in a manner which is consistent with the
requirements of Environmental Laws in a timely fashion for the type of
Remediation that Seller elects to undertake and (B) Buyer, effective as of the
Closing, hereby grants to Seller and its representatives access to the Assets
to conduct such Remediation; provided that the indemnity agreement in place
contains mutually acceptable indemnification and release and other procedures
applicable in connection with Sellers Remediation efforts that are similar in
scope to the obligations of Buyer in _ARTICLE 3_ as if Seller were the Buyer
in such instance. If the Parties are unable to mutually agree upon acceptable
access and indemnification and release procedures, Buyer shall assume
responsibility for the Remediation of the Environmental Defect following
Closing and shall implement such Remediation in a manner which is consistent
with the requirements of Environmental Laws in a timely fashion for the type
of Remediation that Buyer elects to undertake, and Seller agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless Buyer from any and all Losses arising out of or resulting
from such Remediation efforts.

 



 

(f) _Environmental Dispute Resolution Procedure_. If prior to the Closing the
Parties are unable to resolve any Environmental Disputed Matter, then either
Party shall have the right, upon the delivery of written notice to the other
Party (each, an " ** _Environmental Dispute Notice_** "), to Dispute such
Environmental Disputed Matter and to invoke the Dispute resolution provisions
below in this _Section 5.3(f)_ in order to resolve any such Dispute. As used
herein, the term " ** _Environmental Disputed Matter_** " means a Dispute
regarding any of the following: (w) the existence and scope of an
Environmental Defect; (x) any Environmental Defect Value; (y) the
Environmental Adjustment Amount, if any; and (z) the adequacy of Sellers
Environmental Defect Remediation actions. Any Environmental Dispute Notice
must be delivered on or before the tenth Business Day after Closing. In no
event will Closing be delayed on account of any Environmental Disputed Matter
and if the Environmental Defect Property affected thereby is

 



      
 

 



 

transferred to Buyer at Closing, the average of the Parties respective good
faith estimates of the Environmental Defect Values attributable to such
Environmental Defect Property shall be used in the calculation and
determination of the Environmental Adjustment Amount to be used at Closing.

 



 

(1) The Parties shall attempt to resolve all Environmental Disputed Matters
through good faith negotiations for a period of 20 days after the delivery of
an Environmental Dispute Notice by either Party. Following such negotiation
period, if the Environmental Disputed Matter at issue should remain in
Dispute, such Environmental Disputed Matter shall be resolved pursuant to this
_Section 5.3(f)_ and the Parties shall mutually appoint an independent expert
having the qualifications specified below (the " ** _Environmental Defect
Expert_** "). If the Parties are unable to mutually agree upon the
Environmental Defect Expert, then the Parties shall, within ten days after the
expiration of such negotiation period, request (and either Party may so
request alone if the other Party refuses to jointly act in good faith to do so
during such ten day period) that the AAA, acting through its offices in
Houston, Texas, appoint the Environmental Defect Expert. The Environmental
Defect Expert shall be a certified environmental professional having a minimum
of ten years experience with regard to the types of environmental defects
affecting the Properties involved in the Environmental Disputed Matter, shall
be without any conflicts of interest as to the Parties, and shall not have
been employed by or undertaken more than $50,000 of work, in the aggregate,
for either Party or its Affiliates within the five year period preceding the
submission of the Dispute. For the avoidance of doubt, the Environmental
Defect Expert will function as an expert in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this _Section 5.3(f)_ , and not as an arbitrator.

 



 

(2) Within 30 days following the appointment of the Environmental Defect
Expert, Seller and/or Buyer shall provide the Environmental Defect Expert with
a copy of this Agreement, and each Party shall provide, both to the
Environmental Defect Expert and each other, a summary of its position with
regard to each such outstanding Environmental Disputed Matter in a written
document of five pages or less per Environmental Disputed Matter. The Parties
shall instruct the Environmental Defect Expert that, within 30 days after
receiving the Parties respective submissions, the Environmental Defect Expert
shall render a written decision. In rendering its decision, the Environmental
Defect Expert shall not award a higher Environmental Defect Value than the
good faith amount claimed by Buyer in its summary or a lower Environmental
Defect Value than the good faith amount claimed by Seller in its summary, as
applicable. Any decision rendered by the Environmental Defect Expert pursuant
hereto shall be final, conclusive, and binding on Seller and Buyer, and will
be enforceable against each Party in any court having jurisdiction hereof or
jurisdiction of either or both Parties, but is not reviewable by, or
appealable to, any court except in the event of fraud. The Parties shall each
bear one-half of the costs of the Environmental Defect Expert and of any
associated Dispute resolution process and proceedings, except the Parties
shall each bear its own legal fees with respect to any Dispute.

 



 

(3) If the Environmental Defect Expert determines that an Environmental Defect
did not exist or that an Environmental Defect existed but was Remediated by
Seller, then any Environmental Defect Value attributable thereto that was
included in the

 



      
 

 



 

Environmental Adjustment Amount used at Closing, if any, shall be credited to
Seller in the Final Settlement Statement.

 



 

(4) If the Environmental Defect Expert determines that an Environmental Defect
exists, but that the Environmental Defect Value attributable thereto is a
lesser amount than any Environmental Defect Value with respect thereto that
was included in the Environmental Adjustment Amount used at Closing, if any,
then the difference thereof shall be credited to Seller in the Final
Settlement Statement.

 



 

(5) If the Environmental Defect Expert determines that an Environmental Defect
exists, such Environmental Defect has not been Remediated by Seller and the
Environmental Defect Value attributable thereto is a greater amount than the
Environmental Defect Value with respect thereto that was included in the
Environmental Adjustment Amount used at Closing, if any, then the difference
thereof shall be credited to Buyer in the Final Settlement Statement.

 



 

(6) Any such adjustments to the amount of the Purchase Price will be reflected
in the Final Settlement Statement as applicable.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, if any Asset is retained by Seller pursuant to
_Section 5.3(e)(3)_ , the Dispute resolution provisions set forth in this
_Section 5.3(f)_ will not apply and no conveyance of such Asset would be made
to Buyer and no payment will thereafter be required by Buyer in connection
with any such Asset so retained.

respects with past practice and (A) in compliance in all material respects
with the terms of the Applicable Contracts and applicable Law, and (B) except
as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, in compliance with the terms of
the Leases and Surface Contracts; provided, however, that if Seller cures any
non-compliance with respect to any of the matters described above prior to
Closing, then Seller shall be deemed to have

 



      
 

 



 

complied with this _Section 8.1(a)(1)_ ;

 



 

(2) promptly notify Buyer if Seller receives written notice of any Third Party
Claim affecting the Assets or written notice of any default by Seller under

(b) _Restriction on Operations_. Seller shall not:

 



 

(1) convey, sell, transfer, mortgage, pledge, encumber, dispose or abandon any
part of the Assets except (A) Leases that have terminated in the ordinary
course of business based upon the expiration of the primary terms of such
Leases, (B) upon prior written approval of Buyer (which approval shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld) Leases that are, in Sellers

quantities, (C) sales of Equipment in the ordinary course of business that
have been decommissioned, (D) sales of Hydrocarbons produced from, or
attributable to, the Assets in the ordinary course of business, or (E) for
Permitted Encumbrances;

 



 

(2) approve or propose any operations anticipated in any instance to cost the
owner of the Assets more than $200,000, net to the Assets, per activity or per
any series of related activities, except for (A) emergency operations, (B) any
operations required under applicable Laws, or (C) any operations necessary to
avoid a material monetary penalty or forfeiture provision under any applicable
Lease, Surface Contract, Applicable Contract or Law; provided, however, that
Seller shall forward to Buyer the applicable AFE with respect to any operation
that does not require approval pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(2)_ ;

 



 

(3) enter into any farm-out, farm-in or other similar Contract affecting the
Assets;

 



 

(4) let lapse any of Sellers insurance now in force with respect to the

resulting from a breach by Seller or its Affiliates of such Material
Agreement;

 



 

(6) enter into any Contract that, if in existence as of the Execution Date,
would be a Material Agreement;

 



 

(7) waive, release, assign, settle or compromise any claim, action or

not in excess of

 



      
 

 



 

$100,000 individually or in the aggregate, net to the Assets, (excluding
amounts to be paid under insurance policies); provided, however that the

apply to any of the claims, actions or proceedings listed on **_Schedule
6.9_** ; or

 



 

(8) authorize or agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any of the actions
prohibited by this _Section 8.1(b)_.

 



 

(c) _Consents_. For the purposes of obtaining the written consents for AFEs
required in _Section 8.1(b)(2)_ , Buyer designates the following contact
Person: Joseph DeDominic, at the address and telephone number for Buyer set
forth in _Section 15.3_. Such consents may be obtained in writing by overnight
courier or given by .pdf via email or facsimile transmission. Buyer agrees
that it will (1) timely respond to any written request for consent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(2)_ , and (2) consent to any written request for approval of
any AFE that the officers of Buyer reasonably consider to be economically
viable. Buyers consent shall be considered granted within ten days (unless a
shorter time, not to be less than 48 hours, is reasonably required by the
circumstances and the applicable joint operating agreement and such shorter
time is specified in Sellers request for consent) after Buyers receipt of
such request for such consent, unless Buyer notifies Seller to the contrary
during that period.

 



 

(d) _Disclaimer_. Buyer agrees that the acts or omissions of the other Working
Interest owners who are not Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates and which
Seller does not have the contractual right to control shall not constitute a
breach of the provisions of _Section 8.1_ , nor shall any action required by a
vote of Working Interest owners in and of itself constitute such a breach so
long as Seller has voted its interest in a manner that complies with the
provisions of _Section 8.1_.

 



 

(e) _Post-Closing Confidentiality_. Following Closing, except (1) as may be
required or permitted pursuant to the exercise of the rights and fulfillment
of the obligations of Seller under this Agreement, (2) as may be required by
applicable Law, by any Governmental Entity, by any arbitration proceedings or
the rules of any applicable stock exchange, (3) for information which is or
becomes public knowledge through no fault of Seller or any of its Affiliates,
or (4) as may be required by in order to defend or prosecute any Claim related
to the Assets, Seller shall maintain in confidence and not divulge any
confidential data in its possession as of Closing and relating primarily to
the Assets, including geological, geophysical, land, engineering,
environmental, well, and technical information; provided, that for the
avoidance of doubt, none of Sellers technical or other information relating
to the methodology of the drilling or fracking of any well shall be considered
confidential for purposes of this _Section 8.1(e)_. If Seller is requested or
required to disclose any such protected information in connection with any
judicial or administrative proceedings, by any Governmental Entity, by any
arbitration proceedings or by any applicable stock exchange, in each case,
having appropriate jurisdiction (by order, deposition, interrogatories,
requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or
similar process), Seller will, unless prohibited by Law or any such order,
deposition, interrogatory, request for information or documents, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process, notify Buyer promptly in
writing of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request
or requirement so that Buyer may, in its sole discretion, seek a protective
order or other appropriate remedy.

 



       
 

 



 

8.2 _Covenants and Agreements of Buyer_.

 



 

(a) _Change of Name_. As promptly as practicable, but in any case within 120
days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall use its reasonable efforts to (1)
eliminate the name "Hess" and any variants thereof from the Assets, (2) cease
using in any way the word "Hess" with respect to the Assets, and (3) remove
and cease to use all trademarks associated with Seller or its Affiliates with
respect to the Assets. Except with respect to such grace period for
eliminating existing usage, for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall have no
right to use any logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to Seller or any
of its Affiliates. FROM AND AFTER THE CLOSING, BUYER HEREBY WAIVES, RELEASES
AND AGREES TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS SELLER AND THE OTHER SELLER
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST ANY LOSSES ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY
ATTRIBUTABLE TO, THE USE OF THE WORD "HESS" AFTER THE CLOSING DATE AND WITH
RESPECT TO THE ASSETS IN RELATION TO ANY BREACH BY BUYER OF ITS OBLIGATIONS
UNDER THIS _SECTION 8.2(a)_ , EVEN IF SUCH LOSSES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM,
SOLELY OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY
OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES.

 



 

(b) _Governmental Bonds_. Buyer acknowledges that none of the bonds, letters
of credit and guarantees, if any, posted by Seller or its Affiliates with
Governmental Entities and relating to the Assets are transferable to Buyer. On
or before the Closing Date, Buyer shall obtain, or cause to be obtained in the
name of Buyer, replacements for such bonds, letters of credit and guarantees
to the extent such replacements are necessary (1) for Buyers ownership and,
as applicable, operation of the Assets and (2) to permit the cancellation of
the bonds, letters of credit and guarantees posted by Seller and/or its
Affiliates with respect to the Assets. In addition, at or prior to Closing,
Buyer shall deliver to Seller evidence of the posting of bonds or other
security with all applicable Governmental Entities meeting the requirements of
such authorities to own and, where appropriate, operate, the Assets.

 



 

8.3 _Covenants and Agreements of the Parties_.

 



 

(a) _Communication Between the Parties Regarding Breach_. If Buyer or Seller
obtains Knowledge prior to Closing that leads either Party to believe that the
other Party has breached a representation or warranty or failed to perform a
covenant or agreement under this Agreement, the non-breaching Party shall
inform the alleged breaching Party in writing of such potential breach as soon
as reasonably practicable so that the breaching Party may attempt to remedy or
cure such breach prior to the Closing. If such breach or failure is thereafter
cured to the reasonable satisfaction of the non-breaching Party by the Closing
(or, if the Closing does not occur, by the date this Agreement terminates),
then such breach or failure shall be deemed not to have occurred for all
purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Casualty Loss_. Prior to Closing, if a portion of the Assets is destroyed
or materially damaged by fire or other casualty or if any portion of the
Assets is taken or threatened to be taken in condemnation or under the right
of eminent domain (each, a " ** _Casualty Loss_** "), Seller shall promptly
advise Buyer in writing of such Casualty Loss and shall elect, by the

 



      
 

 



 

delivery of written notice to Buyer at least five Business Days prior to the
Closing Date (or, if the Casualty Loss occurs after such date and prior to
Closing, as soon as reasonably practicable prior to the Closing Date), either
of the following: (1) to retain the Asset affected by the Casualty Loss and
reduce the Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of such Asset; or (2) with
the prior written consent of Buyer, to assign such Asset to Buyer without any
reduction of the Purchase Price, subject to the assignment to Buyer of all
insurance proceeds received by Seller as to such Casualty Loss.

 



 

(c) _Operatorship_. Buyer specifically acknowledges and agrees that Seller has
made no representation, warranty or other guarantee that Buyer will succeed
Seller as operator under any joint operating agreement; provided that Seller
shall use its commercially reasonably efforts to support Buyers succession of
Seller as operator as to any of the Assets (subject to the provisions of any
applicable joint operating agreement), including soliciting the written vote
of any co-working interest owner of the Assets to Buyers succession of Seller
as operator. Prior to Closing, Seller shall not voluntarily resign as operator
under any joint operating agreements and unit operating agreements covering
the Assets.

 



 

(d) _Employees of Seller_. Buyer agrees that, without Sellers prior written
consent and excepting only as expressly otherwise provided below, until one
year after the Closing Date, Buyer will not, directly or indirectly, solicit
for employment any employee of Seller or any of its Affiliates who have
provided services in relation to the Assets or with whom Buyer has had contact
or who became known to Buyer in connection with Buyers consideration of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as to the Available
Employees, as defined below; provided that, so long as Buyer has not breached
its obligations hereunder, Buyer shall not be precluded from hiring any such
employee or other Person who (1) responds to any advertisement to the public
or the industry generally that is not directly or indirectly targeted at
employees of Seller or any of its Affiliates, or (2) has been terminated (and
not rehired) by Seller or any of its Affiliates prior to commencement of
employment discussions between Buyer and such employee or other Person. Buyer
or its Affiliates, in its and their sole discretion, may make offers of
employment to those certain of Sellers employees listed in **_Schedule
8.3(d)_ **(the " ** _Available Employees_** "). From and after the Execution
Date until the Closing Date, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in
permitting Buyer or its Affiliates, upon reasonable notice to Seller,
reasonable access to the Available Employees to interview such Available
Employees during normal business hours and to communicate any information
concerning employment offers and employment with Buyer or its Affiliates.
Without limitation to the foregoing, however, Seller shall have the right to
make competing offers to the Available Employees to remain employees of
Seller.

 



 

(e) _Government Reviews_. In a timely manner and at least 30 days prior to
Closing, the Parties shall (1) make all required filings, prepare all required
applications and conduct negotiations with each Governmental Entity as to
which such filings, applications or negotiations are necessary or appropriate
in the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (2) provide
such information as each may reasonably request to make such filings, prepare
such applications and conduct such negotiations. Each Party shall reasonably
cooperate with and use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist the other
with respect to such filings, applications, and negotiations. Without limiting
the foregoing, if the Parties determine that a filing under the HSR Act is
required, then, within ten Business Days following the Execution Date, the
Parties

 



      
 

 



 

will prepare and file with the DOJ and the FTC the notification and report
form required by the HSR Act for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and request early termination of the waiting period thereunder.
Each of the Parties agree to respond promptly to any inquiries from the DOJ or
the FTC concerning such filings and to comply in all material respects with
the filing requirements of the HSR Act. The Parties shall cooperate with each
other and shall promptly furnish all information to the other Parties that is
necessary in connection with Buyers compliance with the HSR Act. The Parties
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably
necessary and appropriate in connection with any HSR Act filing to consummate
the transactions consummated hereby; provided, however, that Buyer will not be
required to sell or dispose of any of its assets or businesses in connection
therewith. All filing fees incurred in connection with the HSR Act filings
made pursuant to this _Section 8.3(e)_ shall be borne one-half by Buyer and
one-half by Seller.

 



 

(f) _Amendment of Schedules_. Buyer agrees that Seller shall have the
continuing right until Closing to add, supplement or amend the Schedules and
Exhibits with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered which, if
existing or known as of the Execution Date or thereafter, would have been
required to be set forth or described in such Schedules and Exhibits and that
Seller shall simultaneously with any addition, supplement or amendment,
provide copies thereof to Buyer. For purposes of determining whether the
conditions set forth in _ARTICLE 10_ or otherwise in this Agreement have been
fulfilled and for purposes of determining any indemnity or other claim
pursuant to this Agreement, the Schedules and Exhibits contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to only include that information contained therein
on the Execution Date.

 



 

(g) _Financial Information_. From and after the Execution Date until the third
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " ** _Access Period_** "), Seller shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors,
managers, employees, agents and representatives to, provide reasonable
cooperation to Buyer, its Affiliates and their agents and representatives in
connection with Buyers or its Affiliates filings, if any, that may be
required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, under securities Laws
applicable to Buyer and its Affiliates (collectively, the " ** _Filings_** ").
During the Access Period, Seller agrees to make available to Buyer and its
Affiliates and their agents and representatives any and all books, records,
information and documents that are attributable to the Assets in Sellers or
its Affiliates possession or control and access to Sellers and its
Affiliates personnel, in each case as reasonably required by Buyer, its
Affiliates and their agents and representatives in order to prepare, if
required, in connection with the Filings, financial statements meeting the
requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, along with any
documentation attributable to the Assets or otherwise related to Seller or its
Affiliates required to complete any audit associated with such financial
statements (it being acknowledged that Seller shall not be required to provide
any pro-formas and forward-looking statements). During the Access Period,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide reasonable
cooperation to the independent auditors chosen by Buyer (" ** _Buyer s
Auditor_**") in connection with any audit by Buyers Auditor of any financial
statements of the Assets or of Seller or its Affiliates that Buyer or any of
its Affiliates requires to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act
or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with respect to any Filings. During the
Access Period, Seller and its Affiliates shall retain all books, records,
information and documents relating to the Assets for the three fiscal years
prior to January 1, 2013 and the period from January 1, 2013 through the
Closing Date. Buyer will reimburse Seller and its Affiliates,

 



      
 

 



 

within ten Business Days after demand in writing therefor, for any reasonable
out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller and its Affiliates in complying with
the provision of this _Section 8.3(g)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
herein shall expand Sellers representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement or give Buyer, its Affiliates or any
Third Party any rights to which it is not entitled hereunder. Buyer hereby
releases the Seller Indemnified Parties from, and shall fully protect, defend,
indemnify and hold the Seller Indemnified Parties harmless from and against,
in each case, any and all Losses (including costs of investigation and
attorneys and experts fees and expenses) relating to, arising out of or
connected with, directly or indirectly, any actions, representations or
certifications of Sellers and its Affiliates personnel or auditors with
respect to the access, records and cooperation provided pursuant to this
_Section 8.3(g)_ , or Buyers use of the information contained in such
records, or the inclusion of such financial records in any debt or equity
offering documents or related materials. THESE INDEMNITY AND DEFENSE
OBLIGATIONS APPLY REGARDLESS WHETHER SUCH LOSSES ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO OR ARISE
OUT OF, SOLELY OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, GROSS, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR
COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF
OR BY ANY OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES; PROVIDED HOWEVER THE FOREGOING
INDEMNITY AND DEFENSE OBLIGATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY WITH RESPECT TO THE WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT OF ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY.

 



 

(h) _Confidentiality_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (1) the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement are incorporated herein by
reference, and (2) upon the Closing Date, the Parties agree that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate.

 



 

(i) _Blanket Agreement Confirmations_. Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to, on or before three days prior to Closing, enter into
blanket agreements, master service agreements or similar agreements, as
applicable, with the counterparties to the Hess Blanket Agreements (such
counterparties, the " ** _Blanket Agreement Counterparties_** ", and such new
blanket agreements, master service agreements or similar agreements, the " **
_Sanchez Blanket Agreements_** "). Such Sanchez Blanket Agreements shall (1)
allow Seller to assign to Buyer the Blanket Agreement Confirmations applicable
to the corresponding Hess Blanket Agreements, and (2) provide that Seller
shall have no liability relating to matters arising after the Effective Time
under such Blanket Agreement Confirmations, except as otherwise provided
herein. Buyer agrees that it shall enter into any such Sanchez Blanket
Agreement if the applicable Blanket Agreement Counterparty offers Buyer terms
that are commercially acceptable to Buyer. If Buyer enters into any Sanchez
Blanket Agreements in accordance with the terms set forth above, Seller shall,
at Closing, assign to Buyer the Blanket Agreement Confirmations related to
such Sanchez Blanket Agreements.

 



 

(j) _Expiring Leases_. From and after the Execution Date, Buyer shall have the
right, upon written notice to Seller (each such notice, an " ** _Expiring
Lease Notice_** "), to require that Seller pay, to the applicable lessor, any
extension or renewal payments, as applicable, provided for by the express
terms of any Expiring Lease. Each such Expiring Lease Notice shall be
delivered to Seller on or before ten Business Days prior to the date such
Expiring Lease would otherwise expire pursuant to its terms. For the avoidance
of doubt, any amounts paid by Seller pursuant to this _Section 8.3(j)_ shall
result in an upward Purchase Price adjustment pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 2.4(c)(2)_ (any such payment, an " ** _Expiring Lease Payment_** ").
If Closing does not occur for any reason, in any event Buyer shall
nevertheless be required to reimburse Seller, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, for each Expiring Lease Payment made by Seller pursuant to
this _Section 8.3(j)_. Promptly following the termination of this Agreement
(and in any event within five Business Days following such termination), Buyer
shall make the reimbursements of any such Expiring Lease Payments to Seller
and, simultaneously with the receipt of such reimbursement of such Expiring
Lease Payments from Buyer, Seller shall assign and deliver to Buyer the
Expiring Lease(s) related to such Expiring Lease Payment(s) pursuant to a
transfer instrument in form substantially similar to the Assignment.

 



 

(k) _Other Covenants_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that certain
covenants and agreements of the Parties are set forth in **_Schedule 1.1(e)_
**and **_Schedule 1.1(g)_**.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 9 
TAX MATTERS**

 



 

9.1 _Asset Tax Liability_. Subject to the treatment of real property Taxes,
personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem Taxes (" ** _Property Taxes_**
") provided below, all Asset Taxes for Tax periods that begin before and end
on or after the Effective Time shall be allocated between Buyer and Seller as
of the Effective Time for all taxable periods that include the Effective Time.
All Asset Taxes that are not Property Taxes shall be allocated to Seller to
the extent they relate to Hydrocarbon production prior to the Effective Time
and to Buyer to the extent they relate to Hydrocarbon production on or after
the Effective Time. No liability for Asset Taxes shall duplicate an adjustment
to Purchase Price made pursuant to _Section 2.4_. Property Taxes for each
assessment period shall be allocated to Seller based on the percentage of the
assessment period occurring before the Effective Time and to Buyer based on
the percentage of the assessment period occurring on or after the Effective
Time. Each Party shall promptly furnish to the other Party copies of any Asset
Tax assessments and statements (or invoices therefor from any applicable Third
Party operator of the Assets) received by it, to the extent such assessment,
statement, or invoice relates to an Asset Tax allocable to the other Party
under this _Section 9.1_. Seller shall estimate all Asset Taxes asserted
against it that are attributable to the ownership or operation of the Assets
to the extent relating to the period on and after the Effective Time and
through the Closing Date, together with all Subject Transfer Taxes, and
incorporate such estimates into the Preliminary Settlement Statement. The
actual amounts (to the extent the actual amounts differ from the estimates
included in the Preliminary Settlement Statement and are known at the time of
the Final Settlement Statement) shall be accounted for in the Final Settlement
Statement. If the actual amounts are not known at the time of the Final
Settlement Statement, the amounts shall be re-estimated, as necessary, based
on the best information available at the time of the Final Settlement
Statement.

 



 

9.2 _Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use, transfer, stamp, documentary,
registration, value-added and other similar Taxes (including all applicable
real estate transfer Taxes but excluding Taxes on gross income, net income,
gross receipts or margin), duties, levies, recording fees or other
governmental charges incurred by or imposed with respect to the property
transfers undertaken pursuant to this Agreement (" ** _Subject Transfer
Taxes_** ") shall be the responsibility of, and shall be paid by, Buyer. The
Parties shall reasonably cooperate in taking steps that would minimize or
eliminate any Subject Transfer Taxes. Buyer agrees to file all Subject
Transfer Tax

 



      
 

 



 

Returns relating to such Subject Transfer Taxes and to reasonably consult with
Seller regarding any such filing.

 



 

9.3 _Asset Tax Returns_. Seller shall provide Buyer with any information
Seller has that is reasonably necessary for Buyer to file any required Tax
Return with respect to Asset Taxes that are due after the Closing Date. All
such Tax Returns shall be prepared by Buyer in a manner consistent with the
prior practice of Seller, to the extent permitted by Law and in a manner
consistent with the allocation described in _Section 2.3(a)_ , _Section
2.3(b)_ and, if applicable, the final Section 1060 Allocation Schedule. Buyer
shall provide Seller with copies of completed drafts of such Tax Returns at
least ten days prior to the due date for filing thereof, to the extent
reasonably practicable, along with supporting work papers, for Sellers
review. Buyer shall consider in good faith any comment that Seller submits to
Buyer no less than five days prior to the due date of such Tax Returns. Buyer
shall file all such Tax Returns and, subject to the provisions of _Section
9.1_ , pay all Asset Taxes due and payable with respect to such Tax Returns.
To the extent Buyer makes any payment of Asset Taxes pursuant to this _Section
9.3_ for which Seller is liable pursuant to _Section 9.1_ and which exceeds
the amount taken into account in the Final Settlement Statement, Seller shall
reimburse Buyer for such excess amount no later than ten days after Buyer
delivers a statement to Seller setting forth the amount of reimbursement to
which Buyer is entitled along with such supporting evidence as is reasonably
necessary to calculate the amount of reimbursement.

 



 

9.4 _Tax Cooperation_. Buyer and Seller shall each cooperate fully as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the
filing of any Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding (each,
a " ** _Tax Proceeding_** ") with respect to Taxes relating to or in
connection with the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the other Partys request) the provision of such Records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

 



 

9.5 _Like Kind Exchange_. Buyer and Seller agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts and cooperation (without risk, expense or extraordinary
commitment of personnel or other resources) in any attempt to qualify (a) the
transfer of the Assets by Seller with respect to this transaction or (b) the
purchase of the Assets by Buyer, with respect to a separate transaction
whereby Buyer transfers other oil and gas properties to a Third Party, as part
of a like-kind exchange of property within the meaning of Section 1031 of the
Code, through a trust, escrow or other reasonable means; provided, however,
that (1) Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold Buyer harmless for any cost,
expense, obligation or other liability, without limitation, which Buyer may
suffer in connection with or arising out of Buyers cooperation with Sellers
treatment of the sale of the Assets as part of a like-kind exchange and on
account of Buyers cooperation with Sellers attempt to qualify the transfer
of the Assets by Seller with respect to this transaction as a like-kind
exchange, and (2) Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold Seller harmless from
any cost, expense, obligation or other liability, without limitation, which
Seller may suffer in connection with or arising out of Sellers cooperation
with Buyers treatment of the purchase of the Assets as part of a separate
like-kind exchange and on account of Sellers cooperation with Buyers attempt
to qualify the purchase of the Assets by Buyer with respect to this
transaction as a like-kind exchange. Each Party shall have the right to assign
its rights, but

 



      
 

 



 

not its obligations, under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to a
"qualified intermediary" (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section
1.1031(k)- l(g)(4)) or as otherwise necessary or appropriate to effectuate a
like-kind exchange, and each other Party agrees to recognize said qualified
intermediary. Each Party shall be solely responsible for assuring the
effectiveness of any exchange for its Tax purposes, and each other Party makes
no representation or undertaking with regard to such effectiveness. In no
event shall any like-kind exchange contemplated by this provision cause an
extension of the Closing Date set forth herein, except as may otherwise be
mutually agreed by the Parties in writing.

 **ARTICLE 13 
POST-CLOSING OBLIGATIONS**

 



 

13.1 _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) _Final Settlement Statement_. As soon as practicable after the Closing,
but in no event earlier than 90 days or later than 180 days after Closing
except as may be otherwise expressly provided herein (the " ** _Final
Settlement Statement Due Date_** "), Seller will cause to be prepared and
delivered to Buyer, in accordance with GAAP and customary industry accounting
practices, a settlement statement setting forth each adjustment to the
Purchase Price in accordance with _Section 2.4_ and showing the calculation of
such adjustments and the resulting final purchase price (the " ** _Final
Purchase Price_** " and such statement, the " ** _Final Settlement
Statement_** "). Within 30 days after its receipt of the Final Settlement
Statement, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a written report containing any
changes that Buyer proposes to make to the Final Settlement Statement. Buyers
failure to deliver to Seller a written report detailing proposed changes to
the Final Settlement Statement by such date shall be deemed to be an
acceptance by Buyer of the Final Settlement Statement delivered by Seller. The
Parties shall endeavor to agree in writing with respect to the changes
proposed by Buyer, if any, by no later than 60 days after Buyers receipt of
Sellers proposed Final Settlement Statement. Should the Parties fail to agree
on the Final Settlement Statement and Final Purchase Price by such date,
either Party may invoke the Dispute resolution procedures provided for in
_Section 13.1(b)_. The date upon which such agreement is reached or upon which
the Final Purchase Price is determined pursuant to _Section 13.1(b)_ shall be
herein called the " ** _Final Settlement Date_**." If such agreed or
determined Final Purchase Price is more than the Preliminary Purchase Price,
Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of such difference by wire transfer in
immediately available funds no later than five Business Days after the Final
Settlement Date. If such agreed or determined Final Purchase Price is less
than the Preliminary Purchase Price, Seller shall pay the amount of such
difference to Buyer by wire transfer in immediately available funds no later
than five Business Days after the Final Settlement Date.

 



 

(b) _Dispute Resolution_. Within ten days after either Party invokes the
Dispute resolution procedures of this _Section 13.1(b)_ pursuant to _Section
13.1(a)_ , the Parties shall mutually appoint (and either Party may on its own
appoint such expert if the other Party refuses to act in good faith to jointly
appoint such expert during such ten day period) an independent expert having
the qualifications specified below (the " ** _Accounting Expert_** "). If the
Parties are unable to mutually agree upon the Accounting Expert within such
ten day period, then the Parties shall, within ten days after the expiration
of such foregoing ten day period, request that the AAA, acting through its
offices in Houston, Texas, appoint the Accounting Expert. The Accounting
Expert shall be a certified public accountant having a minimum of ten years
experience with regard to the types of matters involved in the Dispute, shall
be without any conflicts of interest as to the Parties, and shall not have
been employed by or undertaken more than $50,000 of work, in the aggregate,
for either Party or its Affiliates within the five year period preceding the
submission of the Dispute. For the avoidance of doubt, the Accounting Expert
will function as an expert in accordance with the foregoing procedure, not as
an arbitrator. Within 15 days following the appointment of the Accounting
Expert, Seller and/or Buyer shall provide the Accounting Expert with a copy of
this Agreement, and each Party shall provide, both to the Accounting Expert
and to each other, a summary of its position with regard to each such

 



      
 

 



 

outstanding matter involving the Final Settlement Statement in a written
document of five pages or less per outstanding Disputed matter. The Parties
shall instruct the Accounting Expert that, within 30 days after receiving the
last of the Parties respective submissions or the expiration of such 15 day
period if either Party fails to make a submission, the Accounting Expert shall
render a decision, choosing only either Buyers position or Sellers position
with respect to each Disputed matter. Any decision rendered by the Accounting
Expert pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive and binding on Seller and
Buyer, and will be enforceable against each Party in any court having
jurisdiction hereof or jurisdiction of either or both Parties, but is not
reviewable by, or appealable to, any court except in the event of fraud. The
Parties shall each bear one-half of the costs of the Accounting Expert and of
any associated Dispute resolution proceedings. The Final Settlement Statement
shall be re-issued by Seller if and as necessary to conform to the Accounting
Experts decision.

 



 

13.2 _Records_. Seller shall, at its office located in Houston, Texas, make
(a) the Records, as the same existed as of the Effective Time, available for
pick up by Buyer upon the Closing Date, and (b) those Records that would need
to be updated, supplemented or modified between the Effective Time and
Closing, available for pick up by Buyer within 45 days of the Closing Date.
Seller may retain copies of the Records, and Seller shall, at its sole cost,
expense and risk, have the right to review and copy the original Records
during standard business hours and upon reasonable notice to Buyer for a
period of six years after the Closing Date. Buyer agrees that the Records will
be maintained in compliance with all applicable Laws governing document
retention.

 



 

13.3 _Further Assurances_. From time to time after Closing, Seller and Buyer
shall each execute, acknowledge and deliver to the other such further
instruments and take such other action as may be reasonably requested by the
other Party, at such requesting Partys cost, and as are commercially
reasonable to be performed in order to accomplish more effectively the
purposes of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including those
post-Closing actions contemplated by _Section 4.4(a)_ and _Section 4.4(b)_.
Promptly after Closing, Buyer shall: (a) record the Assignments of the Assets
and all state and federal assignments executed at the Closing in all
applicable real property records and/or, if applicable, all state and federal
Governmental Entities, and Buyer shall provide to Seller copies of such
recorded documents; (b) actively pursue the approval of all Customary Post-
Closing Consents from the applicable Governmental Entities; and (c) actively
pursue all other consents and approvals that may be required in connection
with the assignment of the Assets to Buyer and the assumption of the rights,
interests, obligations and liabilities assumed by Buyer hereunder that have
not been obtained prior to Closing, provided that Seller shall reasonably
cooperate with Buyer in obtaining such other consents and approvals, at
Buyers cost.

 



 

13.4 _Transition Services_ Seller shall, pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement, provide certain services to Buyer with respect to the Assets from
and after the Closing Date until all of such services are terminated according
to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement (such period of time, the "
** _Transition Period_** ").

Agreement, any other agreement, contract or instrument contemplated herein or
the transactions contemplated hereby.**

 



 

(f) _Materiality Qualifiers_. For purposes of determining a Loss resulting
from a breach of any of Sellers representations and warranties for which
Buyer would be entitled to indemnification under _Section 14.2(a)(1)_ , any
dollar or materiality qualifications in Sellers representations and
warranties shall be disregarded.

 



 

14.3 _Claims Procedure_. The defense, indemnification and hold harmless
obligations contained in _Section 3.3(c)_ , _Section 8.2(a)_ , _Section
8.3(g)_ , _Section 9.5_ and _Section 14.2_ shall be implemented as follows:

 



 

(a) _Claim Notice_. The Party seeking defense and indemnification under the
terms of this Agreement (" ** _Indemnified Party_** ") shall submit a written
" ** _Claim Notice_** " to the other Party (" ** _Indemnifying Party_** ")
which, to be effective, must be delivered prior to the end of the survival
period applicable under _Section 14.4_ to the particular Loss that is the
subject of such Claim Notice and must state, to the extent of the information
reasonably available to the Indemnified Party: (1) the amount of each payment
or other obligation claimed by an Indemnified Party to be owing or other Loss
for which the Indemnified Party is seeking defense, indemnification and to be
held harmless, (2) the basis for such Claim, with supporting documentation if
available, and (3) a list identifying, to the extent reasonably possible, each
separate item of Loss for which payment or any other obligation is so Claimed.
Within 30 days of receipt of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party may
provide written notice to the Indemnified Party that it accepts, contests or
rejects the Losses identified in such Claim Notice or its responsibility for
same. Any failure of the Indemnifying Party to provide such notice within such
time period shall be deemed to be a rejection by such Indemnifying Party of
such Losses and its responsibility for same. If the Indemnifying Party objects
to a Claim Notice on the basis that it lacks sufficient information, it shall
promptly request from the Indemnified Party any specific additional
information reasonably necessary for it to assess such indemnification Claim,
and the Indemnified Party shall provide

 



      
 

 



 

the additional information reasonably requested to the extent reasonably
available to it. Upon receipt of such additional information, the Indemnifying
Party shall notify the Indemnified Party of any withdrawal or modification of
the objection. All disputed defense, indemnification and hold harmless Claims
shall be resolved by Buyer and Seller in accordance with either (A) a mutual
agreement between Buyer and Seller, which shall be memorialized in writing, or
(B) final arbitration in accordance with _Section 15.12_ , which may be
invoked by either Party at any time when it reasonably believes that the
Parties are unable to reach mutual agreement as to any defense,
indemnification and hold harmless Claim arising under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Information_. Promptly after the Indemnified Party receives notice of a
Claim or legal action by a Third Party that may result in a Loss for which
defense, indemnification and the right to be held harmless may be sought under
this _ARTICLE 14_ (a " ** _Third Party Claim_** "), the Indemnified Party
shall give written notice of such Third Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party.
If the Indemnifying Party or its counsel so requests, the Indemnified Party
shall furnish the Indemnifying Party with copies of all pleadings and other
material information reasonably available to the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes and
acknowledges its responsibility for such Third Party Claim, then at the
election of the Indemnifying Party, made within 30 days after receipt of such
notice, the Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume
sole management and control of such Third Party Claim (to the extent only that
such Third Party Claim relates to a Loss for which the Indemnifying Party has
agreed and acknowledges that it is liable), including the determination of all
appropriate actions, the negotiation of settlements on behalf of the
Indemnified Party, and the conduct of litigation through attorneys of the
Indemnifying Partys choice; provided, however, that no such settlement can
result in any cost or other liability to the Indemnified Party without its
consent. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume such control, (i) any and
all expense incurred by the Indemnified Party thereafter for investigation,
defense or other handling of the matter shall be borne by the Indemnified
Party, except as to those reasonable expenses incurred in responding to any
request or instruction by the Indemnifying Party and (ii) the Indemnified
Party shall give all reasonable information and assistance, other than
pecuniary, that the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably request as necessary
for the proper defense of such Third Party Claim. In the absence of such an
election, the Indemnified Party will reasonably endeavor to defend, at the
Indemnifying Partys expense, any Third Party Claim to which such Indemnifying
Partys defense, indemnification and hold harmless obligation under this
_ARTICLE 14_ applies until the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, and,
if the Indemnifying Party fails to assume such defense the Indemnified Party
may settle or otherwise resolve the same in the Indemnified Partys reasonable
discretion at the Indemnifying Partys expense and liability, subject to the
Indemnifying Partys consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; provided, further, that if the Indemnifying Party
fails to grant such consent, it shall immediately assume such defense,
indemnification and hold harmless obligation from the Indemnified Party and
reimburse the Indemnified Party for all expenses and other obligations and
liabilities incurred by it prior to such point in time. If any such Third
Party Claim requires immediate action, both the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party will cooperate in good faith to take appropriate action so
as not to jeopardize the defense of such Third Party Claim or either Partys
position with respect to such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party is
entitled to, and does, assume the defense of any such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel at its own
expense and to participate in the defense thereof, subject to the Indemnifying
Partys sole

 



      
 

 



 

management and control of the defense of any such Third Party Claim in its
sole good faith judgment; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable attorneys fees of
the Indemnified Party if the Indemnified Partys counsel shall have advised
the Indemnified Party in writing that there is a conflict of interest that
could make it inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct
to have common counsel for the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
(provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible for paying for
more than one separate firm of attorneys and one local counsel to represent
all of the Indemnified Parties subject to such Third Party Claim). In the
event that the Indemnifying Party has any Dispute regarding whether it is
obligated to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Party as to
any Third Party Claim or other Claim or any Dispute as to the scope of any
such defense, indemnity and hold harmless obligation as to a Third Party Claim
or other Claim, such Dispute shall be resolved in accordance with _Section
15.12_ , which Dispute resolution process may be invoked by either Party at
any time when it reasonably believes that the Parties are unable to reach
mutual agreement as to any defense, indemnification or hold harmless Claim
arising under this Agreement.

for any obligations or liabilities that may be incurred with respect to the
Assets.

behalf of each Party and its Affiliates (collectively, the " ** _Transaction
Documents_** ") constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the
Parties and their respective members, shareholders, officers, directors and
employees with respect to the subject matter hereof, superseding all prior
negotiations, discussions, agreements and understandings relating to such
subject matter.

 



 

15.10 _Binding Effect_. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure
to the benefit of, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

 



 

15.11 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is intended to benefit
only the Parties and their respective Indemnified Parties and their respective
successors and permitted

 



      
 

 



 

assigns; provided that only the Parties will have the right (but not the
obligation) to enforce the provisions of this Agreement on its own behalf or
on behalf of any of its respective Indemnified Parties.

 



 

15.12 _Dispute Resolution_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.3(b)_ ,
_Section 4.3_ , _Section 5.3(f)_ and _Section 13.1(b)_ , any Dispute shall be
determined by arbitration administered by the AAA in accordance with its
Commercial Arbitration Rules (the " ** _Rules_** ") and the provisions of this
_Section 15.12_.

 



 

(a) The arbitration shall be conducted by three arbitrators. The place of
arbitration shall be Houston, Texas. Within 30 days of either Party providing
notice to the other Party of a Dispute, each Party to such Dispute shall
appoint one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so appointed shall select the
third and presiding arbitrator within 30 days following appointment of the
second Party-appointed arbitrator. If either Party fails to appoint an
arbitrator within the permitted time period, then the missing arbitrator shall
be selected by the AAA as appointing authority in accordance with the AAA
Rules. Any arbitrator nominated or appointed by the AAA shall be a member of
the Large, Complex Commercial Case Panel of the AAA. In addition to the rules
of the AAA and applicable Law on arbitrator neutrality, no arbitrator shall
have been an employee or consultant to either Party or any of its Affiliates
within the five year period preceding the arbitration, or have any financial
interest in the Dispute.

 



 

(b) All awards of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding, subject
only to grounds and procedures for vacating, modifying or correcting such
under the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 _et seq._ ). Judgment on the
award may be entered and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction
hereunder.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the agreement to arbitrate Disputes in this _Section
15.12_ (except as provided in _Section 2.3(b)_ , _Section 4.3_ , _Section
5.3(f)_ or _Section 13.1(b)_ ), either Party may apply to a court for interim
measures pending appointment of the arbitration tribunal, including
injunction, attachment and conservation orders. The Parties agree that seeking
and obtaining such court-ordered interim measures shall not waive a Partys
right to arbitration. Additionally, the arbitrators (or in an emergency the
chairperson acting alone in the event one or more of the other arbitrators is
unable to be involved in a timely fashion) may grant interim measures
including injunctions, attachments and conservation orders in appropriate
circumstances, which measures may be immediately enforced by court order.
Hearings on requests for interim measures may be held in person, by telephone
or video conference or by other means that permit the Parties to present
evidence and arguments. The arbitrators (or chairperson, as the case may be)
may require either Party to provide appropriate security in connection with
such measures.

 



 

(d) The arbitral tribunal is authorized to award costs, attorneys fees and
expert witness fees and to allocate such costs and fees between the Parties.
The award may include interest from the date of any default, breach or other
accrual of a claim until the arbitral award is paid in full. The arbitrators
may not award indirect, consequential, special, punitive or exemplary damages
except to the extent allowed under the terms of _Section 14.2(e)_. Unless
otherwise directed by the arbitral tribunal, each Party shall pay its own
expenses in connection with the arbitration. The cost of the arbitrators shall
be split evenly between the Parties.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) All negotiations, mediation, arbitration and expert determinations
relating to a Dispute (including a settlement resulting from negotiation or
mediation, an arbitral award, documents exchanged or produced during a
mediation or arbitration proceeding, and memorials, briefs or other documents
prepared for the arbitration) are confidential and may not be disclosed by the
Parties, their respective Affiliates or any of their respective employees,
officers, directors, counsel, consultants and expert witnesses, except to the
extent necessary to enforce any settlement agreement, arbitration award or
expert determination, to enforce other rights of a Party, as required by Law
or any applicable stock exchange rule or regulation or for a bona fide
business purpose, such as disclosure to accountants, shareholders or Third
Party purchasers; provided, however, that breach of this _Section 15.12(e)_
shall not void any settlement, expert determination or award.

 



 

(f) Any papers, notices or process necessary or proper for an arbitration
hereunder, or any court action in connection with an arbitration or an award,
may be served on a Party in the manner set forth in _Section 15.3_.

 



 

15.13 _Publicity_. Neither Buyer nor Seller nor any of their respective
Representatives shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or
other announcement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), except as may be
required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules, regulations or orders
of any Governmental Entity or stock exchange, in which case, each Party shall
provide the other Party a draft of such release or other announcement prior to
the issuance thereof, and give reasonable consideration to such comments as
the other Party may have, prior to such release or other announcement.
