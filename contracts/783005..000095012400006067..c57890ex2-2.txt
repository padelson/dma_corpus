         (a)      Buyer shall at Closing assume and agree to pay, discharge and
perform the following Liabilities of Sellers (collectively, the "Assumed
Obligations"):

                  (i)      All Liabilities arising under all Stations Agreements
         and the Permits assigned and transferred to Buyer in accordance with
         this Agreement to the extent such Liabilities arise during and relate
         to any period on or after the Closing Date (excluding, however, any
         Liability arising from either (A) the breach of any Station Agreement
         by reason of its assignment to Buyer without a required consent or (B)
         any other breach or default by any Seller upon or prior to Closing
         under any Station Agreement).

                  (ii)     Provided that Sellers pay Buyer the amount, if any,
         owed by Sellers after Closing under Section 2.7, the Assumed
         Obligations shall also include such other Liabilities of Sellers to the
         extent, and only to the extent, the amount thereof is included as a
         credit to Buyer in calculating the Adjustment Amount as ultimately
         determined pursuant to Section 2.7.

         (b)      Except for the Assumed Obligations, Buyer shall not assume or
in any manner be liable for any Liabilities of any Selling Party of any kind or
nature, all of which such Selling Party shall pay, discharge and perform when
due.

         2.4      EARNEST MONEY.

         (a)      Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer has
deposited with the Escrow Agent in immediately available funds the sum of
Twenty-Two Million Dollars ($22,000,000).

         (b)      The Escrow Agent shall hold the Earnest Money under the terms
of the Escrow Agreement in trust for the benefit of the Selling Parties and
Buyer.

         (c)      If Closing does not occur, the Earnest Money shall be
delivered to Sellers or returned to Buyer in accordance with Section 10.2, and
if Closing does occur, the Earnest Money shall be applied at Closing as provided
in Section 2.5.

         2.5      PURCHASE PRICE.

         (a)      Subject to increase as provided in Section 2.5(c) and

payable as follows:


                                       10
<PAGE>   16
                  (i)      An amount equal to the Earnest Money shall be paid by
         the Escrow Agent's disbursement of the Earnest Money to Sellers by wire
         transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to joint written
         instructions from Sellers and Buyer.

                  (ii)     The difference of (A) the Purchase Price minus (B)
         the Earnest Money shall be paid by Buyer to Sellers on the Closing Date
         by wire transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to written
         instructions from Sellers to Buyer.

         (b)      Sellers shall furnish Buyer wire instructions at least two (2)
business days prior to the Closing Date.

         (c)      The Purchase Price shall be increased:
                  (i)      By One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) upon expiration
                           of the 60-day period following publication of notice
                           by the FCC that applications for the FCC Order have
                           been accepted for filing (the "Initial Closing
                           Period") if, and only if, (A) Closing has not
                           occurred prior to expiration of the Initial Closing
                           Period because the FCC has failed to grant the FCC
                           Order or the waiting period (including any
                           extensions) under the HSR Act applicable to the
                           transactions contemplated by this Agreement has not
                           expired or been terminated, and (B) such failure of
                           the FCC, or such failure of such waiting period
                           (including any extensions) to expire or be
                           terminated, is the result of facts relating to Buyer
                           or its Affiliates, including, but not limited to, the
                           facts disclosed on Schedule 4.7; and

                  (ii)     By an additional One Million Dollars ($1,000,000)
                           upon expiration of each consecutive 30-day period
                           following the Initial Closing Period (up to a maximum
                           of four (4) such 30-day periods) if, and only if, (A)
                           Closing has not occurred prior to expiration of such
                           30-day period because the FCC has failed to grant the
                           FCC Order or the waiting period (including any
                           extensions) under the HSR Act applicable to the
                           transactions contemplated by this Agreement has not
                           expired or terminated, and (B) such failure of the
                           FCC, or such failure of such waiting period
                           (including any extensions) to expire or be
                           terminated, is the result of facts relating to Buyer
                           or its Affiliates, including, but not limited to, the
                           facts disclosed on Schedule 4.7;

provided, however, that the aggregate increase in the Purchase Price under this
Section 2.5(c) shall in no event exceed Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000).

         2.6      ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE.

         (a)      Promptly after the Closing, Sellers and Buyer agree to retain
the Appraisal Firm to appraise the classes of Sale Assets. The Appraisal Firm
shall be instructed to perform an appraisal of the classes of Sale Assets and to
deliver a report to Sellers and Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable (the
"Appraisal Report"). Buyer shall pay the fees, costs and expenses of the
Appraisal Firm; provided, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to make available
to Buyer and the Appraisal Firm copies of any appraisals prepared in connection
with Sellers' acquisitions of the Stations.

         (b)      Buyer and Sellers each agree to report the allocation
determined in accordance with Section 2.6(a) to the Internal Revenue Service in
the form required by Treasury Regulations Section 1.1060-IT and to use such
allocation for all other reporting purposes after Closing in connection with
federal, state and local income and, to the extent permitted under applicable
law, franchise Taxes.

         2.7      ADJUSTMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE.

         (a)      All operating income and operating expenses of the Stations
shall be adjusted and allocated between Sellers and Buyer, and an adjustment in
the Purchase Price shall be made as provided in this Section, to the extent
necessary to reflect the principle that all such income and expenses
attributable to the operation of the Stations on or before the date preceding
the Closing Date shall be for the account of Sellers, and all such income and
expenses attributable to the operation of the Stations on and after the Closing
Date shall be for the account of Buyer. The net amount by which the Purchase
Price is to be increased or decreased in accordance with this Section is herein
referred to as the "Adjustment Amount".

         (b)      Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

                  (i)      Sellers shall receive a credit for the unapplied
         portion, as of Closing, of the security deposits made by Sellers under
         those Stations Agreements assumed by Buyer at Closing in accordance
         with Section 2.3.

                  (ii)     Buyer shall be given a credit ("Buyer's Trade
         Credit") in the amount, if any, by which the fair market value of all
         advertising time required to be broadcast on the Stations on or after
         the Closing Date under the Trade Agreements exceeds by more than
         $250,000, the fair market value of the goods and services to be
         received on or after the Closing Date under the Trade Agreements.
         Sellers shall be given a credit in the amount, if any, by which the
         fair market value of the goods or services to be received on or after
         the Closing Date under the Trade Agreements exceeds by more than
         $250,000 the fair


                                       12
<PAGE>   18
         market value of any advertising time required to be broadcast on the
         Stations on or after the Closing Date.

                  (iii)    Buyer shall be given a credit equal to the amount of
         cash consideration that Sellers have not paid prior to the Closing Date
         for programming run by the Stations prior to the Closing Date.

                  (iv)     With respect to each vacation day or portion thereof
         earned but not taken before the Closing Date by the Stations' employees
         hired by Buyer, Buyer shall receive a credit equal to the compensation
         equivalent thereof.

                  (v)      An adjustment and proration shall be made in favor of
         Sellers for the amount, if any, of prepaid expenses, the benefit of
         which accrues to Buyer hereunder, and other current assets acquired by
         Buyer hereunder which are paid by Sellers to the extent such prepaid
         expenses and other current assets relate to the period after the
         Closing, provided that the credit given Sellers for each prepaid
         expense shall not exceed an amount commensurate with the benefit
         therefrom to be received by Buyer after Closing.

                  (vi)     There shall be no proration for sick leave.

                  (vii)    There shall be no proration for any payments made by
         Interep to any of the Sellers in connection with obtaining the right to
         serve as the national sales representative of any of the Stations.

         (c)      To the extent not inconsistent with the express provisions of
this Agreement, the allocations made pursuant to this Section shall be made in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

         (d)      Three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers
shall provide Buyer with a statement setting forth a detailed computation of
Sellers' reasonable and good faith estimate of the Adjustment Amount as of the
Closing Date (the "Preliminary Adjustment Report"). If the Adjustment Amount
reflected on the Preliminary Adjustment Report is a credit to Buyer, the
Purchase Price payable on the Closing Date shall be reduced by the amount of the
preliminary Adjustment Amount, and if the Adjustment Amount reflected on the
Preliminary Adjustment Report is a charge to Buyer, the Purchase Price payable
on the Closing Date shall be increased by the amount of such preliminary
Adjustment Amount. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
deliver to Sellers in writing and in reasonable detail a good faith final
determination of the Adjustment Amount determined as of the Closing Date ("Final
Proration Notice"). Sellers shall assist Buyer in making such determination, and
Buyer shall provide Sellers with reasonable access to the properties, books and
records relating to the Stations for


                                       13
<PAGE>   19
the purpose of determining the Adjustment Amount. Sellers shall have the right
to review the computations and workpapers used in connection with Buyer's
preparation of the Adjustment Amount. If Sellers disagree with the amount of the
Adjustment Amount determined by Buyer, Sellers shall so notify Buyer in writing
(the "Dispute Notice") within forty-five (45) days after the date of receipt of
Buyer's Final Proration Notice, specifying in detail any point of disagreement;
provided, however, that if Sellers fail to notify Buyer in writing of Sellers'
disagreement within such 45-day period, Buyer's determination of the Adjustment
Amount, as indicated in the Final Proration Notice shall be final, conclusive
and binding on Sellers and Buyer. After the receipt of any notice of
disagreement, Buyer and Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
disagreements regarding the Adjustment Amount. If agreement is reached within
forty-five (45) days after Buyer's receipt of the Dispute Notice, then upon
reaching such agreement, Sellers shall pay to Buyer or Buyer shall pay to
Sellers, as the case may be, an amount equal to the difference between (i) the
agreed Adjustment Amount and (ii) the preliminary Adjustment Amount indicated in
the Preliminary Adjustment Report. Any such payment shall be made as provided in
Section 2.7(f). If agreement is not reached within such 30-day period, then the
dispute resolutions of Section 2.7(e) shall apply.

         (e)      If Sellers and their auditors and Buyer and its auditors do
not, within the 30-day period specified in Section 2.7(d), reach an agreement on
the Adjustment Amount as of the Closing Date, then an independent accounting
firm of recognized national standing (the "Arbitrating Firm") which has not
regularly provided services to either the Buyer or Sellers in the last three (3)
years, which shall be knowledgeable and experienced in the operation of radio
broadcasting stations, shall be selected by Sellers and Buyer to resolve the
disputed items. If Sellers and Buyer do not agree on the Arbitrating Firm within
five (5) days, the Arbitrating Firm shall be a nationally recognized accounting
firm selected by lot (after excluding one firm designated by Sellers and one
firm designated by Buyer). Buyer and Sellers shall each inform the Arbitrating
Firm in writing as to their respective positions concerning the Adjustment
Amount as of the Closing Date, and each shall make readily available to the
Arbitrating Firm any books and records and work papers relevant to the
preparation of such firm's computation of the Adjustment Amount. The Arbitrating
Firm shall be instructed to complete its analysis within thirty (30) days from
the date of its engagement and upon completion to inform the parties in writing
of its own determination of the Adjustment Amount and the basis for its
determination. Any determination by the Arbitrating Firm in accordance with this
Section shall be final and binding on the parties for purposes of this Section.
Within five (5) days after the Arbitrating Firm delivers to the parties its
written determination of the Adjustment Amount, Sellers shall pay to Buyer, or
Buyer shall pay to Sellers, as the case may be, an amount equal to the
difference between (i) the Adjustment Amount as determined by the Arbitrating
Firm and (ii) the preliminary Adjustment Amount indicated in the Preliminary
Adjustment Report. Any such payment shall be made as provided in Section 2.7(f).

         (f)      Any payments required under Section 2.7(d) or (e) shall be
paid by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account of the payee
at a financial institution in the United States and shall for all purposes
constitute an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

         2.8      ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.

         (a)      Within ten (10) days after the Closing Date, Sellers shall
furnish to Buyer a true and complete list of Sellers' accounts receivable (other
than non-cash receivables under Trade Agreements) arising from the operation of
the Stations prior to the Closing Date (the "Retained Receivables"), which list
shall set forth for each Retained Receivable the name of the debtor, the date of
the invoice, the amount of any payments previously received on account and the
balance due.

         (b)      For a period of one hundred eighty (180) days after the
Closing Date (the "Collection Period"), Buyer will, without charge to Sellers,
use its usual and customary procedures (which may include referral to a
collection agency) to collect the Retained Receivables as Sellers' agent for
collection, provided that (i) Buyer shall not be required to commence
litigation, employ legal counsel or make any other extraordinary collection
efforts, and (ii) Buyer's obligation to act as Sellers' agent in the collection
of the Retained Receivables shall terminate upon expiration of the Collection
Period. For the purpose of determining amounts collected by Buyer with respect
to the Retained Receivables, each payment by an account debtor shall be applied
to the older or oldest accounts receivable of such account debtor unless the
account debtor in writing (a copy of which Buyer shall provide to Sellers)
identifies such an account as being in dispute and directs that a particular
payment be applied to a specific newer account receivable.

         (c)      Every four (4) weeks during the Collection Period (and within
fifteen (15) days after the end of the Collection Period), Buyer shall deliver
to Sellers a statement showing all collections of Retained Receivables made on
behalf of Sellers since the last previous report and shall pay such collections
to Sellers by check, or by wire transfer, as specified by Sellers, at the time
such statement is delivered. Buyer shall have no right to setoff amounts owed
hereunder by Buyer to Seller against any amounts owed hereunder by Sellers to
Buyer.

         (d)      Sellers shall not engage in any collection efforts against
account debtors under the Retained Receivables during the first ninety (90) days
of the Collection Period, other than with respect to accounts receivable
identified as in dispute as provided in foregoing Section 2.8(b). After the
first ninety (90) days of the Collection Period, Sellers shall have the right,
at their expense, to assist and participate with Buyer


                                       15
<PAGE>   21
in the collection of unpaid Retained Receivables, provided, however, Sellers'
collection efforts shall be commercially reasonable and consistent with its past
practices.

         (e)      Buyer shall not, without Sellers' prior written consent,
compromise or settle for less than full value any of the Retained Receivables
unless Buyer pays Sellers the full amount of any deficiency. Buyer shall be
entitled to purchase from Sellers any Retained Receivable for the full amount
thereof at any time during or at the expiration of the Collection Period.

         (f)      At the end of the Collection Period, Buyer shall return to
Sellers all files concerning the collection or attempts to collect the Retained
Receivables and Buyer's responsibility for the collection of the Retained
Receivables shall cease; provided, Buyer shall promptly pay over to Sellers any
amounts received with respect to the Retained Receivables after the Collection
Period, together with a statement setting forth the components of such amounts.

Assets with Selling Parties being permitted to use the proceeds delivered by
Buyer at Closing in order to obtain such releases.

         5.7      INSPECTION AND ACCESS.

         Sellers will, prior to the Closing Date, make available the assets,

Divestiture, provided that such buyer is bound by a confidentiality agreement
(of which buyer affirmatively acknowledges Sellers are third party
beneficiaries) as restrictive as the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.8
and the Confidentiality Agreement referred to in the immediately following
sentence. Buyer shall continue to be bound by the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement dated June 25, 1999 between the parties hereto,
subject, however, to clause (v) of the foregoing sentence.

         5.9      PUBLICITY.

         The parties agree that no public release or announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior
written consent of the other party (which will not be unreasonably withheld),
except as required by law or applicable regulations, in which case the party
issuing the press release or announcement shall provide the other party with a
copy thereof sufficiently in advance of such issuance to permit the other party
to comment thereon. The parties further agree that they shall not, and shall
direct their employees located in, or having responsibilities with respect to
the St. Louis Market not to, publicly discuss the transaction contemplated
hereby or the Planned Divestiture with any advertisers on, or vendors to, the
Stations.

         5.10     MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT.

to satisfy and to consummate and make effective as soon as practicable the

any proposal or offer from any Person relating specifically to the acquisition
or purchase of any interest in any Seller or any material assets of any Station
or any merger, consolidation or other business combination with any Seller (each
an "Acquisition Proposal"), or (ii) otherwise knowingly assist or negotiate with
any Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; provided, nothing contained
herein shall apply to limit discussions, negotiations, etc. relating to a sale
of any stock of Parent or of all or substantially all of Parent's broadcast
properties (other than the Stations) and/or non-broadcast properties. Selling
Parties shall promptly notify Buyer in writing if an Acquisition Proposal is

<PAGE>   46
preparation and filing of such financial statements, including providing a
customary management representation letter in the form prescribed by generally
accepted auditing standards and using their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent of Sellers' independent accounting firm to permit Buyer and
Buyer's auditors to have access to such firm's workpapers. Under no circumstance
shall the preparation of any financial statements pursuant to such audit: (a)
require any Seller to change or modify any accounting policy, (b) cause any

that (i) is not an Affiliate of Buyer, (ii) is not a trust in which Buyer has a
direct or indirect beneficial interest, and (iii) will not cause Buyer, after
consummation of the Planned Divestiture, to have an attributable interest under
the Act in any of the Excess Stations.

         5.17     DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES.

         Sellers and Buyer acknowledge and agree that Sellers shall not be
liable for the failure of the Schedules to be accurate as a result of the
operation of the Stations prior to a Closing in accordance with Section 5.1 of
this Agreement. The inclusion of any fact or item on a Schedule referenced by a
particular section in this Agreement shall, should the existence of the fact or
item or its contents be relevant to any other section, be deemed to be disclosed
with respect to such other section whether or not an explicit cross-reference
appears in the Schedules if such relevance is readily apparent from examination
of such Schedules.

         5.18     BULK SALES LAW.

         Buyer hereby waives compliance by Sellers, in connection with the

         Buyer agrees to cooperate as reasonably requested by Sellers in
effecting a tax-deferred like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code in
which Buyer will acquire the Sale Assets from Sellers and Sellers will assign
all or part of their rights (but not their obligations) under this Agreement to
a "qualified intermediary" (as defined in Treas. Reg. 1.1031(k)-(g)(4));
provided that (i) such exchange will not cause the Closing Date to be delayed

purchase of the Sale Assets under this Agreement, (ii) Buyer is reimbursed by
Sellers for all of its costs and expenses incurred in cooperating with Sellers
to effect such exchange, (iii) Buyer is not required to incur or assume any
liability or obligation in addition to the liabilities and obligations Buyer is
required to incur or assume under the terms of this Agreement determined as if
this Section 5.19 were not included in this Agreement (other than costs and
expenses reimbursed by Sellers), (iv) Sellers' ability to effect the exchange
shall not constitute a condition precedent to the Selling Party's obligation to
close the sale of the Sale Assets to Buyer in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement (excluding this Section 5.19), and (v) the Selling
Parties shall indemnify Buyer from and against any and all Losses arising from,
relating to or in connection with such exchange (other than Losses resulting
from (A) Buyer's breach of this Section 5.19 or (B) any liability or obligation
Buyer is required to incur or assume under the terms of this Agreement
determined as if this Section 5.19 were not included in this Agreement), and
indemnification of such Losses shall not be subject to or count against the
Threshold or the Cap.

         5.20     LEASE OF STUDIO AND OFFICE SPACE.

         On the Closing Date, Buyer as lessee shall, and the Selling Parties

                                INDEMNIFICATION

         9.1      SURVIVAL.

         All representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this
Agreement or any other Document shall survive the Closing regardless of any
investigation, inquiry or knowledge on the part of any party, and the Closing
shall not be deemed a waiver by any party of the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of any other party in this Agreement or any other
Documents; provided, however, that the period of survival shall, (i) with
respect to the representations and warranties in Section 3.18 (Environmental
Matters), end eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, and (ii) in the case
of any other representation or warranty, end twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date (in each case, the "Survival Period"). No claim for breach of any
representation or warranty may be brought under this Agreement or any other
Document unless written notice describing in reasonable detail the nature and
basis of such claim is given on or prior to the last day of the applicable
Survival Period. In the event such notice of a claim is so given, the right to
indemnification with respect to such claim shall survive the applicable Survival
Period until the claim is finally resolved and any obligations with respect to
the claim are fully satisfied.

         9.2      INDEMNIFICATION BY SELLING PARTIES.

         (a)      Subject to Section 9.2(b), Selling Parties shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer and its officers,
directors, employees, Affiliates, successors and assigns from and against, and
pay or reimburse each of them for and with respect to, any Loss (each, a
"Buyer's Loss") relating to, arising out of or resulting from:

                  (i)      Any breach by any Selling Party of any of its
         representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement
         or any other Document; or

                  (ii)     Any obligation, indebtedness or Liability of any
         Selling Party (other than the Assumed Obligations) regardless of
         whether disclosed to Buyer and regardless of whether constituting a
         breach by a Selling Party of any representation, warranty, covenant or
         agreement hereunder or under any other Document; or

                  (iii)    Noncompliance by any Seller with the provisions of
         the Bulk Sales Act, if applicable, in connection with the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement.


                                       50
<PAGE>   56
         (b)      If Closing occurs, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Selling Parties shall not be obligated to indemnify Buyer
except to the extent that (i) the aggregate amount of Buyer's Losses exceeds
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (the "Threshold") (and then only to the
extent the aggregate amount of Buyer's Losses exceed Two Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($250,000)) and (ii) the aggregate amount of Buyer's Losses is less than
Twenty-Two Million Dollars ($22,000,000) (the "Cap"), provided that any payment
owed by Selling Parties to Buyer for any of Buyer's Losses pursuant to or under
Section 2.7, Section 5.19 or Section 9.2(a)(ii) or (iii) shall not be counted in
determining whether the Threshold limitation is satisfied or the Cap is reached,
and Buyer shall have the right to recover any such Buyer's Losses without regard
to the Threshold limitation or the Cap.

         9.3      INDEMNIFICATION BY BUYER.

         Subject to Section 10.2, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless
Selling Parties and their officers, directors, members, employees, agents,
representatives, Affiliates, successors and assigns from and against, pay or
reimburse each of them for and with respect to any Loss relating to, arising out
of or resulting from:

                  (i)      Any breach by Buyer of any of its representations,
         warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement or any other
         Document; or

                  (ii)     The Assumed Obligations; or

                  (iii)    Buyer's operation of the Stations on or after the
         Closing Date (except for any Loss relating to, arising out of or
         resulting from any Excluded Asset) or Buyer's ownership of the Sale
         Assets.

         9.4      ADMINISTRATION OF INDEMNIFICATION.

         For purposes of administering the indemnification provisions set forth
in Sections 9.2 and 9.3, the following procedure shall apply:

         (a)      Whenever a claim shall arise for indemnification under this
Article, the party entitled to indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") shall
reasonably promptly give written notice to the party from whom indemnification
is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") setting forth in reasonable detail, to the
extent then available, the facts concerning the nature of such claim and the
basis upon which the Indemnified Party believes that it is entitled to
indemnification hereunder.


                                       51
<PAGE>   57
         (b)      In the event of any claim for indemnification resulting from
or in connection with any claim by a third party, the Indemnifying Party shall
be entitled, at its sole expense, either (i) to participate in defending against
such claim or (ii) to assume the entire defense with counsel which is selected
by it and which is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party provided
that (A) the Indemnifying Party agrees in writing that it does not and will not
contest its responsibility for indemnifying the Indemnified Party in respect of
such claim or proceeding and (B) no settlement shall be made and no judgment
consented to without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party which
shall not be unreasonably withheld (except that no such consent shall be
required if the claimant is entitled under the settlement to only monetary
damages actually paid by the Indemnifying Party). If, however, (i) the claim,
action, suit or proceeding would, if successful, result in the imposition of
damages for which the Indemnifying Party would not be solely responsible, or
(ii) representation of both parties by the same counsel would otherwise be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, then
the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the entire defense and
each party shall be entitled to retain counsel (at each such party's own
expense) who shall cooperate with one another in defending against such claim.

         (c)      If the Indemnifying Party does not choose to defend against a
claim by a third party, the Indemnified Party may defend in such manner as it
reasonably determines is appropriate or settle the claim (after giving notice
thereof to the Indemnifying Party) on such terms as the Indemnified Party may
deem appropriate, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to periodic
reimbursement of defense expenses incurred and prompt indemnification from the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with this Article.

         (d)      Failure or delay by an Indemnified Party to give a reasonably
prompt notice of any claim (if given prior to expiration of any applicable
Survival Period) shall not release, waive or otherwise affect an Indemnifying
Party's obligations with respect to the claim, except to the extent that actual
loss or prejudice occurs as a result of such failure or delay. Buyer shall not
be deemed to have notice of any claim solely by reason of any knowledge acquired
on or prior to the Closing Date by an employee of any Station.

         9.5      MITIGATION AND LIMITATION OF DAMAGES .

         Each party hereto agrees to use reasonable efforts to mitigate any
losses which form the basis for any claim for indemnification hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no party
shall be entitled to punitive damages regardless of the theory of recovery.

                                   TERMINATION

         10.1     RIGHT OF TERMINATION.

         This Agreement may be terminated prior to Closing:

         (a)      By written agreement of Selling Parties and Buyer; or

         (b)      By written notice from a party that is not then in material
breach of this Agreement if:

                  (i)      The other party has continued in material breach of
         this Agreement for thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach
         from the terminating party is received by the other party; or

                  (ii)     On the date that would otherwise be the Closing Date
         if any of the conditions precedent to the obligations of Buyer (in the
         case of termination by Buyer) set forth in Sections 6.1(a), 6.1(b),
         6.2, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7 of this Agreement, or any of the conditions
         precedent to the obligations of Sellers (in the case of termination by
         the Selling Parties) set forth in Sections 7.1(a), 7.1(b), 7.2, 7.5 and
         7.7 of this Agreement, have not been satisfied or waived in writing by
         the party with respect to which satisfaction is a condition precedent
         to its obligation to close (whether or not occurring as the result of a
         party's material breach of any provision of this Agreement); or

                  (iii)    Closing does not occur within twelve (12) months
         after the date hereof.

         10.2     OBLIGATIONS UPON TERMINATION.

         (a)      Sections 5.8, 5.9, 13.2 and 13.4 through 13.15 and Articles IX
and X shall survive the termination of this Agreement and remain in full force
and effect. Each party to this Agreement shall remain liable after termination
for breach of this Agreement prior to termination; provided that if Closing does
not occur, the aggregate liability of Buyer for breach under this Agreement
shall be limited as provided in Section 10.2(c).

         (b)      If this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing for any
reason other than as specified in Section 10.2(c), Buyer shall be entitled to
the return of the Earnest Money, in which case Buyer and Selling Parties shall
cooperate in taking such action as required under the Escrow Agreement to effect
the Escrow Agent's distribution of the Earnest Money to Buyer.


                                       53
<PAGE>   59
         (c)      If this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing (i) by the
Selling Parties pursuant to Sections 10.1(b)(i) or 10.1(b)(ii) or (ii) by either
party hereto pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(iii) if on the date of such termination
pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(iii) any of the conditions precedent specified in
Sections 6.3, 6.4, 7.3 and/or 7.4 shall not have occurred as a result of facts
relating to Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer (including, without limitation, as a
result of the failure by Buyer to consummate the Planned Divestiture regardless
of whether Buyer has used its commercially reasonable efforts to do so and has
otherwise complied with its obligations hereunder), Selling Parties' sole remedy
at law or in equity under this Agreement shall be (i) the termination by Selling
Parties of this Agreement, and (ii) the recovery from Buyer of (A) an amount
equal to the Earnest Money (the "Selling Parties' Payment Amount") and (B)
Selling Parties' reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs of collection
incurred by Selling Parties in enforcing their right to recover Selling Parties'
Payment Amount (such fees and other costs herein referred to as "Selling
Parties' Enforcement Costs"). In the event of such termination, Selling Parties
shall be entitled to receive the Earnest Money in payment of Selling Parties'
Payment Amount, and Buyer and Selling Parties shall cooperate in taking such
action as required under the Escrow Agreement to effect the Escrow Agent's
distribution of the Earnest Money to Selling Parties. Selling Parties shall also
be entitled to pursue any other remedy available to Selling Parties at law or in
equity to recover the entire Selling Parties' Payment Amount and Selling
Parties' Enforcement Costs, provided that the total monetary damages (including
any amount received from the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement) to which
Selling Parties shall be entitled shall not exceed the sum of Selling Parties'
Payment Amount plus Selling Parties' Enforcement Costs. BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT SELLING PARTIES' RECEIPT OF SELLING PARTIES' PAYMENT AMOUNT SHALL
CONSTITUTE EITHER PAYMENT OF LIQUIDATED DAMAGES HEREUNDER OR CONSIDERATION IN
EXCHANGE FOR SELLING PARTIES' AGREEING TO ENTER INTO A TRANSACTION WITH A PARTY
SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON CONSUMMATING THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND NOT A PENALTY, AND THAT SELLING PARTIES' PAYMENT AMOUNT
IS REASONABLE IN LIGHT OF (AND IS INTENDED TO COMPENSATE THE SELLING PARTIES
FOR) THE SUBSTANTIAL BUT INDETERMINATE HARM ANTICIPATED TO BE CAUSED BY BUYER'S
MATERIAL BREACH OR DEFAULT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE FAILURE OF THE CLOSING TO
OCCUR UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN FOREGOING CLAUSE (ii) OF THIS SECTION
10.2(c) (REGARDLESS OF WHETHER BUYER IS IN BREACH HEREUNDER), THE DIFFICULTY OF
PROOF OF LOSS AND DAMAGES, THE INCONVENIENCE AND NON-FEASIBILITY OF OTHERWISE
OBTAINING AN ADEQUATE REMEDY, AND THE VALUE OF THE TRANSACTIONS TO BE
CONSUMMATED HEREUNDER.

         10.3     TERMINATION NOTICE.

         If the terminating party is entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the Subsection of Section 10.1 specified in the termination notice,
then termination will be deemed effected pursuant to the specified Subsection
notwithstanding that termination could be effected pursuant to more than one
such Subsection.

         10.4     SELLING PARTIES AS A SINGLE PARTY.

         For purposes of this Article X, (i) no Selling Party shall in any event
constitute an "other party" in relation to any other Selling Party, (ii) all
Selling Parties shall together constitute but a single party, and (iii) any
breach of this Agreement by one Selling Party shall be deemed to constitute a
breach of this Agreement by all Selling Parties.


                                   ARTICLE XI
                              CONTROL OF STATIONS

         Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Buyer shall
not control, manage or supervise the operation of any Station or the conduct of
its business, all of which shall remain the sole responsibility and under the
control of the applicable Seller, subject to such Seller's compliance with this
Agreement.


                                   ARTICLE XII
                               EMPLOYMENT MATTERS

         12.1     TRANSFER OF EMPLOYEES.

         (a)      Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate in arranging a joint
presentation by the Chairman of Buyer and a designated representative of Sellers
to Sellers' employees promptly after the date of this Agreement. The form and
substance of the presentation shall be subject to the approval of both Sellers
and Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Upon completion of the
Closing, Buyer shall offer employment to each of the employees of the Stations
(including those on leave of absence, whether short-term, long-term, family,
maternity, disability, paid, unpaid or other, and those hired after the date
hereof in the ordinary course of business) at a comparable salary, position and
place of employment as held by each such employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date (such employees who are given and accept such offers of employment
are referred to herein as the "Transferred Employees"). Sellers agree to
cooperate fully with Buyer in connection with Buyer's offering to hire any such
employees, and Sellers shall not take any action, directly or indirectly, to
prevent any such employee from becoming employed by Buyer from and after the
Closing; provided, however, that (i)


                                       55
<PAGE>   61
prior to the earlier of the Closing Date or termination of this Agreement, Buyer
shall not employ or solicit the employment (unless conditioned upon the
occurrence of Closing) of any person employed by Sellers at a Station, (ii) all
such offers of employment shall be expressly conditioned upon the occurrence of
Closing, (iii) if this Agreement is terminated, Buyer shall not, for a period of
one year after such termination, employ or solicit the employment of any person
employed by any Seller at a Station at any time during the six-month period
preceding such termination, and (iv) Sellers shall be permitted to retain (or
have hired by an Affiliate of Sellers) any of the employees listed on Schedule
12.1(a), provided that (A) Sellers shall notify Buyer in writing prior to the
Closing Date of each such employee who accepts such an offer of Sellers (or
their Affiliates), (B) each such employee who accepts such an offer shall not be
a Transferred Employee, and (C) any employment or severance agreement covering
any such employee shall be an Excluded Asset and shall not be assigned to Buyer
or to any extent constitute an Assumed Obligation. Nothing in this Section
12.1(a) is intended to nor shall guarantee employment for any Transferred
Employee for any length of time after the Closing Date.

         (b)      Except as provided otherwise in this Article XII, Sellers
shall pay, discharge and be responsible for (i) all salary and wages arising out
of or relating to the employment of Sellers' employees prior to Closing, and
(ii) all liabilities and obligations arising under the Benefit Plans during the
period prior to Closing. Buyer shall pay, discharge and be responsible for all
salary, wages and benefits arising out of or relating to the employment of
Transferred Employees by Buyer upon or after Closing. Buyer shall be responsible
for all severance liabilities for any Transferred Employees terminated on or
after the Closing Date, including, but not limited to, any such liabilities
required to be paid pursuant to the severance agreements listed on Schedule
3.7(b).

         12.2     COBRA.

         Sellers shall comply with the provisions of the Continuation coverage
Under Group Health Plan of ERISA, Title I, Part 6, to the extent applicable in
connection with any Seller's termination of any of its employees. Buyer shall
comply with the provisions of the Continuation Coverage under Group Health Plan
of ERISA, Title I, Part 6, to the extent applicable in connection with Buyer's
termination of any of the Transferred Employees.

         12.3     BUYER'S EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

         (a)      Buyer shall cause all Transferred Employees as of the Closing
Date to be eligible to participate in its "employee welfare benefit plans" and
"employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) and 3(2) of ERISA,
respectively) of Buyer in which similarly situated employees of Buyer are
generally eligible to participate from


                                       56
<PAGE>   62
time to time ("Buyer's Plans"); provided, however, that all Transferred
Employees and their spouses and dependents shall be eligible for coverage
immediately after the Closing Date (and shall not be excluded from coverage on
account of any pre-existing condition) under those Buyer's Plans constituting
employee welfare benefit plans to the extent permitted under such plans with
respect to Transferred Employees.

         (b)      For purposes of any length-of-service requirements, waiting
period, vesting periods or differential benefits based on length of service in
any Buyer's Plan for which a Transferred Employee may be eligible after the
Closing, Buyer shall ensure that, to the extent permitted by law, such
Transferred Employee shall be given credit, in accordance with Buyer's prior
service credit policy set forth on Schedule 12.3(b), for prior service with
Sellers, any Affiliate of Sellers or any prior owner of the Stations. In
addition, to the extent permitted under Buyer's Plans, Buyer shall ensure that
each Transferred Employee receives credit under any Buyer's Plan constituting a
welfare benefit plan for any deductibles or co-payments paid by such Transferred
Employee and his or her dependents for the current plan year under the
corresponding Benefit Plan, if any, maintained by Sellers or any Affiliate of
Sellers. Buyer shall provide vacation or vacation pay (to the extent Buyer
provides vacation pay to its employees) to each Transferred Employee to the
extent Buyer has received a credit relating to such vacation for such
Transferred Employee pursuant to Section 2.7(b)(iv) in determining the
Adjustment Amount. If any Transferred Employee asserts a claim against Sellers
for accrued vacation that is the responsibility of Buyer under the foregoing
sentence, Buyer shall, to the extent of the accrued vacation credit provided to
Buyer with respect to such Transferred Employee pursuant to Section 2.7(b)(iv),
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers from and against any and all losses,
directly or indirectly, as a result of, based upon or arising from any such
claim.

         (c)      As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
make available to the Transferred Employees Buyer's 401(k) Plan in accordance
with the terms and provisions of such plan. As soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, Sellers shall (i) cause the trustee under Sellers' 401(k) Plan to
transfer to the trustee under Buyer's 401(k) Plan, in cash, all of the
Transferred Employees' individual account balances under the Sellers' 401(k)
Plan, except that to the extent such account balances consist of outstanding
plan participant loan receivables, such receivables shall be transferred to
Buyer's trustee in kind, and (ii) provide Buyer (A) a statement of the account
balances as of the Closing Date for each Transferred Employee (including the
balance of any plan participant loan receivables), (B) the documentation
evidencing, and setting forth the terms and conditions applicable to repayment
of, each plan participant loan receivable, and (C) such other information
regarding such individual accounts and plan participant loan receivables as
reasonably requested by Buyer for the administration of such accounts and
receivables under Buyer's 401(k) Plan after Closing.

         12.4     UNION EMPLOYEES.

         Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article XII, upon
consummation of the Closing, Buyer shall (i) recognize the unions and labor
organizations which are parties to the collective bargaining agreements set
forth in Schedule 3.7(b); and (ii) assume and be responsible for the liabilities
and obligations of each Seller arising under the collective bargaining
agreements listed on Schedule 3.7(b), including the Assumed Plans, but only to
the extent arising during and relating to any period on or after the Closing
Date.

         12.5     EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS.

         Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer's obligations pursuant to this
Article XII are in addition to, and not in limitation of, Buyer's assumption of
Sellers' obligations, to the extent arising during and relating to any period on
or after the Closing Date, under the written employment or talent agreements and
written severance agreements which are (i) listed on Schedule 3.7(b) or (ii)
hereafter entered into by any Seller prior to the Closing Date; provided,
however, that notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, no employment, talent or severance agreement hereafter entered into by
any Seller shall constitute a Station Agreement or an Assumed Obligation unless
approved by Buyer in writing, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.

         12.6     NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES.

         The covenants and agreements set forth in this Article XII shall be
solely for the benefit of, and shall only be enforceable by, the parties to this
Agreement and their permitted assigns. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall provide or be construed to provide
any employees of the Selling Parties with any rights under this Agreement, and
no Person, other than the parties to this Agreement, is or shall be entitled to
bring any action to enforce any provision of this Agreement.

         13.1     FURTHER ACTIONS.

         From time to time before, at and after the Closing, each party, at its
expense and without further consideration, will execute and deliver such
documents as reasonably requested by the other party in order more effectively
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

         13.2     PAYMENT OF EXPENSES.

         (a)      The fees for the HSR Filings, the fees for filing the
applications with the FCC under Section 5.4, and the Transfer Taxes payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid
fifty percent (50%) by Sellers and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer.

         (b)      Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each
of the parties shall bear its own expenses, including the fees of any attorneys
and accountants engaged by such party, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

         13.3     SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.

         Selling Parties acknowledge that the Stations are of a special, unique
and extraordinary character, and that damages alone are an inadequate remedy for
a breach of this Agreement by Selling Parties. Accordingly, as an alternative to
termination of this Agreement under Section 10.1, if Buyer is not then in
material default hereunder, Buyer shall be entitled, in the event of Selling
Parties' breach, to enforcement of this Agreement (subject to obtaining any
required approval of the FCC or the Department of Justice) by a decree of
specific performance or injunctive relief requiring Selling Parties to fulfill
their obligations under this Agreement. Such right of specific performance or
injunctive relief shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, Buyer's right to
recover damages and to pursue any other remedies available to Buyer for Selling
Parties' breach. In any action to specifically enforce Selling Parties'
obligation to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Selling
Parties shall waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law or in
equity and any requirement that Buyer prove actual damages. As a condition to
seeking specific performance, Buyer shall not be required to tender the Purchase
Price as contemplated by Section 2.5 but shall be required to demonstrate that
Buyer is ready, willing and able to tender the Purchase Price as contemplated by
such Section.

jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
