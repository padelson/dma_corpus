amended from time to time in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
"Offer") to purchase all the outstanding shares of common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock"), at a price per

Price"), net to the seller in cash, without interest, on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and in accordance with Section 251(h) of the Delaware General

the Offer, except as provided in this Agreement, shall be converted in the
Merger into the right to receive an amount equal to the Merger Consideration,
net to the seller in cash and without interest;

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree that the
Merger shall be governed by and effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL
and, subject to the terms of this Agreement, effected as soon as practicable
following the consummation (as defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) of the
Offer;

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has
unanimously (i) determined that the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "Transactions")

(ii) duly authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance by

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and
the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE OFFER

 

SECTION 1.01 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8.01_ and provided further that the Company
is prepared (in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.02(a)_), to file with the
SEC, and to disseminate to holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
the Schedule 14D-9 on the same date as Merger Sub commences the Offer,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as promptly as
practicable (but in no event later than 11 business days after the date of
this Agreement), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
commence (within the meaning of the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")) the Offer at the Offer
Price. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub
to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock
tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto (the "Offer
Conditions"). The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be at the time
that is one minute following 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on the date that is 20
business days (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the "Exchange Act")) after the date the Offer is first commenced
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act). Merger
Sub expressly reserves the right to waive, in its sole discretion, in whole or
in part, any Offer Condition or modify the terms of the Offer in any manner
not inconsistent with this Agreement, except that, without the prior written
consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit
Merger Sub to, (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) waive, amend or
modify the Minimum Tender Condition or the Termination Condition, (iv) add to
the Offer Conditions or impose any other conditions on the Offer or amend,
modify or supplement any Offer Condition in any manner adverse to the holders
of Company Common Stock, (v) except as otherwise provided in this _Section_ __
_ 1.01(a)_, terminate, or extend or otherwise amend or modify the expiration
date of, the Offer, (vi) change the form or terms of consideration payable in
the Offer, (vii) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of the
Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock or (viii)
provide any "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the
Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, (A) extend the Offer for one or more consecutive
increments of not more than ten business days each (or for such longer period
as may be agreed to by Parent and the Company), if at the scheduled expiration
date of the Offer any of the Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum Tender
Condition) shall not have been satisfied or waived, until such time as such
conditions shall have been satisfied or waived (irrespective of whether the
Minimum Tender Condition has been satisfied) and (B) extend the Offer for the
minimum period required by any rule, regulation or interpretation or position
of the SEC or the staff thereof or The Nasdaq Global Market ("Nasdaq")
applicable to the Offer; _provided_ that Merger Sub shall not be required to
extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date. In addition, if at the otherwise
scheduled expiration date of the Offer each Offer Condition (other than the
Minimum Tender Condition) shall have been satisfied or waived and the Minimum
Tender Condition shall not have been satisfied, Merger Sub may elect to (and
if so requested by the Company, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to), extend the Offer for one or more consecutive increments of
such duration as requested by the Company but not more than ten business days
each (or for such longer period as may be agreed to by Parent and the
Company); _provided_ that the Company shall not request Merger Sub to, and
Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer
pursuant to this sentence on more than three occasions; _provided_ , _further_
, that Merger Sub shall not, and shall not be required to extend the Offer
beyond the Outside Date. On the terms and subject only to the conditions of
the Offer and this Agreement,

 



2

    

 Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment,
and pay for, all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Merger Sub becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable after the expiration
of the Offer (which shall be the next business day after the expiration of the
Offer absent extenuating circumstances) and, in any event, no more than three
business days after the expiration of the Offer. The time at which Merger Sub
first irrevocably accepts for purchase the shares of Company Common Stock
tendered in the Offer is referred to as the "Offer Closing Time". The Offer
may not be terminated or withdrawn prior to its expiration date (as such
expiration date may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this 
_Section_ __ _ 1.01(a)_), unless this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.01_. If this Agreement is validly terminated
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.01_, Merger Sub shall promptly terminate
the Offer and return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of
Merger Sub to return, all tendered shares of Company Common Stock to the
registered holders thereof. Nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _
1.01(a)_ shall affect any termination rights set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.01_.

 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of
the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which shall include an
offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary
advertisement containing the terms set forth in this Agreement and  _Exhibit
A_ hereto (such Schedule TO, as amended from time to time, and the documents
included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any
supplements or amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents") and (ii)
disseminate the Offer Documents to the holders of Company Common Stock as and
to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities Law. The Company
shall furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the
Company required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents.
Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and to correct any material omissions therefrom, and each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer
Documents and to cause the Offer Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to
be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock,
in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Law. Parent and
Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any
written comments, and shall inform the Company and its counsel of any oral
comments, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of
such comments. Except from and after an Adverse Recommendation Change, prior
to the filing of the Offer Documents (including any amendment or supplement
thereto) with the SEC or the dissemination thereof to the holders of Company
Common Stock, or responding to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub shall (x) provide the
Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
Offer Documents or response (it being understood that the Company and its
counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as reasonably practicable)
and (y) give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by
the Company or its counsel. Parent and Merger Sub shall respond promptly to
any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents.

(c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that
Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

 

(d) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Offer Closing Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted.

 



3

    

SECTION 1.02 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company
shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, as amended from time to
time, together with any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the
"Schedule 14D-9"), including a description of the Company Board Recommendation
(subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.02)_ and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9
to the holders of Company Common Stock, as and to the extent required by
applicable U.S. federal securities Law. The Schedule 14D-9 shall also
contain the notice of appraisal rights required to be delivered by the
Company under Section 262(d) of the DGCL at the time the Company first files
the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC and the fairness opinion delivered by
Goldman, Sachs and Co. LLC (together with a description of such firms related
analyses). Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish to the Company all information
concerning Parent and Merger Sub required by applicable Law to be set forth
in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and to correct any material omissions
therefrom, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or
supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so amended
or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of
Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable Law. The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with copies
of any written comments, and shall inform Parent and its counsel of any oral
comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such
comments. Except from and after an Adverse Recommendation Change or in
connection with any disclosures made in compliance with  _Section_ __ _
5.02_, prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment or
supplement thereto) with the SEC or the dissemination thereof to the holders
of Company Common Stock, or responding to any comments of the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall (x) provide Parent
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such Schedule 14D-9 or response (it being understood that Parent and its
counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as reasonably practicable)
and (y) give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by
Parent or its counsel. The Company shall respond promptly to any comments of
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9. The Company hereby
consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of a description of the
Company Board Recommendation (except to the extent that the Company Board
shall have withdrawn or modified the Company Board Recommendation in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.02(b)_).

 

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer
agent to promptly furnish Parent or Merger Sub with mailing labels containing
the names and addresses of the record holders of shares of Company Common
Stock as of the most recent practicable date preceding the date on which the
Offer is commenced and of those Persons becoming record holders subsequent to
such date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security
position listings, computer files and all other information in the Companys
possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of shares of Company
Common Stock, and shall furnish to Parent or Merger Sub such information and
reasonable assistance (including updated lists of stockholders, security
position listings and computer files) as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably
request in communicating the Offer and disseminating the Offer Documents to
the Companys stockholders. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and
except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and
any other documents necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and
Merger Sub shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such
labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with
the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall,
upon request, deliver to the Company or destroy (and shall direct their agents
to deliver to the Company or destroy) all copies of such information (and
certify in writing to the Company such destruction, if applicable).

Effective Time, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may
be. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each
director of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to execute and
deliver a letter effectuating his or her resignation as a member of the
Company Board, to be effective as of the Effective Time.

 

(b) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

 

SECTION 2.08 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock that (i) is owned by the Company or the Company
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) was owned by Parent,
Merger Sub or any subsidiary of Parent at the commencement of the Offer and is
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to
the Effective Time or (iii) was irrevocably accepted for purchase in the Offer
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in
exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of other Company Common Stock_. Subject to
_Sections 2.08(b)_ and _2.08(d)_ , each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price in cash and without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), less any
applicable tax withholding. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.09_, without interest.

 

(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares ("Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.08(c)_, but instead, at the
Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of
Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto except
the right to payment of the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance
with Section 262; _provided_ that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 with respect to such Appraisal Shares or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holders Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to
have become

 



6

    

 exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.08(c)_, without interest. The Company shall give
prompt written notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in, and direct all negotiations and Proceedings with
respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Prior to the
Offer Closing Time, Parent shall not, except with the prior written consent
of the Company, require the Company to make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 

SECTION 2.09 _Payment of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying
agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration to
former holders of Company Common Stock. Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, deposit with the Paying Agent, at or immediately
after the Effective Time, cash necessary to pay the Merger Consideration in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive cash pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.08(c)_ (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Fund").

(b) _Payment Procedure_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event later than three business days after the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") that were converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.08_ (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form
and have such other provisions as are customary and reasonably acceptable to
the Company and Parent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
a Certificate to the Paying Agent for cancelation, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of
cash into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by
such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
2.08_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.09_, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without interest,
into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate have been converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.08_. No interest
shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

 

(c) _Treatment of Book-Entry Shares_. No holder of record of Book-Entry
Shares shall be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration in respect
of such Book-Entry Shares. In lieu thereof, such holder of record shall upon
receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in customary form (or
such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), be
entitled to receive, and the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the

 



7

    

 Effective Time (but in no event later than three business days after the
Effective Time to each such holder of record as of the Effective Time), an
amount of U.S. dollars equal to the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration,
without interest and less any applicable tax withholding, to which such holder
is entitled hereunder, and such Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be canceled.
Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall
only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered.

 

(d) _Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted.

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ as a
result of the conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Common Stock. After the Effective Time there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for any reason, such Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this  _Article II_.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. Notwithstanding the
requirements to surrender a Certificate contained in _Section_ __ _ 2.09_,
if any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of such shares, without interest and less any applicable tax
withholding.

(g) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (and
any interest or other income earned thereon) that remains undistributed as of
the six-month anniversary of the Merger Closing Date shall be delivered to
Parent or its designated affiliate, upon demand, and any former holder of
Company Common Stock entitled to payment of Merger Consideration who has not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent or any successor-in-interest of Parent for payment of its claim for
Merger Consideration (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and
other similar Law).

 

(h) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has
not been surrendered prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately
prior to such date become the property of the Surviving Corporation or its
designated affiliate, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such
holders or their successors, assigns or personal representative previously
entitled thereto, subject to the claims of any former holder of Company
Common Stock entitled to payment of Merger Consideration who has not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_.

 



8

    

(i) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Payment Fund shall be invested by
the Paying Agent as directed by Parent. Nothing contained in this _Section_ __
_ 2.09(i)_ and no investment losses resulting from the investment of the
Payment Fund shall diminish the rights of the stockholders of the Company to
receive the Merger Consideration. To the extent there are losses or the
Payment Fund for any reason (including Appraisal Shares losing their status as
such) is less than the level required to promptly pay the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.08(c)_, Parent shall replace, restore or add to
the cash in the Payment Fund to ensure the prompt payment of the Merger
Consideration. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be the property of, and paid to, Parent or its designated affiliate.

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the Offer such amounts
as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Amounts so deducted
or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made.

 

SECTION 2.10 _Equity Awards_.

 

(a) As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Stock
Option that is then outstanding but not then vested or exercisable shall
become immediately vested and exercisable in full. At the Effective Time, each
Company Stock Option that is then outstanding shall be canceled and the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash without interest, less
any applicable tax withholding, equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Stock Option
by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company
Stock Option (such amount, the "Company Stock Option Cash Consideration"). Any
Company Stock Option that has an exercise price that equals or exceeds
the Merger Consideration shall be canceled for no consideration. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Company Stock Option Cash
Consideration at or reasonably promptly after the Effective Time (but in no
event later than five business days after the Effective Time).

(b) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall
take all actions with respect to the Company ESPP that are necessary to
provide that (i) with respect to the offering period under the Company ESPP in
effect as of the date hereof, if any (the "ESPP Offering Period"), no
individual who was not a participant in the Company ESPP as of the date
hereof may enroll in the Company ESPP with respect to such ESPP Offering
Period and no participant may increase the percentage amount of his or her
payroll deduction election from that in effect on the date hereof for such
ESPP Offering Period, (ii) no new offering period shall be commenced under the
Company ESPP prior to the Effective Time, (iii) immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the Company ESPP shall terminate and (iv) if the applicable
purchase date with respect to the ESPP Offering Period would otherwise occur
on or after the Offer Closing Time, then the ESPP Offering Period will be
shortened and the applicable purchase date with respect to the ESPP Offering
Period will occur on the day immediately preceding the date on which the Offer
Closing Time occurs.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof administering any Company Stock Plan or the Company ESPP)
shall adopt such resolutions or take such action by written consent in lieu of
a meeting, providing for the transactions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
2.10_. The Company shall provide that, on and following the Effective Time,
no holder of any Company Stock Option shall have the right to acquire any
equity interest in the Company or the Surviving Corporation in respect thereof
and each Company Stock Plan shall terminate as of the Effective Time and no
participant in the Company ESPP shall have any further right under the Company
ESPP.

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Other than the capital stock owned by the Company, there are no

subsisting and in full force and effect and (y) all necessary registration,
maintenance, renewal and other relevant filing fees due through the date of

sublicense or otherwise possesses legally enforceable rights to use all
Intellectual Property used in or necessary to the conduct of its business as
presently conducted by Company (the "Company Intellectual Property"), free and
clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens; however, with respect to
Company Intellectual Property owned by a third party, limited to Liens granted
by the Company); _provided_ that this sentence shall not be construed as a
representation or warranty of non-infringement. For the avoidance of doubt, to
the extent that the Company has been granted exclusive licenses to Patents
owned by a third party, such licenses are Material Contracts and the Company
has made available to Parent copies of all such licenses, including any
amendments thereto. No third party has any joint ownership in any inventions
claimed by any issued Patents or pending claims in any applications for
Patents included in the Company Registered Intellectual Property.

(c) The Company has diligently prepared or is diligently preparing to
file patent applications for all potentially patentable inventions within the

decided not to file or has decided to defer filing, a patent application on a
potentially patentable invention. Except for such non-compliance that,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, each of the Company

 



27

    

 and the Company Subsidiary has complied with all Laws regarding the duty of
disclosure, candor and good faith in connection with each Patent included in
the Company Registered Intellectual Property. Except as has not had, and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a

expected to render any Patent contained in the Company Registered Intellectual
Property unenforceable or unpatentable.

(d) To the knowledge of the Company, (i) the conduct of the business of the
Company and the Company Subsidiary as presently conducted has not infringed,
misappropriated or otherwise violated, and is not infringing, misappropriating
or otherwise violating any Intellectual Property rights of any third party,
and (ii) no third party has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated,
or is infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any of the Company
Registered Intellectual Property or other material Company Intellectual
Property owned or purported to be owned by the Company and no such claims
have been made against any third party by the Company; except, in each case
(clauses (i) and (ii)), for infringements and other violations that have not
had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 3.18(e)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, as of the date of this Agreement, there is no action
pending, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the Company
or the Company Subsidiary (other than, for clarity, office actions initiated
by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or any foreign equivalent), and,
neither the Company nor the Company Subsidiary has received any written notice
from any Person since January 1, 2013, in each case, pursuant to which any
Person is (i) alleging that the conduct of the business of the Company or the
Company Subsidiary as presently conducted is infringing, misappropriating or
otherwise violating any Intellectual Property rights of any third party, or
(ii) contesting the use, ownership, validity or enforceability of any of the
Company Intellectual Property owned or purported to be owned by the Company;
except, in each case (clauses (i) and (ii)), as has not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. None of the material Company Intellectual
Property owned or purported to be owned by the Company is subject in any
material respect to any pending or outstanding Judgment that adversely
restricts the use, transfer or registration of, or adversely affects the
validly or enforceability of, any such Company Intellectual Property.

 

(f) No past or present director, officer, employee, consultant or
independent contractor of the Company or the Company Subsidiary owns (or has
any claim, or any right (whether or not currently exercisable) to any
ownership interest, in or to) any Company Intellectual Property owned or
purported to be owned by the Company. The Company has executed valid
and enforceable written agreements with each of its past and present
directors, officers, employees, consultants and independent contractors who
are engaged in creating or developing for the Company or any material Company
Intellectual Property in the course of such Persons employment or retention
thereby, pursuant to which such Person has (i) agreed to hold all confidential
information of the Company in confidence and (ii) presently assigned to the
Company or all of such Persons rights, title and interest in and to all
Intellectual Property created or developed for the Company in the course of
such Persons employment or retention thereby. There is no material uncured
breach by the Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, the counterparty,
under any such agreement.

secrecy and confidentiality of all material Trade Secrets included in the

No Trade Secret that is material to the business of the Company as presently
conducted has been authorized to be disclosed, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, has been disclosed to any of the Companys or the Company
Subsidiarys past or present employees or any third person, other than
pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement restricting the disclosure and use of
such Trade Secret.

 



28

    

(h) No funding, facilities or personnel of any Governmental Entity or any
university, college, research institute or other educational institution has
been or is being used in any material respect to create, in whole or in part,
any material Company Intellectual Property, except for any such funding or use
of facilities or personnel that does not result in such Governmental Entity
or educational institution obtaining ownership of, or use rights to (except
for use rights during the term of the applicable agreement between the Company
and such Governmental Entity), Company Intellectual Property owned or
purported to be owned by the Company, or does not require or otherwise
obligate the Company to grant or offer to any such Governmental Entity or
educational institution any license or other right to such Company
Intellectual Property owned or purported to be owned by the Company (except
for use rights during the term of the applicable agreement between the Company
and such Governmental Entity). No current or former employee, consultant
or independent contractor of the Company or the Company Subsidiary who
contributed to the creation or development of the Company Intellectual
Property owned or purported to be owned by the Company has, to the knowledge
of the Company, performed services for a Governmental Entity or any
university, college, research institute or other educational institution
related to the Companys or the Company Subsidiarys business as presently
conducted during a period of time during which such employee, consultant or
independent contractor was also performing services for the Company or the
Company Subsidiary.

of its business as presently conducted by Company, (ii) in the last 12 months
prior to the date of this Agreement, there have been no failures, breakdowns,

Systems or the conduct of the business of the Company as presently conducted,
and (iii) to the knowledge of the Company, in the 12 months prior to the date
of this Agreement, there have not been any incidents of unauthorized access or
other security breaches of the Company Systems.

 

(j) Except as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation
of the Transactions will not (i) result in the breach of, or create on behalf
of any third party the right to terminate or modify (x) any agreement
relating to any Company Intellectual Property owned or purported to be owned
by or exclusively licensed to the Company or (y) any agreement as to which the
Company is a party and pursuant to which the Company is authorized to use any
Intellectual Property of any third party that is material to the business of
the Company as presently conducted, excluding in each case generally
commercially available, off-the-shelf software programs available at a cost of
not more than $100,000 annually, (ii) result in or require the grant,
assignment or transfer to any other Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their respective affiliates) of any license or other right or

following the date of this Agreement.

the extent the concept is recognized by such jurisdiction) and has full
corporate power and authority to conduct its businesses as presently
conducted. 

SECTION 4.02 _Merger Sub_.

 

(a) Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of entering into the
Transactions, and since the date of its incorporation, Merger Sub has not

following the execution of this Agreement). The execution and delivery by
each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by it of
the Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action
on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, subject, in the case of the Merger, to
the adoption of this Agreement by Parent, as sole stockholder of Merger Sub
(which shall occur immediately following the execution of this Agreement).
Neither the approval and adoption of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions requires any approval of the
stockholders of Parent. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has duly executed and
delivered this Agreement, and, assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Company, this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and
binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms
(subject to Bankruptcy, Equity and Indemnity Exception).

Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof will not, conflict with, or
result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, any provision of (i) the organizational documents of
Parent, Merger Sub or any of Parents subsidiaries, (ii) any Contract to which
Parent or any of its subsidiaries is party or by which any of their respective

respect to Parent or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions, other than (i) compliance with and filings under the HSR Act,

compliance with the rules and regulations of any national security exchange on

SECTION 4.05 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents or the Schedule 14D-9 will,
at the time such document is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or
supplemented or at the time it is first published, sent or given to the
Companys stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The
Offer Documents will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder,
except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub
with respect to statements included or incorporated by reference therein based
on information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein.

other Person, other than Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., the fees and expenses
of which will be paid by Parent, is entitled to any brokers, finders,
financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with the
Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of Parent or any of its affiliates, directors, officers or
employees.

SECTION 4.07 _Litigation_. There is no Proceeding pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any subsidiary of Parent
that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any Judgment outstanding against
Parent or any subsidiary of Parent that would reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

quoted terms are defined under Section 203 of the DGCL). As of the date
hereof, Parent, Merger Sub and its affiliates collectively own no shares of
Company Common Stock directly (other than through passive investments, pension
or employee benefit plans or trusts for Parents or its affiliates
employees, or limited partnership funds, mutual funds or similar entities that
Parent has invested in, in all cases that Parent and its affiliates do not
directly or indirectly control the management or policies thereof). Merger
Sub does not own any shares of Company Common Stock.

SECTION 4.09 _Available Funds_. At the expiration of the Offer and the
Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub will have available all of the funds
necessary for the acquisition of all shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to the Offer and the Merger, as the case may be, to pay all fees and expenses
in connection therewith, to make payments pursuant to Section 2.10 and to
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement. Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledge and agree that their obligations hereunder are not subject to
any conditions regarding Parents, Merger Subs or any other Persons ability
to obtain financing for the consummation of the Transactions.

connection with or in response to any inquiry, offer or proposal that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover
Proposal (other than, solely in response to an inquiry that did not result
from or arise in connection with a material breach of this  _Section_ __ _
5.02(a)_, to refer the inquiring person to this _Section_ __ _ 5.02_ and to

and negotiations regarding any inquiry, proposal or offer pending on the date
of this Agreement that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead

Agreement, at any time prior to the Offer Closing Time, in response to a

a material breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.02(a)_, in the event that the
Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor, that such Company Takeover Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Company
Proposal (a "Qualifying Company Takeover Proposal"), the Company may (A)
furnish information with respect to the Company to the Person or group of
Persons making such Qualifying Company Takeover Proposal and its or their
Representatives pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement so long as
the Company concurrently or promptly thereafter provides Parent, in accordance
with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, any material non-public
information with respect to the Company furnished to such other Person or
group of Persons that was not previously furnished to Parent and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person or group of
Persons and its or their Representatives regarding such Qualifying Company
Takeover Proposal (including soliciting the making of a revised Qualifying
Company Takeover Proposal); _provided_ that the Company may only take the
actions described in clauses (A) or (B) above if the Company Board determines,
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to
take any such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not
to, release any Person from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or
grant permission under or fail to enforce, any standstill provision in
any agreement to which the Company is a party; _provided_ that, if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may waive any such
standstill provision solely to the extent necessary to permit the applicable
Person (if such Person has not been solicited in breach of this _Section_ __ _
5.02_) to make, on a confidential basis to the Company Board, a Company
Takeover

 



36

    

 Proposal, conditioned upon such Person agreeing that the Company shall not
be prohibited from providing any information to Parent (including regarding
any such Company Takeover Proposal) in accordance with, and otherwise
complying with, this _Section_ __ _ 5.02_.

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) fail
to make, withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger
Sub, or propose publicly to fail to make, withdraw, qualify or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation or
resolve or agree to take any such action, (B) adopt, endorse, approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to adopt, endorse, approve or recommend, any
Company Takeover Proposal or resolve or agree to take any such action, (C)
publicly make any recommendation in connection with a tender offer or exchange
offer (other than the Offer) other than a recommendation against such offer or
(D) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9
when disseminated to the Companys stockholders (any action described in this
clause (i) being referred to herein as an "Adverse Recommendation Change")
or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or
authorize, cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
option agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other agreement relating to or that would reasonably be expected
to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with _Section_ __ _
5.02(a)_), or resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any such action.
Notwithstanding anything to contrary in the foregoing or any other provision
of this Agreement, (x) the Company Board may, in response to an Intervening
Event, take any of the actions specified in clause (A) or (D) of the
definition of Adverse Recommendation Change (an "Intervening Event Adverse
Recommendation Change") if the Company Board reasonably determines, in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law
and (y) if the Company Board receives a Superior Company Proposal that did
not result from or arise in connection with a material breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.02_, the Company may make an Adverse Recommendation Change,
and may terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.01(g)_ in
order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the Superior
Company Proposal in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.04_; _provided_ that,
prior to so making an Intervening Event Adverse Recommendation Change or an
Adverse Recommendation Change, or so terminating this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(g)_, (1) the Company Board shall have given Parent at
least four business days prior written notice (a "Company Notice") of its
intention to take such action and a description of the reasons for taking such
action (which Company Notice, in respect of a Superior Company Proposal, shall
specify the identity of the Person who made such Superior Company Proposal
and all of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Company Proposal
and attach the most current version of the relevant transaction agreement and
which Company Notice, in respect of an Intervening Event, shall specify a
reasonably detailed description of the underlying facts giving rise to such
action), (2) the Company shall have negotiated, and shall have caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith, with Parent during such notice
period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to revise
the terms of this Agreement in such a manner that would eliminate the need for
taking such action (and in respect of a Superior Company Proposal, would
cause such Superior Company Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Company Proposal), (3) following the end of such notice period, the Company
Board shall have considered in good faith any revisions to this Agreement
irrevocably committed to in writing by Parent, and shall have determined in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to effect
such Intervening Event Adverse Recommendation Change or Adverse Recommendation
Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law
and, with respect to a Superior Company Proposal, that such Superior Company
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Company Proposal and (4) in the
event of any change to any of the financial terms (including the form and
amount of consideration) of such Superior Company Proposal, the Company shall,
in each case, deliver to Parent an additional Company Notice consistent with
that described in clause (1) of this proviso and a renewed notice period
under clause (1) of this proviso shall commence (except that the four-
business-day notice period referred to in clause (1) of this proviso shall
instead be 

 



37

    

 equal to two business days) during which time the Company shall be required
to comply with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 5.02(b)_ anew with
respect to such additional Company Notice, including clauses (1) through (4)
of this proviso.

(c) Nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.02_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders), including making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to
the stockholders of the Company or (ii) making any disclosure to its
stockholders if the Company Board determines, in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or applicable Law; _provided_ that
any such action that would otherwise constitute an Adverse Recommendation
Change shall be made only in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 5.02(b)_.

(d) In addition to the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.02_, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable and
in any event within one business day after receipt thereof, advise Parent
in writing of (i) any Company Takeover Proposal or any request for
information or inquiry, proposal or offer that the Company Board in good faith
believes could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal
and (ii) the material terms and conditions of such Company Takeover Proposal
or inquiry, proposal or offer (including any subsequent amendments or
modifications thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such Company
Takeover Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer. Commencing upon the
provision of any notice referred to above, the Company and its Representatives
shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis as to any material
developments with respect to any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry,
proposal or offer (and any subsequent amendments or modifications thereto).

value thereof, as determined by the Company Board) of the assets of the
Company and the Company Subsidiary, taken as a whole or (B) 20% or more of the
aggregate voting power of the capital stock of the Company, (ii) any tender
offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, binding share

beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the aggregate

the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving
entity, other than, in each case, the Transactions or (iii) any combination

counsel and its independent financial advisor, are more favorable to the
stockholders of the Company than the Transactions, taking into account all
the terms and conditions (including all financial, regulatory, financing,
conditionality, legal and other terms and conditions) of such proposal and
this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent and any fees to be paid by the Company for terminating this
Agreement).

Wherever the term "group" is used in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.02(e)_, it is
used as defined in Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act.

 

ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

SECTION 6.01 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Except if prohibited by
any applicable Law, the Company shall afford to Parent and to Parents
Representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours (under the
supervision of appropriate personnel and in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the business of
the Company) during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination
of this Agreement to all of its properties, books and records, Contracts and
personnel and, during such period, the Company shall furnish, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, to Parent all information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ that any
such access shall be afforded and any such information shall be furnished at
Parents expense. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the
Company shall not be required to afford access or furnish information to the
extent (a) such information is subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement, (b) such information relates to the applicable portions of the
minutes of the meetings of the Company Board (including any presentations or
other materials prepared by or for the Company Board) where the Company Board
discussed (i) the Transactions or any similar transaction involving the sale
of the Company, or a material portion of its assets, to, or combination of the
Company with, any other Person, (ii) any Company Takeover Proposal or (iii)
any Intervening Event, or (c) the Company determines in good faith after
consulting with counsel that affording such access or furnishing such
information would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
Company, violate applicable Law or result in antitrust risk for the Company;
_provided_ that the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any
required consents for the disclosure of such information and take such other
reasonable action (including entering into a joint defense agreement or
similar arrangement to avoid loss of attorney-client privilege) with respect
to such information as is necessary to permit disclosure to Parent. All
information exchanged pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ shall be
subject to the confidentiality letter agreement dated December 22, 2018
between the Company and Parent, as amended (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

 

SECTION 6.02 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties shall, and shall cause their respective
subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or cause to

cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, including (i)
the obtaining of all necessary or advisable actions or non-actions, waivers

to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company
and the Company Board shall (A) take all action necessary to ensure that no
restrictions on business combinations of any Takeover Law or similar statute
or regulation is or becomes applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement
and (B) if the restrictions on business combinations of any Takeover Law or
similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to any Transaction or this
Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to
ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect
of such statute or regulation on the Transactions and this Agreement.Each of
Parent and the Company shall not, and shall not permit their respective
subsidiaries to, enter into or consummate any transaction, agreement,
arrangement, or acquisition of any ownership interest or assets of any Person,
the effect of which would reasonably be expected to impair, materially delay
or prevent any required approvals, or expiration of the waiting period, under
the HSR Act, or require any approvals or filings under any Foreign Antitrust
Laws.

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall, or shall cause their ultimate parent
entity as that term is defined in the HSR Act to, in consultation and
cooperation with the other, file (i) with the United States Federal Trade
Commission (the "FTC") and the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ")
the notification and report form, if any, required under the HSR Act for the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions as promptly as practicable
(but in no event later than nine business days after the date of this
Agreement) and (ii) all appropriate filings, notices, applications or similar
documents required under any Foreign Antitrust Law applicable to the
Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable. Parent shall, with the
Companys reasonable cooperation, file all appropriate filings,
notices, applications or similar documents required under any Foreign
Antitrust Law applicable to the Transactions as promptly as reasonably
practicable. Any such filings shall be in substantial compliance with the
requirements of the HSR Act or the applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws, as the
case may be. Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) furnish to the other
party such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other party
may request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission
which is necessary under the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law, (ii) give
the other party reasonable prior notice of any such filings or submissions
and, to the extent reasonably practicable, of any communication with, and any
inquiries or requests for additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ and
any other Governmental Entity regarding the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other Transactions, and permit the other party (or its outside counsel if
necessary to retain confidentiality) to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of, and permit the participation of, the
other party in connection with, any such filings, submissions, communications,
inquiries or requests, (iii) unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the
applicable Governmental Entity, and to the extent reasonably practicable, (A)
not participate in or attend any meeting, or engage in any substantive
conversation, with any Governmental Entity in respect of the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other Transactions without the other party, (B) give the
other party reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or conversation, (C)
in the event one party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable
Governmental Entity from participating in or attending any such meeting or
engaging in any such conversation, keep such party apprised with respect
thereto, (D) cooperate with one another in the filing of any substantive
memoranda, white papers, filings, correspondence or other written
communications explaining or defending this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger
or any of the other Transactions, articulating any regulatory or competitive
argument or responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental
Entity and (E) furnish the other party with copies of all filings,
submissions, correspondence and communications (and memoranda setting forth
the substance thereof) between it and 

 



40

    

 its affiliates and their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and
any Governmental Entity or members of any Governmental Entitys staff, on the
other hand, with respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions and (iv) comply with any inquiry or request from the FTC,
the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity as promptly as reasonably
practicable. Any such additional information shall be in substantial
compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act or the applicable Foreign
Antitrust Law, as the case may be. The parties agree not to extend, directly
or indirectly, any waiting period under the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust
Law or enter into any agreement with a Governmental Entity to delay or not to
consummate the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, except with
the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Party shall provide to the other (or the others respective advisors) upon
request copies of all correspondence between such Party and any Governmental
Entity relating to the Transactions. The Parties may, as they deem advisable
and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the
other under this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ as "outside counsel only." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the
advance written consent of the Party providing such materials.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub agree to take promptly any and all steps
necessary to avoid, eliminate or resolve each and every impediment and obtain
all clearances, consents, approvals and waivers under the HSR Act or any
Foreign Antitrust Law that may be required by any Governmental Entity, so as
to enable the parties to close the Transactions as promptly as practicable
(and in any event by or before the Outside Date); _provided,_ however that
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any
obligation to (or to cause any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates
or the Company to): (i) sell, license, divest or dispose of or hold separate
the assets, Intellectual Property or businesses of any entity, (ii)
terminate, amend or assign any existing relationships or contractual rights or
obligations of any entity, (iii) change or modify any course of conduct
regarding future operations of any entity, (iv) otherwise take any action
that would limit the freedom of action with respect to, or the ability to
retain, one or more businesses, assets or rights of any entity or interests
therein or (v) commit to take any such action in the foregoing clause (i),
(ii), (iii) or (iv);  _provided,_ however that Parent and Merger Sub shall
take the actions in the foregoing clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) with respect
to the Company (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) if such action (A) is necessary to obtain required clearances or
waiting period expirations or terminations as may be required under the HSR
Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law by or before the Outside Date and (B) would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be
materially detrimental to the benefits to be derived by Parent and its
affiliates as a result of the Transactions. In addition, the Company shall not
offer or commit to take any of the actions referred to in clause (i), (ii),
(iii) or (iv) of the immediately preceding sentence without Parents prior
written consent. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not require the
Company to, and the Company shall not be required to, take any action with
respect to any Judgment or any applicable Law that binds the Company prior to
the Effective Time.

SECTION 6.03 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time (the
"Continuation Period"), Parent shall provide or cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide to each individual who is employed by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continues employment with
Parent or the Surviving Corporation (each, a "Company Employee") (i) a base
salary and target cash incentive opportunity that, in each case, is no less
favorable than those provided to such Company Employee by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits (excluding
cash incentive opportunities, equity and equity-based awards and change in
control plans, programs and arrangements) that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to those provided to such Company Employee by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
during

 



41

    

 the Continuation Period, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide any Company Employee who experiences a termination of
employment under the circumstances set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.03(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter with severance benefits no less favorable than
those set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.03(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
subject to the Company Employees execution of a general release of claims.

(b) Following the Continuation Period, the Company Employees shall be
eligible to participate in the plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
their respective affiliates (the "Surviving Corporation Plans"), to the same
extent as other similarly-situated employees of Parent and its affiliates. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, following the
Effective Time, each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all Surviving Corporation
Plans to the extent coverage under any such plan replaces coverage under a
comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participates
immediately prior to the Effective Time. This Section 6.03 shall not be
interpreted to require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective
affiliates to duplicate any benefits that are provided under a Company Benefit
Plan or Company Benefit Agreement following the Effective Time.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to include each Company Employee in the
applicable 2019 annual bonus plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
following the Effective Time (and in the case of Parents 2019 annual bonus
plan, on a basis consistent with similarly-situated employees of Parent) with
such participation commencing as of January 1, 2019.

(d) Without limiting the generality of  _Section_ __ _ 6.03(a)_, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to assume, honor and continue the Company Benefit Plans and
Company Benefit Agreements in accordance with their respective terms as in
effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that this
_Section_ __ _ 6.03(d)_ shall not limit the ability of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to amend, modify or terminate any such
Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement in accordance with its terms
as in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(e) With respect to Surviving Corporation Plans, including any "employee
benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by Parent or
any of its subsidiaries to provide benefits for vacation, paid time-off,
severance or 401(k) savings, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits and vesting, each Company Employees service
with the Company (as well as service with any predecessor employer of the
Company, to the extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized by
the Company) shall be treated as service with Parent or any of its
subsidiaries; _provided_ that the foregoing service recognition shall not
apply (i) to the extent that it would result in duplication of benefits for
the same period of services or (ii) to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan
or that provides benefits to a grandfathered employee population.

(f) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries in which any Company Employee is eligible to participate after
the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible
dependents and beneficiaries, to the extent such limitations were waived,
satisfied or did not apply to such employees or eligible dependents or
beneficiaries under the corresponding welfare Company Benefit Plan in which
such employees participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide Company Employees and their
eligible dependents and beneficiaries with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under any Company Benefit Plan
in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket maximum

 



42

    

 requirements for the year in which the Effective Time occurs and (iii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to waive any waiting period or evidence of
insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Company
Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after the Effective Time, in
each case to the extent such Company Employee or eligible dependent had
satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Company
Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time.

(g) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time
to which any Company Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or
vacation policies applicable to such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, as
applicable (and without duplication of benefits), assume the liability for
such accrued personal, sick or vacation time and allow such Company Employee
to use such accrued personal, sick or vacation time in accordance with the
practice and policies of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as they may be
amended from time to time.

(h) The Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall discuss in
good faith the potential tax consequences of Section 280G of the Code on any
individual that is regarded as a "disqualified individual" (as such term is
defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1).

(i) The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ are solely for the
benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section_
__ _ 6.03_ shall (i) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Company
Employee or any other Person (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof)
in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under
any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or any Surviving
Corporation Plan or other employee program or any plan or arrangement of
Parent or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) be construed to modify, amend or
establish any benefit plan, program or arrangement or (iii) in any way affect
the ability of the parties hereto or any other Person to modify, amend or
terminate any of its benefit plans, programs or arrangements. Nothing in this
Agreement shall confer upon any director, employee or service provider of the
Company any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere
with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
any subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services
of any director, employee or individual service provider of the Company at
any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.

 

SECTION 6.04 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and rights to
advancement of expenses) now existing in favor of any Person who is or prior
to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement, a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a
fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company or its
predecessors (each, an "Indemnified Party") as provided in the Company
Charter, the Company Bylaws or any indemnification agreement between
such Indemnified Party and the Company that is in effect as of the date of
this Agreement and that has been made available to Parent (i) shall be assumed
by the Surviving Corporation, without further action, at the Effective Time,
(ii) shall survive the Merger, (iii) shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms with respect to any claims against any such
Indemnified Party arising out of such acts or omissions and (iv) for a period
of six years following the date of this Agreement, shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any
right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party. Parent shall ensure that the
Surviving Corporation complies with and honors the foregoing obligations.

(b) Without limiting _Section_ __ _ 6.04(a)_ or any rights of any
Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification agreement, from and after
the Offer Closing Time, in the event of any threatened or actual Proceeding,
whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole

 



43

    

 or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that an Indemnified Party
is or was a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a fiduciary
with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, the Company
Subsidiary or any of their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or
any of the Transactions, whether in any case asserted or arising before or
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each such
Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any Proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law upon receipt of any undertaking required by
applicable Law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in
connection with any such threatened or actual Proceeding. The Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with an Indemnified Party in the defense of any
matter for which such Indemnified Party could seek indemnification hereunder;
_provided_ that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
assume the defense and appoint lead counsel for such defense, except to the
extent otherwise provided in an indemnification agreement set forth in the
Company Disclosure Letter. The Surviving Corporation shall not settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual
Proceeding for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party
hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in advance in
writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. The
Surviving Corporations obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.04(b)_ shall
continue in full force and effect for the period beginning upon the Offer
Closing Time and ending six years from the Effective Time; _provided_ that
all rights to indemnification in respect of any Proceeding asserted or made
within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such
Proceeding. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform its
obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.04(b)_.

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, following good-faith consultation
with Parent and utilizing Parents insurance broker, the Company may obtain
and fully pay the premium for, "tail" directors and officers liability
insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions)
for the period beginning upon the Offer Closing Time and ending six years
from the Effective Time, covering each Indemnified Party and containing terms
(including with respect to coverage and amounts) and conditions (including
with respect to deductibles and exclusions) that are in the aggregate, no less
favorable to any Indemnified Party than those of the Companys directors and
officers liability insurance policies in effect on the date of this Agreement
(the "Existing DandO Policies"); _provided_ that the maximum aggregate annual
premium for such "tail" insurance policies shall not exceed 250% of the
aggregate annual premium payable by the Company for coverage for its current
fiscal year under the Existing DandO Policies (such annual premium being
set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.04(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter). If
such "tail" insurance policies have been obtained by the Company, Parent shall
cause such "tail" insurance policies to be maintained in full force and
effect, for their full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be
honored by it and the Surviving Corporation. In the event the Company does not
obtain such "tail" insurance policies, then, for the period beginning upon
the Offer Closing Time and ending six years from the Effective Time, Parent
shall either purchase such "tail" insurance policies or Parent shall maintain
in effect the Existing DandO Policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring
in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions); _provided_ that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be required to pay an aggregate annual premium for such insurance
policies in excess of 250% of the annual premium payable by the Company for
coverage for its current fiscal year under the Existing DandO Policies;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premium of such insurance
coverage exceeds such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain the most advantageous policy available for an annual
premium equal to such amount; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of a reputable and financially
sound insurance company containing terms (including with respect to coverage
and amounts) and conditions (including with respect to deductibles and
exclusions) that are, individually and in the aggregate, no less favorable to
any Indemnified Party.

 



44

    

(d) In the event that (i) the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or a substantial
portion of its properties or other assets to any Person or (ii) Parent or any
of its successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in
each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
applicable successors and assigns or transferees expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.04_.

 

(e) From and after the Offer Closing Time, the obligations of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.04_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party to whom this _Section_ __ _ 6.04_ applies without the consent of such
affected Indemnified Party. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.04_ are,
from and after the Offer Closing Time, intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to which each Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to
Law, Contract or otherwise.

 

(f) Parent shall pay all reasonable and documented expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
successfully enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.04_.

 

SECTION 6.05 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.01_, _Section_ __ _ 6.04_,
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.07_, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees
or expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated.

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $265,000,000 (the "Company
Termination Fee") if:

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.01(g)_;

(ii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
8.01(d)_; or

(iii) (A) after the date of this Agreement, a bona fide Company Takeover
Proposal is publicly proposed or announced or shall have become publicly known
and such Company Takeover Proposal is not publicly withdrawn (x) in the case
of this Agreement being subsequently terminated pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
8.01(c)_, prior to the time of the breach or failure to perform giving rise to
such termination or (y) in the case of this Agreement being subsequently
terminated pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)(i)_, prior to the date that
is four business days prior to the final expiration date of the Offer, (B)
this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)(i)_ (but in the case of a termination by the Company,
only if at such time Parent would not be prohibited from terminating this
Agreement pursuant to the proviso in  _Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)(i))_ or by
Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)_, (C) in the case of termination
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)(i)_, at the final expiration date of the
Offer, the Offer Conditions set forth in clauses (b) and (i) of _Exhibit A_
shall have been satisfied but the Minimum Tender Condition shall not have been
satisfied and (D) within 12 months after such termination, the Company
either (1) consummates a Company Takeover Proposal or (2) enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal that (y) is
subsequently consummated or (z) was publicly proposed or announced or became
publicly known prior to the termination of such Agreement.

 



45

    

For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.05(b)_, the term "Company Takeover
Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of Company
Takeover Proposal contained in _Section_ __ _ 5.02(e)_ except that all
references to 20% shall be deemed references to 50%. Any fee due under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.05(b)_ shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds to
an account designated by Parent, (1) in the case of clause (i) above, prior to
or simultaneously with such termination of this Agreement, (2) in the case of
clause (ii) above, within two business days after the date of such termination
of this Agreement and (3) in the case of clause (iii) above, within two
business days after the date of such entry into a definitive agreement or the
consummation of such a transaction, as applicable pursuant to clause (D) of
the preceding paragraph. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on
more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be
payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at
different times and the occurrence of different events.

(c) Except in the case of fraud (with scienter) under Delaware law or a
willful and material breach, in the event the Company Termination Fee
described in this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ is paid to Parent in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 6.05(b)_, such Company Termination Fee shall constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and
its current, former or future stockholders and Representatives for any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated.
Upon payment of the Company Termination Fee in accordance with _Section_ __ _
6.05(b)_, none of the Company or its current, former or future stockholders or
Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, except, with respect to
the Company, in the case of fraud (with scienter) under Delaware law or a
willful and material breach. Any Company Termination Fee paid to Parent
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ will be offset against any award for
damages given to Parent pursuant to any claim based upon fraud (with scienter)
under Delaware law or a willful and material breach.

 

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.05_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that,
without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the
Company Termination Fee due pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.05(b)_ and, in
order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment
for the Company Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the Company
Termination Fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect from time to
time from the date such payment was required to be made hereunder through the
date such payment was actually received.

SECTION 6.06 _Public Announcements_. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other
before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment
upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the Offer,

(a) This Agreement, the Tender and Support Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement (including all Exhibits, Annexes or Schedules
thereto) (i) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties and
their affiliates, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) except for _Section_ __ _
6.04_, are not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties any
rights or remedies. Notwithstanding clause (ii) of the immediately preceding

enforceable by holders of Certificates and holders of Book-Entry Shares
solely to the extent necessary to receive the Merger Consideration to which
such holders are entitled to thereunder, and the provisions of _Section_ __ _
2.10_ shall be enforceable by holders of awards under the Company Stock
Plans.

(b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in _Article

nor any Person on behalf of the Company makes, and neither Parent nor Merger
Sub is relying on, any other express or implied representation or warranty
with respect to the Company or with respect to any other information made
available to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Transactions
(including with respect to the accuracy or completeness thereof). In
connection with the due diligence investigation of the Company by Parent and
Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub have received and may continue to receive
from the Company certain estimates,

 



57

    

 projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
certain business plans and cost-related plan information, regarding the
Companys business and operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge
that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, with which
Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are making
their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such
business plans and cost-related plans, furnished to them (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-related plans),
and that neither Parent nor Merger Sub has relied upon the Company or its
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or
other Representatives, or any other Person, with respect thereto. Accordingly,
each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that neither the Company nor
its stockholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors,
agents or other Representatives, nor any other Person, has made or is making
any representation or warranty or has or shall have any liability (whether
pursuant to this Agreement, in tort or otherwise) with respect to
such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information, business
plans or cost-related plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
information, business plans or cost-related plans), except as expressly set
forth in _Article III_.

(c) Except for the representations and warranties contained in _Article
IV_ , the Company acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes, and the Company is not relying
on, any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to
Parent or Merger Sub or with respect to any other information made available
to the Company in connection with the Transactions (including with respect to
the accuracy or completeness thereof). Nothing in this Agreement (including
_Section_ __ _ 9.07(b)_) shall limit the liability of any Person for fraud
(with scienter) under Delaware law committed by such Person.

 

SECTION 9.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless
of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of laws thereof.

SECTION 9.09  _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ that Merger Sub may
assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Merger Sub
of any of its obligations under this Agreement; _provided,_ _further_ , that
any such assignment shall not take place after the commencement of the Offer
and shall not otherwise materially impede or delay the consummation of the
Transactions or otherwise materially impede the rights of the stockholders of
the Company under this Agreement. Any purported assignment without such
consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

SECTION 9.10 _Specific Enforcement; Jurisdiction_.

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to in _Section_
__ _ 9.10(b)_, without proof of damages or otherwise (and each party hereby
waives any requirement for

 



58

    

 the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The right to specific enforcement shall include the right of the
Company to cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions to be consummated on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement. The parties further agree not to
assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. Each of the parties
acknowledges and agrees that the right of specific enforcement is an integral
part of the Transactions and without such right, none of the parties would
have entered into this Agreement. If, prior to the Outside Date, any party
brings any Proceeding, in each case in accordance with _Section_ __ _
9.10(b)_, to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
hereof by any other party, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by
(i) the amount of time during which such Proceeding is pending, plus 20
business days or (ii) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such Proceeding, as the case may be.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and to the jurisdiction
of the United States District Court for the State of Delaware, for the purpose
of any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions
of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement thereof, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably agrees that all claims with respect to such Proceeding may be
heard and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery or, solely
if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction
thereof, any other court of the State of Delaware or any Federal court sitting
in the State of Delaware. Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, any
other court of the State of Delaware and any Federal court sitting in the
State of Delaware in the event any Proceeding arises out of this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, (ii) agrees that it
will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court, (iii) irrevocably consents to the
service of process in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, on behalf
of itself or its property, by U.S. registered mail to such partys respective
address set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.02_ ( _provided_ that nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.10(b)_ shall affect the right of any party to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by Law) and (iv) agrees that it will not
bring any Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any
of the other Transactions in any court other than the Delaware Court of
Chancery (or, solely if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable,
any other court of the State of Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the
State of Delaware). The parties hereto agree that a final trial court judgment
in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law;  _provided_ that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any partys
rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such
final trial court judgment.

 

SECTION 9.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE OFFER,
THE MERGER OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY
PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
9.11_.

SECTION 9.12 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the
rights and remedies provided in this Agreement shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by applicable Law, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

 



59

    

SECTION 9.13 _Cooperation_. The parties agree to provide reasonable
cooperation with each other and to execute and deliver such further
documents, certificates, agreements and instruments and to take such actions
as may be reasonably requested by the other parties to evidence or effect the
Transactions and to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

Agreement and Plan of Merger 

Offer Conditions

 

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or the Agreement, Merger Sub shall
not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub to,
accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger Subs
obligation to pay for or return tendered shares of Company Common Stock
promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for any shares
of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not theretofore
accepted for payment or paid for) unless (a) there shall have been validly
tendered in the Offer (and not properly withdrawn) prior to the expiration of
the Offer that number of shares of Company Common Stock (excluding shares
tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been
"received" by the "depository", as such terms are defined by Section 251(h) of
the DGCL) that, when added to the shares of Company Common Stock then owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any subsidiary of Parent, would represent a majority of
the Company Common Stock outstanding as of immediately following the
consummation of the Offer (such condition in this clause (a), the "Minimum
Tender Condition") and (b) the waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to
the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the
consummation of the Merger shall have either expired or been terminated.

 

Furthermore, notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement,
Merger Sub shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to
cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment or, subject as aforesaid, to pay for
any shares of Company Common Stock not theretofore accepted for payment or
paid for if, at the then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, any of the
following conditions exists:

(i) there shall be any Legal Restraint in effect preventing or prohibiting
the consummation of the Offer or the Merger;

(ii) (A) any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in
_Article III_  (other than those set forth in _Sections 3.01_ (Organization,
Standing and Power), _3.02(a)_ , _(c)_ and _(d)_ (Capital Structure), _3.04_
(Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability), _3.08(a)_ (Absence
of Certain Changes or Events), _3.20_ (Brokers and Other Advisors), _3.22_
(Opinion of Financial Advisors) and _3.23_ (No Vote Required)) shall not be
true and correct at and as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of such
time, except to the extent such representation or warranty expressly relates
to a specified date (in which case on and as of such specified date), other
than for such failures to be true and correct that have not had or would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect (for purposes of determining the satisfaction of this
condition, without regard to any qualifications or exceptions contained
therein as to "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect"), (B) any
representation or warranty of the Company set forth in _Sections 3.01_
(Organization, Standing and Power), _3.04_ (Authority; Execution and Delivery;
Enforceability), _3.20_  (Brokers and other Advisors), _3.22_ (Opinion of
Financial Advisors) and _3.23_ (No Vote Required) shall not be true and
correct in all material respects at and as of the date of this Agreement and
at and as of such time, except to the extent such representation or warranty
expressly relates to a specified date (in which case on and as of such
specified date) (for purposes of determining the satisfaction of this
condition, without regard to any qualifications or exceptions contained
therein as to "materiality"), (C) any representation or warranty of the
Company set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.02(a)_, _(c)_ and _(d)_ (Capital
Structure) shall not be true and correct other than in  _de minimis_ respects
at and as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of such time, except to
the extent such representation or warranty expressly relates to a specified
date (in which case on and as of such specified date) and (D) any
representation or warranty of the Company set forth in _Section_ __ _
3.08(a)_ (Absence of Certain Changes or Events) shall not be true and correct
in all respects at such time;

   

(iii) the Company shall have failed to perform in all material respects
all obligations to be performed by it as of such time under this Agreement;

(iv) Parent shall have failed to receive from the Company a certificate,
dated as of the date on which the Offer expires and signed by an executive
officer of the Company, certifying to the effect that the Offer Conditions set
forth in clauses (ii) and (iii) immediately above do not exist and have not
occurred; or

(v) this Agreement shall have been validly terminated in accordance with
its terms (the "Termination Condition").

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of,
the rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate or modify the Offer
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC, may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub in
whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion
(other than the Minimum Tender Condition and the Termination Condition, which
may not be waived by Parent or Merger Sub). The failure by Parent, Merger Sub
or any other affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing
rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such
right with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed
a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right
shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from
time to time.

Agreement and Plan of Merger 

Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation

 

AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF

 

LOXO ONCOLOGY, INC.

3\. The nature of the business and the purposes to be conducted and
promoted by the Corporation are to conduct any lawful business, to promote
any lawful purpose and to engage in any lawful act or activity for which
corporations may be organized under the DGCL.

 

4\. The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall have
authority to issue is one-hundred (100) shares of common stock, $0.0001 par
value per share (the " _Common Stock_ "). Shares of the Common Stock may be
issued from time to time as the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "
_Board_ ") shall determine and on such terms and for such consideration as
shall be fixed by the Board. The amount of the authorized Common Stock of the
Corporation may be increased or decreased by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote.

5.  Except as otherwise provided by law, the Common Stock shall have the
exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and for all other
purposes. Each share of Common Stock shall have one vote, and the Common Stock
shall vote together as a single class.

6\. Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless required
by the Bylaws of the Corporation. Any director may be removed from office
either with or without cause at any time by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote, given at a meeting of the stockholders called for that
purpose, or by the consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to vote, given in accordance with
DGCL Section 228\.

 

7\. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon the
Board by law, the Board shall have the power to make, adopt, alter, amend and
repeal from time to time the Bylaws of the Corporation by a majority vote at

the stockholders to alter, amend and repeal Bylaws made by the Board.

8\. The Corporation reserves the right at any time, from time to time, to
amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of
Incorporation, and any other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of
Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted, in the manner now or
hereafter prescribed by law; and all rights, preferences and privileges of
whatsoever nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons
by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation in its present form or as
hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this section.

9\. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as it now exists and as it
may hereafter be amended, no director of the Corporation shall be personally
liable to the Corporation or any of its

   

 stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director; _provided_ that nothing contained in this Section 9 shall eliminate
or limit the liability of a director (i) for any breach of the directors
duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, (iii) pursuant to the provisions of Section 174 of
the DGCL, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an
improper personal benefit. No repeal or modification of this Section 9 shall
apply to or have any adverse effect on any right or protection of, or any
limitation of the liability of, a director of the Corporation existing at the
time of such repeal or modification with respect to acts or omissions
occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

 

10\. The Corporation may indemnify, and advance expenses to, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any person who was or is a party to or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.
