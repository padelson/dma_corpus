omission, delay or prevent any such disbursement. Any failure by Buyer to make the Deposit within

accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#147;GAAP&#148;) as of 12:01&nbsp;a.m. on the day

other license fees, employee performance incentives set forth in employment agreements or annual
compensation plans, any vacation for Transferred Employees (defined below) (except accruals for the
fiscal year of Seller in which Closing occurs for which there shall be no adjustment), utility
expenses, rent and other amounts under Station Contracts and similar prepaid and deferred items.
Seller shall receive a credit for all of the Stations&#146; deposits and prepaid expenses. Sales
commissions related to the sale of advertisements broadcast on the Stations prior to Closing shall

occurring on or prior to the Effective Time shall be borne by Seller. All Taxes related to the
Station Assets accrued or accruable with respect to events occurring after the Effective Time shall
be borne by Buyer. Ad valorem, real estate and other property Taxes (except transfer taxes as

negative or positive barter balance (<I>i.e</I>., the amount by which the value of air time to be provided
by the Stations after the Effective Time exceeds, or conversely, is less than, the fair market
value of corresponding goods and services), there shall be no proration or adjustment, unless the
negative or positive barter balance of the Stations as an aggregate exceeds $50,000 per Station, in
which event such excess or deficiency, as the case may be, shall be treated either as prepaid time
sales or a receivable of Seller, and adjusted for as a proration in Buyer&#146;s or Seller&#146;s favor, as
applicable. In determining barter balances, the value of air time shall be based upon Seller&#146;s
rates as of Closing, and corresponding goods and services shall include those to be received by the
Stations after Closing <I>plus </I>those received by the Stations before Closing to the extent conveyed by
Seller to Buyer as a part of the Station Assets.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Closing (the &#147;Preliminary Adjustment Report&#148;). As used herein, the &#147;Adjustment Amount&#148; means
the net amount by which the Purchase Price is to be increased or decreased in accordance with this
Section&nbsp;1.7. If the Adjustment Amount reflected on the Preliminary Adjustment Report is a credit
to Buyer, then the Purchase Price payable at Closing shall be reduced by the amount of the
preliminary Adjustment Amount, and if the Adjustment Amount reflected on the Preliminary Adjustment
Report is a charge to Buyer, then the Purchase Price payable at Closing shall be increased by the
amount of such preliminary Adjustment Amount. For a period of ninety (90)&nbsp;days after Closing,
Seller and its auditors and Buyer and its auditors may review the Preliminary Adjustment Report and
the related books and records of Seller with respect to the Stations, and Buyer and Seller will in
good faith seek to reach agreement on the final Adjustment Amount. If agreement is reached within
such 90-day period, then promptly thereafter Seller shall pay to Buyer or Buyer shall pay to

Buyer do not agree on the Arbitrating Firm within five (5)&nbsp;calendar days after the end of such
90-day period, then the Arbitrating Firm shall be a nationally recognized independent accounting
firm selected by lot (after excluding one firm designated by Seller and one firm designated by
Buyer). Buyer and Seller shall each inform the Arbitrating Firm in writing as to their respective
positions with respect to the Adjustment Amount, and each shall make available to the Arbitrating
Firm any books and records and work papers relevant to the preparation of the Arbitrating Firm&#146;s
computation of the Adjustment Amount. The Arbitrating Firm shall be instructed to complete its
analysis within thirty (30)&nbsp;days from the date of its engagement and upon completion to inform the
parties in writing of its own determination of the Adjustment Amount, the basis for its
determination and whether its determination is within the Mid-Range (defined below) or if not,
whether it is closer to Buyer&#146;s or Seller&#146;s written determination of the Adjustment Amount. Any
determination by the Arbitrating Firm in accordance with this Section shall be final and binding on
the parties. Within five (5)&nbsp;calendar days after the Arbitrating Firm delivers to the parties its
written determination of the Adjustment Amount, Seller shall pay to Buyer, or Buyer shall pay to

in connection with its analysis. If not, then (i)&nbsp;if the Arbitrating Firm determines that the
written position of Buyer concerning the Adjustment Amount is closer to its own determination, then
Seller shall pay the fees and disbursements of the Arbitrating Firm in connection with its
analysis, or (ii)&nbsp;if the Arbitrating Firm determines that the written position of Seller concerning
the Adjustment Amount is closer to its own determination, then Buyer shall pay the fees and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">except for Excluded Employees (defined below), Buyer shall offer employment to all persons

duties as in effect immediately preceding the Closing, including but not limited to wages,
salaries, commission rate (if applicable) and target bonuses (all determined on a cash basis before
taking into account Seller&#146;s stock compensation program) and with benefits which are substantially
similar to the benefits Buyer provides to its similarly situated employees. As used herein the
term &#147;Excluded Employees&#148; shall mean only those employees who are on inactive status (including
employees who are inactive due to leave or short-term or long-term disability, as of the Closing
Date. Buyer shall offer employment to Excluded Employees on the terms set forth above in this
Section&nbsp;5.7(c) subject to the following conditions: (i)&nbsp;if on medical or disability leave, when
such individual is released by his or her physician to return to active employment, and (ii)&nbsp;such
individual actually reports for active employment with Buyer immediately upon such medical release,

Without limiting the foregoing, if Buyer terminates the employment of any Transferred Employee
within one (1)&nbsp;year after Closing, Buyer shall be responsible for any applicable severance in

are substantially similar to the employee benefits Buyer provides to its similarly situated
employees, with coverage effective immediately upon Closing (and without exclusion from coverage on
account of any pre-existing condition), with service with Seller deemed service with the Buyer for
purposes of any length of service requirements, waiting periods, vesting periods and differential
benefits based on length of service (but not accruals under defined benefits pension plans), and

learning of any breach or default by the other party under this Agreement. The term &#147;Cure Period&#148;
as used herein means a period commencing on the date Buyer or Seller receives from the other
written notice of breach or default hereunder and continuing until the earlier of (i)&nbsp;twenty (20)
calendar days thereafter or (ii)&nbsp;five (5)&nbsp;business days after the scheduled Closing date; provided,
however, that if the breach or default is non-monetary and cannot reasonably be cured within such
period but can be cured before the date five (5)&nbsp;business days after the scheduled Closing date,
and if diligent efforts to cure promptly commence, then the Cure Period shall continue as long as
such diligent efforts to cure continue, but not beyond the date five (5)&nbsp;business days after the
scheduled Closing date.

of this Agreement shall not relieve any party of any liability for breach or default under this
Agreement prior to the date of termination. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, Sections&nbsp;1.6 (Deposit) (and Sections&nbsp;10.4 and 10.5 with respect to the Deposit), 5.1

injunction restraining such failure or threatened failure and, subject to obtaining any necessary
FCC consent, to enforcement of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance requiring
compliance with this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if prior to Closing Seller has the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section&nbsp;10.1(c), then Seller&#146;s sole remedy shall be

Seller&#146;s liquidated damages amount is reasonable in light of the substantial but indeterminate harm
