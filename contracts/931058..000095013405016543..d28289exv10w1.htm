 (e) all contracts of insurance, all coverages and proceeds thereunder and all rights in connection therewith, including without limitation rights arising from any refunds due with respect to insurance premium payments to the extent related to such insurance policies; 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) all pension, profit sharing plans and trusts and the assets thereof and any other employee benefit plan or arrangement and the assets thereof, if any, maintained by Seller and any affiliates of Seller; 

   

 (g) the Stations accounts receivable and any other rights to payment of cash consideration (including without limitation all rights to payments under the Stations network affiliation agreements, whether or not offset) for goods or services sold or provided prior to the Effective Time (defined below) or otherwise arising during or attributable to any period prior to the Effective Time (the "A/R"); 

   

 (h) any computer software and programs used in the operation of the Stations that are not transferable; 

   

 (i) all rights and claims of Seller, whether mature, contingent or otherwise, against third parties with respect to the Stations and the Station Assets, to the extent arising during or attributable to any period prior to the Effective Time; 

   

 (j) all deposits and prepaid expenses (and rights arising therefrom or related thereto), except to the extent Seller receives a credit therefor under Section 1.7;

 (m) the assets listed on _Schedule 1.2_, and the slogan "Great Media, Great People, Great Service." 

   

 1.3. _Shared Assets_. 

  

 (a) Some of the Station Contracts may be used in the operation of multiple stations or other business units (the "Shared Contracts") and are identified on _Schedule 1.1(d)_. The rights and obligations under the Shared Contracts shall be equitably allocated among stations in a manner reasonably determined by Seller in accordance with the following equitable allocation principles: 

   

 (i) any allocation set forth in the Shared Contract shall control; 

  

 (ii) if none, then any allocation previously made by Seller in the ordinary course of Station operations shall control; 

  

 (iii) if none, then the quantifiable proportionate benefit to be received by the parties after Closing shall control; and 

  

 (iv) if not quantifiable, then reasonable accommodation shall control. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Buyer shall cooperate with Seller (and any third party designated by Seller) in such allocation, and the Station Contracts (and Assumed Obligations (defined below)) will include only Buyers allocated portion of the rights and obligations under the Shared Contracts (without need for further action and whether such allocation occurs before or after Closing). If designated by Seller, such allocation will occur by termination of the Shared Contract and execution of new contracts. Buyers allocated portion of the Shared Contracts will not include any group discounts or similar benefits specific to Seller or its affiliates. Completion of documentation of any such allocation is not a condition to Closing. 

   

 (c) Seller operates a centralcasting facility serving WKCF (Orlando), WVUE (New Orleans), WFTX (Ft. Myers) and WALA and WBPG (Mobile-Pensacola). If the Stations include any of such stations, then the terms set forth on _Schedule 1.3 _shall apply. Assets used in the operation of such facility are Excluded Assets. If any Schedule attached hereto includes any such items, then such items are nonetheless Excluded Assets. If applicable, at Closing, the parties shall enter into the agreements set forth on _Schedule 1.3_, in the forms attached hereto as _Exhibit 1.3 _(or, where appropriate, the parties shall execute an assignment and assumption agreement with respect to such agreements). 

   

 (d) Seller also operates WTHI (Terre Haute) on a combined basis with certain radio stations. If the Stations include any such stations, then shared assets shall be allocated as set forth on  _Schedule 1.3_, and to the extent not allocated to Buyer pursuant to such Schedule, such assets shall be Excluded Assets. If any other Schedule attached hereto includes any items that are shared but not allocated to Buyer pursuant to _Schedule 1.3_, then such items are nonetheless Excluded Assets. If applicable, at Closing, the parties shall enter into the agreements set forth on _Schedule 1.3_, which may include (if applicable) shared services agreements and shared facilities agreements, in the forms attached hereto as _Exhibit 1.3 _(or, where appropriate, the parties shall execute an assignment and assumption agreement with respect to such agreements). 

   

 1.4. _Assumption of Obligations_. On the Closing Date (defined below), Buyer shall assume the obligations of Seller arising during, or attributable to, any period of time on or after the Closing Date under the Station Contracts and the FCC Licenses, the obligations described in Section 5.7 and any other liabilities of Seller to the extent Buyer receives a credit therefor under Section 1.7 (collectively, the "Assumed Obligations"). Except for the Assumed Obligations, Buyer does not assume, and will not be deemed by the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to have assumed, any other liabilities or obligations of Seller (the "Retained Obligations"). 

  

 1.5. _Purchase Price_. In consideration for the sale of the Station Assets to Buyer, at Closing Buyer shall pay Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the sum of Two Hundred Sixty Million Dollars ($260,000,000), subject to adjustment pursuant to Sections 1.7 and 5.10 (the "Purchase Price"). 

  

 1.6. _Deposit_. Within one (1) business day of the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall make a cash deposit in immediately available funds in an amount equal to 7.5% of the Purchase Price (the "Deposit") with Bank of America (the "Escrow Agent") pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (the "Escrow Agreement") of even date herewith among Buyer, Seller and the Escrow Agent. At Closing, the Deposit shall be disbursed to Seller and applied to the Purchase 

   ##### 

  

 

Price and any interest accrued thereon shall be disbursed to Buyer. If this
Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to Section 10.1(c), the Deposit
and any interest accrued thereon shall be disbursed to Seller and credited as
partial payment of liquidated damages under Section 10.5. If this Agreement
is terminated for any other reason, the Deposit and any interest
accrued thereon shall be disbursed to Buyer. The parties shall each instruct
the Escrow Agent to disburse the Deposit and all interest thereon to the
party entitled thereto and shall not, by any act or omission, delay or
prevent any such disbursement. Any failure by Buyer to make the Deposit
within one (1) business day of the date hereof constitutes a material default
as to which the Cure Period under Section 10.1 does not apply entitling
Seller to immediately terminate this Agreement. 

   

 1.7. _Prorations and Adjustments_. 

  

 (a) All prepaid and deferred income and expenses relating to the Station Assets and arising from the operation of the Stations shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") as of 12:01 a.m. on the day of Closing (the "Effective Time"). Such prorations shall include without limitation all music and other license fees, employee performance incentives set forth in employment agreements or annual compensation plans, any vacation for Transferred Employees (defined below) (except accruals for the fiscal year of Seller in which Closing occurs for which there shall be no adjustment), utility expenses, rent and other amounts under Station Contracts and similar prepaid and deferred items. Seller shall receive a credit for all of the Stations deposits and prepaid expenses. Sales commissions related to the sale of advertisements broadcast on the Stations prior to Closing shall be the responsibility of Seller, and sales commissions related to the sale of advertisements broadcast on the Stations after Closing shall be the responsibility of Buyer. All Taxes, other than transfer taxes, related to the Station Assets accrued or accruable with respect to events occurring on or prior to the Effective Time shall be borne by Seller. All Taxes related to the Station Assets accrued or accruable with respect to events occurring after the Effective Time shall be borne by Buyer. Ad valorem, real estate and other property Taxes (except transfer taxes as provided by Section 11.1), if any, with respect to the Station Assets shall be pro-rated on a per diem basis. 

   

 (b) With respect to trade, barter or similar agreements for the sale of time for goods or services assumed by Buyer pursuant to Section 1.1(d), if at Closing the Stations have an aggregate negative or positive barter balance ( _i.e_., the amount by which the value of air time to be provided by the Stations after the Effective Time exceeds, or conversely, is less than, the fair market value of corresponding goods and services), there shall be no proration or adjustment, unless the negative or positive barter balance of the Stations as an aggregate exceeds $50,000 per Station, in which event such excess or deficiency, as the case may be, shall be treated either as prepaid time sales or a receivable of Seller, and adjusted for as a proration in Buyers or Sellers favor, as applicable. In determining barter balances, the value of air time shall be based upon Sellers rates as of Closing, and corresponding goods and services shall include those to be received by the Stations after Closing _plus_ those received by the Stations before Closing to the extent conveyed by Seller to Buyer as a part of the Station Assets. 

   

 (c) No later than three (3) business days prior to the scheduled Closing date, Seller shall provide Buyer with a statement setting forth a reasonably detailed computation of Sellers reasonable and good faith estimate of the Adjustment Amount (defined below) as of 

    ##### 

  

    

Closing (the "Preliminary Adjustment Report"). As used herein, the "Adjustment
Amount" means the net amount by which the Purchase Price is to be increased
or decreased in accordance with this Section 1.7. If the Adjustment Amount
reflected on the Preliminary Adjustment Report is a credit to Buyer, then the
Purchase Price payable at Closing shall be reduced by the amount of
the preliminary Adjustment Amount, and if the Adjustment Amount reflected on
the Preliminary Adjustment Report is a charge to Buyer, then the Purchase
Price payable at Closing shall be increased by the amount of such preliminary
Adjustment Amount. For a period of ninety (90) days after Closing, Seller and
its auditors and Buyer and its auditors may review the Preliminary Adjustment
Report and the related books and records of Seller with respect to the
Stations, and Buyer and Seller will in good faith seek to reach agreement on
the final Adjustment Amount. If agreement is reached within such 90-day
period, then promptly thereafter Seller shall pay to Buyer or Buyer shall pay
to Seller, as the case may be, an amount equal to the difference between (i)
the agreed Adjustment Amount and (ii) the preliminary Adjustment Amount
indicated in the Preliminary Adjustment Report. If agreement is not reached
within such 90-day period, then the dispute resolutions of Section 1.7(d)
shall apply. 

   

 (d) If the parties do not reach an agreement on the Adjustment Amount within the 90-day period specified in Section 1.7(c), then Seller and Buyer shall select an independent accounting firm of recognized national standing (the "Arbitrating Firm") to resolve the disputed items. If Seller and Buyer do not agree on the Arbitrating Firm within five (5) calendar days after the end of such 90-day period, then the Arbitrating Firm shall be a nationally recognized independent accounting firm selected by lot (after excluding one firm designated by Seller and one firm designated by Buyer). Buyer and Seller shall each inform the Arbitrating Firm in writing as to their respective positions with respect to the Adjustment Amount, and each shall make available to the Arbitrating Firm any books and records and work papers relevant to the preparation of the Arbitrating Firms computation of the Adjustment Amount. The Arbitrating Firm shall be instructed to complete its analysis within thirty (30) days from the date of its engagement and upon completion to inform the parties in writing of its own determination of the Adjustment Amount, the basis for its determination and whether its determination is within the Mid-Range (defined below) or if not, whether it is closer to Buyers or Sellers written determination of the Adjustment Amount. Any determination by the Arbitrating Firm in accordance with this Section shall be final and binding on the parties. Within five (5) calendar days after the Arbitrating Firm delivers to the parties its written determination of the Adjustment Amount, Seller shall pay to Buyer, or Buyer shall pay to Seller, as the case may be, an amount equal to the difference between (i) the Adjustment Amount as determined by the Arbitrating Firm and (ii) the preliminary Adjustment Amount indicated in the Preliminary Adjustment Report. 

   

 (e) If the Arbitrating Firms determination of the Adjustment Amount is within the Mid-Range, then Seller and Buyer shall each pay one-half of the fees and disbursements of the Arbitrating Firm in connection with its analysis. If not, then (i) if the Arbitrating Firm determines that the written position of Buyer concerning the Adjustment Amount is closer to its own determination, then Seller shall pay the fees and disbursements of the Arbitrating Firm in connection with its analysis, or (ii) if the Arbitrating Firm determines that the written position of Seller concerning the Adjustment Amount is closer to its own determination, then Buyer shall pay the fees and disbursements of the Arbitrating Firm in connection with its analysis. As used herein, the term "Mid-Range" means a range that (i) equals twenty percent (20%) of the absolute difference between the written positions of Buyer and 

    ##### 

  

    

Seller as to the Adjustment Amount and (ii) has a midpoint equal to the
average of such written positions of Buyer and Seller. 

   

 (f) Concurrently with the payment of any amount required to be paid under Section 1.7(c) or (d), the payor shall pay the payee interest on such amount for the period from the Closing Date until the date paid at a rate equal to seven percent (7%) per annum. All payments to be made under Section 1.7 shall be paid by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account of the payee at a financial institution in the United States and shall for all purposes constitute an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

   

 1.8. _Allocation_. After Closing, Buyer and Seller will allocate the Purchase Price in accordance with the respective fair market values of the Station Assets and the goodwill being purchased and sold in accordance with the requirements of Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") based upon an appraisal by a nationally recognized broadcast appraiser acceptable to Buyer and Seller (whose fees shall be paid one-half by Seller and one-half by Buyer). Buyer and Seller shall file its federal income tax returns and its other tax returns reflecting the allocation made pursuant to this Section. 

  

 1.9. _Closing_. The consummation of the sale and purchase of the Station Assets provided for in this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place on the fifth business day after the date of the FCC Consent pursuant to the FCCs initial order (or on such earlier day after such consent as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree), subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Articles 6 or 7 below. The date on which the Closing is to occur is referred to herein as the "Closing Date." 

  

 1.10. _Governmental Consents_. 

  

 (a) Within five (5) business days of the date of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall file an application with the FCC (the "FCC Application") requesting FCC consent to the assignment of the FCC Licenses to Buyer. FCC consent to the assignment of the main station FCC Licenses to Buyer is referred to herein as the "FCC Consent." Buyer and Seller shall diligently prosecute the FCC Application and otherwise use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the FCC Consent as soon as possible. 

   

 (b) If applicable, within ten (10) business days after the date of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall make any required filings with the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act") with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (including a request for early termination of the waiting period thereunder), and shall thereafter promptly respond to all requests received from such agencies for additional information or documentation. Expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act is referred to herein as "HSR Clearance." 

   

 (c) Buyer and Seller shall notify each other of all documents filed with or received from any governmental agency with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer and Seller shall furnish each other with such information and assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of any 

    ##### 

  

    

governmental filing hereunder. The FCC Consent and HSR Clearance are referred
to herein collectively as the "Governmental Consents." 

   

 1.11. _Renewal_. The main station FCC Licenses expire on the dates set forth on  _Schedule 1.1(a)_. If due prior to Closing and if not previously filed, then Seller shall timely file FCC renewal applications with respect to the Stations and thereafter prosecute such applications. The parties acknowledge that under current FCC policy, either the FCC will not grant an assignment application while a renewal application is pending, or the FCC will grant an assignment application with a renewal condition. If the FCC Application is granted subject to a renewal condition, then the term "FCC Consent" shall mean FCC consent to the FCC Application and satisfaction of such renewal condition. 

  

 1.12. _Multiple Closings_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: 

  

 (a) the parties have allocated the Stations into groups (each a "Station Group") and have allocated the Purchase Price (each an "Allocated Price") as follows: 

 

       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

 (b) the FCC Application shall consist of separate applications (each a "Partial Application"), one for each Station Group, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be consummated as follows: (i) if such applications are granted concurrently, then in a single Closing, or (ii) if not, then in multiple Closings (each a "Partial Closing"), one for each Station Group; 

   

 (c) with respect to each Station Group, each Partial Closing shall occur on the fifth business day after the date of the FCC Consent with respect to the applicable Partial Application (subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the applicable conditions set forth in Articles 6 or 7 below), except that if the day the Durango Group Partial Closing is otherwise scheduled to occur is before the Albuquerque Group Partial Closing, then the Durango Group Partial Closing shall be scheduled for the date of the Albuquerque Group Partial Closing; 

   

 (d) at each Partial Closing Seller shall convey to Buyer the Station Assets used or held for use in the operation of the Stations in the applicable group and Buyer shall pay Seller the Allocated Price for such group; and 

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) taking into account such multiple closings: 

   

 (i) the terms "Closing," "Closing Date," "FCC Application" and "FCC Consent" shall mean, and refer separately to, the applicable Partial Closing, the date on which such Partial Closing occurs (or is to occur), the applicable Partial Application, and the applicable FCC consent, each as the context requires; 

  

 (ii) with respect to each Station Group and each Partial Closing, the provisions of this Agreement that apply before, at or after a Closing shall apply before, at or after the applicable Partial Closing; 

  

 (iii) the Deposit shall be allocated and disbursed _pro rata_ according to the Allocated Price to be paid at each Partial Closing, and the term "Deposit" as used herein shall mean, and refer separately to the allocable portion thereof as the context requires (but shall mean the full amount thereof if this Agreement is terminated without any Closing);

 (vi) any termination of this Agreement prior to the first Partial Closing shall constitute a termination of this Agreement in its entirety, but after the first Partial Closing, any termination of this Agreement shall constitute a termination only with respect to the Station Assets not subject to any prior Partial Closing, each Partial Closing being final and non-rescindable; and 

  

 (vii) with respect to the Albuquerque Group and the Durango Group, the Outside Date (defined below) shall be May 31, 2006. 

  

 (f) Without limiting the parties obligations under this Section 1.12 to do Partial Closings, the parties agree to consult with one-another in an effort to minimize the number of Partial Closings to the extent circumstances warrant, but no such consultation is a condition to Closing.

 3.2. _Authorization_. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Buyer Ancillary Agreements by Buyer have been duly authorized and approved by all necessary action of Buyer and do not require any further authorization or consent of Buyer.

 3.3. _No Conflicts_. Except for the Governmental Consents, the execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the Buyer Ancillary Agreements and the consummation by Buyer of any of the transactions contemplated hereby does not (i) conflict with any organizational documents of Buyer, (ii) conflict with, result in a breach of or give rise to a right of termination or acceleration or constitute a material default under any material contract of Buyer, (iii) conflict with any law, judgment, order or decree to which Buyer is subject, or (iv) require the consent or approval of, or a filing by Buyer with, any governmental or regulatory authority or any third party.

ARTICLE 5: _JOINT COVENANTS_  

   

 Buyer and Seller hereby covenant and agree as follows: 

   ##### 

  

  

 5.1. _Confidentiality_. Seller (or The Blackstone Group, LLC on behalf of Seller) and Buyer (or an affiliate of Buyer on behalf of Buyer) are parties to a non-disclosure agreement with respect to Seller and its television stations (the "NDA"). To the extent not already a direct party thereto, Seller and Buyer hereby assume the NDA and agree to be bound by the provisions thereof. Without limiting the terms of the NDA, subject to the requirements of applicable law, all non-public information regarding the parties and their business and properties that is disclosed in connection with the negotiation, preparation or performance of this Agreement (including without limitation all financial information provided by Seller to Buyer) shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed to any other person or entity, except in accordance with the terms of the NDA. 

  

 5.2. _Announcements_. Prior to Closing, no party shall, without the prior written consent of the other, issue any press release or make any other public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent that such party is so obligated by law, in which case such party shall give advance notice to the other. 

  

 5.3. _Control_. Buyer shall not, directly or indirectly, control, supervise or direct the operation of the Stations prior to Closing. Consistent with the Communications Act and the FCC rules and regulations, control, supervision and direction of the operation of the Stations prior to Closing shall remain the responsibility of Seller as the holder of the FCC Licenses. 

  

 5.4. _Risk of Loss_. 

  

 (a) Seller shall bear the risk of any loss of or damage to any of the Station Assets at all times until the Effective Time, and Buyer shall bear the risk of any such loss or damage thereafter. 

   

 (b) If prior to the Effective Time any item of Tangible Personal Property is damaged or destroyed or otherwise not in the condition described in Section 2.6 in any material respect, then: 

   

 (i) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to repair or replace such item in all material respects in the ordinary course of business, 

  

 (ii) Sellers representations and warranties, and Buyers pre-Closing termination rights and post-Closing indemnification rights, are hereby modified to take into account any such condition, and 

  

 (iii) if such repair or replacement is not completed prior to Closing, then as Buyers sole remedy, the parties shall proceed to Closing and Seller shall repair or replace such item in all material respects after Closing (and Buyer will provide Seller access and any other reasonable assistance requested by Seller with respect to such obligation). 

  

 (c) If a Station is off the air prior to Closing, then Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to return the Station to the air as promptly as practicable in the ordinary course of business. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if on the day otherwise scheduled for Closing a Station is off the air, then Closing shall be postponed until the date five (5) business days after the Station returns to the air, subject to Section 10.1. 

    ##### 

  

     

 5.5. _Environmental_. Certain Phase Is identified the items set forth on _Schedule 1.1(c)_. With respect to such items:

 5.6. _Consents_. 

  

 (a) The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (i) any third party consents necessary for the assignment of any Station Contract (which shall not require any payment to any such third party), and (ii) execution of reasonable estoppel certificates by lessors under any Real Property Leases requiring consent to assignment (if any), but no such consents or estoppel certificates are conditions to Closing except for the Required Consents (defined below). Receipt of consent to assign to Buyer the Stations unexpired (i) network affiliation agreements designated with a diamond on _Schedule 1.1(d) _and (ii) main tower leases designated with a diamond on _Schedule 1.1(c)_ (if any) is a condition precedent to Buyers obligation to close under this Agreement (the "Required Consents"). 

   

 (b) To the extent that any Station Contract may not be assigned without the consent of any third party, and such consent is not obtained prior to Closing, this Agreement and any assignment executed pursuant to this Agreement shall not constitute an assignment of such Station Contract; provided, however, with respect to each such Station Contract, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate to the extent feasible in effecting a lawful and commercially reasonable arrangement under which Buyer shall receive the benefits under the Station Contract from and after Closing, and to the extent of the benefits received, Buyer shall pay and perform Sellers obligations arising under the Station Contract from and after Closing in accordance with its terms. 

   

 5.7. _Employees_. 

  

 (a) For a period of two (2) years from the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller, solicit for employment, induce or attempt to induce to leave Sellers or an affiliate of Sellers employ, or hire, any employees of Seller or its affiliates staffed in Sellers Indianapolis headquarters or at any other television station owned by Seller or its affiliates (other than (i) general solicitations not directed solely to any such employees; and (ii) any employment or hiring of such employees that results from such general solicitation). 

   

 (b) If the Stations include any stations identified in Section 1.3(c) or 1.3(d), then any shared employees shall be allocated as set forth on _Schedule 1.3_. With respect to such shared employees, the terms of this Section 5.7 shall apply only to those who are allocated to Buyer pursuant to _Schedule 1.3_, and Buyer shall not solicit for hire those who are not allocated to Buyer (other than general solicitations not directed solely to any such employees). 

   

 (c) Seller has provided Buyer a list showing employee positions and annualized pay rates for employees of the Stations. Except as provided by Section 5.7(b) and 

     ##### 

  

    

except for Excluded Employees (defined below), Buyer shall offer employment to
all persons employed by Seller immediately prior to Closing (including any
hired after the date hereof in the ordinary course of business or in
connection with any bifurcation of operations contemplated by  _Schedule
1.3_) upon substantially the same terms and conditions and with substantially
the same duties as in effect immediately preceding the Closing, including but
not limited to wages, salaries, commission rate (if applicable) and target
bonuses (all determined on a cash basis before taking into account Sellers
stock compensation program) and with benefits which are substantially similar
to the benefits Buyer provides to its similarly situated employees. As used
herein the term "Excluded Employees" shall mean only those employees who are
on inactive status (including employees who are inactive due to leave or
short-term or long-term disability, as of the Closing Date. Buyer shall offer
employment to Excluded Employees on the terms set forth above in this Section
5.7(c) subject to the following conditions: (i) if on medical or disability
leave, when such individual is released by his or her physician to return to
active employment, and (ii) such individual actually reports for active
employment with Buyer immediately upon such medical release, and (iii) Buyer
shall not be required to offer employment under this provision after six (6)
months from the Closing Date or, if longer, after the expiration of any
period required by applicable law. With respect to each employee who accepts
such offer (collectively, the "Transferred Employees"), at Closing employment
with Seller shall terminate and employment with Buyer shall commence. Without
limiting the foregoing, if Buyer terminates the employment of any Transferred
Employee within one (1) year after Closing, Buyer shall be responsible for
any applicable severance in accordance with Sellers severance policy (a copy
of which has been provided to Buyer), unless the Transferred Employee is
party to a written employment agreement that provides for a
different severance obligation. 

   

 (d) With respect to Transferred Employees, Seller shall be responsible for all compensation and benefits arising prior to the Effective Time, and Buyer shall be responsible for all compensation and benefits arising after the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall grant credit to each Transferred Employee for all unused vacation accrued as of the Effective Time as an employee of Seller, and Buyer shall assume and discharge Sellers obligation to provide such leave to such employees (such obligations being a part of the Assumed Obligations). 

   

 (e) Buyer shall permit Transferred Employees (and their spouses and dependents) to participate in its "employee welfare benefit plans" (including without limitation health insurance plans) and "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) and 3(2) of ERISA, respectively) which are substantially similar to the employee benefits Buyer provides to its similarly situated employees, with coverage effective immediately upon Closing (and without exclusion from coverage on account of any pre-existing condition), with service with Seller deemed service with the Buyer for purposes of any length of service requirements, waiting periods, vesting periods and differential benefits based on length of service (but not accruals under defined benefits pension plans), and with credit under any welfare benefit plan for any deductibles or co-payments paid for the current plan year under any plan maintained by Seller. 

   

 (f) Buyer shall also permit each Transferred Employee who participates in the Sellers 401(k) plan to elect to make direct rollovers of their account balances into the Buyers 401(k) plan as of Closing, including the direct rollover of any outstanding loan balances such 

    ##### 

  

    

that they will continue to make payments under the terms of such loans under
the Buyers 401(k) plan, subject to compliance with applicable law and
subject to the reasonable requirements of Buyers 401(k) plan. 

   

 5.8. _Accounting Services_. 

  

 (a) For a period of one hundred twenty (120) days after Closing (the "Collection Period"), Buyer shall, without charge to Seller, use commercially reasonable efforts to collect the A/R in the ordinary course of business and shall apply all amounts collected from the Stations account debtors to the oldest account first. Any amounts relating to the A/R that are paid directly to Seller shall be retained by Seller. Buyer shall not discount, adjust or otherwise compromise any A/R and Buyer shall refer any disputed A/R to Seller. Within ten calendar days after the end of each month, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a report showing A/R collections for the prior month and Buyer shall make a payment, without offset, to Seller equal to the amount of all such collections. At the end of the Collection Period, any remaining A/R shall be returned to Seller for collection. 

   

 (b) During the first fifteen (15) business days after Closing, Buyer shall provide to Seller at no additional cost the services of the Stations business offices, together with reasonable access to related systems and records, for the purposes of closing the books of the Stations for the period prior to Closing and of facilitating the distribution of any stock compensation from Seller to the Stations employees, all in accordance with the procedures and practices applied by the business offices for periods prior to Closing. 

   

 5.9. _1031 Exchange_. 

  

 (a) _By Seller_. To facilitate a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code, Seller may assign its rights under this Agreement (in whole or in part) to a "qualified intermediary" under section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) of the treasury regulations (but such assignment shall not relieve Seller of its obligations under this Agreement) and any such qualified intermediary may re-assign to Seller. If Seller gives notice of such assignment, Buyer shall provide Seller with a written acknowledgment of such notice prior to Closing and pay the Purchase Price (or such portion thereof as is designated in writing by the qualified intermediary) to or on behalf of the qualified intermediary at Closing and otherwise reasonably cooperate therewith at no cost to Buyer. 

   

 (b) _By Buyer_. To facilitate a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code, Buyer may assign its rights under this Agreement (in whole or in part) to a "qualified intermediary" under section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) of the treasury regulations (but such assignment shall not relieve Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement) and any such qualified intermediary may re-assign to Buyer. If Buyer gives notice of such assignment, Seller shall provide Buyer with a written acknowledgment of such notice prior to Closing and convey the Station Assets (or such portion thereof as is designated in writing by the qualified intermediary) to or on behalf of the qualified intermediary at Closing and otherwise reasonably cooperate therewith at no cost to Seller. 

   

 5.10. _DTV Construction at WTHI (Terre Haute)_. Buyer acknowledges that the DTV construction at WTHI (Terre Haute), as set forth on _Schedule 5.10_, must be timely completed to 

   ##### 

  

 

meet replication/maximization requirements for interference protection or to
meet other applicable FCC requirements. Seller shall commence such work in
the ordinary course of business, but completion thereof is not a condition to
Closing. The adjustments under Section 1.7 shall include a credit in favor of
Seller for 50% of the cost of such work incurred by Seller.

The representations and warranties in this Agreement shall survive Closing for a period of eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date whereupon they shall expire and be of no further force or effect, except (a) those under Section 2.5 (Taxes), which shall survive until the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations, and those under Section 2.9 (Environmental), which shall survive for a period of sixty (60) months from the Closing Date, and (b) that if within such period the indemnified party gives the indemnifying party written 

   ##### 

  

 

notice of a claim for breach thereof describing in reasonable detail the
nature and basis of such claim, then such claim shall survive until the
earlier of resolution of such claim or expiration of the applicable statue of
limitations. The covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall survive
Closing until performed. 

   

 9.2. _Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) Subject to Section 9.2(b), from and after Closing, Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer from and against any and all losses, costs, damages, liabilities and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses ("Damages") incurred by Buyer arising out of or resulting from: 

   

 (i) any breach by Seller of its representations and warranties made under this Agreement; or 

  

 (ii) any default by Seller of any covenant or agreement made under this Agreement; or 

  

 (iii) the Retained Obligations; 

  

 (iv) the business or operation of the Stations before the Effective Time, except for the Assumed Obligations; or 

  

 (v) any Tax liability of Buyer caused by an assignment of rights by Seller pursuant to Section 5.9(a). 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else herein to the contrary, after Closing, (i) Seller shall have no liability to Buyer under Section 9.2(a)(i) until, and only to the extent that, Buyers aggregate Damages exceed $500,000 per Station and (ii) the maximum aggregate liability of Seller under Section 9.2(a)(i) shall be an amount equal to 20% of the Purchase Price, except with respect to a breach by Seller of its representations and warranties contained in Section 2.5 (Taxes) and 2.9 (Environmental), in which case the maximum liability of Seller in the aggregate with all other liability of Seller under Section 9.2(a)(1) shall be an amount equal to 50% of the Purchase Price. 

  

 (c) From and after Closing, Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller from and against any and all Damages incurred by Seller arising out of or resulting from:

 9.3. _Procedures_. 

  

 (a) The indemnified party shall give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any demand, suit, claim or assertion of liability by third parties that is subject to indemnification hereunder (a "Claim"), but a failure to give such notice or delaying such notice shall not affect the indemnified partys rights or the indemnifying partys obligations except to the extent the indemnifying partys ability to remedy, contest, defend or settle with respect to such Claim is thereby prejudiced and provided that such notice is given within the time period described in Section 9.1. 

   

 (b) The indemnifying party shall have the right to undertake the defense or opposition to such Claim with counsel selected by it. In the event that the indemnifying party does not undertake such defense or opposition in a timely manner, the indemnified party may undertake the defense, opposition, compromise or settlement of such Claim with counsel selected by it at the indemnifying partys cost (subject to the right of the indemnifying party to assume defense of or opposition to such Claim at any time prior to settlement, compromise or final determination thereof). 

   

 (c) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding: 

   

 (i) the indemnified party shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense, opposition, compromise or settlement of the Claim; 

  

 (ii) the indemnifying party shall not, without the indemnified partys written consent, settle or compromise any Claim or consent to entry of any judgment which does not include the giving by the claimant to the indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such Claim; and 

  

 (iii) in the event that the indemnifying party undertakes defense of or opposition to any Claim, the indemnified party, by counsel or other representative of its own choosing and at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right to consult with the indemnifying party and its counsel concerning such Claim and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and their respective counsel shall cooperate in good faith with respect to such Claim. 

  

 (d) Seller and Buyer agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article 9 as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all income Tax purposes. 

   

ARTICLE 10: _TERMINATION AND REMEDIES_  

    ##### 

  

     

 10.1. _Termination_. Subject to Section 10.3, this Agreement may be terminated prior to Closing as follows: 

  

 (a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller; 

   

 (b) by written notice of Buyer to Seller if Seller breaches its representations or warranties or defaults in the performance of its covenants contained in this Agreement and such breach or default is material in the context of the transactions contemplated hereby and is not cured within the Cure Period (defined below); 

   

 (c) by written notice of Seller to Buyer if Buyer breaches its representations or warranties or defaults in the performance of its covenants contained in this Agreement and such breach or default is material in the context of the transactions contemplated hereby and is not cured within the Cure Period; provided, however, that the Cure Period shall not apply to Buyers obligations to make the Deposit on the date hereof and to pay the Purchase Price at Closing; or 

   

 (d) by written notice of Seller to Buyer or Buyer to Seller if Closing does not occur by the date twelve (12) months after the date of this Agreement (the "Outside Date"), except as provided by Section 1.12. 

   

 10.2. _Cure Period_. Each party shall give the other party prompt written notice upon learning of any breach or default by the other party under this Agreement. The term "Cure Period" as used herein means a period commencing on the date Buyer or Seller receives from the other written notice of breach or default hereunder and continuing until the earlier of (i) twenty (20) calendar days thereafter or (ii) five (5) business days after the scheduled Closing date; provided, however, that if the breach or default is non-monetary and cannot reasonably be cured within such period but can be cured before the date five (5) business days after the scheduled Closing date, and if diligent efforts to cure promptly commence, then the Cure Period shall continue as long as such diligent efforts to cure continue, but not beyond the date five (5) business days after the scheduled Closing date. 

  

 10.3. _Survival_. Neither party may terminate under Sections 10.1(b) or (c) if it is then in material default under this Agreement. Except as provided by Section 10.5, the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party of any liability for breach or default under this Agreement prior to the date of termination. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Sections 1.6 (Deposit) (and Sections 10.4 and 10.5 with respect to the Deposit), 5.1 (Confidentiality) and 11.1 (Expenses) shall survive any termination of this Agreement. 

  

 10.4. _Specific Performance_. In the event of failure or threatened failure by either party to comply with the terms of this Agreement, the other party shall be entitled to an injunction restraining such failure or threatened failure and, subject to obtaining any necessary FCC consent, to enforcement of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance requiring compliance with this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if prior to Closing Seller has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(c), then Sellers sole remedy shall be termination of this Agreement and receipt of the liquidated damages amount pursuant to Section 10.5, except for any failure by Buyer to comply with its obligations related to the 

   ##### 

  

 

Deposit or Sections 1.10, 5.1, 5.2 or 5.3, as to which Seller shall be
entitled to all available rights and remedies, including without limitation
specific performance. 

   

 10.5. _Liquidated Damages_. If Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(c), then Buyer shall pay Seller on demand an amount equal to 15% of the Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately available funds, and such payment shall constitute liquidated damages and the sole remedy of Seller under this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Sellers recovery of such amount shall constitute payment of liquidated damages and not a penalty and that Sellers liquidated damages amount is reasonable in light of the substantial but indeterminate harm anticipated to be caused by Buyers material breach or default under this Agreement, the difficulty of proof of loss and damages, the inconvenience and non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and the value of the transactions to be consummated hereunder. 

  

ARTICLE 11: _MISCELLANEOUS_  

   

 11.1. _Expenses_. Each party shall be solely responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with the negotiation, preparation and performance of and compliance with the terms of this Agreement. All governmental fees and charges applicable to any requests for Governmental Consents shall be paid by the party upon whom the applicable governmental authority imposes the fee or charge (or shall be shared equally if not imposed upon either party). Buyer and Seller shall each pay one-half of all governmental taxes, fees and charges applicable to the transfer of the Station Assets under this Agreement. Each party is responsible for any commission, brokerage fee, advisory fee or other similar payment that arises as a result of any agreement or action of it or any party acting on its behalf in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 11.2. _Further Assurances_. After Closing, each party shall from time to time, at the request of and without further cost or expense to the other, execute and deliver such other instruments of conveyance and assumption and take such other actions as may reasonably be requested in order to more effectively consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 11.3. _Assignment_. Except as provided by Section 5.9 (1031 Exchange), neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party hereto. The terms of this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties respective successors and any permitted assigns, and no assignment shall relieve any party of any obligation or liability under this Agreement. 

  

 11.4. _Notices_. Any notice pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed delivered on the date of personal delivery or confirmed facsimile transmission or confirmed delivery by a nationally recognized overnight courier service, and shall be addressed as follows (or to such other address as any party may request by written notice):

No party makes any representation or warranty with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller makes no representation or warranty to Buyer with respect to any projections, budgets or other estimates of the Stations revenues, expenses or results of operations, or, except as expressly set forth in Article 2, any other financial or other information made available to Buyer with respect to the Stations. 

   ##### 

  

  

 11.7. _Severability_. If any court or governmental authority holds any provision in this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable under any applicable law, then, so long as no party is deprived of the benefits of this Agreement in any material respect, this Agreement shall be construed with the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision deleted and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not be affected or impaired thereby. 

  

 11.8. _No Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement expressed or implied is intended or shall be construed to give any rights to any person or entity other than the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 11.9. _Governing Law_. The construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to the choice of law provisions thereof. 

  

 11.10. _Neutral Construction_. Buyer and Seller agree that this Agreement was negotiated at arms-length and that the final terms hereof are the product of the parties negotiations. This Agreement shall be deemed to have been jointly and equally drafted by Buyer and Seller, and the provisions hereof should not be construed against a party on the grounds that the party drafted or was more responsible for drafting the provision. 

  

 11.11. _Cooperation_. After Closing, Buyer shall cooperate with Seller in the investigation, defense or prosecution of any action which is pending or threatened against Seller or its affiliates with respect to the Stations, whether or not any party has notified the other of a claim for indemnity with respect to such matter. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall make available its employees to give depositions or testimony and shall furnish all documentary or other evidence that Seller may reasonably request. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Section 11.11. 

  

 11.12. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and all of which together will constitute one and the same agreement.
