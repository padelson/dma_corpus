ARTICLE II 

_PURCHASE PRICE; CLOSING_

 

Section 2.1 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price for the PMD Shares
and the PMD Assets shall be (i) $3,800,000,000 (the " _Base Purchase Price_
"), (ii) _plus_ the Final Closing Cash, (iii) _minus_ the Final Closing
Indebtedness and (iv) (A) _plus_ , if the Final Closing Net Working Capital

Working Capital, the full amount by which the Reference Net Working Capital
exceeds the Final Closing Net Working Capital (the aggregate of the foregoing
clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), the " _Purchase Price_ ").

 



2 Section 2.2 _Payment of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) No later than four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, APD shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer (i) a statement setting forth its good faith
estimates of the Closing Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital_ "), the Closing Cash (the " _Estimated Closing Cash_ ") and
the Closing Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ "), as
estimated in accordance with the Accounting Principles together with
reasonable documentation supporting the basis of all such calculations (the "
_Estimated Statement_ "); and (ii) a funds flow statement consistent with
_Schedule D_ and _Schedule E_ including wire transfer instructions (the "
_Funds Flow Statement_ "). APD shall in good faith consider any changes
requested by Buyer to the Estimated Statement and the Funds Flow Statement.

(b) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay, on behalf of the PMD Share Buyers and the
PMD Asset Buyers, to the PMD Share Sellers and PMD Assets Sellers as set
forth in _Schedule D_ an aggregate amount equal to (i) the Base Purchase
Price, (ii) _plus_ the Estimated Closing Cash, (iii) _minus_ the Estimated
Closing Indebtedness and (iv) (A)  _plus_ , if the Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital exceeds the Reference Net Working Capital, the full amount by
which the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital exceeds the Reference Net
Working Capital or (B) _minus_ , if the Reference Net Working Capital exceeds
the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, the full amount by which the
Reference Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital (the aggregate of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and
(iv), the " _Preliminary Purchase Price_ "), in immediately available funds
to the accounts designated in the Funds Flow Statement.

 

Section 2.3 _Exchange Rate_.

 

(a) _Schedule E_ sets forth those jurisdictions where, pursuant to applicable
Law, a portion of the Purchase Price or Preliminary Purchase Price that is
attributable to the sale and purchase of any PMD Shares or PMD Assets in such
jurisdictions other than the United States must be paid in a currency other
than dollars. All payments shall be made by the applicable PMD Share Buyer or
PMD Asset Buyer in local currency converted at the applicable spot exchange
rate for value at Closing to be determined in accordance with _Schedule E_.

 

(b) For purposes of applying any dollars denominated threshold amounts or
limitations on indemnification to Losses denominated in a currency other than
dollars, the amounts of such Losses shall be converted into dollars using an
exchange rate equal to average of the prevailing exchange rate for
transactions as published by _The Wall Street Journal_ published on each of
the five (5) consecutive Business Days immediately preceding the date on
which the indemnification payment for such Loss is made.

Section 2.4 _The Closing_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including Section
2.4(b), the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Closing_ ") shall, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article VII, be held at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher and Flom LLP at Four Times Square, New York, New 

 



3  York (or such other place or places as the parties may mutually agree), (A)
on the sixth Business Day after all the conditions precedent set forth in
Article VII are satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that, by
their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing; _provided_ that such
conditions would be so satisfied) or (B) on such other date as the parties may
mutually agree in writing. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_." Notwithstanding the actual
occurrence of the Closing at any particular time on the Closing Date, the
Closing shall be deemed effective as of 12:01 a.m. New York time on the
Closing Date (the " _Effective Time_ ") with APD owning the PMD Assets and the
PMD Shares for the entire calendar day immediately preceding the Closing Date
and Buyer owning the PMD Assets and the PMD Shares for the entire Closing
Date.

(b) The sale and purchase of any PMD Shares and PMD Assets in the
jurisdictions outside the United States set forth in  _Schedule F_ shall
occur in escrow on the Local Business Day immediately preceding the Closing
Date at the locations and times set forth in _Schedule F_ (each, a " _Local
Closing_ "). At each Local Closing, the relevant PMD Share Seller or PMD
Asset Seller, as the case may be, shall deliver the respective Local Purchase
Agreement (to the extent not previously delivered) and any documents,
certificates and instruments contemplated thereby to the relevant PMD Share
Buyer or PMD Asset Buyer, as the case may be, and the relevant PMD Share Buyer
or PMD Asset Buyer shall deliver the respective Local Purchase Agreement and
any documents, certificates and instruments contemplated thereby to
the relevant PMD Share Seller or PMD Asset Seller, as the case may be
(collectively, the " _Local Closing Documents_ "). The consummation of each
Local Closing shall be subject to the condition precedent that the Closing
occurs. All agreements and documents executed at the respective Local Closing
shall be held in escrow pending the Closing. If the Closing does not occur,
all agreements and documents executed at the respective Local Closing and held
in escrow shall be returned to the parties that have executed such documents
and such parties shall be returned to their respective positions preceding the
Local Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, the payment of any portion of the
Purchase Price or Preliminary Purchase Price attributable to a Local Closing
shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VII and shall be made at the time at which the Closing occurs in
accordance with Section 2.4(a).

 

(c) On the Closing Date, APD shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer
the following (except as otherwise provided in Section 5.24): 

(i) the Local Closing Documents (released from escrow) duly executed by APD or
its Subsidiaries (to the extent each is a party thereto), to the extent not
executed and delivered by such parties at a Local Closing;

(ii) certificates (where applicable) or equivalent documents representing the
PMD Shares duly endorsed (or accompanied by a duly executed stock power) and
in form for transfer to Buyer;

 

(iii) such duly executed deeds and other good and sufficient instruments of
conveyance and transfer as shall be effective to vest good and marketable
title in Buyer to the Owned Real Property, free and clear of Encumbrances
except Permitted Encumbrances;

 



4 (iv) the Related Agreements and the Other Transaction Documents, duly
executed by APD or its Subsidiaries (to the extent each is a party thereto),
to the extent not executed and delivered by such parties prior to the Closing;

 

(v) an owners affidavit, non-imputation affidavit, and GAP undertaking in
form reasonably requested by Buyers title company, together with such other
and further documents as may be reasonably required to consummate the transfer
of the Owned Real Property as may be reasonably required by Buyers title
company to issue a title insurance policy for the Owned Real Property that is
subject only to Permitted Encumbrances, and all real property transfer tax
declarations, if required under applicable law;

 

(vi) a certificate of non-foreign status that complies with Section 1445 of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, duly executed by each of
the Sellers listed on Section 2.4(c)(vi) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule;

(vii) a duly executed bill of sale and assignment, in the form attached as
_Exhibit B_ hereto, and such other instruments or documents as the Buyer may
reasonably request to evidence the PMD Asset Buyers purchase of the Acquired
PMD Assets or otherwise necessary to provide for the transactions
contemplated hereby; and

(viii) all other documents expressly required to be delivered by APD or its
Affiliates on or prior to the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement.

(d) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to APD
or its designee the following:

(i) the Local Closing Documents (released from escrow) duly executed by Buyer
or its Subsidiaries (to the extent each is a party thereto), to the extent not
executed and delivered by such parties prior to the Closing;

 

(ii) the Preliminary Purchase Price in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to an account or accounts at such bank or banks specified in the
Funds Flow Statement;

(iii) the Related Agreements and the Other Transaction Documents,

the Closing;

 

(iv) a duly executed instrument of assumption, in the form attached as

their Affiliates from) the Assumed Liabilities, or otherwise reasonably
required by APD in connection herewith; and

(v) all other documents expressly required to be delivered by Buyer or its
Affiliates on or prior to the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement.

 



5 Section 2.5 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) _Post-Closing Purchase Price Determination_.

 

(i) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90) days after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to APD a statement (the "
_Preliminary Adjustment Statement_ ") containing a reasonably detailed
calculation by Buyer of the Closing Net Working Capital of the PMD Business,
the Closing Cash and the Closing Indebtedness, in each case as of the
Effective Time prepared in substantially the same format as the Estimated
Statement (the " _Closing Adjustment Amounts_ "), all prepared on a basis
consistent with the Accounting Principles.

 

(ii) In connection with Buyers preparation of the Preliminary Adjustment
Statement, APD shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (A) provide
reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to
its employees and all work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents
prepared or reviewed by APD or any of its employees and accountants or other
Representatives which are relevant to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement
(which access shall be provided promptly after request by Buyer and/or its
Representatives) and (B) use its reasonable best efforts to cause APDs
independent accountant to communicate and cooperate with Buyer and its
Representatives with respect to such preparation; _provided_ , _that_ , APD
shall not be required to disclose any Privileged information.

 

(iii) If APD disagrees with Buyers calculation of the Closing Adjustment
Amounts, APD shall promptly, but in no event later than forty-five (45) days
after receiving the Preliminary Adjustment Statement (the " _Review Period_ ")
deliver to Buyer written notice describing its dispute by specifying those
items or amounts as to which APD disagrees, together with APDs determination
of such disputed items and amounts and a description setting forth in
reasonable detail the nature of the disputed items (a " _Dispute Notice_ ").
If APD either gives notice that it agrees with Buyers calculation of the
Closing Adjustment Amounts or fails to deliver a Dispute Notice within the
Review Period, Buyer and APD agree that the Preliminary Adjustment Statement
shall be deemed to set forth the Closing Adjustment Amounts with respect to
those items that have been agreed upon or for which APD shall have failed to
deliver a Dispute Notice (and shall constitute the respective Final Adjustment
Amount). If APD delivers a Dispute Notice to Buyer within the Review Period,
APD and Buyer will use good faith efforts to resolve the dispute during the
thirty (30)-day period commencing on the date APD delivers the Dispute Notice
to Buyer (and all such discussions related thereto shall be governed by Rule
408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule
and evidence of such discussions shall not be admissible in any future
proceedings between the parties). If Buyer and APD are not able to resolve all
disputed items within such thirty (30)-day period, then either party shall
have the right to submit the items in dispute following the expiration of such
thirty (30)-day period to Ernst and Young LLP, or if Ernst and Young LLP is
unwilling to serve, another mutually acceptable internationally recognized
independent accounting firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). The Accounting Firm
shall be given reasonable access to all relevant records of the PMD Business
to calculate the Closing Adjustment Amounts. If any remaining issues

 



6  in dispute are submitted to the Accounting Firm for resolution, each of
Buyer and APD will be afforded an opportunity to present to the Accounting
Firm any material relating to the determination of the matters in dispute
(with a simultaneous copy to the other party) and to discuss such matters with
the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall calculate, based solely on the
written submissions of Buyer, on the one hand, and APD, on the other hand,
and not by independent investigation, and only with respect to the matters in
dispute, the Closing Adjustment Amounts and shall be instructed that its
calculation (A) must be made in accordance with the standards and definitions
in this Agreement (including the Accounting Principles) and _Schedule A_,
and (B) with respect to each item in dispute, must be within the range of
values established for such amount as determined by reference to the value
assigned to such amount by APD in the Dispute Notice and by Buyer in the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement. APD and Buyer shall instruct the Accounting
Firm to submit such calculation to APD and Buyer as soon as practicable, but
in any event within thirty (30) days after the remaining issues in dispute
are submitted to the Accounting Firm. The determination by the Accounting Firm
of the Closing Adjustment Amounts, as set forth in a written notice delivered
to Buyer and APD by the Accounting Firm in accordance with this Agreement,
will be binding and conclusive on Buyer and APD. The Closing Adjustment
Amounts as determined after all disputes have been resolved in accordance with
this Section 2.5(a) are referred to herein collectively as the " _Final
Adjustment Amounts_ " and individually as the " _Final Closing Net Working
Capital_ ", the " _Final Closing Cash_ " and the " _Final Closing
Indebtedness_ ", respectively.

 

(iv) The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by Buyer in
the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of the items that are
successfully disputed by APD (as finally determined by the Accounting Firm)
bears to the aggregate dollar amount of the items submitted to the Accounting
Firm and by APD in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of
the disputed items that are unsuccessfully disputed by APD (as finally
determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of the
items submitted to the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall include such
apportionment of its fees and expenses in its determination.

(v) In connection with APDs review of the Preliminary Adjustment
Statement, Buyer shall (A) provide reasonable access, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice, to its employees and all work papers,
schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared or reviewed by Buyer or any
of its employees and accountants or other representatives during the course
of its review which are relevant to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement
(which access shall be provided promptly after request by APD and/or its
representatives) and (B) use its reasonable best efforts to cause Buyers
independent accountant to communicate and cooperate with APD and its
Representatives with respect to such review; _provided_ , _that_ , Buyer shall
not be required to disclose any Privileged information.

 

(vi) The process set forth in this Section 2.5(a) shall be the exclusive
process of APD and Buyer for the resolution of any disputes related to the
Closing Adjustment Amounts.

 



7 (b) _Final Purchase Price Determination_.

 

(i) Promptly upon the determination of the Final Adjustment Amounts, the
parties shall determine the amount that would have been paid pursuant to
Section 2.2 if the Final Adjustment Amounts had been substituted for the
Estimated Closing Cash, Estimated Closing Indebtedness and the Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital, respectively.

 

(ii) If such substitution when netted, would have resulted in a Purchase Price
that is less than the Preliminary Purchase Price paid at Closing, then APD
shall pay to Buyer an aggregate amount equal to such shortfall pursuant to
Section 2.5(b)(v).

 

(iii) If such substitution when netted, would have resulted in a Purchase
Price that is greater than the Preliminary Purchase Price paid at Closing,
then Buyer shall pay to APD an aggregate amount equal to such excess pursuant
to Section 2.5(b)(v).

 

(iv) If such substitution when netted, would have resulted in a Purchase Price
that is equal to the Preliminary Purchase Price paid at Closing, then there
shall be no adjustment to the Preliminary Purchase Price.

(v) Buyer or APD, as the case may be, shall, within five (5) Business Days of
the determination of the Final Adjustment Amounts make any payments pursuant
to Section 2.5(b)(ii) or (iii), as the case may be, to the other by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by
the other, together with interest thereon at a rate equal to the prime rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the Closing Date, for the
period from the Closing Date through and including the earlier of the date of
payment and the date on which such payment is made.

Section 2.6 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) Attached as _Schedule D_ is a schedule setting forth the allocation of
the Base Purchase Price, among the PMD Shares and the PMD Asset Sellers (the
" _Base Purchase Price_ _Allocation_ ") which shall be conclusive and binding
on APD, Buyer and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates. No later than
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer, on behalf of itself, the PMD
Share Buyers and the PMD Asset Buyers, shall deliver to APD a schedule (the "
_Closing Adjustments Allocation Schedule_ "), allocating the Closing
Adjustment Amounts, among the PMD Shares and the PMD Asset Sellers, which
allocation: (i) shall, in all cases, be consistent with the Base Purchase
Price Allocation, (ii) shall allocate the amounts described in Sections
2.1(ii) and 2.1(iii) based on the PMD Shares and the PMD Asset Sellers to
which such amounts relate, and (iii) shall allocate the amount described in
Section 2.1(iv) in accordance with the Base Purchase Price Allocation. If APD
disagrees with the Closing Adjustments Allocation Schedule, APD may, within
thirty (30) days after delivery of the Closing Adjustments Allocation
Schedule, deliver a notice (the " _APD Allocation Notice_ " to Buyer to such
effect, specifying those items as to which APD disagrees and setting forth 

 



8  APDs proposed allocation. If the APD Allocation Notice is duly delivered,
Buyer and APD shall, during the twenty (20) days following such delivery, use
commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts. If Buyer and APD are unable to reach such agreement, they shall
promptly thereafter cause the Accounting Firm to resolve any remaining
disputes (it being understood that no adjustment shall be made by the
Accounting Firm to the Base Purchase Price Allocation). The Closing
Adjustments Allocation Schedule, as it may be adjusted pursuant to any
agreement between APD and Buyer or as determined by the Accounting Firm, and
as further adjusted as appropriate to reflect Final Closing Cash, Final
Closing Indebtedness and Final Closing Net Working Capital, in each case as
determined pursuant to Section 2.5, shall be applied to the Base Purchase
Price Allocation and, as so applied, shall become the final allocation of the
Purchase Price among the PMD Shares and the PMD Asset Sellers (the " _Final
Allocation_ "), which shall be conclusive and binding on APD, Buyer and their
respective Affiliates.

 

(b) APD and Buyer shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates to) (i) be bound by the Final Allocation for purposes of
determining any Taxes, (ii) prepare and file IRS Form 8594 and any other
comparable forms required under applicable Tax Law in a manner consistent with
the Final Allocation, (iii) prepare and file its Tax Returns on a basis
consistent with the Final Allocation and (iv) take no position inconsistent
with the Final Allocation on any applicable Tax Return or in any proceeding
before any Tax Authority, except as otherwise required pursuant to a Final
Determination. In the event that a Tax Authority disputes the Final
Allocation, the party receiving notice of such dispute shall promptly notify
the other party hereto, and APD and Buyer shall (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to) use their reasonable best efforts
to defend such Final Allocation in any applicable proceeding, and the matter
shall be handled as a Tax Audit.

(c) No later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date,
Buyer, on behalf of itself, the PMD Share Buyers and the PMD Asset Buyers,
shall deliver to APD a schedule (the " _Preliminary Asset Allocation Schedule_
") (i) allocating among the Acquired PMD Assets sold by each PMD Asset Seller
the Purchase Price allocated to such PMD Asset Seller on the Final Allocation
and any relevant Assumed Liabilities and (ii) allocating among the assets of
US63, any Required 338 Entity and any Transferred DRE the Purchase Price
allocated to the applicable PMD Share Seller on the Final Allocation and any
relevant Assumed Liabilities, in each case, in a manner consistent with
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder
to the extent applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, the Preliminary Asset
Allocation Schedule shall be limited to the specific assets and liabilities
described in the immediately preceding sentence and shall be consistent in
all respects with the Final Allocation. If APD disagrees with the Preliminary
Asset Allocation Schedule, APD may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of
the Preliminary Asset Allocation Schedule, deliver a notice (the " _APD
Asset Allocation Notice_ ") to Buyer to such effect, specifying those items
as to which APD disagrees and setting forth APDs proposed allocation. If the
APD Asset Allocation Notice is duly delivered, Buyer and APD shall, during the
twenty (20) days following such delivery, use commercially reasonable efforts
to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts. If Buyer and APD are
unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause the
Accounting Firm to resolve any remaining disputes. The Preliminary Asset
Allocation Schedule, as it may be adjusted pursuant to any agreement between
APD and Buyer or as determined by the Accounting Firm, shall be conclusive and
binding on APD, Buyer and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates.

 



9 (d) APD and Buyer shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates to) allocate any post-Closing adjustment to the Purchase Price or
any other items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes
(including the Assumed Liabilities) to the relevant Transferred PMD Company or
the PMD Asset Seller; shall further allocate such adjustment, if relevant for
purposes of any applicable Law, to the assets to which such adjustment
relates; and shall make any corresponding changes required to reflect such
adjustment; in each case as reasonably determined by APD and Buyer consistent
with the Base Purchase Price Allocation and, to the greatest extent reasonably
possible, with the Final Allocation. In the event of any such adjustment, the
parties shall timely file with any relevant Tax Authority any additional
information required to be filed under applicable Law.

Section 2.7 _Withholding Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any party making a
payment under this Agreement shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
such payment the amounts required to be deducted and withheld under the Code,
or any provision of any U.S. federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if either party becomes aware that any amount
is required to be so withheld, it shall promptly notify the other party of
any such required withholding and the parties shall cooperate with each other
in good faith (including by taking all reasonable actions requested by the
other party to the extent such actions would not reasonably be expected to
have an adverse impact on the requested party) to minimize or eliminate such
withholding Taxes; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ that Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to give written notice to APD of any
withholding from any payment made pursuant to this Article II as soon as
reasonably practicable and in any event within 15 Business Days prior to the
date of such payment. Subject to Section 2.7(b), any amounts so withheld, to
the extent paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority, shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

(b) If any Taxes are required by any jurisdiction to be deducted or withheld
from any payment made pursuant to this Article II and such requirement to
deduct or withhold arose or arises as a result of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates having been organized under the laws of, or having a place of
business in, a jurisdiction, in each case, under circumstances where (and to
the extent) such deduction or withholding of Tax would not have been required
had Buyer or any of its Affiliates been organized under the laws of, or had a
place of business in, another jurisdiction, such payment shall be increased as
necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made
(including deductions and withholding applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 2.7), the recipient of such payment receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding
been made.

 



10 ARTICLE III

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF APD_

 

APD hereby represents and warrants to Buyer that, except as set forth in the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule (provided that any disclosure as an exception
to, or in response to a listing requirement contained in, a representation or
warranty in a section or subsection of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule shall
apply to the corresponding section or subsection of this Article III, as well
as to matters represented or warranted in such other sections or subsections
of this Article III with respect to which it is reasonably apparent on the
face of such disclosure that such disclosure would apply or qualify):

 

Section 3.1 _Organization, Etc_ _._ Each of APD, the PMD Share Sellers and the
PMD Asset Sellers (in respect of the PMD Business) and the Transferred PMD
Companies is a corporation, partnership or other legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing (to the extent such concept is
recognized) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation
or organization. Each of the Transferred PMD Companies has all requisite
power and authority to conduct its business as it is now being conducted and
to own, lease and operate its property and assets, except where the failure to
have such power and authority would not, in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be materially adverse to the PMD Business. Each of APD (in respect
of the PMD Business), the PMD Share Sellers, the PMD Asset Sellers (in respect
of the PMD Business) and the Transferred PMD Companies is qualified or
licensed to do business in each jurisdiction in which ownership of property or
the conduct of its business requires such qualification or license, except
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the PMD
Business. True and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and by-
laws (or comparable governing documents) of each of the Transferred PMD
Companies have been made available to Buyer.

Section 3.2 _Authority Relative to this Agreement, Etc_ _._ APD has, and each
other Seller has or will have, immediately prior to the Closing, all requisite
corporate or other power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement,
the Local Purchase Agreements, any Related Agreements and any
Other Transaction Documents to which it is a party and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the Local Purchase Agreements, the Related Agreements and the
Other Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by APD, and
immediately prior to the Closing will have been authorized by each other
Seller, to the extent party thereto. Other than corporate approvals of the
Subsidiaries of APD, which will be obtained prior to the Closing, no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Sellers (and no action on the part of (i)
the board of directors (or similar governing body) of the Sellers or (ii)
stockholders of the Sellers) are necessary to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance in accordance with their respective terms of this
Agreement, the Local Purchase Agreements, the Related Agreements and the Other
Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. This Agreement, the Local Purchase Agreements, the Related
Agreements and the Other Transaction Documents, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been (or in the case of
the Related Agreements, the Other Transaction

 



11  Documents and certain of the Local Purchase Agreements will be) duly and
validly executed and delivered by each of the Sellers to the extent party
thereto and, assuming this Agreement and such other agreements have been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by each of Buyer, the PMD Asset Buyers and
the PMD Share Buyers to the extent a party thereto, each of this Agreement and
such other agreements constitutes (or in the case of the Related Agreements,
the Other Transaction Documents and certain of the Local Purchase Agreements
will constitute) a legal, valid and binding agreement of Sellers to the extent
party thereto, enforceable against each such Seller in accordance with its
terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights and to general equity principles.

 

Section 3.3 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) Section 3.3(a) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the
date hereof, the authorized and outstanding capital stock (or other equity
interests) of each Transferred PMD Company and the record and beneficial
owners of such outstanding capital stock (or other equity interests). All of
the issued and outstanding capital stock (or other equity interests) of
the Transferred PMD Companies are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable and free of any preemptive rights or Encumbrances in
respect thereof, other than Encumbrances imposed by federal, state or foreign
securities Laws. The PMD Share Sellers own and at the Closing will own, the
PMD Shares free and clear of any Encumbrances other than Encumbrances imposed
by federal, state or foreign securities Laws. Except as set forth in Section
3.3(a) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, agreements, understandings,
claims or other commitments or rights of any type or other securities (i)
requiring the issuance, sale, transfer, repurchase, redemption or other
acquisition of any shares of capital stock of any Transferred PMD Company,
(ii) restricting the transfer of any shares of capital stock of any
Transferred PMD Company or (iii) relating to the voting of any shares of
capital stock of any Transferred PMD Company.

(b) None of the Transferred PMD Companies owns any equity interest, or any
interest convertible into or exchangeable for an equity interest, in any
Person.

Section 3.4 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Neither the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by APD nor the
execution, delivery and performance of the Local Purchase Agreements, the
Related Agreements and the Other Transaction Documents by APD or the Sellers
party thereto, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby by APD or the Sellers, will (a) violate any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or other comparable governing
documents) of any Seller or any of the Transferred PMD Companies, (b) require
any consent, waiver, approval, license, authorization or permit of, or filing
with or notification to (collectively, the " _Governmental Filings_ "), any
Governmental Authority except for (i) filings with the Federal
Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and with the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") pursuant to the HSR Act,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (ii) requirements of
any foreign Regulatory Laws and Laws regulating trade or exchange or currency
controls, and (iii) such consents, waivers, approvals, licenses,
authorizations, permits, filings or notifications which, if not obtained or
made, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
be materially adverse to the PMD Business or materially impair or materially
delay

 



12  the ability of the Sellers to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (c) conflict with, result in a violation or breach of, or
constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default under,
or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
obligation of any PMD Asset Seller (in respect of the PMD Business) or any of
the Transferred PMD Companies under any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any Material Contract, except such conflicts, violations,
breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations and accelerations which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be
materially adverse to the PMD Business or materially impair or materially
delay the ability of the Sellers to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or (d) assuming the making of the Governmental Filings and
obtaining of the related approval referred to in clause (b)(i) or (b)(ii)
above, violate any Law applicable to any PMD Asset Seller or any of the
Transferred PMD Companies or by which any of their respective properties or
Assets may be bound, except for such violations which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the
PMD Business or materially impair or materially delay the ability of the
Sellers to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

Section 3.5 _Financial Statements_. Section 3.5 of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule sets forth the unaudited combined balance sheet and statement of
income of the PMD Business as of December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015,

Statements set forth in Section 3.5 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule).

 

Section 3.6 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as set forth on Section 3.6

Agreement, since December 31, 2015 (a) through the date hereof, APD has
operated the PMD Business in all material respects in the ordinary course of
business consistent with its past practice, (b) through the date hereof,
none of APD, any of the PMD Share Sellers, any of the PMD Asset Sellers (in
respect of the PMD Business) or any of the Transferred PMD Companies have
taken or agreed to take any action that, if taken during the period from the
date of this Agreement through the Closing without Buyers prior consent,
would constitute a breach (after giving effect to the last paragraph of
Section 5.1) of Section 5.1(c), (d), (g), (k) and (p), and (c) there has not
been any change, event or development that has had, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

with respect to any Excluded Assets or Retained Liabilities, the PMD Business
has been conducted in compliance with applicable Law in all material respects.
Other than with respect to any Excluded Assets or Retained Liabilities, the
Transferred PMD Companies and the PMD Asset Sellers (in respect of the PMD
Business) have all governmental permits, licenses, certificates,
qualifications, registrations, approvals for their products, other approvals
and other similar authorizations necessary for the conduct of the PMD
Business as presently conducted (the " _Permits_ ") and are in compliance with
the terms of the Permits in all material respects. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Section 3.7, no representation or warranty shall be deemed
to be made in this Section 3.7 in respect of any matter the subject matter of
which is specifically covered by Section 3.10, Section 3.11, Section 3.13,
Section 3.14, Section 3.15 or Section 3.19.

2015 in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice, (d)
for Liabilities set forth on Section 3.8 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule,
or (e) for Retained Liabilities, the PMD Business is not subject to any
Liabilities that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated
balance sheet of the PMD Business other than Liabilities which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be materially
adverse to the PMD Business. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Section 3.8, no representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made in this
Section 3.8 in respect of any matter the subject matter of which is
specifically covered by Section 3.7, Section 3.9, Section 3.10, Section 3.13,
Section 3.14, Section 3.15 or Section 3.19.

Section 3.9 _Litigation_. Except as set forth on Section 3.9 of the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule and for Actions solely relating to the Excluded Assets or
the Retained Liabilities, as of the date of this Agreement, there is no
material Action pending, or, to the Knowledge of APD, threatened, against a
Transferred PMD Company, APD, any of its Affiliates or the PMD Asset Sellers
(in respect of the PMD Business) relating to or involving the PMD Business or
any properties or rights of a Transferred PMD Company. As of the date of this
Agreement, none of the Transferred PMD Companies, APD, any of its Affiliates
or the PMD Asset Sellers (in respect of the PMD Business) has, since October
1, 2013, received notice that it is subject to any outstanding injunction,

tribunal reasonably expected to be materially adverse to the PMD Business.

paid on its behalf) all material Taxes due and owing, regardless of whether
required to be shown as due on such Tax Returns.

(b) There is no Tax Audit pending against or with respect to any Transferred
PMD Company in respect of any material Tax and no written or, to APDs
Knowledge, unwritten notice of such a Tax Audit with respect to any material
Tax has been received by APD, any Affiliate of APD or any Transferred PMD
Company, other than as a result of any such Transferred PMD Company being a
member of any affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary Tax group.

 



14 (c) No material deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or
assessed in writing by a Tax Authority against any Transferred PMD Company
that are still pending, other than as a result of any such Transferred PMD
Company being a member of any affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary
Tax group.

 

(d) There are no material liens for Taxes upon the PMD Shares, the Acquired
PMD Assets or the Assets or property of any Transferred PMD Company, except

(e) No Transferred PMD Company is currently the beneficiary of any outstanding
waivers of any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or extensions of
time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency and no request for any
such a waiver or extension is currently outstanding, other than as a result of
any such Transferred PMD Company being a member of any affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax group.

(f) No Transferred PMD Company (i) is a party to any Tax allocation,
indemnity, sharing or similar agreement that will not be terminated and
settled prior to the Closing (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Contract entered into in the ordinary course of business containing customary
Tax allocation or gross-up provisions and which does not relate primarily to
Taxes), or (ii) is liable for the Taxes of any other Person (other than a
Transferred PMD Company) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or a
similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, including on the basis
of Sections 34, 35, 39 and 43 of the Dutch Collection Act 1990 (
_Invorderingswet_ 1990)), as a transferee or successor, by Contract or
otherwise.

 

(g) All material Taxes required to be withheld by APD or its Affiliates (with
respect to the PMD Business) in connection with the amounts paid to
employees, independent contractors, stockholders, creditors and other third
parties have been withheld and have been duly and timely paid to the
appropriate Tax Authority.

 

(h) No Transferred PMD Company will be required to include any material item
of income in, or exclude any material item of deduction from, taxable income
for any Post-Closing Tax Period as a result of any: (i) change in method of
accounting for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) use of an improper method of
accounting for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) "closing agreement"
as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or a similar provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date, (iv)
installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the
Closing Date, (v) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date, or
(vi) election under Section 108(i) of the Code.

(i) Each Transferred PMD Company is and at all times has been resident for
Tax purposes solely in the country in which it is incorporated. No Transferred
PMD Company has a permanent establishment (within the meaning of an applicable
Tax treaty) or an office or fixed place of business in a country other than
the country in which it is incorporated or organized.

(j) All claims made by each Transferred PMD Company for group relief or
allowance were valid when made and have been or will be allowed by way of
relief

 



15  from, or allowance or credit against, Tax. All arrangements entered into by
any Transferred PMD Company in relation to groups and consolidated groups for
Tax purposes and fiscal unities were valid when made and will be valid up to
the Closing Date.

(k) Each PMD Asset Seller (with respect to the PMD Business) or
Transferred PMD Company that is organized outside of the United States is a
taxable person for the purposes of VAT, and is registered for the purposes of
VAT solely in the country of its incorporation. No Transferred PMD Company has
any material VAT invoice on purchase which cannot be credited as input VAT,
or has enjoyed excessive VAT refund for exported goods due to inaccurate
information filed with the applicable customs authority.

 

(l) Any document that may be necessary or desirable in proving the title of
any Transferred PMD Company to any asset which is owned by such Transferred
PMD Company, is duly stamped for stamp duty purposes. No such documents which
are outside the United Kingdom would attract stamp duty if they were brought
into the United Kingdom.

 

(m) All material subsisting exemptions, reductions and rebates of Taxes
granted to any Transferred PMD Company by any Tax Authorities are in full
force and effect and have not been terminated. The Sale will not, and, to
APDs Knowledge, there is no other circumstance or event that will, result in
any such exemption, reduction or rebate being cancelled or terminated,
whether retroactively or for the future.

(n) No shares of a Transferred PMD Company are subject to a blocking period (
_Sperrfrist_ ) pursuant to the German Reorganization Tax Act (
_Umwandlungssteuergesetz_ ), under which actions after the Closing Date may
trigger German Taxes on any transaction carried out prior to the Closing Date.

 

(o) No shares of a Transferred PMD Company are subject to a lock-up period
pursuant to the Notice on the Corporate Income Tax Treatments of Corporate
Restructuring (Caishui (2009) No. 59) article 5 and article 7 for special tax
treatments, under which actions after the Closing Date may violate conditions
of the special tax treatments and trigger Chinese Taxes on any transaction
carried out prior to the Closing Date.

(p) No Tax Facility has been claimed by the Transferred PMD Company listed on
Section 3.10(p) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule which on the Closing Date
is still subject to a Claw Back.

(q) Except insofar as Section 3.11 relates to Taxes, notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, the representations and warranties made by
APD in this Section 3.10 are the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties made regarding Taxes or other Tax matters.

 

Section 3.11 _Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA_.

 

(a) Section 3.11(a) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule contains a true and
complete list, as of the date hereof, of each material: (i) health and
welfare plan, fund or program, (ii) pension or retirement plan, fund, program
or individual agreement, (iii) deferred compensation, incentive compensation,
equity or equity-based compensation plan or program, 

 



16  (iv) post-employment or post-retirement health or welfare, fund, or program,
and (v) other employee benefit plan, fund, program, agreement or arrangement,
in each case that is sponsored, maintained or contributed to by APD or its
Affiliates (or by any trade or business, whether or not incorporated, that
together with APD or its Affiliates would be deemed a "single employer" within
the meaning of section 4001(b) of ERISA (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ")) for the
benefit of any Business Employee, other than any plan, fund, program,
agreement or arrangement mandated by applicable Law (collectively, whether or
not material, the " _Business Plans_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, each
Business Plan that is sponsored by any of the Transferred PMD Companies (other
than a Foreign Transferred Business Plan) shall be referred to as a "
_Transferred Business Plan_." Section 3.11(a) of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule separately notes each (i) material Business Plan, and (ii) each
Transferred Business Plan and each Foreign Transferred Business Plan (whether
or not material). Within thirty (30) days following the date hereof, APD
shall revise Section 3.11(a) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule to include
each Business Plan, other than a Transferred Business Plan or Foreign
Transferred Business Plan, not included on such Section 3.11(a) of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule as of the date hereof.

(b) APD has made available, or will make available within thirty (30) days of
the date hereof, to Buyer true and complete copies of each material Business
Plan and each Transferred Business Plan or Foreign Transferred Business Plan
and each summary plan description (if applicable) with respect to each
material Business Plan, and each Transferred Business Plan or each Foreign
Transferred Business Plan. With respect to each Business Plan that is a
Transferred Business Plan or a Foreign Transferred Business Plan, APD has also
made available to Buyer any trust, deed or other funding vehicle, the most
recent reports or summaries required under ERISA, the Code or applicable Law.
APD has also made available the most recent determination or opinion letter
received from the IRS with respect to each Business Plan intended to qualify
under Section 401 of the Code.

(c) No Transferred Business Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA.
No liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Sections 412 or 430 of
the Code has been incurred by any of the Transferred PMD Companies or any of
their ERISA Affiliates, and no condition exists, in each case that could
reasonably present a material risk to any of the Transferred PMD Companies of
incurring any such liability. No Asset of any Transferred PMD Company or any
Acquired PMD Asset is subject to a lien pursuant to ERISA or the Code. Neither
APD nor any of its Affiliates contributes to, or has in the past five (5)
years contributed to, a Multiemployer Plan as it relates to Business
Employees. As to any Multiemployer Plan to which APD or its ERISA Affiliates
contribute or have an obligation to contribute within the last five (5)
years: (i) all contributions have been made as required by the terms of the
plans, the terms of any collective bargaining agreements and applicable Law;
(ii) neither APD nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has withdrawn from such
plans or received notice of any outstanding claim or demand for withdrawal
liability or partial withdrawal liability with respect to the Transferred PMD
Companies or any of their ERISA Affiliates; and (iii) neither APD nor
any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in any transaction which would give rise to a
liability of any of the Transferred PMD Companies under Section 4069 or
Section 4212(c) of ERISA.

 

(d) Each Business Plan has been operated and administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and applicable Law, including ERISA and
the Code, and with respect to each Business Plan, all contributions and
premium payments required

 



17  by Law or the terms of the Business Plan have been made or, if applicable,
accrued in accordance with GAAP and the Accounting Principles, in each case,
as it relates to the participation of any Business Employee.

(e) Each Business Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code is the subject of a favorable determination or
opinion letter to such effect from the IRS as to such qualification and, to
the Knowledge of APD, no events have occurred that could reasonably be
expected to result in the loss of such qualification.

 

(f) No Transferred Business Plan is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (with the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) or is otherwise subject
to Section 409A of the Code.

(g) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(g) of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule, no Business Plan provides medical, surgical, hospitalization, death
or similar benefits (whether or not insured) for Business Employees for
periods extending beyond their retirement or other termination of service,
other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable Law, (ii) death benefits under
any "pension plan," or (iii) benefits the full cost of which is borne by the
Business Employee (or his or her eligible beneficiary).

 

(h) Except to the extent required by applicable Law or set forth in Section
3.11(h) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedules, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not, either alone or in
combination with another event, (i) entitle any Business Employee to severance
pay, retention payments, unemployment compensation or any other payment
or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount, of
compensation due any Business Employee. Neither the execution of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
result in the payment under any Business Plan of any "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code. No Transferred
PMD Company has any contract or other obligation to "gross-up" any employee,
director or other service provider of any Transferred PMD Company for taxes
or excise taxes under Section 409A of the Code or Section 4999 of the Code.

(i) As of the date of this Agreement, there are (i) no pending or, to the
Knowledge of APD, threatened material claims, or facts that could reasonably
be expected to give rise to material claims, by or against any Transferred
Business Plan or Foreign Transferred Business Plan, by any employee or
beneficiary covered under any such Transferred Business Plan, or otherwise
involving any Business Employees participation in a Business Plan (other than
routine claims for benefits) and (ii) no material matters pending (other than
routine qualification determination filings) with respect to any of the
Transferred Business Plans or Foreign Transferred Business Plans before any
Governmental Authority.

 

(j) As of the date of this Agreement, there has been no amendment to, written
interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) by APD or any of its
Affiliates relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under,
any Business Plan which would, individually or in the aggregate, materially
increase the expense of maintaining such Business Plan above the level of
the expense incurred in respect thereof for the 12 months ended as of
December 31, 2015.

 



18 (k) With respect to each plan, fund, program, agreement or arrangement that
would otherwise meet the definition of a "Transferred Business Plan" but
which is subject to any Law other than U.S. federal, state or local Law (a "
_Foreign Transferred Business Plan_ "): (i) the fair market value of the
assets of each funded Foreign Transferred Business Plan, (ii) the collective
liability of each insurer for any Foreign Transferred Business Plan funded
through insurance or (iii) the book reserve established for any Foreign
Transferred Business Plan, in each case together with any accrued
contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the projected benefit
obligations with respect to all current and former participants in such plan,
according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to
determine employer contributions to each such foreign Transferred Business
Plan and/or the Accounting Principles and no transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall cause such assets, insurance obligations or reserves,
together with any such accrued contributions, to be less than such projected
benefit obligations. Each Foreign Transferred Business Plan required to be
registered has been registered and has been maintained in good standing with
applicable Governmental Authorities.

(l) With respect to each Business Plan and any other arrangement that is (in
each case) an occupational pension scheme under applicable Law in the United
Kingdom, other than such a scheme under which all the benefits are money
purchase benefits (each a " _UK DB Scheme_ "): (i) no Transferred PMD Company
has ever been a sponsor or participating employer in relation to any UK DB
Scheme, and (ii) no Transferred PMD Company is a party to any guarantee,
indemnity, arrangement or agreement of any kind relating to the funding of any
UK DB Scheme or which could give rise to any payment or
contribution liability of any kind to any UK DB Scheme. No Current Business
Employee has any claim or right to benefits as a result of a "relevant
transfer" as defined in the Transfer Regulations with respect to any UK DB
Scheme. No Governmental Authority has issued a contribution notice or
financial support direction (or a warning notice in relation to such a
contribution notice or financial support direction), against any Transferred
PMD Company with respect to a UK DB Scheme and, to the Knowledge of APD,
there are no circumstances which may allow any Governmental Authority to issue
such a contribution notice, financial support direction or warning notice with
respect to any UK DB Scheme.

 

Section 3.12 _Employment_.

 

(a) (i) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(a)(i) of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule, APD and its Affiliates are not party to any collective bargaining

the Current Business Employees (collectively, the " _Labor Contracts_ ").

(ii) With respect to each Labor Contract, APD and its Affiliates have
performed in all material respects their obligations to date under such Labor
Contract, and none of the Transferred PMD Companies and the PMD Asset Sellers

the Labor Contract is, or is alleged in writing to be (with or without the
lapse of time or the giving of notice), in material breach or material default
under such Labor Contract.

 



19 (iii) Within the last three (3) years, Acquired Employees have not
been permitted to work for a Transferred PMD Company or any Subsidiaries
thereof or the PMD Asset Sellers (in respect of the PMD Business) as or in the
capacity of exempt employees who do not qualify for such status under all Laws
and Contracts applicable to the PMD Business, except where any noncompliance
with applicable Law, in the aggregate, would not be material. Within the last
three (3) years, each Transferred PMD Company and its Subsidiaries and the PMD
Asset Sellers (in respect of the PMD Business) has properly classified
Persons engaged as an independent contractor to perform services for the
Transferred PMD Company and its Subsidiaries and the PMD Asset Sellers (in

Law, in the aggregate, would not be material.

(iv) APD and its Affiliates have complied, in all material respects, with all

this Agreement in connection with the execution of this Agreement.

(v) Except as disclosed in Section 3.12(a)(v) of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule, as of the date hereof, there is no controversy existing, pending or,

notice of) any strike, union organization drive, demands for representation,
primary or secondary boycott, or material labor dispute involving the Business
Employees within the last three (3) years, nor, to the Knowledge of APD, are
there any campaigns being conducted to solicit cards from the Current
Business Employees to authorize representation by any labor organization of
any Current Business Employees.

(b) APD and its Affiliates are in compliance with all notice and other
requirements (in respect of the PMD Business) under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act of 1988 or any similar local, state or foreign law
relating to plant closings or layoffs (the " _WARN Act_ "). With respect to
all Business Employees, except as disclosed in Section 3.12(b) of the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule, no facility of APD or its Affiliates (in respect of the
PMD Business) has been closed, no "social plan" has been implemented, no
early retirement, separation or window program has been implemented within the
past three (3) years, and there are no specific plans or announcements of any
such action, social plan or program for the future.

(c) Section 3.12(c) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule contains a true and
complete list of all Current Business Employees as of the date hereof,

Current Business Employee has entered into any change of control, severance,
retention or termination agreement with APD or its Affiliates.

 

(d) (i) Except as set forth on Section 3.12(d) of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule, neither APD nor its Affiliates have committed themselves to
materially increase the remuneration of Current Business Employees or
otherwise materially change the terms and conditions of their employment.
Payment in full and/or accrual on the books and records of APD and its
Affiliates (in respect of the PMD Business) as of the Closing, in accordance
with the Accounting Principles, has been made with respect to all Current
Business Employees of all wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, benefits,
Taxes and other compensation currently due to such Current Business Employees
under applicable Law or any employment contract, including but not limited to,

matter.

(e) To the Knowledge of APD, APD and its Affiliates have complied in all
material respects with all applicable data protection obligations and duties
under Law, including the personal data of Business Employees and workers;
_provided_ that such warranty shall apply only to any such obligations and
duties to the extent that they arise in relation to the PMD Business. No
notice from any data protection authority, that alleges non-compliance with
any applicable data protection Law (including without limitation, any
enforcement notice, deregistration notice, transfer prohibition notice or any
equivalent notice) has been received by APD or any of its Affiliates as of the
date hereof in relation to the PMD Business. To the Knowledge of APD, APD and
its Affiliates are not aware of any written complaint or submission by any
Person as of the date hereof that would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any such notice.

adverse to the PMD Business. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
the parties hereby agree that all matters with respect to compliance with, or
Liabilities arising under, Environmental Laws shall be excluded from
all other representations and warranties in this Article III. The
representations and warranties contained in this Section 3.13 shall be the

Business, and except as set forth on Section 3.16(c) of Sellers Disclosure
Schedule, the tangible Acquired PMD Assets (including fixtures) and the

obligation to repay or a loss of any benefit to which Buyer is entitled under,
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any material Contract to which
Buyer is a party or by which Buyer or any of its properties or Assets may be

limited contact with regulatory authorities may be required to the extent
customary in preparing such a report). All such information and access shall
be subject to the terms and conditions of the confidentiality agreement dated
September 11, 2015 between Buyer and APD (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_
"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither APD
nor its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred PMD Companies) shall
be required to disclose pursuant to this Agreement to Buyer or its
Representatives any information (i) related to the Sale Process or APDs or
its Representatives evaluation thereof including projections, financial or
other information related thereto other than projections, financial or other
information prepared in the ordinary course of the PMD Business without being
prepared for the Sale Process, (ii) if doing so presents a reasonable risk of
violating any Contract or Law to which APD or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or to which it is subject or which it believes in good faith (upon a
written opinion of counsel (which may be inside counsel)) could result in a
loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of Privilege, (iii) if APD
or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation and such
information is reasonably pertinent thereto or (iv) if APD or any of
its Subsidiaries reasonably determines in good faith that such information is
competitively sensitive; _provided_ that in such case it may be provided to
Buyers advisors only under previously agreed "clean team"
restrictions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, APD and its Subsidiaries shall
not be required to provide any such information as and to the extent it
relates to the Excluded Businesses, the Retained Liabilities or the Excluded
Assets. Promptly following the Closing, APD shall deliver to Buyer a copy of
a DVD-ROM or similar electronic media containing a copy of the contents of

Governmental Authority. For purposes of this Section 5.3(b)(iv), "best
efforts" shall include taking each of the actions set forth in the foregoing
clauses (A) through (E) above within Buyers control, including selling or

transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Authority;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be required to take any such
action the effectiveness of which would not be conditioned upon and subject
to Closing;

(vi) APD will not in connection with obtaining Required Governmental
Approvals take or agree to take any action identified in the immediately
preceding Section 5.3(a), without the prior written consent of Buyer, and if
so requested by Buyer will use reasonable best efforts to effectuate any
license, divestiture, disposition, hold separate, or any other action of any
of the PMD Assets or the PMD Businesses necessary to obtain Required
Governmental Approvals; _provided_ , _that_ , such action is conditioned on
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(vii) without limiting Section 5.3(b)(iv), each of APD and Buyer, in the event
that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or
becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make
consummation of the acquisition of the PMD Shares or the other transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful
or that would prevent or delay consummation of the acquisition of the PMD
Shares or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall use its
reasonable best efforts necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such
injunction or order so as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close
as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement unless, by mutual
agreement, APD and Buyer decide that litigation is not in their respective
best interests.

 

(c) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date,
except as required by this Agreement, Buyer and its Affiliates shall not,
without the prior written consent of APD, engage in any action or enter into
any transaction or permit any action to be taken or transaction to be entered
into, that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, none of Buyer, the Subsidiaries of Buyer, or their respective
Affiliates shall, and shall not cause any Person to, acquire (whether via
merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase or otherwise), or agree to so
acquire, any assets of or any equity in any

 



38  other Person or any business or division thereof, unless that acquisition or
agreement would not reasonably be expected to (i) increase the risk of not
obtaining, or cause a delay in obtaining, any authorizations, consents,
orders, declarations or approvals of any Governmental Authority necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration
or termination of any waiting period under any Regulatory Law; (ii) increase
the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or materially
increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal
or otherwise; or (iii) delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Buyer will pay APD a termination fee of $190,000,000 in immediately
available funds within two (2) Business Days following the termination of this
Agreement if terminated: (i) by APD pursuant to Section 8.1(c) with respect to
Regulatory Laws, (ii) by APD pursuant to Section 8.1(e) as a result of
Buyers material breach of this Section 5.3 or (iii) by APD or Buyer pursuant
to Section 8.1(b) if, as of the Outside Date, the condition in Section 7.1(a)
(if the failure to satisfy such condition is as a result of a Regulatory Law)
or Section 7.1(b) had not been satisfied. For the avoidance of doubt, the
termination fee shall be APDs exclusive remedy for Buyers failure to obtain
all Required Governmental Approvals if Buyer has complied with
its obligations under this Section 5.3.

Section 5.4 _Further Assurances_. Subject to Section 5.3, each of the parties
hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts before and after the Closing
Date to take or cause to be taken all action, to do or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other party hereto in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to, (i) the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the obligations of any of the
parties hereto; (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from Governmental Authorities required to be obtained by APD or Buyer,
or their respective Affiliates, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (other than with respect to Regulatory Laws
which are the subject of Section 5.3), (iii) to the extent consistent with the
obligations of the parties set forth in Section 5.3, the defending of any
Actions, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (iv) the execution
and delivery of such instruments, and the taking of such other actions, as the
other party hereto may reasonably require in order to carry out the intent of
this Agreement; and (v) render any other assistance as reasonably requested by
APD or Buyer to fulfill the purposes of this Agreement, the Related Agreements
and the Other Transaction Documents and to convey to, transfer to or vest in
the Buyer the Transferred PMD Companies, the PMD Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities contemplated by this Agreement to be transferred or assumed at
Closing.

(a) Except for the Related Agreements, the Local Purchase Agreements, the
Other Transaction Documents and intercompany accounts governed by Section
5.5(b), all intercompany arrangements and agreements, whether written or oral,

properties or joint activities between APD or any of the Retained
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of the Transferred PMD Companies, on
the other hand, shall be terminated or extended in accordance with Section
5.5(a) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule.

 



39 (b) At or prior to the Closing, all outstanding intercompany accounts, whether
payables (other than trade payables) or receivables (other than trade
receivables), between APD or any of the Retained Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any of the Transferred PMD Companies, on the other hand, shall be
settled and of no further force and effect such that none of Buyer or its
Affiliates or any Transferred PMD Company shall have any continuing obligation
with respect thereto (it being understood that such settlement shall not in
any way affect the Related Agreements or the Other Transaction Documents or
any amounts which may be payable pursuant to the Related Agreements or the
Other Transaction Documents); _provided_ , that in the case of any such
payables or receivables (other than trade payables and trade receivables,
as applicable) not set forth on Section 5.5(b)(i) of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule, such payables or receivables shall be settled in a manner that does
not have adverse tax consequences to the Transferred PMD Companies. Except as
set forth on Section 5.5(b)(ii) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedules, any
intercompany trade payables or intercompany trade receivables, in each case as
relating to the PMD Business, shall remain outstanding as of the Closing and
shall be paid in the ordinary course after the Closing.

(c) Except to the extent provided to the contrary in Section 5.5(b), effective
as of the Closing, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, including
the Transferred PMD Companies, hereby releases APD and each of the Retained
Subsidiaries (and their respective officers, directors and employees, acting
in their capacity as such) from any Liability, obligation or responsibility
to any of them for any and all past actions or failures to take action prior
to the Closing, including any actions which may be deemed to have been
negligent or grossly negligent, relating to or arising out of Contracts with
APD or a Subsidiary thereof or the operation or conduct of any businesses,
Assets (including activities performed thereat) or operations managed or
operated by, or operationally related to, directly or indirectly, to the PMD
Business or the Excluded Businesses, except for any obligation pursuant to
the provisions of this Agreement, the Local Purchase Agreements, the Related
Agreements or the Other Transaction Documents.

 

(d) Except to the extent provided to the contrary in Section 5.5(b), effective
as of the Closing, APD, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, including the
Retained Subsidiaries, hereby releases Buyer, each PMD Asset Buyer and each of
the Transferred PMD Companies (and their respective officers, directors and
employees, acting in their capacity as such) from any Liability, obligation
or responsibility to any of them for any and all past actions or failures to
take action prior to the Closing, including any actions which may be deemed to
have been negligent or grossly negligent, relating to or arising out of
Contracts with a PMD Asset Seller or a Transferred PMD Company or the
operation or conduct of any businesses, Assets (including activities performed
thereat) or operations managed or operated by, or operationally related to,
directly or indirectly, to the PMD Business, except for any obligation
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, the Local Purchase Agreements,
the Related Agreements or the Other Transaction Documents.

to deliver or cause to be

 



40  delivered to Buyer all Transferred PMD Books and Records then in the
possession of APD or any Retained Subsidiary, and Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to APD all APD
Books and Records then in the possession of any Transferred PMD Company. The
foregoing shall be limited by the following specific provisions:

 

(a) To the extent any document (other than that stored on electronic media)
can be subdivided without unreasonable effort into two portions, one of which
constitutes a Transferred PMD Book and Record and the other of which
constitutes an APD Book and Record, such document (other than that stored on
electronic media) shall be so sub-divided, and the original of the portion
such document (other than that stored on electronic media) which constitutes
a Transferred PMD Book and Record shall be provided to Buyer (with a copy
thereof provided to APD) and the original of the portion such document (other
than that stored on electronic media) which constitutes an APD Book and
Record shall be provided to APD (with a copy thereof provided to Buyer).

require, without limitation, deliveries of any such specific and discrete
books and records requested in writing by either party and then in the
possession of the other party.

in its possession, and may use such books and records as reasonably required
for its tax, accounting, compliance and other administrative purposes, subject
to this Agreement and the Related Agreements, and subject to holding in

with the requirements and limitations of this Agreement, including Section
5.13. If either party has a reasonable concern regarding the other partys use
of such books and records, such party may, upon reasonable prior written
notice, audit the other partys use of such books and records at times and in
a manner reasonably acceptable to all parties at the auditing partys expense,

has not been cured prior to the audit, the costs of such audit shall be
reasonably apportioned between the parties as determined equitably by the
auditor.

 

(d) Each party may refuse to furnish any Information if it believes in good
faith that doing so presents, based on a written opinion of counsel (which
may be inside counsel), a significant risk of loss of the ability to
successfully assert a claim of Privilege; _provided_ that the parties hereto
shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such
information without resulting in a loss of the ability to successfully assert
a claim of Privilege.

(e) Neither party shall be required to deliver to the other books and records
or portions thereof if such delivery would violate any applicable Law, based

position as if Buyer, and not APD or a Retained Subsidiary, had performed or
were performing such obligations.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, APD and Buyer shall cooperate and Buyer shall

of the other party or its Affiliates solely to the extent relating to (a) in
the case of requests by Buyer, the PMD Business, Transferred PMD Companies,
PMD Assets, Assumed Liabilities or Acquired Employees and (b) in the case of
requests by APD, the Excluded Businesses, the Excluded Assets or the Retained
Liabilities, insofar in each case as such access is reasonably required by APD
or Buyer or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates for legitimate business
reasons and does not violate any applicable Law or any confidentiality
obligations applicable to APD or Buyer or any of their Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as the case may be (and shall use reasonable efforts to cause
persons or firms possessing relevant Information to give similar access) and,
to the extent practicable, such Information is identified by the requesting
party with reasonable specificity; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party
shall be required to retain any Information as a result of this Section 5.9;
_provided_ , _further_ , that no party shall be required to disclose any
Information pursuant to this Agreement if (i) it believes in good faith that
doing so presents a significant risk, based on a written opinion of
counsel (which may be inside counsel), of resulting in a loss of the ability
to successfully assert a claim of Privilege or (ii) APD or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation and such information is
reasonably pertinent thereto; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of
clause (i) above, the parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate in seeking to
find a way to allow disclosure of such 

 



44  information without resulting in a loss of the ability to successfully
assert a claim of Privilege; _provided_ , _further_ , that each party hereto
and its respective Affiliates shall not be required to provide the other
party or its Representatives with any information related to the Sale Process
or Buyers, APDs or their respective Representatives evaluation thereof,
including projections, financial or other information related thereto other
than, in the case of APD or its Affiliates, projections, financial or other
information prepared in the ordinary course of the PMD Business without being
prepared for the Sale Process. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Information may be requested under this Section 5.9 for audit and
accounting purposes and in connection with Actions, as well as for purposes of
fulfilling disclosure and reporting obligations. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, following Closing and for as long as such
retention is required under applicable Law, Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Transferred PMD Companies to, retain all medical and exposure records of
Business Employees and afford APD and its Affiliates and Representatives with
reasonable access to such medical and exposure records in each case to the
extent permitted under applicable Law.

 

Section 5.10 _Production of Witnesses and Individuals_. From and after the
Closing Date, APD and Buyer shall use and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use reasonable efforts to make available to each other, upon
written request, its officers, directors, employees and agents for fact
finding, consultation and interviews and as witnesses to the extent that any
such person may reasonably be required in connection with any Actions in
which the requesting party may from time to time be involved relating to the
conduct of the PMD Business or the Excluded Businesses. APD and Buyer agree to
reimburse each other for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (other than
officers or employees salaries) incurred by the other in connection with
providing individuals and witnesses pursuant to this Section 5.10.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 5.10 shall not
apply to Actions brought between APD and its Affiliates (but not including the
Transferred PMD Companies), on the one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates
(including after the Closing Date, the Transferred PMD Companies) on the
other hand.

Section 5.11 _Retention of Records_. Except when a longer retention period is
otherwise required by Law or agreed to in writing, including as set forth in
Section 6.8, APD and its Affiliates and the Transferred PMD Companies and
their respective Subsidiaries shall retain, in accordance with their
respective records control schedule policy existing from time to time, all
Information relating to the PMD Business and the Excluded Businesses,
respectively. The parties hereto agree that upon written request from the
other that certain Information relating to the PMD Business or the
transactions contemplated hereby be retained in connection with an Action,
the parties shall use reasonable efforts to preserve and not to destroy or
dispose of such Information without the consent of the requesting party. If a
party desires to destroy or dispose of any Information retained at the
request of the other party, it shall offer first in writing at least sixty
(60) days prior to such destruction or disposition to surrender such
Information to the other party.

 

Section 5.12 _Non-Solicitation of Employees; Non-Competition_.

 

(a) From the Closing Date until the earlier of (i) the 18-month anniversary of
the Closing Date and (ii) the earliest to occur of a (x) sale of APDs EM
Business, (y) material monetary investment by a third party in the EM Business
or (z) merger of

 



45  the EM Business with a third party, without the prior written consent of
Buyer, APD agrees that none of APD or any of its controlled Affiliates will,
directly or indirectly, either (A) solicit for employment or (B) hire any
member of the Senior Management of the PMD Business (in each case,
irrespective of whether that member of Senior Management of the PMD Business
is then employed by Buyer or its Affiliates). For the avoidance of doubt, a
spin-off of the EM Business that does not involve the material monetary
investment of a third party or a subsequent planned merger with a third party
(a " _Qualified Spin_ ") shall not constitute a sale of the EM Business for
purposes of this Section 5.12(a).

(b) From the Closing Date until the earlier of (i) the 18-month anniversary of
the Closing Date and (ii) the earliest to occur of a (x) sale of APDs EM
Business, (y) material monetary investment by a third party in the EM Business
or (z) merger of the EM Business with a third party, without the prior written
consent of Buyer, as to any Current Business Employee, APD agrees that,
without the prior written consent of Buyer, none of APD or any of its
controlled Affiliates will, directly or indirectly, either (i) solicit for
employment or (ii) hire any Current Business Employee (in each
case, irrespective of whether that Current Business Employee is then employed
by Buyer or its Affiliates); _provided_ that APD and its Subsidiaries shall
not be precluded from soliciting or hiring, or taking any other action with
respect to any such Current Business Employee that is not a member of the
Senior Management of the PMD Business (A) who responds to a solicitation by a
search firm or recruiting agency or a general advertisement not specifically
targeted at employees of Buyer or any of its Affiliates or (B) whose
employment was terminated by Buyer or its Affiliates other than due to a
voluntary resignation by that individual or whose employment with Buyer or its
Affiliates ceased at least six (6) months prior to the commencement of
employment discussions between such individual and APD or its Affiliates;
_provided_ , _further_ , that APD and its Affiliates shall not be restricted
from engaging in solicitations or advertising not targeted at Current
Business Employees.

(c) For a period of 18 months from and after the Closing Date, as to any APD
employees that are employed within the Materials Technologies business
segment of APD, as reflected in the segment financial reporting contained in
APDs Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30,
2015, except for the Acquired Employees (collectively, the " _APD Materials
Employees_ "), Buyer agrees that, without the prior written consent of APD,
none of Buyer or any of its controlled Affiliates will, directly or
indirectly, either (i) solicit for employment or (ii) hire any APD Materials
Employee (in each case, irrespective of whether that APD Materials Employee
is then employed by APD or its Affiliates); _provided_ that Buyer and its
Subsidiaries shall not be precluded from soliciting or hiring, or taking any
other action with respect to any such individual (A) who responds to a
solicitation by a search firm or recruiting agency or a general advertisement
not specifically targeted at employees of APD or any of its Affiliates or (B)
whose employment was terminated by APD or its Affiliates other than due to a
voluntary resignation by that individual or whose employment with APD or its
Affiliates ceased at least six (6) months prior to the commencement of
employment discussions between such individual and Buyer or its Affiliates;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Buyer and its Affiliates shall not be restricted
from engaging in solicitations or advertising not targeted at APD Materials
Employees.

 

(d) For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date (the "
_Restricted Period_ "), without the prior written consent of Buyer, APD
agrees not to, and not to

 



46  permit any of its Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates to, directly or
indirectly engage in, acquire or own an interest in (in whole or in part)
manage, operate, control, or participate in the ownership, management,
operation or control of any Competing Business; _provided_ that nothing herein
shall preclude APD from: (i) owning five percent (5%) or less of the
outstanding publicly-traded securities of any Person so long as APD does not
have the right to appoint a member of the board of directors or managers of
such Person; (ii) acquiring (or entering into an agreement to acquire) and,
after such acquisition, owning an interest in any Person (or its successor)
that is engaged in a Competing Business (A) if such Competing Business
generated less than ten percent (10%) of such Persons consolidated annual
revenues in the last completed fiscal year of such Person or (B) if APD
disposes of such Competing Business within 12 months of its acquisition
(which twelve (12)-month period shall extend on a day-for-day basis if Buyer
has delivered an Acceptance Notice (as defined below) and APD and Buyer are
negotiating Right of First Offer Contracts) whether such 12-month period
extends beyond the Restricted Period, provided that APD shall provide Buyer,
on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, with a right of first offer
to purchase any such Competing Business (" _Right of First Offer_ ")
in accordance with the Right of First Offer Procedure; or (iii) exercising
its rights or complying with its obligations under this Agreement, any of the
Related Agreements or any of the Other Transaction Documents. For the purposes
of this Section 5.12(d), " _Right of First Offer Procedure_ " shall mean
that, if, at any time during the Restricted Period, without the written
consent of Buyer, APD acquires a Competing Business, APD shall deliver written
notice to Buyer (" _Offer Notice_ ") of APDs acquisition of a Competing
Business and obligation to first offer such Competing Business for sale to
Buyer. Buyer, on its own behalf or on behalf of an Affiliate, shall have a
period of thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Offer Notice within
which to advise APD by written notice (the " _Acceptance Notice_ ") that Buyer
desires to purchase such Competing Business at a purchase price (the " _Offer
Price_ ") set forth in the Acceptance Notice. If Buyer delivers the
Acceptance Notice within such thirty (30) day period and APD does not reject
such Acceptance Notice within fifteen (15) days of its delivery, the parties
shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the terms and conditions upon which
APD shall sell and Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall purchase the Competing
Business, which shall include final agreement on the Offer Price or such other
purchase price as the parties may agree, and to memorialize such agreement in
a stock or asset purchase agreement mutually agreeable to the parties ("
_Right of First Offer Contract_ "). If APD has rejected the Acceptance Notice
or APD and Buyer are unable to agree upon and execute a Right of First Offer
Contract within sixty (60) days after delivery of an Acceptance Notice that
has not been rejected by APD, Buyers rights under the Right of First Offer
shall terminate, and APD may offer to sell the Competing Business to one or
more third parties free of Buyers rights under the Right of First Offer at a
price that is higher than the price offered by Buyer in the Acceptance Notice;
_provided_ , _that_ , the 12 month period set forth in this Section 5.12(d)
shall be extended by the number of days elapsed between the Offer Notice and
the expiration of the sixty (60) day period following the delivery of the
Acceptance Notice.

 

(e) APD shall require any Subsidiary of APD to which APDs EM Business is
contributed and then spun-off in a Qualified Spin to comply with the terms of
this Section 5.12 as if it were a party hereto; _provided_ , _that_ , such
restrictions would not apply to a purchaser of such spun-off entity or its
Affiliates.

 



47 Section 5.13 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of (i) the second (2nd) anniversary
of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 and (ii) the
seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date, APD and Buyer shall hold and
shall cause their respective Affiliates (including the Transferred PMD
Companies) to hold, and shall each use their reasonable best efforts to cause
their respective Representatives to hold, in strict confidence and not to
disclose or release without the prior written consent of the other party,
any and all Confidential Information (as defined herein); _provided_ that the
parties may disclose, or may permit disclosure of, Confidential Information
(i) to their respective Representatives who have a need to know such
information and are informed of their obligation to hold such information
confidential to the same extent as is applicable to the parties hereto and in
respect of whose failure to comply with such obligations, APD or Buyer, as the
case may be, will be responsible, (ii) if the parties hereto, their
Affiliates or their Representatives are compelled to disclose any such
Confidential Information by judicial or administrative process or, based on a
written opinion of counsel (which may be inside counsel), by
other requirements of Law or (iii) as is reasonably required in connection
with, and for the sole purpose of, the exercise of such partys rights and
obligations under this Agreement, any Related Agreement or any Other
Transaction Document. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any
demand or request for disclosure of Confidential Information is made pursuant
to clause (ii) above, APD or Buyer, as the case may be, shall promptly notify
the other of the existence of such request or demand and shall provide the
other a reasonable opportunity to seek an appropriate protective order or
other remedy, which both parties will reasonably cooperate in obtaining (each
at their own expense). In the event that such appropriate protective order or
other remedy is not obtained, the party who is required to disclose such
Confidential Information shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, only that
portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to
be disclosed. Nothing in this Section 5.13(a) shall restrict the use of
Confidential Information in connection with any dispute between the parties
regarding this Agreement, the Related Agreements, the Other Transaction
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. As used in this
Section 5.13, " _Confidential Information_ " shall mean all proprietary
technical, economic, environmental, operational, financial and/or other
business Information or material of a party, (A) in the case of the
confidentiality obligations of APD and its Affiliates and Representatives,
following the Closing, to the extent relating to the PMD Business, the PMD
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities or (B) in the case of the
confidentiality obligations of Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives,
(i) prior to the Closing, to the extent related to the PMD Business, the PMD
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, or (ii) prior to or after the Closing, to
the extent relating to the Excluded Assets, the Retained Liabilities or the
Excluded Businesses, including, with respect to the foregoing (A) and (B), (a)
ideas and concepts for existing products, processes and services; (b)
specifications for products, Equipment and processes; (c) manufacturing and
performance specifications and procedures; (d) engineering drawings and
graphs; (e) technical, research and engineering data; (f) formulations and
material specifications; (g) laboratory studies and benchmark tests; (h)
service and operation manuals; (i) quality assurance policies, procedures and
specifications; (j) evaluation and/or validation studies; (k) pending patent
applications; (l) all other know-how, methodology, procedures, techniques and
trade secrets related to research, engineering, development and
manufacturing; and (m) business information, including marketing and
development plans, forecasts, research and development agreements, and
customer and vendor information (except to the extent that such Information
can be shown

 



48  to have been (1) in the public domain through no fault of such party or its
Affiliates (including, in the case of APD, any of the Retained Subsidiaries
or, in the case of Buyer, any of its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred
PMD Companies)) or (2) lawfully acquired from other sources by the party (or
its Affiliates (including the Transferred PMD Companies)) to which it was
furnished; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of (2) that such sources
did not provide such Information in breach of any confidentiality or other
legal obligations). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall
prevent APD or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or their
respective Representatives from disclosing or using any Confidential
Information to the extent solely used or held for use in any Excluded Business
or solely related to any Retained Liability and nothing herein shall prevent
Buyer or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or their respective Representatives
from, following the Closing, disclosing or using any Confidential Information
to the extent solely used or held for use in the PMD Business or solely
related to any PMD Asset, any Assumed Liability or any of the Transferred PMD
Companies.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, (i) APD and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Transferred PMD Companies), on the other hand, shall be deemed to have
satisfied their obligations hereunder with respect to Confidential Information
if they exercise the same degree of care (but no less than a reasonable
degree of care) as they take to preserve confidentiality for their own similar
Information and (ii) confidentiality obligations provided for in any agreement
between APD or any of its Affiliates, or Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Transferred PMD Companies), on the one hand, and any employee
of APD or any of its Affiliates (or, prior to the Closing Date, any of the
Transferred PMD Companies), or Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing Date, the Transferred PMD Companies), on the other hand
shall remain in full force and effect. Confidential Information of APD and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, or the Transferred PMD Companies, on the other
hand, in the possession of and used by the other as of the Closing Date may
continue to be used by APD or its Affiliates, or Buyer or its Affiliates
(including the Transferred PMD Companies), as the case may be, as reasonably
required for its tax, accounting, compliance and other administrative
purposes, so long as the Confidential Information is maintained in confidence
and not disclosed in violation of this Agreement. Such continued right to use
may not be transferred to any third party (other than an Affiliate of a
party hereto) unless the third party purchases all or substantially all of
the business and Assets in one transaction or in a series of related
transactions for which or in which the relevant Confidential Information is
used or employed.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 5.13, to the extent that a
Related Agreement provides that certain Confidential Information shall be
maintained confidential on a basis that is more protective of such
Confidential Information or for a longer period of time than provided for in
this Section 5.13, then the applicable provisions contained in such Related
Agreement shall control with respect thereto.

Section 5.14 _Pre-Closing Employment Transfers_. Without Buyers request and
consent, APD or an Affiliate of APD (including a PMD Asset Seller) may not
cause a Current Business Employee to be transferred from APD or an Affiliate
of APD (including a PMD Asset Seller) to a Transferred PMD Company.

 



49 Section 5.15 _Certain Notice and Consultation Jurisdictions_.

 

(a) Under French labor Laws, (i) the works council(s) of APDs Affiliate(s)
in France (" _APD France_ ") will need to be informed and consulted with
respect to the proposed sale of the PMD Business to the extent it is conducted
in France (the " _French Business_ ") and (ii) under Dutch labor Laws, the
works council of APDs Affiliate in the Netherlands (" _APD Netherlands_ ")
and the trade unions and the Dutch Social Economic Council will need to be
informed and consulted with respect to the proposed sale of the PMD Business
as it is conducted in the Netherlands (the " _Dutch Business_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (1) unless and
until APD has executed and delivered to Buyer the France Acceptance Notice,
the French Business will not be considered part of the acquired PMD Assets
for the purpose of this Agreement and (2) unless and until APD has executed
and delivered to Buyer the Dutch Acceptance Notice, the Dutch Business will
not be considered part of the sale of the PMD Business for purposes of this
Agreement, and, if no such Dutch Acceptance Notice is delivered, the Closing
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Dutch Purchase Price.

 

(b) On the terms and conditions set forth in the offer letter attached as
_Schedule Q_ hereto (the " _French Offer Letter_ " and the offer set forth
therein, the " _French Offer_ "), Buyer has irrevocably offered to consummate
the transaction in France as contemplated by this Agreement and to have the
provisions of this Agreement apply following completion of the consultation
process described in _Section_ _5.15(a)_ _(i)_. Subject to acceptance of the
French Offer by APD following completion of the consultation process described
in _Section _ _5.15(a)_ _(i)_ , and upon delivery to Buyer of the executed
acceptance notice attached as Schedule 2 to the French Offer Letter (the "
_France Acceptance Notice_ "), this Agreement shall apply to the French
Business.

 

(c) On the terms and conditions set forth in the offer letter attached as
_Schedule Q_ hereto (the " _Dutch Offer Letter_ " and the offer set forth
therein, the " _Dutch Offer_ "), including the price specified in the
applicable local purchase agreement (the " _Dutch Purchase Price_ "), Buyer
has irrevocably offered to acquire the Dutch Business and to have the
provisions of this Agreement apply to such Dutch Business following completion
of the consultation process described in _Section 5.15(a)_ _(ii)_. Subject to
acceptance of the Dutch Offer by APD following completion of the consultation
process described in _Section 5.15(a)_ _(ii)_ and upon delivery to Buyer of
the executed acceptance notice attached as Exhibit C to the Dutch Offer Letter
(the " _Dutch Acceptance Notice_ "), this Agreement shall apply to the Dutch
Business and shall be included in the acquired PMD Assets.

(d) APD and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with each other and any relevant
Affiliates in connection with the applicable consultation processes described
in this _Section 5.15_ , including (i) Buyer timely providing any required
information relating to Buyer, the expected consequences for persons working
with the Dutch Business and the measures envisaged by Buyer for dealing with
such consequences, or as otherwise reasonably requested by APD in respect of
or for the purpose of such consultation processes and (ii) APD keeping
Buyer informed of the status of such consultation and any material
developments so far as they relate to APD France or APD Netherlands. Without
Buyers prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, APD shall not (and shall cause APD

 



50  France and APD Netherlands not to) enter into any agreement with, or make
any material commitment to, the relevant works council and trade union which
would bind or impose any obligation on the Buyer, or its Affiliates after the
Closing; _provided_ ; _however_ ; for the avoidance of doubt, that Buyers
consent shall not be required with respect to any matter affecting only
employees of APD who are not Business Employees or any immaterial matters.
If, as a result of any such consultation processes, changes to this Agreement,
any Related Agreement, any Other Transaction Document or the applicable local
purchase agreement, or further arrangements in connection with the Sale, are
considered necessary by APD, APD shall negotiate in good faith with Buyer on
such changes (if any and without an obligation for the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to accept such changes) to this Agreement, any Related Agreement,
any Other Transaction Document or the applicable local purchase agreement, or
further arrangements (if any) that are appropriate, in accordance with the
terms and conditions set forth in the French Offer Letter and/or Dutch Offer
Letter (as applicable).

 

(e) APD and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in connection with any
notification to, or any consultation with, employees of APD or its Affiliates
who are not included in or covered by the notice and consultation processes
referred to in _Section 5.15(d)_ and who might be affected by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such employees
employee representative bodies, labor boards and relevant government
agencies, whether required by Law or otherwise undertaken by APD or its
Affiliates. Buyer shall timely provide APD and its relevant Affiliates any
information reasonably required or reasonably requested by APD relating to
Buyer and its plans for employees in connection with any such notification or
consultation.

 

Section 5.16 _Current Business Employees Covered by Transfer Regulations_.

 

(a) APD and Buyer acknowledge that certain transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will constitute a relevant transfer for the purposes of the
applicable Transfer Regulation and agree to use their reasonable best efforts
to ensure that all objections and acceptance periods under the Transfer
Regulations lapse before Closing. Accordingly, on the Closing the employment
and the contracts of employment of all Automatically Transferring Employees
will transfer to a Transferred PMD Company, PMD Asset Buyer or other Affiliate
of Buyer in accordance with the Transfer Regulation and shall take effect as
if originally made between such entity and the Automatically Transferring
Employee, subject to Section 5.16(d) below.

(b) Buyer and its Affiliates and APD and its Affiliates each agree to
cooperate and to coordinate in an organized manner the satisfaction of any
relevant obligations under the Transfer Regulation, including obligations
regarding information, notice, and consultation processes required by Law or
by any agreement with a works council, trade union or any other collective
bargaining or labor representative. Buyer shall and shall cause its Affiliates
to provide such information and assistance as APD reasonably requests to
enable APD to meet its obligations regarding information and consultation
without undue delay. Accordingly, APD and its Affiliates will give the Buyer
and its Affiliates supervised pre-Closing access to the Current Business
Employees (and Transferred PMD Companies, as necessary) as Buyer may
reasonably request for this purpose. APD and its Affiliates may not issue
communications regarding post-Closing terms and conditions of employment to
relevant Automatically 

 



51  Transferring Employees, or agree to provide any new terms and conditions of
employment, whether through the information and consultation process or
otherwise, without Buyers prior written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(c) If it is found or alleged that the employment of any individual employed
by or on behalf of APD, other than an Automatically Transferring Employee, has
transferred to any Buyer or its Affiliates under the Transfer Regulation,
then:

 

(i) the Buyer or its Affiliate shall promptly notify APD of this fact;

 

(ii) within 10 days of APD having received such notification, APD shall offer
the individual immediate employment on his or her pre-transfer terms and
conditions;

(iii) if the individual does not accept that offer within 10 days of it
being made, or if no such offer is made, Buyer or its Affiliates may dismiss
him or her with immediate effect; and

(iv) APD will indemnify the Buyer and its Affiliates from any pay and
benefits due and paid by Buyer or its Affiliate to such individual and any
statutory or contractual redundancy, notice, severance payments or other
Losses arising solely in relation to the employment of that individual or
their termination. The indemnity in this Section 5.16(c) is (A) subject to any
such termination taking place as soon as reasonably practicable following such
individuals failure to accept an offer from APD or its Affiliate; (B)
conditional upon Buyer or its Affiliate taking all reasonably practicable
steps to limit or otherwise mitigate such Losses, and (C) excludes any Losses
arising from any act or omission of Buyer, its Affiliates and their
officer, agents and employees other than to give effect to a termination in
accordance with this Section 5.16(c).

(d) APD or its Affiliates shall promptly inform the Buyer or its Affiliates
of any notices of objection received from any Automatically Transferring
Employee with respect to the transfer of their employment relationship to a
PMD Asset Buyer, Transferred PMD Company or an Affiliate thereof or otherwise
of any claims that such employees employment has ended by or in consequence
of such proposed transfer. If any such Automatically Transferring Employee
objects to the transfer of their employment relationship to a PMD
Asset Buyer, a Transferred PMD Company or an Affiliate thereof, or if such
Automatically Transferring Employee otherwise claims that their employment has
ended, by or in consequence of such proposed transfer, any pay and benefits
due to such individual between the Closing Date and the termination of such
individuals employment and any statutory or contractual redundancy, notice,
severance payments or other Losses arising from or in relation to such
persons employment during this period or their termination (except for any
Liabilities related to Beckmann/Martin Rights, which for the avoidance of
doubt, are Retained Liabilities) shall be shared equally (50%/50%) by APD and
Buyer, unless and to the extent such objection is due to the failure of Buyer
or its Affiliates to comply with any relevant Transfer Regulation in respect
to such individual, in which event the payments and Liabilities set out in
this Section 5.16(d) will become Assumed Liabilities.

 



52 Section 5.17 _Other Current Business Employees_. Except for Current Business
Employees covered under Section 5.16 or Section 5.19, the following shall
apply:

(a) For Current Business Employees, who are not based in the U.S. and who are
employed by a Transferred PMD Company immediately prior to Closing, such
employees: (i) shall continue employment with the applicable Transferred PMD
Company after the Closing, (ii) shall continue receiving the same terms and
conditions of employment as in effect immediately prior to the Closing;
_provided_ that such employees will not be offered equity compensation and
will not be offered a defined benefit pension plan unless required by
applicable Law. For Current Business Employees, who are not based in the U.S.
and are not employed by a Transferred PMD Company as of immediately prior to
Closing, such employees shall be offered employment by Buyer, a Transferred
PMD Company or an Affiliate of Buyer on the following terms for a period of
twelve (12) months following the Closing, provided such offer is accepted pre-
Closing: (i) base salary that is the same as disclosed and provided by APD as
of the date hereof; (ii) incentive compensation and employee benefit plans
that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the incentive compensation and
employee benefit plans disclosed and provided by APD as of the date hereof
(excluding equity compensation and defined benefit plan benefits).
Notwithstanding the forgoing, for any such employee classified as grade 118
and above by APD as of the date hereof, Buyers offer shall include, for a
period of twelve (12) months, incentive compensation and employee benefit
plans that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the incentive
compensation and employee benefit plans disclosed and provided by APD as of
the date hereof (excluding defined benefit plan benefits but including the
equivalent value of equity compensation grants).

(b) For Current Business Employees, who are based in the U.S. and who are
not subject to a Labor Contract, such employees shall receive or be offered,
as the case may be, for a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing Date,
provided such offer is accepted pre-Closing: (i) base salary that is the same
as disclosed and provided by APD as of the date hereof; (ii) incentive
compensation and employee benefit plans that are no less favorable in the
aggregate to the incentive compensation and employee benefit plans disclosed
and provided by APD as of the date hereof (excluding equity compensation and
defined benefit plan benefits). Notwithstanding the forgoing, for any such
employee classified as grade 118 and above by APD as of the date hereof,
Buyers offer shall include, for a period of twelve (12) months, incentive
compensation and employee benefit plans that are no less favorable in the
aggregate to the incentive compensation and employee benefit plans disclosed
and provided by APD as of the date hereof (excluding defined benefit
plan benefits but including the equivalent value of equity compensation
grants). If a Leave Employee is able to return to work and actually presents
himself to Buyer or an Affiliate for work within six (6) months after the
Closing Date, such Leave Employee shall be offered employment by Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer on the terms required by this Section 5.17(b) applicable to
Current Business Employees. APD shall transfer the employment of any Leave
Employee to an Affiliate of APD that is not a Transferred PMD Company
immediately prior to Closing, if necessary. For Current Business Employees who
are based in the U.S. and who are subject to a Labor Contract, the employment
terms and conditions of the Labor Contract will apply. Buyer agrees to assume
the collective bargaining

 



53  agreement at the Calvert City location and any and all Liabilities
thereunder whether arising before, on or after the Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that APD, or its applicable Subsidiary, shall engage in effects
bargaining with the union at the Calvert City location and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain union confirmation that APD, or its
applicable Subsidiary, will retain all Liabilities related to post-retirement
welfare benefits for all Current Business Employees covered under the Labor
Contract at the Calvert City location who are or may become eligible for post-
retirement welfare benefits under such Labor Contract (giving credit
for service with Buyer or its Affiliates when determining eligibility);
_provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this Section 5.17(b) shall limit or
condition the obligation of Buyer to assume the Labor Contract at the Calvert
City location. 

(c) If any Current Business Employee, who is outside the U.S. and covered
under this Section 5.17, becomes entitled to severance or notice payments or
obligations as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under any applicable Law, Business Plan or individual agreement on or in
connection with the Closing, then: (i) APD shall fully accrue any such
severance or notice Liabilities as required by the Accounting Principles and
(ii) APD and Buyer shall share such payments and obligations equally (50%/50%)
for amounts due that are greater than the amounts accrued, unless and to the
extent such Liabilities or attorneys fees are due to Buyers or its
Affiliates failure to comply with their obligations under Section 5.17(a) or
their obligation to make an offer of employment to each U.S. Current Business
Employee. APD and Buyer agree that, provided Buyer makes offers of employment
to each U.S. Current Business Employee, no U.S. Current Business Employee
shall be entitled to severance solely as a result of this Agreement. With
respect to Current Business Employees covered under this Section 5.17, APD
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, comply with any of its
respective obligations regarding information and consultation processes
required by Law or by any agreement with a works council, trade union or
any other collective bargaining or labor representative. The Buyer agrees to
cooperate regarding any such information and consultation process and shall
cause its Affiliates to provide such information and assistance as APD
reasonably requests without undue delay. APD may not provide any such Current
Business Employee with any communications regarding post-Closing terms and
conditions of employment without consent of Buyer, which consent will not be
unreasonable withheld, delayed or conditioned. Unless required by Law, APD
and its Affiliates may not agree to provide any new terms and conditions of
employment through the information and consultation process without consent of
Buyer, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned.

Section 5.18 _Special Compensation and Benefit Plan Provisions_.

 

(a) Current Business Employees who are: (i) Automatically Transferring
Employees who do not object to employment with Buyer or any of its Affiliates
and become employed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates; (ii) employed by a
Transferred PMD Company; and (iii) offered employment by Buyer or its
Affiliates and accept such offer of employment and become employed by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates shall be referred to as " _Acquired Employees_."

(b) No Acquired Employee shall have any right to defined benefit type pension
or retirement scheme unless required under applicable Law or a Labor Contract.

 



54 (c) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, recognize, honor or
otherwise credit all unused vacation or paid time off earned by or otherwise
accrued in respect of each Acquired Employee as of the Closing Date, to the
extent permitted by Law and to the extent such unused vacation or paid time-
off has been reflected in the determination of Indebtedness.

(d) The following shall apply with respect to certain Business Plan transfers:

 

(i) _Netherlands_ : With respect to Business Employees that are located in the
Netherlands, the following shall occur: 

(1) The Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall provide a new defined benefit
pension plan with the same benefits and plan design as in place for such
Acquired Employees on the Closing Date for Acquired Employees in the
Netherlands.

(2) APD or an Affiliate of APD shall retain all Liabilities with respect to
defined benefit plan benefits for Business Employees located in the
Netherlands and no transfer of assets or Liabilities in relation to APDs
defined benefit plan in the Netherlands shall occur.

(3) With respect to its new defined benefit plan in the Netherlands, Buyer or
its Affiliate shall undertake to make employees whole for the accrued service
with APD. Buyer shall calculate the value of the Projected Benefit Obligation
at Closing with respect to the Acquired Employees and deduct the Accrued
Benefit Obligation at Closing with respect to Acquired Employees from the
Projected Benefit Obligation at Closing. The difference between these two
values shall be an Assumed Benefit Obligation. Such Projected Benefit
Obligation and Accrued Benefit Obligation shall be determined using Current
Actuarial Assumptions and Methods for such Netherlands defined benefit plan.

(ii) _Germany_ : APD shall determine the Projected Benefit Obligation in
respect of the defined benefit pension benefits of the Acquired Employees
located in Germany on the Closing Date. Such Projected Benefit Obligation
shall be determined using the Current Actuarial Assumptions and Methods for
such German defined benefit plan. The difference between such Projected
Benefit Obligation and the Transferred DB Plan Assets shall be an Assumed
Benefit Obligation.

 

(iii) _Japan, Italy and Korea_ : APD shall determine the Projected Benefit
Obligation for any retirement or severance allowance or indemnity (to the
extent related to service for periods prior to the Closing and payable upon a
voluntary termination or separation), whether arising under applicable Law or
under a Business Plan, for all Current Business Employees located in Japan,
Italy and Korea using Current Actuarial Assumptions and Methods used for such
purposes by APD and the Accounting Principles. For Acquired Employees, such
Projected Benefit Obligation shall be an Assumed Benefit Obligation. For
Current Business Employees that do not become Acquired Employees or that
choose to receive a payment of such benefits under applicable Law, APD shall
retain all such obligations or pay them, as the case may be.

 



55 (iv) _United Kingdom_ : If any Transferred PMD Company has Liabilities
which arise under Section 75 or Section 75A of the Pensions Act 1995 (such
Liabilities being, for the avoidance of doubt, Retained Liabilities), between
the date hereof and the Closing Date, or (if that is not practicable) as soon
as practicable thereafter, APD will use reasonable best efforts to cause APD
and its Affiliates and following the Closing Date and provided that the terms
of the relevant arrangement are acceptable to Buyer, Buyer will use reasonable
best efforts to cause the relevant Transferred PMD Company, to enter into a
scheme apportionment arrangement or a flexible apportionment arrangement as
provided for under Regulation 6B or 6E of the Occupational Pension Schemes
(Employer Debt) Regulations 2005 (" _Debt Regulations_ ") pursuant to which
APD or its Affiliates (excluding the Transferred PMD Companies) assume
responsibility for all the relevant Transferred PMD Companys Liabilities
under Section 75 or Section 75A of the Pensions Act 1995 and the Debt
Regulations.

(v) For the purposes of this Section 5.18(d), " _Projected
Benefit Obligation_ " and " _Accrued Benefit Obligation_ " shall have the
meaning provided under GAAP. " _Current Actuarial Assumptions and Methods_ "
shall mean the current assumptions and methods used to determine benefits and
liabilities under the applicable Business Plan or statutory fund as of the
last day of the last plan year.

(e) Neither APD nor Buyer shall offer to any Current Business Employee any
additional compensation as an inducement to become an Acquired Employee (a "
_Transition Bonus_ ") unless mutually agreed upon by APD and Buyer in good
faith. APD and Buyer shall share any Transition Bonus equally (50%/50%).

(f) For Acquired Employees, APD or its Affiliate shall make full payment (or
pro rata, if the Closing occurs prior to September 30, 2016), based on actual
performance of all bonus and incentives for the fiscal year ending September
30, 2016 at the time set forth in the applicable plan and in accordance with
past practice. If the Closing occurs after September 30, 2016, APD shall make
pro rata payments of all bonus and incentives under the APD Annual Incentive
Plan or other bonus and incentive plans as of the Closing Date for the period
between October 1, 2016 and the Closing Date. Such pro rata payment shall be
made at target as determined under the relevant plan or scheme. APD shall
retain all liabilities with respect to any retention or change of control
bonuses provided under any employment or similar agreement entered into prior
to the Closing Date.

(g) Nothing in this Article V shall be construed to prevent the termination of
any Acquired Employee following the Closing Date.

(h) With respect to Acquired Employees who are employed in the U.S. (" _U.S.
Acquired Employee_ "), the following provisions shall apply:

(i) The U.S. Acquired Employees will be eligible to participate in the
benefit and compensation plans, policies and arrangements of Buyer or its

 



56  applicable Affiliates (the " _Buyer Benefit Plans_ ") effective as of end of
the period specified in the Transition Services Agreement. From and after the
end of the period specified in the Transition Services Agreement, Buyer shall
cause each Buyer Benefit Plan in which U.S. Acquired Employees are or will
become eligible to participate, to credit for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and (except with respect to defined benefit pension,
retiree welfare benefit plans and Buyer service award plans) benefit accrual,
the service of such employees with APD or its Affiliates (including the
Transferred PMD Companies) prior to the Closing Date as if such service were
with Buyer or its Affiliates, to the same extent as such service was credited
for such purpose by APD or its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date;
_provided_ that no such service credit will be required to the extent it
would result in a duplication of benefits or to the extent APD has not
provided reasonably requested information to credit such service. Buyer shall
use its commercial best efforts to cause each such Buyer Benefit Plan in which
U.S. Acquired Employees are or will become eligible to participate to (A)
waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions
would have been covered under an analogous benefit plan that was applicable to
such U.S. Acquired Employee (or his or her eligible dependents) immediately
prior to the Closing Date, (B) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence
of insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such U.S.
Acquired Employee (or his or her eligible dependents) on or after the Closing
Date, to the extent such U.S. Acquired Employee (or his or her eligible
dependents) had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an
analogous benefit plan that was applicable to such U.S. Acquired
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and (C) recognize under such
Buyer Benefit Plan, for the plan year that includes the Closing Date, any co-
payments, deductible payments and similar payments or expenses incurred by the
U.S. Acquired Employees under any analogous benefit plan that was applicable
to such U.S. Acquired Employee (or his or her eligible dependents) during the
plan year that includes the Closing Date.

 

(ii) Except as expressly provided in this Agreement or the Transition Services
Agreement, APD shall cause each U.S. Acquired Employee to cease participating
in and accruing additional benefits or service credit under any Business Plan
that is not a Transferred Business Plan or a Foreign Transferred Business
Plan. Effective as of the Closing Date, APD shall cause the Transferred PMD
Companies to cease to be participating employers in any Business Plan that is
not a Transferred Business Plan or a Foreign Transferred Business Plan.

 

(iii) U.S. Acquired Employees shall, as soon as administratively practicable
on or following the Closing Date, become eligible to participate in a U.S.
tax-qualified defined contribution plan sponsored by Buyer or one of its
Affiliates (" _Buyer_ __ _s 401(k) Plan_ "). As of the Closing Date, APD
shall fully vest the applicable U.S. Acquired Employees in their account
balances under the applicable U.S. tax-qualified defined contribution plans
sponsored by APD or its Affiliates (collectively, the " _Seller_ __ _s 401(k)
Plans_ ") and under the applicable U.S. tax-qualified defined benefit plans
sponsored by APD or its Affiliates (collectively the " _Seller_ __ _s DB
Plans_ "). Buyer agrees that Buyers 401(k) Plan will accept rollovers of the
account balances of U.S. Acquired Employees (including participant loan
promissory notes, subject to the following sentence) from Sellers 401(k)
Plans. With respect to the rollover of participant loans,

 



57  APD will take such actions as are reasonably necessary to ensure that such
rollover loans will not default as a result of the transaction, and APD and
Buyer will accommodate the loan rollover process for loans which, as of the
date of the rollover, are not in default; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
such rollover shall not include any securities of APD or its Affiliates and
shall be subject to such administrative rules and procedures as may be
mutually agreeable, the terms of the plans and receipt of a timely participant
election.

(iv) APD or its Affiliate shall retain all liability to provide continuing
health coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1985 (" _COBRA_ ") with respect to any "qualifying event" that occurs on or
prior to the Closing Date, including with respect to any "MandA Qualified
Beneficiaries" each as such term is defined under COBRA. As soon as
practicable following the Closing Date, Buyer or its Affiliate shall assume
that portion of the cafeteria plan sponsored by APD that meets the
requirements of Section 125 of the Code (" _APD Cafeteria Plan_ ") that
relates to the provision of medical expense reimbursement account benefits and
dependent care expense reimbursement account benefits for U.S. Acquired
Employees upon the Closing Date or such other date agreed in the Transition
Services Agreement (" _Cafeteria Plan Transfer Date_ "). Within a reasonable
time following the Closing Date, if amounts contributed to the APD Cafeteria
Plan for U.S. Acquired Employees exceed reimbursed claims under such accounts
as of the Cafeteria Plan Transfer Date, APD shall make a cash payment equal to
such excess amount to a cafeteria plan that meets the requirements of Section
125 of the Code sponsored by Buyer or its Affiliate. If reimbursed claims
under the APD Cafeteria Plan for U.S. Acquired Employees exceed amounts
contributed to the APD Cafeteria Plan as of the Cafeteria Plan Transfer Date,
Buyer or its Affiliate shall make a cash payment to APD equal to such excess
amount within a reasonable time following the last date on which a U.S.
Acquired Employee could submit a claim for reimbursement. Buyer agrees to
process and honor, or cause its Affiliate to process and honor, all elections
and eligible medical and dependent care expenses incurred before and following
the Cafeteria Plan Transfer Date and to continue such medical expense and
dependent care expense reimbursement accounts through the end of the calendar
year for those U.S. Acquired Employees participating in the APD Cafeteria Plan
immediately prior to the Cafeteria Plan Transfer Date.

 

(v) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide severance benefits
to any U.S. Acquired Employee whose employment is terminated during the one-
year period immediately following the Closing Date, in an amount that is at
least equal to the severance benefits provided under the Buyer Corporation
Severance Pay Plan.

 

Section 5.19 _Non-EU Small Jurisdictions_. For Current Business employees in
India, the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer
shall offer terms and conditions of employment as required under applicable
Law or in the alternative, substantially the same terms and conditions of
employment as provided by Buyer to similarly-situated Buyer employees in
the applicable jurisdiction.

 



58 Section 5.20 _Employment Cooperation and Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) Buyer and APD shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other to
effectuate the provisions set forth in this Article V relating to the
transfer of the Current Business Employees and the transfer of employment
related Assets and Liabilities that are Acquired PMD Assets and Assumed
Benefit Obligations, including by using reasonable efforts to cooperate to (i)
exchange information related to the Current Business Employees and their
dependents and beneficiaries, including employment records and benefits
information, (ii) establish mirror employee benefit plans and related trusts
to be maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Transferred PMD
Companies) following the Closing Date to the extent required by the terms of
this Agreement and (iii) encourage Current Business Employees to become
Acquired Employees (although, for the avoidance of doubt, this provision
shall not require Buyer to offer or continue to operate any particular
policies or contractual terms in relation to such Current Business Employees).

 

(b) APD shall provide an updated Section 3.12(a) to the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule and updated Section 3.12(c) to the Sellers Disclosure Schedule,
updated to include employee names and birthdates (to the extent permitted by
Law) and accrued vacation entitlement, and for any accruals or employment, or
other changes at least forty-five (45) days prior to the Closing Date. 

(c) Buyer and APD acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
Article V are included for the sole benefit of Buyer and APD and nothing
contained herein shall (i) be construed as an amendment to any employee
benefit plan or program, (ii) create any third-party beneficiary or other
rights in any other person, including any employee or former employee of any
of Buyer or Seller or their respective Affiliates, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof, or (iii) otherwise obligate Buyer or APD or any of their
respective Affiliates to maintain any particular employee benefit plan or
retain the employment of any particular employee following the Closing Date.

Section 5.21 _Compliance with WARN Act and Similar Statutes_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, APD shall cause each Transferred PMD Company and the
PMD Asset Sellers and any other APD Affiliate (in respect of the PMD
Business) to fully comply with the WARN Act, affecting in whole or in part any
site of employment, facility, operating unit or employee covered by this
Agreement. On or before the Closing Date, APD shall provide a list of the name
and site of employment of any Business Employees who, within ninety (90) days
prior to the Closing Date, have been terminated or who have experienced, or
would, if a layoff or hours reduction continued for six (6) months,
experience, an employment loss or layoff  as defined by the WARN Act. APD
shall update this list up to and including the Closing Date (" _Employment
Loss Update_ "). APD agrees to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Transferred PMD Companies) from and against any and all Losses which Buyer and
its Affiliates may incur in connection with any Action or claim of violation
brought against Buyer or its Affiliates under the WARN Act to the extent
related to materially inaccurate information provided by APD in the Employment
Loss Update.

(b) For ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer and its
Subsidiaries shall not engage in any conduct which would result in an
employment loss or layoff

 



59  under the WARN Act for a sufficient number of employees of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries which, if aggregated with any such conduct of APD or its
Affiliates prior to the Closing Date, would trigger any notice obligations
under the WARN Act; _provided_ , that Buyer shall be entitled to rely on the
information provided by APD. Except for Losses for which APD is required to
indemnify Buyer under Section 5.21(a), Buyer agrees to, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless APD and the Retained
Subsidiaries from and against any and all Losses which APD and the Retained
Subsidiaries may incur in connection with any Action or claim of violation
brought against APD and any of the Retained Subsidiaries under the WARN Act
to the extent related to actions taken by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
following the Closing Date with regard to any site of employment of the
Transferred PMD Companies or their Subsidiaries or any of their operating
units within any site of employment of the PMD Business.

Section 5.22 _Mail and Other Communications; Accounts_.

(a) After the Closing Date, each of APD and its Subsidiaries and Buyer and its
Subsidiaries may receive mail, packages and other communications (including
electronic communications) properly belonging to the other (or the others
Subsidiaries). Accordingly, at all times after the Closing Date, each of APD
and Buyer authorizes the other and their respective Subsidiaries to receive
and open all mail, packages and other communications received by it and not
unambiguously intended for the other party (or its Subsidiaries) or any of the
other partys (or its Subsidiaries) officers or directors, and to retain the
same to the extent that they relate to the PMD Business (in the case of
receipt by Buyer and its Subsidiaries) or the Excluded Businesses (in the case
of receipt by APD and its Subsidiaries), or to the extent that they do not
relate to the PMD Business (in the case of receipt by Buyer and its
Subsidiaries) or the Excluded Businesses (in the case of receipt by APD and
its Subsidiaries), the receiving party shall promptly after becoming aware
thereof refer, forward or otherwise deliver such mail, packages or other
communications (or, in case the same relate to both the PMD Business and the
Excluded Businesses, copies thereof) to the other party. The provisions of
this Section 5.22 are not intended to, and shall not be deemed to, constitute
an authorization by either APD or Buyer to permit the other to accept service
of process on its behalf and neither party is or shall be deemed to be the
agent of the other for service of process purposes.

 

(b) All payments and reimbursements received by APD or its Subsidiaries in
connection with or arising out of the PMD Business, the PMD Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities after the Closing shall be held by such Person in trust
for the benefit of Buyer and, immediately upon receipt by such Person of any
such payment or reimbursement, such Person shall pay over to Buyer the amount
of such payment or reimbursement, without right of set off.

(c) All payments and reimbursements received by Buyer or its Subsidiaries
in connection with or arising out of the Excluded Assets, Retained
Liabilities or Excluded Businesses, after the Closing shall be held by such
Person in trust for the benefit of APD and, immediately upon receipt by such
Person of any such payment or reimbursement such Person shall pay over to APD
the amount of such payment or reimbursement without right of set off.

 



60 Section 5.23 _Shared Contracts_.

 

(a) With respect to Shared Contractual Liabilities pursuant to, under or
relating to a given Shared Contract, such Shared Contractual Liabilities
shall, unless otherwise allocated pursuant to this Agreement, a Local Purchase
Agreement or a Related Agreement, be allocated between APD and Buyer as
follows:

 

(i) If a Liability is incurred exclusively in respect of the PMD Business or
the Excluded Businesses, such Liability shall be allocated to Buyer (in
respect of the PMD Business) or APD (in respect of the Excluded Businesses);

(ii) If a Liability cannot be so allocated under clause (i) above, such
Liability shall be allocated to APD or Buyer, as the case may be, based on the
relative proportions of total benefit received (over the term of the Shared
Contract remaining as of the Closing Date, measured as of the date of the
allocation) by the PMD Business or the Excluded Business under the relevant
Shared Contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of APD and Buyer shall be
responsible for any or all Liabilities arising from its (or its Subsidiarys)
breach of the relevant Shared Contract to which this Section 5.23 otherwise
pertains.

(b) If APD or any Retained Subsidiary, on the one hand, or Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred PMD Companies), on the other hand,
receives any benefit or payment which under any Shared Contract which was
intended for the other, APD and Buyer will, and will cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, deliver such benefit or payment to the other party.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that
the Shared Contracts listed on Section 5.23(c)(i) of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule shall not be deemed to be PMD Assets hereunder (the " _Excluded
Shared Contracts_ "). Without limiting the foregoing, the parties have
determined that it is advisable that certain Shared Contracts, which are
identified on Section 5.23(c)(ii) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, be
separated into separate Contracts between the appropriate third party and
either the Excluded Businesses or the PMD Business. From the date hereof until
the date that is eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date, the parties
hereto shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to enter
into or to grant, and to cause each third-party counterparty to each Shared
Contract identified on Section 5.23(c)(ii) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule
to enter into or to grant, any such new agreements or consents as
are reasonably necessary to permit APD and its Affiliates or Buyer and its
Affiliates, as applicable, to derive the benefits, and assume the obligations
and economic burdens, with respect to each Shared Contract identified on
Section 5.23(c)(ii) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule on an independent
basis following the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither APD, Buyer
nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be required to offer or grant any
financial or non-financial accommodation in connection therewith. If, on the
Closing Date, any such third party agreement or consent is not obtained, APD
and Buyer shall, and APD shall cause the other Sellers to, cooperate in a
mutually acceptable arrangement under which Sellers and their respective
Affiliates or Buyer and its Affiliates, as applicable, would in compliance
with Law, obtain the appropriate benefits and assume the related obligations
and bear the related economic burdens in respect of each Shared Contract

 



61  identified on Section 5.23(c)(ii) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule,
including by means of subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangements,
or enforcement by the party to such Shared Contract for the benefit (and at
the expense) of the other party or its Affiliates (as applicable) that is an
intended beneficiary thereof pursuant to this Section 5.23.

 

(d) As used in this Section 5.23, Buyers Subsidiaries shall include the
Transferred PMD Companies.

 

Section 5.24 _Obligations Regarding Non-Assignable Assets and Delayed_ _PMD
Assets_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, unless
and until such consent, approval or amendment described below is no longer
required or has been obtained, this Agreement, the Related Agreements, the
Other Transaction Documents and the Local Purchase Agreements shall not
constitute an agreement to assign, license, sublicense, lease, sublease,
convey or transfer at the Closing any PMD Asset, any Transferred PMD Company
or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom
as to which consent or approval from any Person (including consents and
approvals of Governmental Authorities) to assignment, license, sublicense,
lease, sublease, conveyance or transfer thereof or amendment thereof is
required but has not been obtained as of the Closing Date (such Asset, a "
_Delayed PMD Asset_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that to the extent not
inconsistent with the terms of any Delayed PMD Asset or applicable Law, the
parties shall treat Buyer as the owner thereof for Tax purposes as of the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, neither APD or any of its Affiliates nor Buyer or any of its
Affiliates shall be required to commence any litigation or offer or pay any
money or otherwise grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any
third party. Without limiting the generality of Section 5.3 and Section 5.4,
APD and Buyer shall use, and cause each of their Subsidiaries to use,
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such consent, approval or
amendment, including after the Closing Date. Upon obtaining the requisite
consents or approvals, such Delayed PMD Asset shall be transferred and
assigned to Buyer hereunder without additional consideration therefor.

 

(b) In the event and to the extent that, prior to the Closing, APD or any
Retained Subsidiary is unable to obtain a consent, approval or amendment
required to assign, license, sublicense, lease, sublease, convey or transfer
any Delayed PMD Asset to Buyer, then following the Closing, APD shall, and
shall cause the Retained Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to (i) continue to hold, and to the extent required by the terms applicable
to such Delayed PMD Asset, operate such Delayed PMD Asset in all material
respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and
taking into account the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
cooperate in any arrangement, reasonable and lawful as to APD and Buyer,
designed to provide to Buyer or its Subsidiaries the benefits arising under
such Delayed PMD Asset, including accepting such reasonable direction as
Buyer shall request of APD; _provided_ , _however_ , that the costs and
expenses incurred by APD or its Affiliates in connection with the foregoing
shall be borne solely by Buyer. APD shall, and shall cause the Retained
Subsidiaries to, without further consideration therefor, pay and remit to
Buyer promptly all monies, rights and other consideration received, net of any
costs associated therewith, in respect of such performance. Buyer shall
pay, perform and discharge fully, promptly when due, all of the obligations
of APD or the Retained Subsidiaries in respect of

 



62  such performance, and Buyer shall be responsible for all Assumed Liabilities
related thereto and indemnify the APD Indemnified Parties for all Losses
arising out of any actions (or omissions to act) of APD or any Retained
Subsidiary arising out of such performance or taken at the direction of Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer and its Affiliates shall use their
best efforts to obtain any consents, transfers, assignments, assumptions,
waivers, or other legal instruments necessary to cause Buyer or its relevant
Affiliate to be fully substituted for APD or any Seller of the PMD Assets on
any Permits, Environmental Permits, financial assurance obligations
or instruments, or other environmental approvals or filings associated with
the PMD Assets. APD shall use its best efforts to provide necessary assistance
or signatures to Buyer to achieve the purposes of this Section 5.24. Until
such time as the relevant Permits and Environmental Permits have been
transferred to Buyer or its Affiliates, Buyer or its relevant Affiliate(s)
shall comply with all applicable Environmental Laws, Permits and Environmental
Permits, including all reporting obligations and financial assurance
obligations, that remain in APDs name or the name of another Seller of PMD
Assets and that relate to the PMD Business.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Section 5.24, neither APD
nor any other of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action that
may, in the good faith judgment of APD or such Subsidiary, (i) result in a
violation of any obligation which APD or any such Subsidiary has to any third
party or (ii) violate applicable Law.

 

(e) Buyer acknowledges that certain consents and approvals to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be required from certain third parties,
and that such consents and approvals have not been and may not be obtained.
Subject to APDs and its Affiliates compliance with its obligations under
this Agreement, Buyer agrees that APD and its Affiliates shall not have any
liability whatsoever arising out of or relating to, the failure to obtain any
consents or approvals that may have been or may be required in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of the default
under or acceleration or termination of any Contracts, Permits or
Environmental Permits or other right or obligation, as a result thereof.
Subject to APDs and its Affiliates compliance with its obligations under
this Agreement, Buyer further agrees that no representation, warranty,
covenant or other obligation of APD contained herein shall be breached or
deemed breached, and no condition to Buyers obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed not satisfied, as
a result of the failure to obtain any such consent or approval or as a result
of any such default, acceleration or termination.

 

Section 5.25 _Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) If the Closing occurs, Buyer shall and shall cause the Transferred PMD
Companies to take any necessary actions to provide that all rights to
indemnification and all limitations on liability existing in favor of any
current or former officers, directors, partners, members, managers or
employees of the Transferred PMD Companies (collectively, the " _PMD
Indemnitees_ "), as provided in (i) the organizational documents of the
Transferred PMD Companies in effect on the date of this Agreement or (ii) any
agreement providing for indemnification by the Transferred PMD Companies of
any of the PMD Indemnitees in effect on the date of this Agreement to which
the Sellers or the Transferred PMD Companies are a party

 



63  and set forth in Section 5.25(a) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedules shall
survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and continue
in full force and effect and be honored by the Transferred PMD Companies
after the Closing.

(b) In the event that the Transferred PMD Companies or Buyer or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Transferred PMD Companies or Buyer, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.25, in each case to the extent such
person could be indemnified by the company of which it was an officer,
director, partner, member, manager or employee.

 

(c) The obligations of Buyer under this Section 5.25 shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom
this Section 5.25 applies without the express written consent of such affected
indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this
Section 5.25 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section
5.25). 

Section 5.26 _Funding_. Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that it shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, take all actions necessary, proper or
advisable to obtain all funding required to pay the Required Amount by no
later than the date when Buyer would be required to effect the Closing
pursuant to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, if the
funding required to pay the Required Amount has not been obtained, Buyer
shall continue to be obligated to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and effect the Closing on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article VII.

Section 5.27 _Schedule Updates_. If APD becomes aware of, or there occurs,
after the date of this Agreement any fact or condition that renders any
representation or warranty made by APD in Article III untrue, or if any fact
or condition requires any change in the Sellers Disclosure Schedule delivered
to Buyer at the time of execution of this Agreement, APD will have the right
to deliver to Buyer at or before the Closing a supplement to the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule specifying any needed change. Any such supplement to
Sellers Disclosure Schedule shall not be given effect for purposes of (i)
the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) or (ii) the indemnification
provisions under Section 8.4(a) herein.

 

Section 5.28 _Local Purchase Agreements; Related Agreements_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree to enter into, and to cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to enter into, each of the Local Purchase Agreements,
each of the Related Agreements and each of the Other Transaction Agreements to
which it is contemplated to be a party at or prior to the Closing Date. To the
extent there is a conflict between any of the provisions of this Agreement
and any of the Related Agreements, the provisions of such Related Agreement
shall control with respect to the subject matter thereof.

 



64 (b) From and after the Closing, APD and Buyer shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries party to the Local Purchase Agreements to comply with such
respective Subsidiaries obligations thereunder; _provided_ that the foregoing
obligations are subject to Section 5.24. Buyer and APD further agree to
unconditionally guarantee their respective Subsidiaries obligations under
this Agreement, the Local Purchase Agreements and the Related Agreements. APD
and Buyer agree that such Local Purchase Agreements shall not expand or limit
the rights and obligations of the Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer and its
applicable Subsidiaries party thereto, on the other hand, beyond those
provided for in this Agreement, and that the Local Purchase Agreements shall
not provide for any additional rights or obligations of the Sellers, Buyer or
the applicable Subsidiaries of Buyer party thereto that are not provided for
in this Agreement. APD and Buyer shall cooperate in the preparation of such
Local Purchase Agreements, which shall be prepared substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ with such changes as necessary to comply with
applicable Law of such foreign jurisdiction. To the extent there is a conflict
between any of the provisions of this Agreement and any Local Purchase
Agreement, APD and Buyer acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this
Agreement shall control and that, if necessary, APD and Buyer shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, deliver such additional instruments as
may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

Section 5.29 _Specified Litigation_. Without limiting Section 5.10, following
the Closing Date, APD shall have exclusive authority and control over the
investigation, prosecution, defense and appeal of the Existing APD Actions and
all then pending or threatened Actions to the extent relating to or arising in
connection with the Excluded Businesses, the Excluded Assets or the Retained
Liabilities (other than the Existing APD Actions), including Actions involving
the matters set forth on Section 5.29 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule
(each, an " _APD Action_ "), and may settle or compromise, or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to any such Action without the consent of
Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that if both APD (or a Retained Subsidiary)
and Buyer (or any of its Subsidiaries, including any Transferred PMD Company)
are named as parties to any APD Action (a " _Joint Action_ "), APD shall not
settle such Joint Action without the written consent of Buyer (not to be
unreasonably withheld) unless such settlement releases Buyer (or such of
its Subsidiaries (including any Transferred PMD Companies) named as parties)
in connection with such Joint Action and provides relief consisting solely of
money damages borne by APD (or a Retained Subsidiary). Without APDs prior
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
Buyer and its Affiliates shall not communicate regarding any APD Action with
any third party (other than Buyers or its Affiliates attorneys and auditors)
or make any public statement about any APD Action, in each case except as
required by Law or any Governmental Authority (subject to first consulting
with, and considering in good faith the views of, APD to the extent legally
permissible). As soon as practicable following the Closing, APD shall, and
shall cause the Retained Subsidiaries to, use its commercially reasonable
efforts to have Buyer, any Transferred PMD Company, any of their respective
Subsidiaries and any Buyer Indemnified Parties removed as parties to any APD
Action in which they are named parties as soon as is reasonably practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Article VI shall exclusively
govern with respect to Tax-related matters.

 



65 Section 5.30 _Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Transferred PMD Companies and the PMD
Business shall cease to be insured by the Sellers or their respective
Affiliates insurance policies or by any of their self-insured programs, and
neither Buyer nor its Subsidiaries shall have any access, right, title or
interest to or in any APD insurance policies (including to all claims and
rights to make claims and all rights to proceeds from insurance policies
maintained with third-parties) to cover any assets of the Transferred PMD
Companies or any Liability arising from the operation of the PMD Business on
or after the Closing. APD or the Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates may, to be effective at the Closing, amend any insurance policies
in the manner it deems appropriate to give effect to this Section 5.30(a).
From and after the Closing, Buyer shall be responsible for securing all
insurance it considers appropriate for its operation of the Transferred PMD
Companies and the PMD Business. At the Closing, Buyer agrees to take over and
assume all the known and incurred but not reported claims of the Transferred
PMD Companies and the PMD Business (other than Retained Liabilities), which
have been incurred as of the Closing Date, and Buyer agrees to be responsible
to pay such claims until they are finally settled and disclosed. Subject to
Section 5.30(b), Buyer further covenants and agrees not to seek to assert or
to exercise any rights or claims of any Transferred PMD Company or the PMD
Business under or in respect of any past or current insurance policy under
which any Transferred PMD Company or the PMD Business is or was insured
except to the extent constituting a PMD Asset under clause (b) or (c) below.

(b) If, after the date hereof but prior to the Closing Date, there shall
occur any physical damage to or destruction of, or theft or similar loss of,
any of the tangible assets constituting (or that, but for such occurrence,
would have constituted) a PMD Asset (a " _Casualty Loss_ "), then (a) if such
Casualty Loss is material to the PMD Business or the PMD Assets, (i) APD shall
promptly give notice to Buyer thereof and of APDs estimate of the amount of
casualty insurance, if any, payable to APD or its Affiliates in respect
thereof, and (ii) APD shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to replace
or repair (as applicable) the PMD Assets related to such Casualty Loss and (b)
if the Closing is consummated, and if such damaged, destroyed, stolen or lost
tangible assets have not been repaired or replaced as of the Closing Date,
then, without duplication or limitation of Buyers other rights hereunder,
promptly after any casualty or business interruption insurance proceeds from
insurance policies maintained with third-parties payable to APD or its
Affiliates in excess of self-insured retention amounts and not subject to
reimbursement with respect to such Casualty Loss have been collected, APD
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, pay to Buyer (i) the net amount, if
any, of the aggregate casualty insurance proceeds from insurance policies
maintained with third-parties described above that were paid to APD or its
Affiliates in connection with such Casualty Loss after deducting from such
aggregate proceeds an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by APD or its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date
in connection with the repair or replacement of such damaged, destroyed or
stolen assets and (ii) the net amount, if any, of the aggregate business
interruption insurance proceeds from insurance policies maintained with third-
parties described above that were paid to APD or its Affiliates in connection
with such Casualty Loss after deducting from such aggregate amount an amount
equal to the amount of the insured Losses incurred by APD or its Affiliate
prior to the Closing Date. APD shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to collect amounts due (if any) under
insurance policies in respect of any Casualty Loss. The amount of

 



66  any insurance proceeds paid to Buyer and the amount of the underlying
Liability giving rise to such insurance proceeds shall not be included for any
purposes in the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital.

(c) If, after the date hereof but prior to the Closing Date, there shall occur
any circumstance that results in, or would reasonably be expected to result
in, a Product Liability Claim, then: APD shall (a) promptly give notice to
Buyer of such Product Liability Claim and of APDs estimate of the Losses, if
any, reasonably expected to be incurred in connection with such Product
Liability Claim; (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly identify
and remediate (if appropriate) the underlying cause of any such Product
Liability Claim; (c) consistent with past practice, file a claim
for insurance under APDs or its Affiliates third-party insurance policies
in respect of any Product Liability Claim; and (d) subject to and effective at
the Closing, assign to Buyer, or cause its Affiliates to assign to Buyer, any
claims for insurance proceeds from insurance policies maintained with third
parties, or pay to Buyer, or cause its Affiliates to pay to Buyer, any amounts
previously collected by APD or its Affiliates, net of any costs incurred by
APD or its Affiliates in collecting such amounts, under such insurance
policies in respect of such Product Liability Claim in excess of self-insured
retention amounts and not subject to reimbursement. APD shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to collect amounts due
(if any) under insurance policies in respect of any Product Liability Claim.
The amount of any insurance proceeds paid to Buyer and the amount of any
underlying Liability giving rise to such insurance proceeds shall not be
included for any purposes in the calculation of the Closing Net Working
Capital.

(d) Without limiting the foregoing provisions of subsection (c), if the
Closing shall occur, APD shall continue to maintain for a period of three (3)
years following the Closing Date, "occurrences reported" insurance policies in
respect of Product Liability Claims substantially consistent with such
policies that are currently maintained by APD or any of its Affiliates as of
the date hereof (the " _Specified Insurance Policies_ ") and will continue to
include on such policies as insureds APD and its Affiliates with respect to
Product Liability Claims of the PMD Business, such that (and only for the
purpose that) claims made with respect to Product Liability Claims insured by
such policies in respect of the PMD Business as of the Closing Date (only
in respect of events occurring on or prior to such Closing Date) to the
extent constituting Assumed Liabilities would continue to be insured for such
three (3) year period in the same manner and to the same extent as if the
Closing had not occurred;  _provided_ that Buyer shall be responsible for any
self-insured retentions (including any coverage for which APD is required to
reimburse a third party insurer). Buyer shall reimburse APD or its applicable
Affiliate for any reasonable unreimbursed out-of-pocket costs or expenses
incurred by APD and its Affiliates in connection with making and enforcing
insurance claims relating to the PMD Business at Buyers request pursuant to
this Section 5.30(d). In furtherance of the foregoing, APD and Buyer agree
that all Liabilities in respect of Product Liability Claims relating to the
PMD Business in respect of any periods prior to the Closing shall be Retained
Liabilities solely to the extent covered by the Specified Insurance Policies
(excluding self-insured retentions and policies subject to reimbursement to
the third party); _provided_ , that such Liabilities shall only constitute
Retained Liabilities to the extent of the proceeds of insurance
actually recovered by APD or its Affiliates. APD and Buyer shall cooperate
reasonably with each other in, and use commercially reasonable efforts to
pursue, the collection of all such insurance proceeds in respect of
Liabilities relating to the PMD Business in respect of any periods prior to
the Closing.

 



67 Section 5.31 _Retransfer of Assets_.

 

(a) If either party determines, within twelve (12) months after the Closing
Date, that any of the Transferred PMD Companies owns any Excluded Assets, or
that any Assets have been transferred by the PMD Asset Sellers to the PMD
Asset Buyers, that are not PMD Assets, then Buyer shall transfer, assign and
convey, or shall cause any such Asset to be transferred, assigned and
conveyed, to APD or any of its Affiliates or other designees designated by
APD without any consideration therefor.

(b) If either party determines, within twelve (12) months after the Closing
Date, that any of APD or the Retained Subsidiaries owns any PMD Assets, or
that any Assets have not been transferred by the PMD Asset Sellers to the PMD
Asset Buyers, that are PMD Assets, then APD shall transfer, assign and
convey, or shall cause any such Asset to be transferred, assigned and
conveyed, to Buyer or any of its Affiliates or other designees designated by
Buyer without any consideration therefor.

 

Section 5.32 _Buyer Substitution_. Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain any consents, transfers, assignments, assumptions, waivers or other
legal instruments necessary to cause Buyer or the appropriate Affiliate of
Buyer to be fully substituted for the applicable Seller or Affiliate or
Subsidiary thereof with respect to any order, decree, judgment, agreement or
Action with respect to an Assumed Liability that is in effect as of the
Closing. Buyer shall inform the applicable Person, including Governmental
Authorities, about its assumption of the Assumed Liability associated with
the matters covered by this Section 5.32 and request that such Person direct
all communications, requirements, notifications and/or official letters
related to such matters to Buyer. APD shall (and shall cause its applicable
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to) use its reasonable best efforts to provide
necessary assistance or signatures to Buyer to achieve the purposes of this
Section 5.32. Until such time as Buyer and the applicable Sellers or
Affiliates or Subsidiaries thereof complete the substitutions outlined above,
Buyer shall comply with the terms and conditions of all such orders, decrees,
judgments, agreements and Actions that remain in the name of any of the
Sellers or their applicable Subsidiaries or Affiliates. 

Section 5.33 _Pasadena Facility_ ___Construction_.

 

(a) Until the Closing Date, APD shall use commercially reasonable efforts, in
good faith and consistent with APDs efforts prior to Closing and subject to
the Total Budget, achieve Mechanical Completion and Safe to Start for the new
production facility under construction in Pasadena, TX (the " _Pasadena Plant_
"), as planned by APD prior to execution of this Agreement and as reflected
on _Schedule L_. APD agrees not to make any material modifications to the
Pasadena Plant beyond those currently planned by APD as set forth on _Schedule
L_ , or to the activities and schedule set forth on  _Schedule L_ , or with
regard to any material changes to any contractors, subcontractors, vendors and
any other service providers, without the prior written consent of the Buyer
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(b) APD agrees that prior to Closing, upon five (5) Business Days advance
notice, Buyer may have reasonable access during normal business hours to the
site to observe APDs work on the Pasadena Plant and ensure compliance with
this Section 5.33,

 



68  provided (i) Buyers involvement shall be scheduled and limited so as not to
cause any project disruption or delay, or otherwise interfere with APDs
ability to meet its obligations as set forth above, (ii) prior to Closing,
Buyer shall not have access to competitively sensitive, privileged,
proprietary, or other confidential information reasonably withheld by APD and
(iii) Buyers representatives shall follow all reasonable instructions given
by APDs representatives, including all site safety procedures as may be
required by APD; _provided_ , that, prior to the Closing, so long as
Mechanical Completion and Safe to Start have not been achieved, APD shall,
at least once a month, within five (5) Business Days following the end of
each calendar month, deliver to and provide reasonable written updates to
Buyer regarding the status of the construction of the Pasadena Plant, which
updates shall include, but not be limited to, an estimate of the aggregate
amount of Construction Costs paid, expended or incurred to date, an updated
schedule estimating when Mechanical Completion and Safe to Start will be
achieved and any other updates that could reasonably be expected to have a
material impact on the construction of the Pasadena Plant.

(c) If APD notifies Buyer that APD has achieved Mechanical Completion and
Safe to Start prior to the Closing, APD agrees that, with reasonable advance
notice, Buyer may audit and copy from APDs books, records and other documents
(including computer files and supporting orders and invoices) as necessary to
verify APDs adherence to this Section 5.33; _provided_ , _that_ , APD may
request that such audit is conducted by a third-party, subject to customary
confidentiality obligations. Buyer may conduct such audit under this Section
5.33 at any time during normal business hours at the site and shall not cause
any project disruption or delay, or otherwise interfere with APDs ability to
meet its obligations hereunder. Buyer may only perform one (1) audit pursuant
to this Section 5.33(c); _provided_ , that, in the event such audit
determines APD has not satisfied its obligations pursuant to this Section
5.33, Buyer may, at its election, conduct one (1) or more subsequent audits,
as needed, to confirm Mechanical Completion and Safe to Start. The costs and
expenses of such audit shall be borne by Buyer; _provided_ , _that_ , if APD
has breached this Section 5.33 and has not cured such breach prior to the
audit, such costs and expenses shall be reasonably apportioned between the
parties as determined equitably by the auditor.

(d) At Closing, APD will assign to Buyer all of APDs right, title and
interest in any and all of the Pasadena Plant Assets, and Buyer shall assume
all of such right, title and interest, and all responsibility, Liabilities and
risk with respect to the Pasadena Plant Assets. In the event Closing occurs
before (i) APD has achieved Mechanical Completion and Safe to Start and (ii)
APD has incurred total Construction Costs up to the amount of the Total
Budget, Buyer may request and require that (x) APD assist, consistent
with APDs efforts prior to Closing, Buyer to achieve Mechanical Completion
and Safe to Start and (y) APD reimburse Buyer, and APD shall promptly (but in
any event within ninety (90) days) reimburse Buyer upon such request, for any
and all Construction Costs incurred to achieve Mechanical Completion and Safe
to Start (but APD shall not have any obligations for costs or expenses related
to changes, modifications or improvements not consistent with APDs plans
prior to Closing except as otherwise agreed by the parties in writing);
_provided_ , that, APDs obligations hereunder shall cease upon the earlier of
Mechanical Completion and Safe to Start or when APDs total Construction Costs
(inclusive of costs incurred pursuant to the foregoing clauses (x) and (y))
equal or exceed the Total Budget; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event
at any time prior to the Closing Date APDs total Construction Costs exceed or
are expected to exceed the

 



69  Total Budget prior to achieving Mechanical Completion and Safe to Start, APD
and Buyer shall enter into good faith discussions with respect to achieving
Mechanical Completion and Safe to Start. 

(e) APD shall not under any circumstances be obligated to (i) pay or incur
Construction Costs in connection with the Pasadena Plant in excess of the
Total Budget as set forth on _Schedule L_ or (ii) undertake any work or pay or
incur any expenses in connection with the Pasadena Plant (except routine
expenses to preserve and maintain the facility) after achieving
Mechanical Completion and Safe to Start. APD shall provide written notice to
Buyer upon completion of Mechanical Completion and Safe to Start. APD may
cease working and cease incurring additional Construction Costs in the event
APDs total Construction Costs exceed the Total Budget prior to Closing, and
APD shall not be obligated to pay or incur additional costs or expenses to
commence any testing, production or operations of the Pasadena Plant in the
event APD achieves Mechanical Completion and Safe to Start prior to Closing.

(f) In the event that Mechanical Completion and Safe to Start is achieved
prior to Closing and the Construction Costs paid or incurred by APD in
connection with the Pasadena Plant equal, in the aggregate, an amount less
than the Total Budget, Buyer may engage an independent and accredited third-
party expert reasonably acceptable to APD to verify that Mechanical
Completion and Safe to Start has been achieved, the costs and expenses of
which shall be borne by Buyer; _provided_ , _that_ , if such expert determines
that Mechanical Completion and Safe to Start has not been achieved, such
costs and expenses shall be apportioned between the parties as determined
equitably by the expert. Such expert shall (i) be permitted entry to the
Pasadena Plant, (ii) inspect the Pasadena Plant, (iii) verify that
Mechanical Completion and Safe to Start has been achieved and (iv) promptly
notify Buyer and APD whether Mechanical Completion and Safe to Start has been
achieved. In the event that such inspection concludes that Mechanical
Completion and Safe to Start has not been achieved, APD will promptly resume
all activities and efforts to achieve Mechanical Completion and Safe to Start.
If APD fails to resume its activities and efforts to achieve Mechanical
Completion and Safe to Start within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of
notice from the expert that Mechanical Completion and Safe to Start had not
been achieved, Buyer may, without prejudice to any other remedy Buyer may have
under this Agreement, pursue Mechanical Completion and Safe to Start,
pursuant to this Section 5.33; _provided_ that Buyers activities and efforts
to achieve Mechanical Completion and Safe to Start shall not relieve APD of
its obligations under this Section 5.33.

 

(g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any other
agreements or contracts, (i) Buyer understands and agrees that APD makes no
representations or warranties, and shall have no liability whatsoever, under
any theory, whether in contract (including warranty or indemnity) or in tort
(including negligence and strict liability) in connection with the performance
or non-performance of the Pasadena Plant, including but not limited to any
warranties of merchantability or fitness for use, or any representations,
warranties or guarantees of any kind regarding the volume, variety, efficiency
or purity of any products that may be produced from the Pasadena Plant, (ii)
APD shall have no liability under any theory whatsoever, whether in contract
(including warranty or indemnity) or in tort (including negligence and strict
liability), for any indirect, incidental, consequential or special damages in
any way arising from or relating to the Pasadena Plant, including without
limitation, any damages arising from or relating to delay, downtime,
diminution of value, loss of use, or loss 

 



70  of profits related thereto and (iii) without prejudice to the foregoing
clauses (i) or (ii), which shall take precedence over this clause (iii), in
the event APD provides any goods, materials, or services of any kind to Buyer
in connection with the Pasadena Plant after Closing, APDs sole and exclusive
liability with respect to any services provided after Closing shall be to re-
perform any materially defective services and with respect to any good or
materials supplied after Closing shall be to repair or replace any materially
defective goods or materials.

 

Section 5.34 _Pasadena Subdivision and Carve-Out Provisions_.

 

(a) At the Closing, APD or one of its Affiliates shall lease to Buyer the
parcel of land underlying the Pasadena Plant on the terms and conditions set
forth in the form of Ground Lease attached hereto as _Schedule N_ , together
with such requisite licenses, access easements, easements appurtenant and
other land rights as necessary for Buyer to access, own, operate,
maintain, repair, and replace the Pasadena Plant. Sellers shall retain access
rights to own and operate its environmental remediation systems on Tract V
including extraction wells, monitoring wells pumps, pipes and associated spare
parts inventory.

 

(b) At the Closing, APD or one of its Affiliates and Buyer shall enter into a
Utilities Supply Agreement, on the terms and conditions set forth in the form
attached hereto as _Schedule O_.

(c) The parties acknowledge that certain currently unused equipment,
vessels, and other parts remain on the parcel of land underlying the Pasadena
Plant from APDs prior plant operations that are not part of the Pasadena
Plant and which are not Excluded Assets (" _Residual Equipment_ "). Prior to
the Closing Date, APD shall provide Buyer with evidence, acceptable to Buyer
in its reasonable discretion, that APD has taken such measures as are
necessary to render such Residual Equipment sufficiently free of Hazardous
Substances for the purpose of making such equipment safe to conduct further
work on, including the demolition or rehabilitation of such equipment. Such
evidence shall include providing Buyer with any reasonably available
documentation in APDs possession relating to the removal of Hazardous
Substances from the Residual Equipment. Buyer shall, at its option, have the
right to inspect the Residual Equipment prior to the Closing Date, and APD
shall provide Buyer reasonable access to conduct such inspection. The parties
agree to cooperate in good faith to address any concerns reasonably raised by
Buyer in connection with the evidence provided by APD and any inspection by
Buyer of the Residual Equipment pursuant to this 
Section 5.34(c).

 

Section 5.35 _Calvert City Carve-Out Provisions_. At the Closing, APD or one
of its Affiliates shall lease to Buyer the parcel of land underlying Sellers
PMD plant (" _Calvert City PMD Plant_ ") and any real property associated with
the Calvert City Utility Assets on the terms and conditions set forth in the
form of Ground Lease attached hereto as _Schedule P_ , together with such
requisite licenses, access easements, easements appurtenant and other land
rights as necessary for Buyer to access, own, operate, maintain, repair, and
replace the Calvert City PMD Plant. Sellers shall provide such requisite
license, access easements, easements appurtenant and other land rights as
necessary for Buyer to access, own, operate, maintain, repair, and replace the
Calvert City Utility Assets as necessary to perform under the Calvert City
Utility Contracts.

Section 5.36 _Lease Amendment_. Prior to the Closing Date, APD will use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the amendment described on Section
5.36 of the

 



71  Sellers Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ , _however_ , that obtaining such
amendment shall not be a condition to Closing. If such amendment is not
obtained prior to the Closing, APD shall indemnify Buyer from any Losses
resulting therefrom in accordance with Article VIII without regard to the De
Minimis Claim Threshold or the Basket.

 

Section 5.37 _Milton, Wisconsin Vapor Investigation_.

 

(a) The parties agree that promptly after the date of this Agreement, Sellers
shall conduct a soil vapor investigation, including the sub-slab vapor
sampling, at Sellers sole cost, with respect to the Former Ken Roach
warehouse at the Milton Real Property (" _Former Ken Roach Warehouse_ ") in
accordance with a written scope of investigation (" _Scope of Work_ ")
prepared by an environmental consultant, approved by Buyer, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The approach set forth in the
Scope of Work shall be consistent with the Wisconsin DNR Vapor
Intrusion Documents. Sellers shall provide Buyer with a draft of the written
Scope of Work for review and comment, and shall, to the extent appropriate in
Sellers reasonable judgment, incorporate Buyers reasonable comments in the
Scope of Work prior to finalizing it. Sellers shall implement the final Scope
of Work at the Former Ken Roach Warehouse according to its terms and in
accordance with the Wisconsin DNR Vapor Intrusion Documents prior to the
Closing Date. Sellers shall repair any damage to the Milton Real Property
caused by the soil vapor investigation. Sellers shall require their
environmental consultant to provide draft findings of the soil vapor intrusion
investigation to the Buyer for review and comment, and shall cause their
environmental consultant, to the extent appropriate in the reasonable judgment
of said consultant, to incorporate Buyers reasonable comments, prior to
publishing a final report.

 

(b) If the soil vapor intrusion investigation identifies the presence of
Hazardous Substances in excess of Vapor Action Levels or Vapor Risk Screening
Levels referenced in, or developed in accordance with, the Wisconsin DNR Vapor
Intrusion Documents, Sellers shall perform, at their sole cost (except as
provided in subsection (c) below), those actions necessary to ensure
that environmental conditions at the Milton Real Property are not causing a
hazard to employees or other persons working or occupying the Former Ken Roach
Warehouse due to vapor intrusion. Such actions may include, in Sellers
reasonable judgment, further investigations prior to a determination that
mitigation measures are required, which further investigations shall be
subject to the review and comment procedures for the initial investigation set
forth in Section 5.37(a). Unless required by applicable Environmental Law,
Sellers shall not be obligated to report the findings of the vapor intrusion
investigation to any Governmental Authority or seek any approval or
concurrence of any Governmental Authority with respect to any
mitigation undertaken at the Former Ken Roach Warehouse. Any mitigation
efforts (1) shall be consistent with the requirements of any applicable
Environmental Laws and other applicable guidance, including the Wisconsin DNR
Vapor Intrusion Documents and (2) shall not materially or unreasonably
interfere with Buyers current or reasonably anticipated business operations
or other use of the Real Property. Sellers shall maintain reasonable
communications with Buyer and Buyers representatives related to any
mitigation efforts and, to the extent applicable, any regulatory
communications related thereto. Such communications shall include the
following with respect to any material proposal, plan, report, or proposed
correspondence relating to the vapor intrusion investigation or mitigation,
including any document proposing the contemplated method of mitigation (each a
" _Proposed Mitigation_

 



72   __ _Document_ "): (x) Sellers shall submit to Buyer a draft of each
Proposed Mitigation Document at least ten (10) Business Days before submitting
such document to a Governmental Authority, or, if no such submittal is
contemplated or necessary, proceeding with activities set forth in the
document; (y) Sellers shall incorporate Buyers reasonable comments, to the
extent appropriate in Sellers reasonable judgment, into the Proposed
Mitigation Document before finalizing it; and (z) once a Proposed Mitigation
Document is finalized and, if applicable, approved by the relevant
Governmental Authority (such document referred to as a " _Final
Mitigation Document_ "), Sellers shall conduct any mitigation in accordance
with the applicable Final Mitigation Document. Following the Closing, Buyer
shall provide reasonable access to the Milton Real Property and undertake
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Sellers in connection with
any mitigation efforts.

(c) Sellers shall be responsible for the cost of implementing any mitigation
required to ensure that environmental conditions at the Milton Real Property
are not causing a hazard to employees or other persons working or occupying
the Former Ken Roach Warehouse due to vapor intrusion. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent that mitigation involves the operation of existing
systems (such as the warehouses HVAC system) or systems installed by Sellers
to vent vapors that do not require any treatment of such vapors, Buyer shall
assume the obligation and the costs associated with the operation of such
systems.

(d) The parties agree to maintain the confidentiality of the soil vapor
intrusion investigation and the resulting report(s) except where disclosure is
(i) required by Law or directive of a Governmental Authority; (ii) prudent in
response to a third-party claim or to address concerns raised by employees,
(iii) necessary in connection with a financing, sale or lease of the real
property or the PMD Business, or (iv) necessary to obtain approval of a
Governmental Authority for mitigation at the Former Ken Roach Warehouse (if
such approval is required or if Sellers decide in their judgment to seek such
approval) and shall provide notice to the other parties in advance of any such
disclosure.

 

Section 5.38 _Intellectual Property Transfer Cooperation_. At Buyers
reasonable request and expense, APD shall reasonably assist in obtaining any
necessary documentation, including from any third parties as required, for the
preparation and/or transfer of the registrations and applications for PMD IP,
including seeking new assignments or powers of attorney from its inventors
or other third parties having any ownership claim or related right to any of
the Intellectual Property, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
provide necessary assistance or signatures to Buyer to achieve such transfer
(and recordation by Buyer thereof) within a timeframe that will not cause
Buyer to incur extension of time costs and penalties. Buyer shall be
principally responsible for preparing such documents to change ownership to
Buyer and any other documents with respect to actions requested by Buyer in
connection with this Section 5.38. Until such time as Buyer completes the
assignments and registration of the assignments to Buyer for all of the
registrations and applications for PMD IP (for which Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to complete expeditiously, and APD shall
reasonably cooperate therewith), APD shall provide Buyer with all Intellectual
Property related communications, such as office actions, annuity statements,
maintenance fee statements or other notices in a reasonable time for Buyer to

Affiliates and hold them harmless from, against and in respect of, without
duplication, (i) any Taxes attributable to or imposed on the Acquired PMD
Assets for or relating to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date and the portion of any Straddle Period (as defined herein) ending on the
Closing Date (computed in accordance with Section 6.2 hereof) (each, a " _Pre-
Closing Tax Period_ "); (ii) any Taxes imposed on or assessed against any of
the Transferred PMD Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period; (iii) any Taxes
(including Taxes imposed pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or a
similar provision of any state, local or foreign Tax Law) imposed on any
Transferred PMD Company as a result of being a member of any consolidated,
combined, affiliated or unitary group prior to the Closing; and (iv) any
Taxes attributable to or imposed on the Acquired PMD Assets or any of the
Transferred PMD Companies resulting from a breach of any representation or
warranty of APD set forth in Section 3.10; _provided_ that APD shall not
indemnify or hold Buyer or its Affiliates harmless from, against, or in
respect of, any Taxes attributable to or relating to any Post-Closing Tax
Period (as defined herein) other than Taxes resulting from a breach of a
representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.10(f), Section 3.10(h),
Section 3.10(l), Section 3.10(n), Section 3.10(o) or Section 3.10(p); and (v)
all Transfer Taxes borne by APD under Section 6.5, in each case except to
the extent taken into account in determining the Final Adjustment Amounts.
For purposes of this Section 6.1(a), APD shall be credited for any estimated
or other similar Tax payments made by APD, any of the Transferred PMD
Companies on or before the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, APD
shall not indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates from any
liability for Taxes directly related to any action outside the ordinary course
with respect to the Acquired PMD Assets or the Transferred PMD Companies
taken on the Closing Date after the Closing by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(other than any such action expressly required or permitted by this Agreement
or required by applicable Law) (a " _Buyer Tax Act_ ").

 



75 (b) _Buyer_ __ _s Indemnification of APD_. Buyer shall indemnify APD and its
Affiliates and hold them harmless from, against and in respect of, without
duplication, (i) any Taxes attributable to or imposed on the Acquired PMD
Assets for any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date and the portion
of any Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date (computed in
accordance with Section 6.2 hereof) (each, a " _Post-Closing Tax Period_ ");
(ii) any Taxes imposed on or assessed against any of the Transferred PMD
Companies for any Post-Closing Tax Period; (iii) any Taxes attributable to a
Buyer Tax Act or an action described in Section 6.11; and (iv) all Transfer
Taxes borne by Buyer under Section 6.5.

 

Section 6.2 _Closing of Current Taxable Year, Etc_ _._

 

(a) _Closing of Taxable Year_. To the extent required or permitted by Law
(including pursuant to Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 1502 of
the Code), the parties shall elect to close any taxable year of any
Transferred PMD Companies as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

 

(b) _Straddle Periods_. In the case of any taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), subject to
Section 6.2(c), the portion of Taxes (or any Tax refund and amount credited
against any Tax) that are allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending at the end of the Closing Date will be: (i) in the case of Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis without regard to income, gross receipts, payroll
or sales, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes (or Tax refund or amount
credited against Tax) for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of such
Straddle Period ending at the end of the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period and (ii) in
the case of all other Taxes, determined as though the taxable year of the
Transferred PMD Companies terminated at the end of the Closing Date.

(c)  _Transaction Tax Deductions_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Article VI, for purposes of determining the parties respective
liabilities for Taxes under this Article VI, the amount of Taxes attributable
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and a Post-Closing Tax Period shall be determined
by assuming that all deductions arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in each case to the extent paid by APD or its
Affiliates prior to or on the Closing Date or taken into account in
determining the Final Adjustment Amounts, are deductible in a Pre-Closing Tax
Period.

Section 6.3  _Tax Returns_.

(a) Except as provided in Section 6.5 hereof, APD shall prepare, or cause to
be prepared in accordance with applicable Law, and file or cause to be filed,
when due, all Tax Returns (other than Straddle Period Tax Returns that relate
solely to Transferred PMD Companies) with respect to Taxes for which APD is
responsible as described in Section 6.1(a) hereof, including income,
franchise, or other similar Tax Returns for any Transferred PMD Company for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall and shall cause the Transferred PMD
Companies to cooperate with, and take any action reasonably requested by, APD
with respect to the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns. The
immediately preceding sentence shall, in no way, be construed as limiting or
otherwise modifying the rights and obligations of the parties under Section
6.7 hereof.

 



76 (b) Except as provided in Section 6.5 hereof, Buyer shall prepare, or cause to
be prepared in accordance with applicable Law (in the case of any Straddle
Period Tax Return, consistent with past practice for such Tax Return except as
otherwise required by applicable Law) and file or cause to be filed, when due,
all Tax Returns with respect to the Transferred PMD Companies required to be
filed other than those described in Section 6.3(a) hereof.

(c) If either APD or Buyer is obligated under this Agreement to bear the
economic burden for any portion of the Tax payable in connection with any Tax
Return to be prepared and filed by the other (or an Affiliate of the other),
the party responsible for filing such return (the " _Preparer_ ") shall
prepare and deliver to the other party (the " _Payor_ ") a copy of such return
and, upon reasonable request by the Payor, any schedules, work papers and
other documentation that are relevant to the preparation of the portion of
such return for which the Payor is or may be liable hereunder not later than
thirty (30) days prior to the due date for such Tax Return (including
applicable extensions) (the " _Due Date_ "). The Preparer shall not file such
Tax Return until the earlier of (i) the receipt of written notice from the
Payor indicating the Payors consent thereto, or (ii) one (1) day prior to the
Due Date.

 

(d) The Payor shall have the option of providing to the Preparer, at any time
at least ten (10) days prior to the Due Date, written instructions as to how
the Payor wants any, or all, of the Tax Items for which it may be liable
reflected on such Tax Return; _provided_ that (i) Payor agrees in writing that
it is liable for the Tax payable with respect to such Tax Items, and (ii)
such instructions shall represent a reasonable and good faith interpretation
of relevant Law and is consistent with past practice. The Preparer shall, in
preparing such Tax Return, cause the items for which the Payor is liable
hereunder to be reflected in accordance with the Payors instructions on such
Tax Return. In the absence of having received instructions from Payor, such
items shall be reported in any manner determined by the Preparer.

 

(e) If either party is obligated under this Agreement to bear the economic
burden for any portion of the Taxes payable in connection with any Tax Return
for which such party is not responsible for filing under this Agreement, such
party shall timely pay to the party responsible for filing such Tax Return the
amount of any such Taxes. The party responsible for filing any Tax Return
under this Agreement shall timely pay any amounts received pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence (as well as any other Taxes due in respect of
such Tax Return) over to the relevant Governmental Authority.

 

Section 6.4 _Contest Provisions_.

 

(a) _Notification of Contests_. APD and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
Buyer and its Affiliates, on the other hand (the " _Recipient_ "), shall
notify the other party in writing within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by
the Recipient of written notice of any pending or threatened audits,
adjustments, assessments, examinations or proceedings (whether judicial or
administrative) (a " _Tax Audit_ ") which may affect the liability for Taxes
of such other party or may give rise to an indemnification payment under
Section 6.1 by such other party. If 

 



77  the Recipient fails to give such notice to the other party, or if such
notice is not in sufficient detail to notify the other party of the nature of
the Tax Audit, the Recipient shall not be entitled to indemnification for any
Taxes arising in connection with such Tax Audit to the extent such failure to
give notice materially adversely affects the other partys right to
participate in and contest the Tax Audit.

 

(b) _Which Party Controls_.

 

(i) _APD s Items_. If such Tax Audit relates to any Taxes for which APD is
liable in full hereunder, APD shall at its expense control the defense and
settlement of such Tax Audit (including selection of counsel, determining
whether to pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings
(whether judicial or administrative), hearings and conferences with any Tax
Authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either pay
the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable Law permits such refund
suits or contest such Tax Audit in any permissible manner);  _provided_ that
APD shall not settle or otherwise compromise such Tax Audit without Buyers
prior written consent if such settlement or compromise could adversely affect
in any material respect the Tax Liabilities of Buyer, the Transferred PMD
Companies or any of their Affiliates in a Post-Closing Tax Period. In no case
shall Buyer, the Transferred PMD Companies or any of their Affiliates settle
or otherwise compromise any Tax Audit referred to in the preceding sentence
without APDs prior written consent.

(ii) _Buyer s Items_. If such Tax Audit relates to any Taxes for which Buyer
is liable in full hereunder, Buyer shall at its expense control the defense
and settlement of such Tax Audit (including selection of counsel, determining
whether to pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings
(whether judicial or administrative), hearings and conferences with any Tax
Authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either pay
the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable Law permits such refund
suits or contest such Tax Audit in any permissible manner); _provided_ , that
Buyer shall not settle or otherwise compromise such Tax Audit without APDs
prior written consent if such settlement or compromise could adversely affect
in any material respect the Tax Liabilities of APD, the Transferred PMD
Companies or any of their Affiliates in a Pre-Closing Tax Period. In no case
shall APD or any of its Affiliates settle or otherwise compromise any Tax
Audit referred to in the preceding sentence without Buyers prior written
consent.

(iii) _Combined and Mixed Items_. If such Tax Audit relates to Taxes
for which both APD and Buyer are liable hereunder, to the extent possible
such Tax Items will be distinguished and each party will control the defense
and settlement of those Taxes for which it is so liable.

 

If such Tax Audit relates to any Straddle Period and any Tax Item cannot be
identified as being a liability of only one party or cannot be separated from
a Tax Item for which the other party is liable, the party which has the
greater potential liability for those Tax Items that cannot be so attributed
or separated (or both) shall control the defense and settlement of the Tax
Audit; _provided_ that such party defends the items as reported on the
relevant Tax Return; _provided_ ,

 



78   _further_ , that such party will not settle or otherwise compromise any
other Tax Audit without the other partys written consent, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(iv) _Participation Rights_. Any party who does not control a Tax Audit under
this Section 6.4(b) for which such party may be obligated to indemnify the
other party under this Article VI or who may be adversely affected in any
material respect by the outcome of such Tax Audit may participate at its own
expense in the defense of such Tax Audit and employ counsel of its choice at
its expense and the party controlling such Tax Audit under this Section 6.4(b)
shall in good faith keep such party informed with respect to such Tax Audit
and, upon the reasonable request of such party, shall consult with such party
from time to time regarding the conduct of such Tax Audit.

Section 6.5 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, all Tax Returns with respect to any excise, sales, use, value
added, transfer (including real property transfer), stamp, documentary,
filing, recordation and other similar taxes arising directly or indirectly
from the Closing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, those arising
pursuant to the Local Purchase Agreements) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be
timely filed by the party responsible for such filing under applicable Law (
_provided_ that such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed jointly by APD
and Buyer if either (i) no party to this Agreement is or (ii) both APD, on the
one hand, and Buyer and its Subsidiaries or the Transferred PMD Companies, on
the other hand, are responsible for filing such Tax Returns under the
applicable Law imposing such Transfer Taxes) and 50% of all such Transfer
Taxes (and 50% of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs for the preparation of
such Tax Returns) shall be borne by each of Buyer and APD. If a party pays a
Transfer Tax, the other party will reimburse such paying party for 50% of the
amount of any such Transfer Tax within thirty (30) days of the paying partys
written demand therefor. APD and Buyer shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to use commercially reasonable efforts to eliminate,
mitigate or reduce any Transfer Taxes (which may include the preparation and
filing of any claim for exemption or exclusion from the application or
imposition of any Transfer Taxes). Each of Buyer and APD, as applicable, shall
use commercially reasonable efforts following the Closing Date to obtain any
available refund or credit in respect of any Transfer Taxes to the maximum
extent available under applicable Law as soon as reasonably possible and, if
either Buyer or APD (or an Affiliate of Buyer or APD) receives a refund or
utilizes a credit in respect of any such Transfer Taxes, the recipient party
shall promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business Days of receipt,
pay to the other party an amount equal to 50% of such refund or credit.

 

Section 6.6 _Certain Post-Closing Settlement Payments and Post-Closing
Actions_.

 

(a) _Buyer s Claiming, Receiving or Using of Refunds and Overpayments_. If
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (A) receives any refund of Tax, or (B)

(B), (x) relates to Taxes paid by APD or any of its Subsidiaries with respect
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the
Closing Date, or (y) is the subject of indemnification by APD pursuant to this
Agreement, Buyer shall transfer, or cause to be transferred, to APD, within
thirty (30) days of receipt, the entire amount of the refund or
overpayment (including interest), net of any Tax and other costs imposed on
or payable by Buyer or any of its Affiliates with

 



79  respect thereto (including with respect to any interest on such refund or
overpayment), received or utilized by Buyer or any of its Affiliates. Buyer
agrees to notify APD within thirty (30) days after the discovery of a right
to claim any such refund or overpayment and the receipt of any such refund or
utilization of any such overpayment. Buyer agrees to claim any such refund or
to utilize any such overpayment as soon as practicable and to furnish to APD
all reasonably requested information, records and assistance necessary to
verify the amount of the refund or overpayment. The amount of economic benefit
of any refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes of the Transferred PMD Companies

an annual or per diem basis, in which case apportionment shall be on a pro
rata basis. 

(b) _APD s Claiming, Receiving or Using of Refunds and Overpayments_. If APD

benefit of any overpayment of Taxes which, in each case (A) and (B), (x)

taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning after the Closing Date
(including any refund of Tax in a Pre-Closing Tax Period by reason of a
carryback from a Post-Closing Tax Period) or (y) is the subject of
indemnification by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, APD shall transfer, or
cause to be transferred, to Buyer, within thirty (30) days of receipt, the
entire amount of the refund or overpayment (including interest), net of any
Tax and other costs imposed on or payable by APD or any of its Affiliates with
respect thereto (including with respect to any interest on such refund or
overpayment), received or utilized by APD or any of its Affiliates. APD agrees
to notify Buyer within thirty (30) days after the discovery of a right to
claim any such refund or overpayment and the receipt of any such refund or
utilization of any such overpayment. APD agrees to claim any such refund or to
utilize any such overpayment as soon as practicable and to furnish to Buyer
all reasonably requested information, records and assistance necessary to
verify the amount of the refund or overpayment.

(c) _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_. Except to the extent required by applicable
Law, none of Buyer, the Transferred PMD Companies or any of their Affiliates
shall amend any Tax Return prepared and filed by APD pursuant to Section

refund arising from carrybacks from a Post-Closing Tax Period to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period.

(h) execute such powers of attorney as are reasonably requested and required

3.3(a) ( _Capitalization_ ) with respect to the ownership of the PMD Shares
shall be deemed to be true and correct in all material respects if no more
than 1% of the issued and outstanding PMD Shares of any Transferred PMD
Company is owned by a Person other than the PMD Share Sellers. The
representations and warranties of APD contained in Article III (other than the
Fundamental Representations and the representations and warranties set forth
in Section 3.6(c) ( _Absence of Certain Changes_ )) shall be true and correct
as of the Closing Date as though made on the Closing Date (provided that
representations and warranties made as of a specified date, shall be true and
correct only as of such specified date), except where the failure to be true
and correct (without regard to any materiality or "Material Adverse Effect"
qualifications therein) would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) _Performance by APD_. APD shall have or caused to be performed and
complied in all material respects with all obligations and covenants required
by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by the Sellers on or prior
to the Closing. APD shall have or caused to be performed all obligations and
covenants contained in Section 1.1.

 



83 (c) _Required Consents_. All approvals, consents and waivers that are listed
on Section 7.3(c) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule shall have been
received, and executed counterparts thereof shall have been delivered to Buyer
at or prior to the Closing.

 

(d) _Certificates_. APD shall have furnished Buyer with such certificate
signed by its executive officer of APD to the effect that the conditions set
forth in Section 7.3(a) and Section 7.3(b) hereof have been satisfied.

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT; INDEMNIFICATION_

 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may only be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of APD and Buyer;

 

(b) by APD or Buyer if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before May 6,
2017 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_  that if on the Outside Date the
condition to the Closing set forth in Section 7.1(a) (if the failure to
satisfy such condition is a result of a Regulatory Law) or Section 7.1(b)
shall not have been satisfied but all other conditions to the Closing shall
be satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are
to be satisfied at the Closing ( _provided_ such conditions would be satisfied
as of such date)), then either party shall have the right to extend the
Outside Date an additional 90 days by notifying the other party in writing of
such election before the Outside Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available
to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement
(including under Section 5.3) shall have been the cause of, or shall have
resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date;

 

(c) by APD or Buyer if any Governmental Authority shall have issued an order,
decree or ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting any material portion of the transactions contemplated
hereunder and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become
final and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the terminating
party shall have fulfilled its obligations contained in Section 5.3 prior to
exercising its right to termination hereunder;

(d) by Buyer upon written notice to APD, if there shall have been a material
breach of any of the representations, warranties, agreements or covenants set
forth in this Agreement on the part of APD which would render the satisfaction
of any conditions set forth in Section 7.3 incapable of fulfillment, such
violation or breach has not been waived by Buyer, and (i) the breach has not
been cured within 30 days following Buyers written notice of such breach or
(ii) is not capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.1(d), if not exercised, shall terminate 60 days following delivery of such
written notice; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 8.1(d) shall not be available to Buyer if it is
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or other
agreement contained herein;

 



84 (e) by APD upon written notice to Buyer, if there shall have been a material
breach of any of the representations, warranties, agreements or covenants set
forth in this Agreement on the part of Buyer which would render the
satisfaction of any conditions set forth in Section 7.2 incapable of
fulfillment, such violation or breach has not been waived by APD, and (i) the
breach has not been cured within 30 days following APDs written notice of
such breach or (ii) is not capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 8.1(e), if not exercised, shall terminate 60 days following
delivery of such written notice; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(e) shall not be available
to APD if it is then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, or other agreement contained herein;

(f) by APD upon written notice to Buyer, if Buyer fails to consummate the
Closing within six (6) Business Days of the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 (other than those
conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing
(provided that such conditions would have been satisfied as of such date) or
the failure of which to be satisfied is attributable primarily to a breach by
Buyer of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement);

(g) by Buyer upon written notice to APD, if APD fails to consummate the
Closing within six (6) Business Days of the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 (other than those
conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing (provided
that such conditions would have been satisfied as of such date) or the
failure of which to be satisfied is attributable primarily to a breach by APD
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement).

 

Section 8.2 _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof, written notice thereof
shall forthwith be given to the other party, and, except as set forth in this
Section 8.2, this Agreement shall terminate and be void and have no effect and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned;  _provided_ that if
(x) such termination shall result from the Intentional Breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein or (y)
the Intentional Breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein shall cause the Closing not to occur, then
such breaching party shall be fully liable for any and all damages of any kind
incurred or suffered by the other party as a result of such failure or breach,
including, with respect to Intentional Breaches by a party, damages for the
lost value to the other party of the benefits of the transactions contemplated
by the Agreement (which damages shall not be limited to out-of-pocket
expenses, and which shall be determined without regard to any limitation on
types or measurement of damages in this Agreement); _provided_ , _further_ ,
that any failure by Buyer to consummate the Closing at any time at which APD
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f)
due to a breach by Buyer of its representations and warranties in Section 4.4
or a breach by Buyer of the obligations set forth in Section 5.26 __ shall be
deemed to be an Intentional Breach by Buyer; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that
nothing in this Section 8.2 shall limit Buyers obligation to pay the
termination fee under Section 5.3(d), if payable; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that in the event that APD receives payment of the termination fee under
Section 5.3(d), any damages recoverable by APD for an Intentional Breach under
this Section 8.2 shall be reduced by the amount of the termination fee paid to
APD under Section 5.3(d). If this Agreement is terminated as provided
herein: 

(a) each party hereto will redeliver, and will cause its agents (including
attorneys and accountants) to redeliver, all documents, work papers and other
material of each party hereto relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether obtained before or after the execution hereof;

 



85 (b) all Information received by Buyer with respect to the business,
operations, Assets or financial condition of APD or its Subsidiaries shall
remain subject to the Confidentiality Agreement; and

(c) notwithstanding the termination hereof, the following Sections of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect: (A) Sections 3.18 and 4.9
relating to brokers, (B) Sections 5.3(d), 5.13 and 8.1 and this Section 8.2
and (C) Article IX.

 

Section 8.3 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. The
representations and warranties contained herein shall survive the Closing and
shall thereupon terminate on the 18 month anniversary of the Closing Date;
_provided_ that (i) the Fundamental Representations and the Buyer Fundamental
Representations survive the Closing indefinitely, (ii) the representations
and warranties set forth in (A) Section 3.11 _(Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA_
), (B) Section 3.13 ( _Environmental Matters_ ), (C) Section 3.14(a) ( _Title
to Owned Real Property_ ) and (D) Section 3.16(a) ( _Title to Assets_ ), in
each case, shall survive the Closing and thereupon terminate on the three (3)
year anniversary of the Closing Date and (iii) the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.10 ( _Taxes_ ) shall survive the Closing
and shall thereupon terminate upon thirty (30) days following the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations. All covenants and agreements
contained herein which by their terms contemplate actions or impose
obligations following the Closing shall survive the Closing and remain in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms; _provided_ that for the
avoidance of doubt, (x) the obligations of Buyer to assume, and to indemnify
APD Indemnified Parties for, the Assumed Liabilities and (y) the obligations
of APD to retain, and indemnify Buyer Indemnified Parties for, the Retained
Liabilities shall in each case survive the Closing indefinitely. Claims with
respect to breaches of all other covenants and agreements contained herein
shall survive the Closing and shall thereupon terminate on the 18 month
anniversary of the Closing Date.

 

Section 8.4 _Indemnification_. This Article VIII shall not limit in any way
the parties obligations under Article VI.

 

(a) From and after Closing, and subject to Section 8.3 and this Section 8.4,
APD shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Subsidiaries and the
Transferred PMD Companies and each of their Affiliates and each of Buyers,
its Subsidiaries, the Transferred PMD Companies and their respective
Affiliates respective officers, directors, employees, and agents
(collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any
Losses (other than indemnification relating to Taxes, which shall be covered
exclusively by Article VI) to the extent arising from or in connection with
(i) the failure of the Sellers to duly perform or observe any covenant,
agreement or obligation to be performed or observed by the Sellers pursuant to
this Agreement or any Related Agreement, (ii) any of the Retained Liabilities,
(iii) any breach of any representation or warranty of APD set forth in
Article III of this Agreement (other than Section 3.10) or in any certificate
delivered by or on behalf of APD pursuant to this Agreement, (iv) subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 8.4(l), APD-

 



86  Indemnified Environmental Liabilities or (v) the Losses described in the
last sentence of Section 5.36. Buyer shall take and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to take all commercially reasonable steps, to
mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be
expected to, or does, give rise to such Loss.

 

(b) From and after Closing, and subject to Section 8.3 and this Section 8.4,
Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless APD and its Subsidiaries and each of
their Affiliates and each of APDs, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates
respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, the "
_APD Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any Losses to the extent
arising from or in connection with (i) the failure of Buyer to duly perform or
observe any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed or observed by
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or any Related Agreement, (ii) any of
the Assumed Liabilities, except that with respect to APD-Indemnified
Environmental Liabilities, Buyer shall not have an obligation to indemnify the
APD Indemnified Parties to the extent that Buyer Indemnified Parties have a
right to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.4(a)(iv), taking into account
any limitations on such right set forth in this Article VIII, or (iii) any
breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer set forth in Article IV of
this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement. APD shall take and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and Affiliates to take all commercially reasonable steps, to mitigate any Loss
upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to, or
does, give rise to such Loss.

(c) Any calculation of Losses for purposes of this Section 8.4 (including for
purposes of determining the amount of Losses for purposes of sub-sections (h)
and (i) below) or any indemnity payments made under Article VI hereof shall be
(i) net of any insurance or other third party recovery received by the
Indemnified Party (whether paid directly to such Indemnified Party or
assigned by the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party) less the amount
of any increases in premiums attributable to such claim and (ii) reduced to
take account of any Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party as
a result of any such Losses or Taxes in the year in which such Losses or Taxes
are incurred or in the immediately following year. The amount of any Tax
benefit actually realized by an Indemnified Party shall be (i) calculated on
a "with-and-without basis", after taking into account all other Tax attributes
of such Indemnified Party and any taxable income recognized by the Indemnified
Party from the receipt of any related indemnity payment, and (ii) in the case
of a Tax benefit for which the related indemnity payment will result in
decreased depreciation or amortization deductions to the Indemnified Party,
shall be reduced by 50%. Any indemnity payment under this Agreement or any
payment made by APD or Buyer pursuant to Section 6.5 in satisfaction of a
Transfer Tax that is the responsibility of the other party under local Law
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, for all Tax purposes,
unless a Final Determination with respect to the Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates causes any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for Tax purposes. Each of the parties shall notify the
other parties if it receives notice that any Tax Authority proposes to treat
any indemnity payment under this Agreement as other than an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes. A party (and its Affiliates) shall not be
deemed to have suffered a "Loss" with respect to an item to the extent such
party was actually compensated therefor by reason of an increase in the amount
otherwise paid to it or a reduction in the amount otherwise paid by it
pursuant to Section 2.5 hereof.

 



87 (d) No Action or claim for Losses subject to indemnification under this
Section 8.4 with respect to a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement shall be brought or made
after the date on which such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
shall terminate pursuant to Section 8.3 hereof, regardless of when the facts
underlying such claim are first discovered; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
claim made after the Closing and prior to such termination date with
reasonable specificity by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party
shall survive (and be subject to indemnification) until it is finally and
fully resolved.

(e) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, no indemnity may be
sought hereunder in respect of any Losses to the extent such Liability (or
lack thereof) was specifically addressed or taken into account in determining
the Final Adjustment Amounts.

 

(f) (i) Upon receipt by a Buyer Indemnified Party or APD Indemnified Party
(the " _Indemnified Party_ ") of notice from a third party of any action,
suit, proceeding, claim, demand or assessment (a " _Third Party Claim_ ")
against such Indemnified Party which might give rise to a claim for Losses
under this Section 8.4, the Indemnified Party (or APD or Buyer on behalf of
an Indemnified Party) shall promptly give written notice thereof to the party
from whom indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") setting
forth, with reasonable specificity, the nature of and facts underlying each
particular claim (including identification of particular sections of this
Agreement pursuant to which indemnification is being sought), a copy of any
documentation received from the third party and, to the extent then possible,
an estimate of the Losses relating thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that
failure to give such notice shall not eliminate the right to indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been
prejudiced as a result of such failure. Except as specifically provided in
Section 8.4(k), the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its option,
within twenty (20) Business Days, to assume by written notice the defense of,
at its own expense and by its own counsel, any such matter as to which the
Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification hereunder; _provided_ that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of a Third
Party Claim and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
retained by the Indemnified Party if (A) such Third Party Claim relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation or (B) to the extent such Third Party Claim
relates to Taxes (which shall be subject to Article VI); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in any such case, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right
to retain its own counsel (but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be
at the expense of the Indemnifying Party) and participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party shall, in accordance with
the preceding sentence, undertake to compromise or defend any such asserted
liability, it shall notify the Indemnified Party in writing of such
undertaking and its intention to do so, and the Indemnified Party shall, and
cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel (at the Indemnifying Partys expense) in the compromise of, or
defense against, any such asserted liability, (C) the primary objective of
such Third Party Claim is to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against
the Indemnified Party, (D) the Indemnified Partys potential Losses in excess
of the Cap exceed the Indemnifying Partys potential indemnification
obligations hereunder or (E) the Indemnifying Party does not agree in writing
that it would be obligated (without reservation of any rights) to pay all
Losses arising from or related to such Third Party Claim (subject to the
limitations of indemnification contained

 



88  in this Section 8.4, if applicable) if such claim was valid and
indemnifiable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not
settle any such asserted liability without the written consent of the
Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld) unless such settlement
releases the Indemnified Party in connection with such matter and provides
relief consisting solely of money damages borne by the Indemnifying Party.
Except with respect to Existing APD Actions, notwithstanding an election of
the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of such action or proceeding, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and
to participate in the defense of such action or proceeding. The Indemnifying
Party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of one such separate
counsel pursuant to the preceding sentence in each jurisdiction (and shall pay
such fees, costs and expenses at least quarterly), if, but only if, (A) the
defendants in, or targets of, any such action or proceeding include both an
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and such Indemnified Party shall
have reasonably concluded, based on a written opinion of counsel (which may
be inside counsel), that there is a material conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party with respect to such proceeding
(in which case the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to direct the
defense of such action or proceeding on behalf of the Indemnified Party) or
(B) the Indemnifying Party shall not have employed counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such Indemnified Party to represent such Indemnified Party
within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or
proceeding. In any event, the Indemnified Party and its counsel shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel and to the extent the
Indemnified Party asserts any position in any proceeding that is inconsistent
with the position asserted by the Indemnifying Party that increases the Loss,
the Indemnifying Party shall not have any indemnification obligation to the
extent of such increased Loss.

 

(ii) Except as specifically provided in Section 8.4(k), if the Indemnifying
Party does not undertake to compromise or defend any Third Party Claim within
twenty (20) Business Days pursuant to Section 8.4(f)(i) above, then the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in any such defense at
its sole cost and expense, but in such case, the Indemnified Party shall
control the investigation and defense of the asserted liability; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall not consent to any settlement of
a Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
The Indemnifying Partys decision to allow the Indemnified Party to take the
lead with respect to any indemnity obligation of the Indemnifying Party shall
not limit, expand or otherwise affect the Indemnifying Partys obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to any such indemnity obligation,
and if an Indemnified Party settles a Third Party Claim it is defending
pursuant to this Section 8.4(f)(ii) without obtaining the Indemnifying
Partys written consent to such settlement in violation of the immediately
preceding sentence, then the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of its
indemnification obligations hereunder with respect to such Third Party Claim.

(iii) In the event any Indemnified Party should have an indemnification claim
against any Indemnifying Party under this Agreement that does not involve a
claim by a third party, promptly after becoming aware of any facts or
circumstances which the Indemnified Party believes have given or would
reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification pursuant to
this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim to
the Indemnifying Party in writing

 



89  setting forth, with reasonable specificity, the nature of and facts
underlying each particular claim (including identification of particular
sections of this Agreement pursuant to which indemnification is being sought)
and to the extent then possible, an estimate of the Losses relating thereto.
The failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have to
such Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has
been prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution
of such dispute for thirty (30) days following notice of such claim and, if
not resolved through negotiations during such 30-day period, such dispute
shall be resolved by litigation in the appropriate court of competent
jurisdiction in accordance with Section 9.9.

(g) The indemnification provisions of this Agreement (i) shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy (other than Article VI and injunctive relief or specific
performance as contemplated by Section 9.7) following the Closing with respect
to any breach or non-fulfillment of any representation, warranty, agreement,
covenant or any other obligation contained in this Agreement, the IP
Assignment Agreement or, in each case, the Exhibits or Schedules thereto, (ii)
shall apply without regard to, and shall not be subject to, any limitation
by reason of set-off, limitation or otherwise and (iii) are intended to be
comprehensive and not to be limited by any requirements of Law concerning
prominence of language or waiver of any legal right under any Law (including
rights under any workers compensation statute or similar statute conferring
immunity from suit). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other
rights, claims and causes of action (including rights of contributions, if
any) known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the
future, that it may have against APD or any of its Affiliates or Buyer or any
of its Affiliates, as the case may be, arising under or based upon any Law
(including any such Law relating to environmental matters (including
Environmental Laws) or arising under or based upon any securities Law, common
Law or otherwise). The obligations of the parties set forth in this Section
8.4 shall be conditioned upon the Closing having occurred. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, in no event shall any party, its successors
or permitted assigns be entitled to claim or seek rescission of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 8.4(g) shall limit any
Persons right to seek and obtain any remedy on account of fraud by any
Person.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein and subject to
Section 8.4(j), neither APD nor Buyer shall be required to provide
indemnification for Losses under Section 8.4(a)(iii), Section 8.4(a)(iv) (to
the extent set forth in Section 8.4(l)(ii)(C)) and Section 8.4(b)(iii) to the
Buyer Indemnified Parties or APD Indemnified Parties, respectively, (i) for
any individual item or series of related items to the extent arising out of
the same or similar facts and circumstances where the Loss relating thereto is
less than $750,000 (the " _De Minimis Claim Threshold_ ") or (ii) in respect
of each individual item or series of related items to the extent arising out
of the same or similar facts and circumstances where the Loss relating thereto
is equal to or greater than the De Minimis Claim Threshold, unless the
aggregate amount of all such Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties
or APD Indemnified Parties, as applicable, with respect to such breaches (in
the aggregate), exceeds $35,000,000 (the " _Basket_ "), in which case the
obligation to provide indemnification under

 



90  Section 8.4(a)(iii) and Section 8.4(a)(iv) (to the extent set forth in
Section 8.4(l)(ii)(C)) and Section 8.4(b)(iii) to the Buyer Indemnified
Parties or APD Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, shall only apply with
respect to such amounts that are in excess of the Basket.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein and subject to
Section 8.4(j), neither APD nor Buyer shall be required to make payments for
indemnification to Buyer Indemnified Parties or the APD Indemnified Parties,
respectively, under Sections 8.4(a)(iii), Section 8.4(a)(iv) and Section
8.4(b)(iii) when the aggregate amounts paid by APD or Buyer, as applicable,
with respect thereto exceeds $380,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ").

 

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, (i) neither the
Basket nor the Cap shall apply to any claim involving Losses to the extent
arising out of or relating to a breach of any Fundamental Representation,
Buyer Fundamental Representation or any claim involving Losses resulting from
fraud and (ii) the De Minimis Claim Threshold shall not apply to any
claim involving Losses to the extent arising out of or relating to a breach
of any Fundamental Representation, any Buyer Fundamental Representation or any
claim involving Losses resulting from fraud.

 

(k) For purposes of determining (i) the occurrence of a breach of, or
inaccuracy in, any representations or warranties contained in this Agreement
or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement (except for the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.5 ( _Financial
Statements_ ), Section 3.6(c) ( _Absence of Certain Changes_ ), Section
3.11(a) ( _Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA_ ), Section 3.16(c) ( _Condition of
Assets_ ) and the first paragraph (inclusive of (a) through (i) of such
paragraph and the definition of "Material Contracts") of Section 3.17 (
_Contracts_ )), or (ii) the amount of Losses resulting from a breach of, or
inaccuracy in, any representations or warranties contained in this Agreement
or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, all qualifications
as to "materiality", "material", "in all material respects", "materially
adverse", or "Material Adverse Effect" contained therein shall not be given
effect.

 

(l) Additional Provisions Related to Environmental Matters:

 

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, all of the provisions of Section 8.4 shall
also be applicable to claims related to environmental matters, except to the
extent that there is a conflict between such provisions and this Section
8.4(l), in which case this Section 8.4(l) shall control.

 

(ii) Sellers obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant
to Section 8.4(a)(iv) ( _APD-Indemnified Environmental Liabilities_ ) shall
be limited to the percentage of the Losses as follows:

(A) With respect to any Remediation Liabilities:

(a) For each claim made in good faith between the Closing Date and the day
immediately prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date: one hundred
percent (100%) of the Losses arising from such claim.

 



91 (b) For each claim made in good faith between the second anniversary of the
Closing Date and the day immediately prior to the third anniversary of the
Closing Date: ninety percent (90%) of the Losses arising from such claim.

(c) For each claim made in good faith between the third anniversary of the
Closing Date and the day immediately prior to the fourth anniversary of the
Closing Date: eighty percent (80%) of the Losses arising from such claim.

 

(d) For each claim made in good faith between the fourth anniversary of the
Closing Date and the day immediately prior to the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date: seventy percent (70%) of the Losses arising from such claim.

(e) For each claim made in good faith between the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date and the day immediately prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date: sixty percent (60%) of the Losses arising from such claim.

 

(f) For each claim made in good faith between the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date and the day immediately prior to the seventh anniversary of the
Closing Date: forty percent (40%) of the Losses arising from such claim.

(g) For each claim made in good faith between the seventh anniversary of the
Closing Date and the day immediately prior to the eighth anniversary of the
Closing Date: twenty percent (20%) of the Losses arising from such claim.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Sellers shall
not be responsible for, nor be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified
Parties with respect to any claim for Remediation Liabilities pursuant to
Section 8.4(a)(iv) asserted on or after the eighth anniversary of the Closing
Date.

 

(B) With respect to Environmental Compliance Liabilities:

pursuant to Section 8.4(a)(iv) asserted on or after the third anniversary of
the Closing Date.

 

(C) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, (1) until the
sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, Sellers shall not be required to
provide indemnification for Losses under Section 8.4(a)(iv) for any

 



92  individual item or series of related items (x) where the Loss relating
thereto is less than the De Minimis Claim Threshold or (y) where the Loss
relating thereto is equal to or greater than the De Minimis Claim Threshold,
unless the aggregate amount of all Losses subject to indemnification under
Section 8.4(a) (iii) and (iv) exceeds the Basket, in which case the obligation
to provide indemnification under Section 8.4(a)(iv) shall only apply to such
amounts that are in excess of the Basket and (2) from the sixth anniversary to
the eighth anniversary of the Closing Date, Sellers shall not be required to
provide indemnification for Losses under Section 8.4(a)(iv) for any
individual item or series of related items where the Loss relating thereto is
less than the De Minimis Claim Threshold, it being understood that any
individual item or series of related items that is equal to or in excess of
the De Minimis Claim Threshold shall be indemnifiable for Losses in excess of
the De Minimis Claim Threshold and not be subject to the Basket.

(D) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Sellers shall
not be required to make payments for indemnification under Section 8.4(a)(iv)
when the aggregate amount of all payments by Sellers under Section 8.4(a)(iii)
and (iv) with respect thereto exceeds the Cap.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Sellers
indemnity obligation pursuant to Section 8.4(a) with respect to (w) any
breach of APDs representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.13, (x)
APD-Indemnified Environmental Liabilities, (y) Known Environmental Matters and
(z) APD Landlord Real Property Hazardous Substance Liabilities, in each case,
shall be subject to the following limitations:

(A) Sellers shall not be responsible for any Losses, including costs of
Cleanup, to the extent such Losses are incurred due to any change in use of
the facilities from manufacturing to any other use; _provided_ that such
limitation shall not apply to changes in use to the extent that such
activities are implemented by APD or any other PMD Asset Seller.

(B) Sellers shall only be responsible for Losses to the extent that such
Losses arise out of matters: (1) in order to correct a violation of
Environmental Laws that is the subject of an indemnification obligation as an
Environmental Compliance Liability; (2) when there is an obligation under
Environmental Law or Environmental Permit to undertake an investigation or
Cleanup; (3) when there is a valid order or other directive of a Governmental
Authority to undertake such investigation or Cleanup or correct
an Environmental Compliance Liability; (4) when a settlement has been reached
with a Governmental Authority or other person, which, with respect to such
settlement, Buyer has complied with the applicable provisions of this
Agreement with respect to the defense and resolution of the claim leading to
such settlement; and (5) to the extent that a Third Party Claim has been
asserted by a Governmental Authority or other person, the undertaking of
actions to respond or resolve such claim is reasonably prudent and has been
consented to by Sellers (such consent not to be unreasonably denied or
delayed, provided that Buyer has complied with the applicable provisions of
this Agreement with respect to such Third Party Claim).

 



93 (C) Sellers shall not be responsible for any Losses that result from a
decision by Buyer to close, in whole or in part, any of its facilities or
operations, including by way of example, any obligation to undertake
investigation and Cleanup of environmental media that is triggered by such
closure; _provided_ that this limitation shall not apply to Losses (1)
incurred to undertake Cleanup with respect to a decision by Sellers to close
or remove regulated environmental units, such as underground storage tanks,
that are not undertaken in connection with the complete cessation of
operations at a facility or (2) that result from decisions to close facilities
or operations that are implemented by Sellers at APD Landlord Real Property.

 

(D) Sellers shall not be responsible for costs of Cleanup or other Losses
arising out of or related to any environmental investigation, assessment,
study or other remedial or corrective action that any Buyer Indemnified Party
voluntarily initiates, performs or causes to be performed by any Person or
Governmental Authority after the Closing Date (" _Post-Closing Environmental
Activities_ ") and Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless APD Indemnified
Parties for any Losses resulting from such actions, _provided_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply to (1) Post-Closing Environmental
Activities undertaken as a result of investigation or Cleanup that is
conducted pursuant to this Agreement to address the presence or a Release of
Hazardous Substances that is subject to indemnification pursuant to Section
8.4(a) or (2) the extent that Buyer Indemnified Parties identify such issues
as a result of (t) a requirement to conduct such Post-Closing Environmental
Activities pursuant to Environmental Laws, an Environmental Permit (including
any closure requirement set forth in any such Environmental Permit;
_provided_ that Section 8.4(l)(iii)(C) shall remain applicable as to whether
any Losses related to such closure are indemnifiable), or a facially valid
directive of a Governmental Authority; (v) Post-Closing
Environmental Activities reasonably undertaken in response to an
Environmental Claim asserted by any Person or Governmental Authority, with the
consent of APD, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; (w) Post-
Closing Environmental Activities reasonably undertaken due to written notice
of a condition that reasonably suggests an imminent and substantial
endangerment to workers or others on site or sensitive environmental
receptors; (x) a non-intrusive environmental compliance audit that the Buyer
Indemnified Party undertakes as part of its regular and routine environmental
management practices; (y) legitimate work undertaken to repair equipment or
facilities or in connection with expansion or modification of operations; or
(z) if APD consents to such Post-Closing Environmental Activities.

(E) If any Buyer Indemnified Party sells (or otherwise ceases to own) any
Real Property and the right of Buyer Indemnified Parties to indemnification
with respect to (1) Section 8.4(a)(iii) for breach of the representations set
forth in Section 3.13, (2) APD-Indemnified Environmental 

 



94  Liabilities, (3) Known Environmental Matters and (4) APD Landlord Real
Property Hazardous Substance Liabilities has not terminated or expired, Buyer
shall make a good faith effort or shall cause said Buyer Indemnified Party to
make a good faith effort to: (x) include Section 8.4(l)(iii)(A) or equivalent
language in the purchase and sale agreement, if applicable, and (y) include
language requiring the Buyer to agree that any indemnification with respect
to environmental contamination shall be based on the industrial nature of the
Real Property and shall include the use of institutional and engineering
controls, including deed restrictions, if applicable and necessary, with
respect to the Cleanup of such contamination.

(F) For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers shall be responsible for any
operating, reporting, and well-closure costs associated with on-going
monitoring required after the date a determination is received from the
Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the real property in question
that no further action is required with respect to the alleged or actual
contamination of soil, groundwater or surface water that is the subject of an
indemnification claim (" _Remediation Completion Date_ "); provided, that this
provision does not apply to groundwater monitoring that may be required at
the Wichita Real Property as a result of a hazardous waste corrective action
permit that may be issued for this property, which obligation shall be the
obligation and responsibility of Buyer.

 

(G) Sellers shall not be responsible for the performance of or costs of
operation and maintenance incurred after the Remediation Completion Date
associated with any institutional or engineering controls implemented as part
of Cleanup; _provided_ that this limitation shall not apply to APD Landlord
Real Property Hazardous Substance Liabilities. Without limiting the
foregoing, Buyer agrees that it shall be responsible for the performance of
and the costs of operations and maintenance associated with the engineering
and institutional controls with respect to the former evaporation pond and
former drum storage area that located on property purchased by APD
Manufacturing Corporation from Abbott Laboratories pursuant to the Abbott 2011
Agreement and shall be responsible for all Losses resulting from actions at
said property that disturb said controls, including excavation of
contaminated soils in such areas.

(H) Neither party shall be obligated to indemnify the other party for any
costs and expenses associated with oversight of the other partys performance
of its defense and indemnity obligations, including costs of outside
consultants or attorneys or internal costs attributed to the time spent on
an indemnified matter by the other partys management or employees.

(iv) With respect to any indemnity obligation of Sellers arising from or in
connection with the Known Environmental Matters (excluding (a) the agreed upon
investigation/corrective action to address potential vapor intrusion relating
to the Milton, WI facility, as to which the obligations and rights of the
parties are to be governed by Section 5.37 of this Agreement; and (b) the
Known Environmental Matters relating to Wichita, KS, as set forth on Item 5 of
the Known Environmental Matters

  



95  schedule, and Vernon, CA, as set forth on Item 8 of the Known Environmental
Matters schedule) and the APD Landlord Real Property Hazardous Substance
Liabilities, to the extent such indemnity obligation (1) relates to a Third
Party Claim, APD shall have the right to defend, compromise and settle any and
all such Third Party Claims, and (2) relates to (i) the investigation or
Cleanup of any exposure to or Release of any Hazardous Substance or (ii) the
investigation of or corrective action for any potential or actual non-
compliance with Environmental Laws, APD shall have the right to take the lead
and implement any such investigation, corrective action or Cleanup,
provided that APD shall do so in accordance with all applicable Environmental
Laws and Environmental Permits, including the Pasadena Hazardous Waste Permit
and the Calvert City Solid Waste Permit and any related plans addressing
investigation or Cleanup, and any other applicable directive or requirement
of Governmental Authorities with jurisdiction over such matters. Buyer may, at
its own expense, remain involved in the performance of any action respecting
clauses (1) and (2) of the preceding sentence (except to the extent that such
involvement would unreasonably interfere with the performance of the work),
and APD shall promptly provide copies to Buyer of all notices, correspondence,
draft reports and final reports related to such matter. However, for the
avoidance of doubt, Buyers involvement as provided in this Section 8.4(l)(iv)
shall not include communications or contact of any nature whatsoever with any
Person or Governmental Authority except as specifically approved in writing
by APD or as otherwise expressly authorized pursuant to this Agreement. APD
shall undertake any such work required herein in a manner designed to minimize
any disruption, to the extent reasonably practicable, with the conduct of
Buyers operations, if any, at the real property in question. Buyer shall
agree to allow access to conduct any of the work contemplated herein and shall
fully cooperate with APD in the performance of the work. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, with respect to any Environmental Compliance Liability matter that
involves taking actions to correct noncompliance with applicable Environmental
Law, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have the right to control such
corrective actions in accordance with Section 8.4(l)(vii).

(v) With respect to any indemnity obligation of Sellers for or pursuant to (A)
Section 8.4(a)(iii) for any breach of APDs representations and warranties
set forth in Section 3.13, (B) APD-Indemnified Environmental Liabilities, and
(C) the Known Environmental Matters relating to Wichita, KS (as set forth on
Item 5 of the Known Environmental Matters schedule) and Vernon, CA (as set
forth on Item 8 of the Known Environmental Matters schedule), to the extent
such indemnity obligation (1) relates to a Third Party Claim, Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall have the right to defend, compromise and settle any
and all such Third Party Claims, and (2) relates to (x) the investigation or
Cleanup of any exposure to or Release of Hazardous Substance, which
investigation or Cleanup shall be governed by Section 8.4(l)(vi) below, or (y)
the investigation of or corrective action for any potential or actual non-
compliance with Environmental Laws, Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have the
right to take the lead and implement any such investigation, corrective action
or Cleanup, subject to the provisions of Section 8.4(l)(vii) below. APD may,
at its own expense, remain involved in the performance of any action
respecting clauses (1) and (2) of the preceding sentence (except to the extent
that such involvement would unreasonably interfere with the performance of
the work), and Buyer shall promptly provide copies to APD of all notices,
correspondence, draft reports and final reports related to such matter.
However,

 



96  for the avoidance of doubt, APDs involvement as provided in this Section
8.4(l)(v) shall not include communications or contact of any nature whatsoever
with any Person or Governmental Authority except as specifically pre-approved
in writing by Buyer or as otherwise expressly authorized pursuant to this
Agreement. To the extent relevant, APD shall agree to allow Buyer Indemnified
Parties and their Representatives access to conduct any of the work
contemplated herein and shall fully cooperate with Buyer Indemnified Parties
and their Representatives in the performance of the work.

 

(vi) With respect to any indemnity obligation of Sellers with respect to (w)
Section 8.4(a)(iii) for any breach of APDs representations and warranties
set forth in Section 3.13, (x) APD-Indemnified Environmental Liabilities, and
(y) the Known Environmental Matters relating to the Wichita, KS (as set forth
on Item 5 of the Known Environmental Matters schedule) and Vernon, CA (as set
forth on Item 8 of the Known Environmental Matters schedule), to the extent
such indemnity obligation relates to the investigation or Cleanup of any
Release of any Hazardous Substance (" _Indemnified Remediation Activities_ ")
the following provisions shall apply:

(A) Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have control over the Indemnified
Remediation Activities and shall conduct such Indemnified Remediation
Activities in accordance with all applicable Environmental Laws;

 

(B) Sellers indemnification obligations for Losses arising from Indemnified
Remediation Activities are limited to their share of the amount which is
equal to the cost of satisfying the Remediation Requirement, as determined
pursuant to this Section 8.4(l)(vi).

 

(C) Within 180 days of APDs receipt from Buyer Indemnified Parties of notice
of a matter that is subject to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement,
APD shall submit to the Buyer Indemnified Parties a plan reflecting the
activities, if any, necessary to satisfy the Remediation Requirement with
respect to said matter (" _Baseline Remediation Plan_ "); _provided_ , that
if based on the circumstances of the matter, the parties agree that there is a
need to act more quickly to respond to the obligations of Environmental Law,
an order or directive of a Governmental Authority, or for some other reason,
APD shall submit such Baseline Remediation Plan on a more timely basis as
agreed to by the parties. The Baseline Remediation Plan must be prepared by an
environmental consultant (" _Baseline Consultant_ ") nationally recognized in
the country in which the subject Real Property is located. The Baseline
Remediation Plan must include the Baseline Consultants estimate of the net
present value of the cost of implementing, obtaining applicable Environmental
Permits for, and operating and maintaining the activities set forth in the
Baseline Remediation Plan, using factors and discount rates that are customary
in the environmental consulting and engineering business. The Baseline
Consultant shall base the Baseline Remediation Plan on the information
available to APD and the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to the
environmental conditions that are the subject of the investigation or Cleanup.
The parties shall coordinate to provide such information to the Baseline
Consultant.

 



97 (D) APD shall promptly notify the Buyer Indemnified Parties if the
Baseline Consultant concludes that it does not have sufficient information to
determine whether any action is necessary to comply with the Remediation
Requirement with respect to the matter, or, if action is required to comply
with the Remediation Requirement, the available information is not sufficient
to prepare a Baseline Remediation Plan. In that event, APD shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to conduct, at its sole expense, such
investigation, including environmental sampling, as it reasonably believes is
necessary to obtain information to allow the Baseline Consultant to prepare a
Baseline Remediation Plan as contemplated in this Section 8.4(l)(vi) and shall
undertake commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any resulting
disruption of the operations of the Buyers operations. The Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall grant APD and the Baseline Consultant reasonable access to the
Real Property in question for the purposes of conducting such investigation.
If investigation activities are undertaken pursuant to this Section
8.4(l)(vi)(D), APD shall submit a Baseline Remediation Plan within ninety (90)
days of the completion of such activities, unless the parties have agreed in
writing to an extension of such time or that such investigation must be
completed in a shorter amount of time.

(E) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have thirty (30) days from the date
they receive the Baseline Remediation Plan to notify APD whether they concur
with the findings of the Baseline Remediation Plan; _provided_ , that if based
on the circumstances of the matter, the parties agree that there is a need to
act more quickly to respond to the obligations of Environmental Law, an order
or directive of a Governmental Authority, or for some other reason, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall provide such response to the Baseline Remediation
Plan on a more timely basis as agreed to by the parties. If the Buyer
Indemnified Parties fail to notify APD of any disagreement with the Baseline
Remediation Plan within such thirty (30) day period (or such other period as
agreed to by the parties), the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be deemed to
have agreed to such Baseline Remediation Plan and waived any right of
disagreement with respect thereto, unless the parties have agreed in writing
to an extension of time to respond. If the Buyer Indemnified Parties concur
with the Baseline Remediation Plan or have not notified APD of any
disagreement with the Baseline Remediation Plan within the time period
provided in this Section 8.4(l)(vi)(E), the Baseline Remediation Plan shall
be considered final (" _Final Baseline Remediation Plan_ "), and Sellers
indemnification obligation with respect to the subject Indemnified Remediation
Activities shall be limited to their share of the Losses and shall not exceed
the amount of the estimate contained in such Final Baseline Remediation Plan,
except as adjusted as a result of a Material Change in Condition or a bi-
annual review as provided in Section 8.4(l)(vi)(G) below.

 

(F) In the event that the Buyer Indemnified Parties and APD disagree on a
material component of the Baseline Remediation Plan, the parties shall
thereupon attempt in good faith to resolve any differences. If the parties are
unable to reach such conclusion on their own within sixty (60) days of
submission of the Baseline Remediation Plan (or such shorter time as the
parties 

 



98  reasonably agree is necessary under the circumstances), they shall submit
the dispute for resolution to a mutually acceptable, nationally recognized
environmental consulting firm (" _Arbiter_ "), the cost of which will be
shared equally by the parties. If APD and Buyer Indemnified Parties cannot
reach agreement on the selection of a single Arbiter, APD and the Buyer
Indemnified Parties each will select an environmental consultant to confer
with an environmental consultant chosen by the other to jointly select a
consultant who will serve as the Arbiter. The standard governing the dispute
resolution process shall be whether the Baseline Remediation Plan satisfies
the Remediation Requirement with respect to such matter and comports with
Section 8.4(l)(vi)(C) above. If the Arbiter finds that the Baseline
Remediation Plan does not satisfy the Remediation Requirement and comport with
Section 8.4(l)(vi)(C) above, the Arbiter shall provide its own Baseline
Remediation Plan (now the " _Final Baseline Remediation Plan_ ") that
satisfies the Remediation Requirement and contains the information required in
Section 8.4(l)(vi)(C) above. In the event that the Arbiter issues a Final
Baseline Remediation Plan, Sellers obligation with respect to the subject
Indemnified Remediation Activities shall be limited to their share of the
Losses and shall not exceed the amount of the estimate contained in the Final
Baseline Remediation Plan, except as adjusted as a result of a Material Change
in Condition or a bi-annual review as provided in Section 8.4(l)(vi)(G) below.

 

(G) The parties shall repeat the estimation process set forth in Section
8.4(l)(vi)(A)-(E) above (1) every two (2) years with respect to any
Indemnified Remediation Activities until Cleanup is complete; and (2) upon
provision by Buyer Indemnified Parties of notice to APD of discovery of any
facts relating to a an indemnified matter indicating that the nature or extent
of the environmental conditions or the Cleanup required to comply with the
Remediation Requirement with respect to such indemnified matter are materially
different than contemplated in the prior Final Baseline Remediation Plan ("
_Material Change in Condition_ ").

(H) APD and Sellers and the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in good
faith to meet any deadline imposed by Environmental Laws for the completion
of any activities under this Section 8.4(l).

(vii) For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers shall be responsible for any Losses
associated with taking any actions to correct any actual or alleged violations
of Environmental Laws subject to indemnification, including any capital
improvements and repairs and modifications to capital improvements associated
with any property such as, without limitation, the installation of new or
upgrading existing pollution control equipment (collectively " _Corrective
Action_ "); _provided_ that Sellers responsibility for Losses arising from
Corrective Action shall be limited to those costs minimally necessary to
comply with applicable Environmental Laws, correct any alleged or actual
violation of Environmental Laws, and comply with any applicable directive or
order of or settlement agreement with any Governmental Authority or third
party with respect to the subject violations, taking into account only those
costs for Corrective Action that would be necessary to address operations as
they existed on the Closing Date to comply with

 



99  Environmental Law in effect as of the Closing Date (" _Corrective Action
Baseline Costs_ "). Without limiting the foregoing, APD may, at its own
expense, remain involved in the performance of any such Corrective Action
(except to the extent that such involvement would unreasonably interfere with
the performance of the work), and Buyer shall promptly provide copies to APD
of all notices, correspondence, draft reports and final reports related to
such matter. However, for the avoidance of doubt, APDs involvement as
provided in this Section 8.4(l)(vii) shall not include communications or
contact of any nature whatsoever with any Person or Governmental
Authority except as specifically pre-approved in writing by Buyer, provided,
that to the extent that such matter also involves penalties with respect to
such pre-Closing Date noncompliance, the Buyer shall allow APD to communicate
with Governmental Authorities, and no matter involving such penalties shall
be resolved without the consent of APD. In the event that there is a dispute
between the Parties as to whether a proposed Corrective Action is consistent
with actions that meet the standard for Corrective Action Baseline Costs, or
whether the actual costs of the Corrective Action exceed the Corrective Action
Baseline Costs, which dispute the parties cannot resolve within sixty (60)
days, having in good faith attempted to do so, the parties promptly shall
jointly retain an Arbiter to evaluate whether the Corrective Action is
consistent with the standard for Corrective Actions set forth in this Section
8.4(l)(vii) and to calculate the Corrective Action Baseline Costs.
In arriving at a calculation of the Corrective Action Baseline Costs, the
Arbiter shall estimate the net present value of the cost of implementing,
obtaining applicable Environmental Permits for, and operating and maintaining
the activities necessary to complete the Corrective Action, using factors and
discount rates that are customary in the environmental consulting and
engineering business. The Arbiters determination with respect to whether the
Corrective Action meets the standard for Corrective Actions set forth in this
Section 8.4(l)(vii) and with respect to the calculation of the Corrective
Action Baseline Costs shall be binding upon the parties. For the avoidance of
doubt, this provision does not affect in any way Sellers indemnification
obligations with respect to fines or penalties arising from actual or alleged
violations of Environmental Laws.

 

(viii) Prior to the Closing, APD shall deliver to Buyer true and correct
copies of all environmental reports and other documentation addressing
investigation, Cleanup, or the environmental conditions at the Pasadena Real
Property, the Reserve Real Property, and the Milton Real Property that are in
the possession or control of APD or Sellers, other than those documents that
have been provided in APDs electronic data room and those documents that are
Transferred PMD Books and Records.

 

(ix) With respect to the Wichita Real Property, the parties acknowledge that
pursuant to the Agreement and Purchase of Sale by and between Abbott
Laboratories and APD Manufacturing Corporation, effective March 23, 2011 ("
_Abbott 2011 Agreement_ "), Abbott Laboratories and APD Manufacturing
Corporation (x) provided indemnities to one other and undertook specific
environmental obligations with respect to the property that was subject to
that agreement and (y) separately entered into an access agreement providing
Abbott Laboratories with access to APD Manufacturing Corporations property
to comply with Abbott Laboratories groundwater monitoring obligations
pursuant to the Administrative Order on Consent in the Matter of

 



100  Abbott Laboratories, Wichita, Kansas 67277, Docket No. RCRA-07-2002-0130,
dated June 28, 2002, and to authorize Abbott Laboratories use of a deep well
on APD Manufacturing Corporations property for purposes of the disposal of
collected leachate and non-hazardous wastewater, subject to the terms of the
access agreement. Sellers and Buyer agree that they shall cooperate with one
another to ensure that to the extent the Abbott 2011 Agreement and related
access agreement are assigned by APD Manufacturing Corporation to Buyer, any
such assignment is consistent with the allocation of liabilities by and
between Sellers and Buyer in this Agreement and notwithstanding anything else
to the contrary, such assignment shall not disturb said allocation without an
express written agreement that the parties intend to amend or alter said
allocation of liabilities.

, _further_ , that Buyer (or its Affiliate) shall have the right to assign all
or any portion of its right, and obligations pursuant to this Agreement from

injunctive relief, specific performance or other equitable relief is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.
Each of the parties hereto hereby waives (a) the defense that a remedy at law
would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or

Section 9.8 _Publicity_. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby agrees
that no press release or similar public announcement or communication shall,
if prior to, or after, the Closing, be made or be caused to be made (including
by such parties respective Affiliates) concerning the execution or

with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing (i) either party may make
or cause to be made any press release or similar public announcement or
communication as may be required to comply with the requirements of any
applicable Laws or the rules and regulations of each stock exchange upon which
the securities of one of the parties is listed and (ii) either party may
disclose any information concerning the transactions contemplated hereby which
it deems appropriate in its reasonable judgment, in light of its status as a
publicly owned company, including to securities analysts and institutional
investors and in press interviews; _provided_ , that, with respect to the PMD
Business (except to the extent it relates to APDs activities with respect to
the effect on APD of the separation or disposition of the PMD Business), to
the extent

 



103  practicable, each party will try in good faith to remain within the bounds
