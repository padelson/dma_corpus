 **STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT**

  



  

This **STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT**  (this " ** _Agreement_** ") is made and
entered into as of April 17, 2004, between the persons or entities who are
signatories hereto and listed on **Exhibit A** hereto (each a " **
_Seller_** "), **DIGITAL RIVER, INC. _,_** __ a company organized under the
laws of Delaware (" ** _Parent_** ") and **BLITZ F03-1424 GMBH** , a company
organized under the laws of Germany and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(" ** _Buyer_** ").

  



  

 **RECITALS**

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , the Sellers are the owners of all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock (the " ** _Shares_** ") of element
5 Informationstechnologien und -dienstleistungen Aktiengesellschaft, a
company organized under the laws of Germany with its registered offices (
_Sitz_ ) at Cologne/Germany, registered with the commercial register at the
lower court of Cologne/Germany under registration number HR B 30389 (the " **
_Company_** "). All Shares are certificated by twenty share certificates (
_Aktienurkunden)_ (collectively the " ** _Share Certificates_** "). The
aggregate number of Shares reflected on the Share Certificates is equal to
the total number of Shares of the Company outstanding.

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , the Sellers desire to sell the Shares to Buyer, and Buyer
desires to purchase the Shares from the Sellers, for the consideration and
pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

 **ARTICLE 1** 
  
  **SALE AND TRANSFER OF SHARES; CLOSING**

  



  

1.1 _Purchase and Sale of Shares_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement each Seller hereby sells to Buyer, and Buyer hereby purchases
from each Seller, all of each Sellers Shares owned by each Seller, as listed
on **Exhibit A** and all other shares of the Company owned by each Seller.
The sale shall comprise all rights attached to the Shares. In particular the
profit of the current fiscal year including retained profits of preceding
fiscal years, if any ( _i.e._ profits carried forward and profits for which
no resolution on their use has been adopted) shall belong to the Buyer only.

  



  

1.2 _Purchase Price_.

  



  

(a) At the Closing (defined below), Buyer shall pay to Sellers, deposit in
escrow (the " ** _Escrow_** "), and pay to the parties identified on **Exhibit
B**,  **Exhibit C** and **Exhibit D**, in the amounts set forth therein,
aggregate cash consideration equal to an aggregate amount of One Hundred
Twenty Million United States Dollars (US$120,000,000) (the " **P _urchase
Price_** "). The Purchase Price to be paid at the Closing shall

  

      
   



  

be decreased by the following amounts, each of which shall be handled in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement:

  



  

(i) the amount of any Seller Transaction Expenses (as defined in Section 8.1
and set forth on **Exhibit B**);

  



  

(ii) the amount of the Total 2003 Plan Payment (as defined in Section 1.2(f)
and set forth on **Exhibit C**);

  



  

(iii) the amount of the Working Capital Deficit (as defined in Section 1.2(e)
and set forth on **Exhibit D**), if any; and

  



  

(iv) US$12,000,000 (divided among the Sellers on a pro rata basis) plus
US$1,500,000 (divided among the Management ** __** Shareholders on a pro
rata basis) will be deposited into Escrow to secure the indemnification
obligations to Buyer as set forth in Article 7, such amount as being
increased by interest or decreased due to withdrawals over the time
(hereinafter the " ** _Escrow Amount_** ").

  



  

(b) The difference between the Purchase Price and the total amounts to be
deducted therefrom under Section 1.2(a)(i) to (iv) shall be referred to
herein as the **_"Closing Consideration."_** The amount of the Closing
Consideration to be paid to each Seller at Closing (the " ** _Closing Cash
Payment_** "), and any amounts to be deposited into Escrow for such Seller,
shall be as set forth on and in accordance with **Exhibit A**. All amounts
deposited into Escrow on behalf of such Sellers are set forth in **Exhibit
A**. The initial Escrow Amount will be held for a period of eighteen (18)
months following the Closing Date and will be subject to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement by and among the Buyer, Shareholders Agent and the escrow
agent (the " ** _Escrow Agent_** ") named therein, substantially in the form
as attached hereto as **Exhibit E**, provided, however, that at the Closing
Date, the Escrow Amount will initially be held by the Interim Trustee (as
discussed in Section 1.3(c) below) until such time as the Buyer,
Shareholders Agent and Escrow Agent enter into the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(c) Simultaneously with the Closing Cash Payment, Buyer will pay the Seller
Transaction Expenses as set forth on **Exhibit B** via wire transfer to the
account designated in Section 1.3 on behalf of Montgomery and Co., LLC; Paul,
Hastings, Janofsky and Walker LLP; and P + P Pollath \+ Partners.

  



  

(d) Simultaneously with the Closing Cash Payment, Buyer will pay the amount
of the Working Capital Deficit with respect to the Silent Partnerships and
Shareholder Loans as set forth on **Exhibit G **via wire transfer to the
account designated in Section 1.3.

  



  

(e) _Silent Partnerships and Shareholder Loans_.

  



  

(i) The Company currently has outstanding amounts (including principal and
accrued and unpaid interest) pursuant to silent partnerships and debt
arrangements with certain of the Sellers as identified on **Exhibit G** (the
" ** _Silent Partnerships and Shareholder Loans_** "). Concurrently with the
Closing, the Company

  



  

2      
   



  

shall satisfy all amounts due under the Silent Partnerships and Shareholder
Loans as set forth on  **Exhibit G** out of the Companys existing cash
reserves; but only to the extent that such repayment does not exceed
4,375,000 plus additional interest not to exceed 125,000 (the " ** _Company
Repayment Amount_** "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if following payment
of the Company Repayment Amount, the Companys Working Capital would be less
than zero (any such lesser number being referred to as the " ** _Working
Capital Deficit_** "), the Company Repayment Amount shall be reduced by
the amount of the Working Capital Deficit.  Buyer shall pay the amount of
the Working Capital Deficit to the holders of Silent Partnerships and
Shareholder Loans as set forth on **Exhibit G**. Following payment of the
Company Repayment Amount and any amount paid by Buyer in connection with a
Working Capital Deficit, all amounts outstanding pursuant to the Silent
Partnerships and Shareholder Loans shall be deemed repaid in full. For
purposes of this Agreement, the " ** _Company s Working Capital_**" means
the difference between the Companys Current Assets and the Companys
Current Liabilities. For purposes of this Agreement, " ** _Current Assets_**
" means the sum of the following balances as reflected on the face of
the Companys balance sheet as of a specified date (i) cash and
cash equivalents (including any amounts received from the trustee of that
certain 2000 Direct Participation Plan (the **_"2000 Plan"_** ) on behalf of
payment to the Company from the beneficiaries of the trust pursuant to the
2000 Plan), (ii) all accounts receivable line items, (iii) prepaid expenses,
and (iv) other current assets. " ** _Current Liabilities_** " means the sum
of the following balances as reflected on the face of the Companys balance
sheet as of a specified date: (i) all short term liabilities to banks, (ii)
accounts payable to publishers and other accounts payable, (iii) deferred
income, (iv) accrued expenses, and (v) other current liabilities. In the
event the parties have a dispute regarding the payoff of the Silent
Partnerships and Shareholder Loans, then all such disputes shall be resolved
in accordance with the dispute mechanism set forth in Section (b) of Schedule
1.4. Promptly following the Closing, the Sellers shall provide to Buyer
written confirmation from the holders of the Silent Partnerships and
the Shareholder Loans that all obligations thereunder are terminated.

  



  

(ii) As of the Closing Date, Management shall in good faith prepare an
estimated closing statement (the " ** _Estimated Closing Statement_** ")
which reflects the Current Assets, Current Liabilities (each as defined
above) and Working Capital Deficit, if any, of the Company as of the Closing
Date. Within 90 days after the Closing, Buyer shall prepare a final closing
statement of the Company as of the Closing Date (the " ** _Final
Closing Statement_** "), reflecting the total amount of Current
Assets, Current Liabilities, and Companys Working Capital as of the Closing.
In the event the Working Capital Deficit, if any, reflected on the Final
Closing Statement is greater than the Working Capital Deficit, if any,
reflected on the Estimated Closing Statement (such excess amount, the " **
_Overpayment_** "), Buyer shall be entitled to deduct on a pro rata basis
from the Escrow Amount attributable to Sellers the aggregate amount of the
Overpayment. In the event the Working Capital Deficit, if any, reflected on
the Final Closing Statement is less than the Working Capital Deficit, if any,
reflected on the Estimated Closing Statement (such lesser amount, the " **
_Underpayment"_** ), Buyer shall pay to the Sellers the aggregate amount of
the Underpayment, but in no event will any payments under this sentence
increase the Purchase Price.

  



  

3      
   



  

(f) _Stock Option Plan 2003_. Pursuant to clause 7 of Section 9 of the
Companys Stock Option Plan 2003 (the " ** _2003 Plan_** "), Buyer elects in
its own and full discretion in accordance with the terms of the 2003 Plan and
in connection with the proposed Liquidation Event (as defined in the 2003
Plan), to pay cash to those persons entitled to receive consideration under
the 2003 Plan, which are listed on **Exhibit C**. The total cash to be paid
to each person entitled to receive such cash under the 2003 Plan shall be
equal to the product of (A) (i) the price per Share paid to the Sellers
pursuant to this Agreement, less, (ii) 24.00, and (B) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock underlying the total options held by such person
under the 2003 Plan (the aggregate amount payable to all such persons by the
Buyer being referred to as the " ** _Total 2003 Plan Payment_** "). At
the Closing, Buyer shall pay to each person listed on **Exhibit C** by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated
in Section 1.3 on behalf of such persons pro rata portion of the Total
2003 Plan Payment as set forth on **Exhibit C**.

  



  

1.3 _Delivery_ _ of the Shares, Closing_.

  



  

(a) The consummation of the purchase and sale of the Shares (the " **
_Closing_** ") provided for in this Agreement shall take place at the offices
of counsel to the Company in Cologne, Germany on April 17, 2004 (the " **

Trustee to deliver (" _u bereignen") _the Share Certificates to Buyers
Representatives upon the receipt of a fax statement of Hypovereinsbank AG,
Munich (Germany), confirming that the funds as outlined in Section 1.2 above
have been transferred to the trust account on behalf of the Sellers or the
named persons herein (the " ** _Bank Confirmation_** "). The Share
Certificates must be endorsed for and on behalf of the Buyer by the Sellers
without any conditions ( _unbedingte Indossierung_ ). For the avoidance of
doubt Buyers Representatives shall be _Alex H. Danzberger or Joel
Ronning_. Without undue delay, the Share Trustee shall transfer by wire
transfer: (i) the amounts set forth in Section 1.3(a) above for the Seller
Transaction Expenses (to the parties identified on Exhibit B), the Total 2003

Deficit (to the holders of the Silent Partnerships and Shareholder Loans),
the Escrow Amount (pursuant to the terms of Section 1.3(c) below) and the
Company Repayment Amount (to the holders of the Silent Partnerships and
Shareholder Loans) and (ii) each Sellers pro rata portion of the Closing
Consideration (minus respective banking fees) to the Sellers bank account
numbers at the respective banks as set forth in **Exhibit A.**

  



  

(c) At the Closing Date, the Share Trustee will transfer the Escrow Amount to
a trust account of Noerr Stiefenhofer Lutz whereby Dr. Kerstin Mast (the " **
_Interim Trustee_** ") will hold the amount as trustee of the Buyer and the
Sellers pending final negotiation of the Escrow Agreement with the Escrow
Agent. At the time the Buyer, Shareholders Agent and Escrow Agent execute
and deliver the Escrow Agreement, the Interim Trustee will transfer the
Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent. If the Buyer, Shareholders Agent and
Escrow Agent do not enter into the Escrow Agreement on or before the day that
is the 28th calendar day following the Closing Date, the Buyer and Sellers
agree that the Interim Trustee may deposit the Escrow Amount with the local
court pursuant to Section 372 of the German Civil Code. The Buyer and Sellers
then must follow the procedures of the local court to establish the Escrow
with an alternate escrow agent. The Escrow Amount will be transferred by the
Share Trustee to the Interim Trustee promptly following the opening by the
Interim Trustee of a United States dollar trust account.

(e) easements, covenants, rights-of-way and other similar restrictions of
record; and

  



  

(f) those liens listed on Part 4.13(f) of the Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

4.14 _Contracts_.

  



  

(a) Part 4.14(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and complete
list of all contracts to which the Company is a party or by which the Company
or any of its assets is bound other than (i) contracts involving the payment
by or to the Company, or creating any liability of the Company (whether
direct or indirect, fixed or contingent), of less than 25,000 and (ii)
contracts with customers (collectively, the " ** _Material Contracts_** ").

  



  

(b) Each Material Contract is in full force and effect and is enforceable
against the Company and, to the knowledge of Management, the other parties
thereto, in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and general equitable principles.
The Company is in material compliance with each contract listed on Part
4.14(a) of the

  



  

15      
   



  

Disclosure Schedule. To the knowledge of Management, all other parties to
such contracts are in compliance with the terms thereof in all material
respects.

  



  

(c) To the knowledge of Management, no event has occurred, and no
circumstance or condition exists that (with or without notice or lapse of
time) will, or could reasonably be expected to (i) result in a violation or
breach of any provisions of any Material Contract, (ii) give any person or
entity the right to declare a default or exercise any remedy under any
Material Contract, (iii) give any person or entity the right to
accelerate the maturity or performance of any Material Contract or (iv) give
any person or entity the right to cancel, terminate or modify any Material
Contract. The Company has not knowingly waived any of its material rights
under any Material Contract;

  



  

(d) No Material Contract can be terminated or otherwise ended by the other
contractual party due to the sale of the shares of the Company; no such
contract contains a provision according to which, in case of a change of
control in the Company, the contractual obligations could be amended to the
disadvantage of the Company.

  



  

(e) The Company has concluded no contracts with shareholders, or with
relatives of shareholders within the meaning of Section 15 of the German Tax
Code ( _Abgabenordnung_ ) or with persons, partnerships or estates which are
related to the Company within the meaning of Section 1 ss. 2 of the German
Foreign Tax Act ( _Au ßensteuergesetz_).

  



  

(f) Except as set forth in Part 4.14(f) of the Disclosure Schedule, the
Company is not a contractual partner to any sales agents or trade agents and
has not concluded any other similar contractual relationship according to
which, inter alia, payment claims pursuant to or according to Section 89b of
the German Commercial Code ( _Handelsgesetzbuch_ ) or any similar provision
could occur.

  



  

4.15 _Agreements_ _ with Customers_.

  



  

(a) The Company has approximately 10,000 publisher clients in its database,
all of whom are either a party to a written contract or have signed up on-
line to the Companys terms and conditions. To the knowledge of Management, to
the extent the publisher clients are engaged in business with the Company,
all publisher clients are in compliance with the terms thereof in all
material respects. The terms and conditions of the Companys standard
E-sales contract are in compliance in all material respects with the federal
and state laws of the United States and the laws of each of the European
Union and each of its member nations. The Company has provided Seller with a
copy of the Companys standard written contract and on-line terms
and conditions. Part 4.15 of the Disclosure Schedule identifies each
agreement with a customer that differs in any material respect from the
Companys standard written contract or the Companys terms and conditions.
Part 4.15 of the Disclosure Schedule lists each customer agreement that
contains a change of control provision that specifically permits such
customer to terminate the contract pursuant to such provision upon a change
of control of the Company or to amend the agreement to the disadvantage of
the Company pursuant to such provision of the contract (it being expressly
understood that the customer contracts

  



  

16      
   



  

may be terminable by customers independent of such change of
control provisions or transactions pursuant to other provisions of the
customer contract).

  



  

(b) The top ten (10) customers generated approximately  4,750,000 of the
Companys revenue during the twelve (12) months ended March 31, 2004.
Approximately 150 customers generated 80% of the revenue of the Company
during the twelve (12) months ended March 31, 2004 (such customers, the " **
_Top 80% Customers_** "). No one customer accounted for more
than approximately  1,500,000 of the Companys revenue during the twelve
(12) months ended March 31, 2004. No Top 80% Customer, supplier to, or
distributor of the Company has notified the Company of an intention to
terminate or substantially alter its existing business relationship with the
Company and Management has no reason to believe that such termination or
alteration of such relationship is likely to occur. No payment processor,
payment processing bank or credit card provider has informed the Company that
it intends to terminate its relationship with the Company, or given the
Company a notice or warning that it may do so in the future.

had any direct or indirect financial interest in, any Material Contract,
material transaction or material business dealing involving the Companys
business; (c) has at any time competed, directly or indirectly, with the
Company; and (d) has any claim or right against the Company (other than
rights to receive compensation for services performed as an employee of the
Company). For purposes of this Agreement, " ** _Related Party_** "
shall mean: (a) each individual who is, or who has at any time been an
officer or member of the Company; (b) each member of the immediate family of
each of the individuals referred to in clause (a); and (c) any trust or other
entity (other than the Company) in which any one of the individuals referred
to in clauses (a) and (b) above holds (or in which more than one of such
individuals collectively hold), beneficially or otherwise, a material voting,
proprietary or equity interest.

  



  

4.19 _Taxes_. All taxes, assessments, penalties, and interest and all
contributions to social insurance, that have become due from the Company on

for all taxes, contributions and social insurance contributions not yet due
for the period to the Financial Statement Date.  No concealed profit
distributions have been made to the shareholders.

  



  

4.20 _Customer Information_. The Company has delivered to Buyer complete and
accurate copies of the Companys policy regarding collection and use
of customer information, along with all amendments thereto (collectively, the

amendment occurred. The Company has not collected, disclosed or otherwise
used any customer information in violation of the Privacy Policy in effect at
the time such information was collected.

list of all employee benefit plans (" ** _Employee Benefit Plans_**

the provisions of ERISA, established, maintained or contributed to by the
Company.

  



  

(b) The Company does not maintain or contribute to any such Employee Benefit
Plan subject to ERISA that is not in substantial compliance with ERISA. None
of the Employee Benefit Plans is a "multiemployer plan," as defined in

19      
   



  

(e) The Company has not engaged in any transaction with respect to the

for prohibited transactions under ERISA or the Code nor have any of the
Companys managing members, officers, or employees to the extent they or any
of them are fiduciaries with respect to such plans, breached in any material
respect any of their responsibilities or obligations imposed upon fiduciaries
under Title I of ERISA or would result in any claim being made under or by or

to which Buyer or any of the assets owned by Buyer, are subject, in each case
without giving effect to the application of any law, rule or regulation
or order, decree or award applicable to any of the Sellers or their
respective affiliates.

  



  

5.4 _Consents_. Other than any required notice Buyer must make to the Company
on the acquisition of the Shares, the Buyer is not and will not be required

 **ARTICLE 6** 
  
  **POST  CLOSING COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES**

  



  

6.1 _Discharge of Directors and Officers_. The Company shall, and Buyer will
cause the Company to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the past and
existing Management and/or members of the Supervisory Board of the Company
and other persons entitled to indemnification under the articles of
association and bylaws of the Company and any indemnification agreements with
the Company, each as in effect on the date hereof, to the same extent that
such persons are entitled to indemnification under the Companys articles of
association, bylaws and indemnification agreements in effect on the date
hereof; _provided however_ , no such indemnification will be provided for
criminal acts, intentional misconduct or gross negligence. The parties agree
that the Buyer will insure that the Company does not bring any damages claim
for the failure to appoint a Supervisory Board as of August 2003.
Furthermore, Buyer will cause the Company to include and maintain in effect
in its charter document and bylaw provisions regarding limitation of
liability and indemnification of directors, officers and other persons which
are at least as favorable to such persons as those contained in the charter
and bylaws of the Company on the date hereof. The provisions of this Section
are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
person described in this Section and his or her heirs and representatives.

  



  

6.2 _Relocation of Parent Headquarters_. Buyer agrees that promptly after

22      
   



  

6.3 _Board Representation_. Concurrent with the Closing, Parent shall appoint
a member of Management as a member of the Board of Directors of Parent to

in any event within three (3) business days after Closing), Buyer
shall engage Ernst and Young LLP (Cologne) to perform a review of the
Companys historical value added tax payments and methodology and to
determine whether the Company has any material exposure for the nonpayment of
value added tax for any period prior to the Closing Date.  Ernst and Young LLP
shall, within 60 days of being engaged under this Section 6.4, issue a
written report of its findings and provide a copy of such report to Buyer and
to the Shareholders Agent. In the event that the report states that the
Company actually owes value added taxes which it has not already paid or
reserved for in excess of 1,000,000 as a result of its past operations, then
it is understood that, for purposes of Section 7.1, a _" **Material Tax
Matter** "_ has occurred.

  



  

6.5 _Management Representation Letter_. In connection with Ernst and Youngs
audit under United States generally accepted accounting principles (" ** _US

  **REMEDIES, INDEMNIFICATIONS**

  



  

7.1 _Survival (" _Verj ahrung")__. The representations and warranties made
by the Sellers in Article 3, the Management in Article 4 and the Buyer in
Article 5 of this Agreement shall survive the Closing until 11:59 p.m.
(German time) on the date that is the eighteen-month anniversary of the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the representations set forth in
Sections 3.1 and 4.2 shall survive the Closing until the date that is the
four-year anniversary of the Closing Date. However, claims against the
Management resulting from a Material Tax Event (Section 6.4 in connection
with Section 4.19) shall survive until the respective tax statements become
res judicata ( _Bestandskraft)_. The covenants of the parties in
this Agreement shall survive until the earlier of the date when fully
performed or the date of expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
The application of sec. 203 of the German Civil Code shall be excluded. It
is expressly agreed and understood that no indemnification and/or remedy
claim may be made with respect to representations and warranties after the
expiration of the applicable survival period.

  



  

7.2 _Indemnification by Management_. Each member of Management, severally but
not jointly, will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and (after the
Closing) the Company and their respective equity holders, directors,
officers, employees and agents (each a " ** _Buyer Indemnitee_** ") from and
against any and all damages in connection with:

  



  

23      
   



  

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty under Article 4
(a " ** _Management Warranty Breach_** "); or

  



  

(b) any default by the Management in the performance or observance of any of
their covenants or agreements hereunder.

  



  

7.3 _Indemnification by Sellers_. Each Seller, severally but not jointly,
will defend, indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer Indemnitee from and
against any and all damages in connection with any breach or inaccuracy of a
representation or warranty under Article 3 as it relates to such Seller (a "
** _Seller Warranty Breach_** "). In addition, each Sellers amount held
in escrow as set forth on **Exhibit A** shall be available to satisfy
any and all damages suffered by a Buyer Indemnitee in connection with a
breach of a representation or warranty in Article 4.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the case of a Seller Warranty Breach which relates to a
specific Seller or Sellers, and not to all Sellers (such as a representation
or warranty regarding a specific Sellers title to its shares or the good
standing, authorization or authority of a Seller that is an entity), only the
Seller or Sellers to whom such Seller Warranty Breach relates will have any
indemnification liability under this Section 7.3.

  



  

7.4 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Buyer will defend, indemnify and
hold harmless the Sellers and their respective equity holders, directors,
officers, employees and agents (each a " ** _Seller Indemnitee_** ") from and
against any and all damages in connection with:

  



  

(a) any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty under Article 5;

  



  

(b) any default by Buyer in the performance or observance of any of its
covenants or agreements hereunder; or

  



  

(c) the operation of the business of the Company by the Buyer after the
Closing.

  



  

7.5 _Third Party Claims_. If any legal action is initiated against any Seller
Indemnitee or Buyer Indemnitee (each an " ** _Indemnitee_** ") by any third
party and such Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification from the Buyer or
Sellers (each an " ** _Indemnitor_** ") as applicable, under this Article 7
on account of its involvement in such legal action, then such Indemnitee will
give prompt notice to the applicable Indemnitor of such legal action;
_provided, however,_ that the failure to so notify such Indemnitor will not
relieve such Indemnitor of its obligations under this Article 7, but will
reduce such obligations by the amount of damages or increased costs and
expenses attributable to such failure to give notice. Upon receipt of such
notice, such Indemnitor will diligently defend against such legal action on
behalf of such Indemnitee at its own expense using counsel reasonably
acceptable to such Indemnitee; _provided, however_ , that if such Indemnitor
fails or refuses to conduct such defense, or such Indemnitee has been advised
by counsel that it may have defenses available to it which are different from
or in addition to those available to such Indemnitor, or that its interests
in such legal action are adverse to such Indemnitors interests, then such
Indemnitee may defend against such

  



  

24      
   



  

legal action at such Indemnitors expense. Such Indemnitor or Indemnitee, as
applicable, may participate in any legal action being defended against by the
other at its own expense, and will not settle any legal action without the
prior consent of the other, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld;
_provided, however,_ that the consent of an Indemnitor is not required if
such Indemnitor failed or refused to defend the Indemnitee in the legal
action that is being settled. Such Indemnitor and Indemnitee will cooperate
with each other in the conduct of any such legal action.

  



  

7.6 _Notice of Indemnification Claims_. No indemnification claim will be
deemed to have been asserted until the applicable Indemnitor has been given
notice by the Indemnitee of the amount of such claim and the facts on which
such claim is based.

  



  

7.7 _Indemnification Threshold_

  



  

Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no Indemnitor will have
any indemnification obligations under this Article 7 or otherwise unless
and until the claims asserted against such Indemnitor exceed One Hundred
Fifty Thousand United States Dollars (US$150,000) in the aggregate (the " **
_Threshold Amount_** "); thereafter, such Indemnitor will be liable for all
indemnification claims properly asserted against it, including those
comprising the Threshold Amount

  



  

7.8 _Indemnification Cap_.

  



  

(a) The indemnification obligations of each Seller under Article 7 will be
limited to the Escrow Amount attributable to such Seller as set forth on
**Exhibit A;** provided however, that (i) in the case of intentional
misrepresentation by such Seller, or (ii) Seller Warranty Breaches involving
Article 3 **,** the indemnification obligations of each Seller shall be
limited to the Closing Cash Payment actually received by such Seller as set
forth on **Exhibit A**.

  



  

(b) The indemnification obligations of each Management Shareholder under
Article 7 will be limited to the Escrow Amount attributable to such
Management Shareholder as set forth on **Exhibit A**; provided ****
however, that (i) in the case of intentional misrepresentation by any
Management Shareholder, or (ii) Management Warranty Breaches involving
Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 or 4.5, the indemnification obligations of each
Management Shareholder shall be limited to the Closing Cash Payment plus any
Earn-Out Consideration actually received by such Management Shareholder as
set forth on **Exhibit A**. In the event that Section 4.19 survives for a
period of more than 18 months pursuant to Section 7.1, any indemnification
obligations of the Management Shareholders under Article 7 for claims made
after eighteen (18) months after the Closing involving a breach of Section
4.19 will be limited to each such Management Shareholders pro rata share
(relative to the other Management Shareholders only) of the Escrow Amount.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and subject
to any limitations contained herein, (i) each Seller shall only be liable for
such Sellers Pro Rata Share of any indemnification obligations for Seller
Warranty Breaches

  



  

25      
   



  

under this Article 7 or otherwise (except for Seller Warranty Breaches which
relate to specific Seller or Sellers, for which such Seller shall be liable
for up to 100% of the amounts otherwise owed under 7.8(a)), and (ii) each
Management Shareholder will only be liable for his Pro Rata Share of any
indemnification obligations for intentional misrepresentations or Management
Warranty Breaches under this Article 7 or otherwise. As used in this
Agreement, for a Seller, " ** _Pro Rata Share_** " means the amount of the
Escrow reflected on **Exhibit A **for such Seller, and for a member of
Management with respect to such persons indemnification obligations outside
the escrow where those Sellers that are not also members of Management have
no liability, " ** _Pro Rata Share_** " means such member of Managements pro
rata share of the Initial Payments received by the Management only.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Seller has breached a representation or
warranty relating to the specific Seller, and thereby exhausted the
portion of the Escrow related to such Seller, and thereafter a breach of
a representation and warranty occurs for which all Sellers have
an indemnification obligation through the Escrow, then the " ** _Pro Rata
Share_** " of the Sellers will be recalculated based on the amount then still
held in escrow on behalf of each Seller and the total amount still held in
Escrow, such that the Buyer will be entitled to full indemnification from the
Escrow.

  



  

(d) Except for indemnification obligations for intentional misrepresentation
by any Seller, Seller Warranty Breaches involving Article 3 or as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, the total amount of the payments that
each Seller can be required to make under or in connection with this
Agreement shall be limited in the aggregate to the Escrow Amount attributable
to such Seller, and each Sellers cumulative liability shall in no event
exceed such amount.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but
subject to the exceptions set forth at the beginning of the prior sentence,
any indemnification payments required to be made by the Sellers hereunder
shall be made exclusively from the funds held by the Escrow Agent under the
Escrow Agreement, and Buyer shall have no recourse against any of the Sellers
or against any of the assets of any of the Sellers, in connection with any
indemnification claim or any other claim of any nature.

  



  

(e) The indemnification obligations of Buyer under Article 7 will be limited
to an amount equal to the Escrow Amount.

  



  

7.9 _Using of Escrow Amount_.

  



  

(a) In the event Management Shareholders or Sellers have any liability (for
indemnification or otherwise under this Agreement) to any Buyer Indemnitee
under this Article 7, Buyer Indemnitees shall first satisfy such liability by
permitting the Escrow Agent to transfer cash to Buyer or the Buyer
Indemnitees from the Escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement as follows:

  



  

(i) In case of a malicious intent (" _Arglist_ ") intentional tort (" _vors
atzliche Schadigung_") or fraud (" _Betrug_ ") or similar cases resulting in
a Indemnification claim pursuant to Section 7.8(a) such Sellers Pro
Rata Share deposited in the Escrow Account shall first be used to fulfill
such Sellers indemnification obligations. If under such indemnification
obligations such Pro Rata Share deposited in

  



  

26      
   



  

the Escrow is not sufficient, the further indemnification obligations shall
be asserted against such Seller _in personam._

  



  

(ii) In case of any Seller Warranty Breach involving Article 3, such Sellers
pro rata share deposited in the Escrow Account shall first be used to fulfill
such Sellers indemnification obligations. If under the relevant
indemnification obligations such Pro Rata Share deposited in the Escrow is
not sufficient, the further indemnification obligations shall be asserted
against such Seller _in personam, _ provided however, that such claim shall
be limited to an amount equal to the Closing Cash Payment received by the
relevant Seller as set forth above.

  



  

7.10 _Other Limitations on Indemnification Provisions_.

  



  

(a) Any payment made by an Indemnitor to an Indemnitee pursuant to this
Article 7 in respect of any claim (i) will be net of any insurance proceeds
payable to the Indemnitee in respect of such claim and (ii) will be reduced
by an amount equal to any tax benefits obtainable by the Indemnitee which are
attributable to such claim.

  



  

(b) Each person or entity entitled to indemnification hereunder will take all
reasonable steps to mitigate all losses, costs, expenses and damages after
becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise
to any losses, costs, expenses or damages that are indemnifiable or
recoverable hereunder.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the recovery
and indemnification rights of any party under this Article 7 will be limited
solely and exclusively to a claim for monetary damages ( _Schadensersatz in
Geld_ ), _provided, however_ , that such damages shall only cover actual
damages incurred by such party ( _unmittelbar entgangener Gewinn_ ) and
shall, in particular, not cover internal administration or overhead costs of
such party, special, incidental, consequential damages ( _Folgesch aden_),
loss of profits, punitive damages, loss of goodwill or reputational damage of
such party or other indirect damages or the loss of profits by such party.
Actual damages may allow for the argument that a reasonable Buyer would have
paid a reduced purchase price had such reasonable buyer known of the breach
of the representation and warranty.

  



  

7.11 _Exclusive Remedy_. To the extent permitted by law and subject to any
mandatory provisions such as sec. 123 or 276 para. 3 of the German
Civil Code, any further claims and remedies of the Buyer under or in
connection with this Agreement against the Sellers and/or their direct and
indirect shareholders and advisers other than those explicitly provided for
in Article 7 of this Agreement, irrespective of their nature, amount or
legal basis, are hereby expressly waived and excluded and in particular,
without limitation, claims under pre-contractual fault (sec. 311 para. 2 and
3 of the German Civil Code), breach of contract ( _Pflichtverletzung aus dem
Schuldverh altnis_) and/or the right to reduce the purchase price (
_Minderung_ ) or to rescind this Agreement ( _R ucktritt_), frustration of
the agreement ( _St orung der Geschaftsgrundlage_) and any liability in tort
( _Deliktshaftung_ ). Notwithstanding the aforesaid, any claims of the Buyer

  



  

27      
   



  

to specific performance and/or compliance with other obligations under this
Agreement shall remain unaffected.

  



  

7.12 _Tax Treatment_. Any indemnification payments under this Article 7 will
be treated, for Tax purposes, as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

  



  

7.13 _No Quality Guarantees_. The Parties are fully aware of the discussion
currently ongoing in German legal literature focusing on the question whether
Section 444 of the German Civil Code (as amended with effect from 1 January
2002) might render the common practice in business sale and purchase
agreements - where the seller gives certain guarantees to Buyer within
certain limitations - impossible by prohibiting any such limitations. In this
respect, the Parties, having given this issue due consideration and having
received legal advice from their respective legal advisors, make the
following statements:

  



  

It is the common opinion of the Parties that the provisions of Section 444 of
the German Civil Code (as amended) shall not and do not apply to independent
promises of guarantee as given by the Sellers in Article 3 above, given by
Management in Article 4 above and given by the Buyer in Article 5 above (as
opposed to quality guarantees concerning the object of the purchase (
_Beschaffenheitsgarantien_ ). Accordingly, the Parties wish to confirm to one
another that (i) the Guarantees set forth in Article 3, Article 4 and Article
5 above neither constitute, and shall not be qualified and construed as, any
quality guarantees concerning the object of the purchase (
_Beschaffenheitsgarantien_ ) within the meaning of Sections 443, 444 of the
German Civil Code (as amended) nor covenants concerning the object of the
purchase ( _Beschaffenheitsvereinbarungen_ ) within the meaning of Section
443 para. 1 sentence 1 of the German Civil Code (as amended), and (ii) the
provisions contained in Article 7 hereof do not contain any exclusions (
_Ausschl usse_) or limitations ( _Beschr ankungen_) within the meaning of
Section 444 of the German Civil Code (as amended) but form an integral part
of the Guarantees. The Parties hereby confirm and subscribe to such
understanding. For the avoidance of doubt, in the unlikely event that the
provisions of Article 3 and Article 4 above in connection with this Article 7
setting out the scope and limitations of the Sellers liability are, contrary
to the intention and explicit understanding of the parties regarded and
construed as quality guarantees concerning the object of the purchase, and
the limitations of the Sellers liability contained herein are therefore
found wholly or partially invalid, the Buyer hereby waives the right to
assert claims going beyond the limits of the limitations provided herein and
transfers the respective claims to the Sellers. The Sellers accept both the
waiver and the transfer.

  



  

7.14 _Disclosure Schedule_. For purposes of this Agreement, " ** _Disclosure
Schedule_** " means the schedule (dated as of the date of the Agreement)
delivered to Buyer on behalf of the Sellers and the Management. Each
disclosure made in the Disclosure Schedule must identify with specificity the
provisions of the Agreement to which such disclosure relates and shall not be
deemed to be disclosed with respect to all other representations and
warranties.  The contents of any documents identified in the
Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be incorporated into any
disclosure.

7.15 _Shareholders  Agent_.

  



  

(a) Michael Inhester is hereby irrevocably appointed by the Management
Shareholders as their agent for purposes of Section 1.4 and Article 7 and by
all Sellers other than 3i Group Investments LP, Earlybird Pre-Seed Bet. KG
Nr. 1 der Earlybird VC GmbH and Co. KG, Earlybird Pre-Seed GmbH and co. KG  Bet.
KC Nr. 2 and IKB Private Equity GmbH (the " ** _Investors_** ") as
their agent for purposes of Article 7 and Joachim Dietrich is hereby
irrevocably appointed by the Investors as their agent for purposes of Article
7 (Messrs. Inhester and Dietrich collectively, the " ** _Shareholders 
Agent_**"), and Mr. Inhester and Mr. Dietrich each hereby accepts his
appointment as the Shareholders Agent. Mr. Inhester is hereby authorized by
each of the Management Shareholders and Sellers other than the Investors and
Mr. Dietrich is hereby authorized by each of the Investors to enter into the
Escrow Agent on each of their behalf.  Mr. Inhester is authorized but not
obligated to act on behalf of the Management Shareholders by the approval of
those Management Shareholders who collectively were entitled to receive a
majority of the Closing Cash Payment to be received by all Management
Shareholders. Mr. Inhester is authorized but not obligated to act on behalf
of the Sellers other than the Investors by the approval of those Sellers
other than the Investors who collectively were entitled to receive a majority
of the Closing Cash Payment to be received by all the Sellers other than the
Investors. Mr. Dietrich is authorized but not obligated to act on behalf of
the Investors by the approval of those Investors who collectively were
entitled to receive a majority of the Closing Cash Payment to be received by
all the Investors. On all matters relating to Section 1.4 and Article 7,
Buyer shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the Shareholders Agent
representing the parties with an interest in the matter at issue, and shall
be entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind
whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of
any Seller by the appropriate Shareholders Agent, and on any other action
taken or purported to be taken on behalf of any Seller by the appropriate
Shareholders Agent, as fully binding upon such shareholder. If the
Shareholders Agent shall die, become disabled or otherwise be unable to
fulfill his responsibilities as agent of the Sellers, then the Sellers
represented by such Shareholders Agent shall, within ten (10) days after
such death or disability, appoint a successor agent and, promptly thereafter,
shall notify Buyer of the identity of such successor. Any such successor shall
become the " ** _Shareholders  Agent_**" for purposes of Section 1.4 and
Article 7. If for any reason there is no Shareholders Agent at any time, all
references herein to the Shareholders Agent shall be deemed to refer to the
Management Shareholders, with respect to Section 1.4, or the Sellers, with
respect to Article 7.

  



  

(b) The Shareholders Agent undertakes to perform such duties as are
specifically set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement only and
shall have no duty under any other agreement or document, and no implied
covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement against the Shareholders Agent. The Shareholders Agent shall incur
no liability with respect to any action taken by it or for any inaction on
its part in reliance upon any notice, direction, instruction, consent,
statement or other document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and
duly authorized, nor for any other action or inaction except for its own
negligence or willful misconduct. In no event shall the Shareholders Agent
be liable for incidental, punitive

  



  

29      
   



  

or consequential damages. The respective Sellers hereby agree jointly and
severally to indemnify the Shareholders Agent for, and hold the
Shareholders Agent harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred
without negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Shareholders
Agent, arising out of or in connection with the Shareholders Agent carrying
out its duties hereunder. This right of indemnification,
compensation, reimbursement and payment shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and the resignation or removal of the
Shareholders Agent.

  



  

(c) The reasonable fees and expenses incurred by Joachim Dietrich while
acting on behalf of the Investors under the authorization granted in this
Section 7.15 shall be borne by the Investors and shall not be payable out of
the Escrow Fund; the same shall apply mutates mutandis with regard to the
fees and expenses incurred by Dr. Michael Inhester.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 8**

  



  

 **GENERAL PROVISIONS**

  



  

8.1 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,

excluding any accounting fees) incurred in connection with the negotiation,
preparation or carrying out of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " ** _Seller Transaction Expenses_** ") shall be paid by
the Sellers through the payment by the Buyer pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof.

mailed by registered mail, return receipt requested; or (c) when received by
the addressee, if sent by an internationally recognized overnight delivery
service (receipt requested). All communications shall be sent to Buyer at the

may designate by notice to the other parties).

  



  

8.3 _Further Assurances_. The parties agree (a) to furnish upon request to
each other such further information, (b) to execute and deliver to each other
such other documents (provided that such documents do not and would not
create any liability or obligation of such party) and (c) to do such other
acts and things, all as the other party may reasonably request for the
purpose of carrying out the intent of this Agreement and

  



  

30      
   



  

the documents referred to in this Agreement. Parent agrees to cause Buyer, or
in the failure of Buyer, Parent itself, to perform all of its obligations
under Section 1.4 of this Agreement.

  



  

8.4 _Waiver_. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are
cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any party
in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such
right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such
right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such
right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege.  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (i) no claim
or right arising out of this Agreement or the documents referred to in
this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a
waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the
other party, (ii) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable
except in the specific instance for which it is given, and (iii) no notice to
or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of
such party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take
further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement.

  



  

8.5 _Entire Agreement and Modification_. This Agreement supersedes all
prior agreements between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and constitutes a complete and exclusive statement of the
terms of the agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof. This Agreement may not be amended except by a written
agreement executed by the party to be charged with the amendment.

  



  

8.6 _Assignments_ _, Successors, and No Third-Party Rights_.  Any party may
assign any of its rights under this Agreement in whole or in part without the
prior consent of any other party. No party can assign its obligations under
this Agreement to any person or entity, except with the prior written consent
of the other party.  Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
apply to, be binding in all respects upon and inure to the benefit of, the
successors and permitted assigns of the parties.  Nothing expressed or
referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any person or entity
other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy
or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this
Agreement. This Agreement and all of its provisions and conditions are for
the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their
successors and assigns.

  



  

8.7 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any such invalid,
ineffective or unenforceable provision shall, to the extend permitted by law,
be deemed replaced by such valid, effective and enforceable provision as
comes closest to the economic intent and purpose of such invalid, ineffective
or unenforceable provision. The same shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to any
gap in this Agreement.

  



  

31      
   



  

8.8 _Construction_ _; Section Headings_. The headings of Sections in this
Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its

be paid in United States Dollars. All references to Dollars shall be to United
States Dollars. All amounts listed herein in Euros shall be converted to
United States Dollars using the  bid range rates for trading among banks in
amounts of US$1,000,000 as of the date such Euro amounts are to be paid,

Claim Notice (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) shall apply.  Any fees
charged by Sellers banks or financial institutions with respect to amounts
transferred from Buyer shall be the responsibility of the Sellers.

  



  

8.9 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or
referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

  



  

8.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement is, and shall be deemed to be, a contract
entered into under and pursuant to the laws of Germany to the exclusion of
the rules of conflict of laws, and shall be in all respects governed,
construed, applied and enforced in accordance with the laws of Germany, as
applied to contracts to be performed entirely within such country.  No
defense given or allowed by the laws of any other country shall be interposed
in any action, case or proceeding hereon unless such defense is also given or
allowed by the laws of Germany.

  



  

8.11 _Language_. This Agreement is written in English language (except that
certain exhibits may be in German language). Terms to which a German
translation has been added shall be interpreted throughout this Agreement in
the meaning assigned to them by the German translation.

prior written consent of any other party. The parties are entitled to
disclose any information about this Agreement to any government agency or to
any other public authority to which they must disclose such information
pursuant to any applicable legal provision. In addition, the parties are
entitled to publicly disclose any such information, if they are required to
do so by law, The Nasdaq National Market, the London Stock Exchange or by any
other regulatory authority to which they are subject, it being understood
however, that any party must give prior notice of any such public disclosure
to the other party in due time and must give prior notice of any request to
make a disclosure to a third party.

  



  

32      
   



  

8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of
this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to
constitute one and the same agreement. Counterpart signature pages delivered
by facsimile or e-mail will be deemed to be valid and binding for all
purposes.

  



  

8.14 _Corporate_ _Governance Matters_. The Sellers have resolved on the
amendment of the Current Articles of Association of the Company in the form
attached as **Exhibit O** (the " ** _New Articles of Association_** "), inter
alia, in order to delete the right of certain of the Sellers to
appoint directly a members of the supervisory board (Entsendungsrecht)
pursuant to the Current Articles of Association. Each of the Sellers having
currently such right agrees to give any and all declarations necessary in
order to change the Current Articles of Association in a legally effective
manner. The supervisory board of the Company has resolved on new rules of
procedure for the management board of the Company with the wording set forth
in **Exhibit N**.  For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the
Company (including its supervisory board) is always free in its discretion to
agree on amendments and changes to the rules of procedure for the management
board. The parties agree that the New Articles of Association will be applied
for entry with the Commercial Register only after Closing without undue
delay. The Sellers agree to act in a manner as if the New Articles of
Association have been duly implemented as of Closing. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Buyer is free to change the New Articles of
Association and the corporate structure of the Company (including its legal
form) at any time after the Closing. The Buyer acknowledges that as of
Closing, new service agreements with members of the management board in the
form attached hereto as **Exhibit Q** have been approved and are currently in
place. As a precaution, the parties agree that, in case these new service
agreements have not been properly entered into, they will undertake all steps
and give all declarations necessary to properly implement such agreements so
that they have full legal effect. The same will apply with the implementation
of the rules of procedure with the form as set forth in **Exhibit N**.  The
Sellers covenant that the Shareholders Agreements I and II have
been terminated effective as of the Closing.  The Sellers who are parties to
the Shareholders Agreements I and II dated November 29, 1999 and December 5,
2001, respectively, and the Company have entered into a termination agreement
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit R (the " ** _Termination Agreement_**
"). As a precaution, the Sellers hereby irrevocably offer to the Company to
finalize and enter into the Termination Agreement. This offer shall be
binding on the Sellers and can be accepted by the Company within two (2)
months after the Closing. To the extent legally possible, the Buyer shall
cause the new Supervisory Board appointed after the Closing to take all steps
necessary and/or to give and/or receive any and all declarations necessary
for the execution of the Termination Agreement on behalf of the Company.
However, it is understood by the Sellers internally that irrespective of the
legal effectiveness of the approval by the Company of the Termination
Agreement, the Termination Agreement shall be binding between the Sellers.

  



  

8.15 _Supervisory Board_. The current members of the Supervisory Board have
submitted their resignation from the Supervisory Board effective as of the
Closing. Upon request of the Buyer, 3i Group Investments LP, Earlybird
Pre Seed

  



  

33      
   



  

Beteiligungskommanditgesellschaft Nr. 1, der Earlybird Venture Capital GmbH and
Co. KG, Earlybird Pre Seed Beteiligungskommanditgesellschaft Nr. 2 and IKB
Private Equity GmbH shall be jointly obligated to appoint a representative of
the Buyer as new member of the supervisory board for the time period until
the New Articles of Associations pursuant to Section 8.14 are legally
effective.
