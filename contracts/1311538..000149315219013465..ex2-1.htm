RECITALS

  



  

WHEREAS, Merger Sub shall commence a tender offer to purchase all of the
outstanding shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company
(the "Company Common Stock") (each a "Share" and collectively, the
"Shares") for $1.27 per Share (such amount or any greater amount per Share
paid pursuant to the Offer being hereinafter referred to as the "Offer
Price"), subject to any applicable withholding Taxes, net to the seller in
cash, without interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement (such cash tender offer, as it may be amended from time
to time as permitted by this Agreement, the "Offer");

  



  

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation
(the "Merger"), in accordance with the Florida Business Corporation Act, as
amended ("FBCA"), pursuant to which each issued and outstanding Share other
than ( _i_ ) Shares owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company and ( _ii_ ) the Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right
to receive an amount equal to the Offer Price, subject to any applicable
withholding Taxes, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and
Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, certain of the Company's shareholders (holding
approximately 37% of outstanding Shares in the aggregate) are entering into a
tender and support agreement with Parent and Merger Sub (the "Support
Agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, each such shareholder has
agreed to tender all Shares owned by such shareholder to Merger Sub in the
Offer;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has
unanimously ( _i_ ) determined that this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger,
taken together, are at a price and on terms that are fair to, advisable and in
the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and ( _ii_ ) adopted
resolutions approving and declaring advisable the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, including the Offer, the Top-Up Option and the
Merger, and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Transactions") and (
_iii_ ) determined to recommend that the shareholders of the Company tender
their Shares in response to the Offer, and, if required, approve this
Agreement (including the Articles of Merger) and the Merger, in each case
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have ( _i_
) determined that it is in the best interests of Parent and its sole
stockholder or Merger Sub and its sole shareholder (as the case may be), and
declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement and ( _ii_ ) approved the

the transactions contemplated hereby;

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Offer and the Merger; and

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties, intending to be
legally bound, agree as follows:

  



  

Article I

  

The Offer.

  



  

Section 1.01 The Offer.

  



  

(a) Commencement of the Offer. Unless this Agreement shall have previously
been terminated in accordance with Article VIII, and _provided_ that the
Company shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations
under Section 1.02, Merger Sub shall commence (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Exchange Act")) the Offer
to purchase all of the outstanding Shares at a price per Share equal to the
Offer Price as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof,
but no later than the fifteenth (15th) Business Day after the initial public
announcement of the execution of this Agreement (which initial
public announcement shall occur no later than the first (1st) Business Day
following execution and delivery of this Agreement).

  



  

(b) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. The obligation of Merger Sub to, and
of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment and pay for Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction (or
waiver by Parent and Merger Sub) of the conditions set forth in _Annex A_
hereto (the "Offer Conditions"). To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to waive any of the Offer
Conditions (other than the Minimum Condition), to increase the price per
Share payable in the Offer and to make any other changes in the terms of the
Offer; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no change may be made without the prior
written consent of the Company that ( _i_ ) other than in accordance with
Section 1.01(g), decreases the price per Share payable in the Offer, ( _ii_ )
changes the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer, ( _iii_ ) reduces
the maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, ( _iv_ )
imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, ( _v_ )
amends, modifies or waives the Minimum Condition, ( _vi_ ) modifies or amends
any of the Offer Conditions in any manner adverse to the holders of Shares or
( _vii_ ) except as provided in Section 1.01(c), extends the Initial Offer
Expiration Date.

(c) Expiration and Extensions of the Offer. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at midnight, New York time (i.e., one minute after 11:59
p.m., New York time), on the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the
commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act) of the Offer (calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
promulgated under the Exchange Act) (the "Initial Offer Expiration Date");
_provided_ that ( _i_ ) if at any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, any
Offer Condition is not then satisfied or, to the extent permitted by this
Agreement and applicable Law, waived, then Merger Sub shall extend the Offer
on one or more occasions for consecutive periods of at least two (2)
Business Days but no more than ten (10) Business Days, each as determined by
Parent in its sole discretion, or for such longer period(s) as Parent and the
Company may otherwise agree, up until the End Date in order to permit such
Offer Condition(s) to be satisfied and ( _ii_ ) if, less than five (5)
Business Days prior to any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer all of the
Offer Conditions have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by this
Agreement and applicable Law, waived, then Merger Sub shall have the right to
extend the Offer for a period of up to five (5) Business Days; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that such extension shall be subject to Merger Sub's right to
terminate the Offer and pursue the Merger in connection with a Conversion
Event in accordance with Section 1.01(e) and the parties' respective rights
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII. Notwithstanding any of
the foregoing contained in this Section 1.01(c), Merger Sub shall be required
to extend the Offer on one or more occasions for the minimum period required
by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or the staff thereof or
of the NYSE American applicable to the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such extension shall be subject to Merger Sub's right to terminate the
Offer and pursue the Merger in connection with a Conversion Event in
accordance with Section 1.01(e) and the parties' respective rights to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, and nothing contained
herein shall require Merger Sub to extend the period during which the Offer
remains open to any date after the End Date. The Initial Offer Expiration Date
as it may be extended is referred to as the "Offer Expiration Date."
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article I, if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VIII, then Merger Sub shall
promptly (and, in any event, within one (1) Business Day after such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer.

  



  

(d) Payment. Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the
satisfaction or permitted waiver of all the Offer Conditions, Merger Sub
shall accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days) after the Offer Expiration Date and in any event in compliance
with Rule 14d-10 and Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding
any of the foregoing contained in this Section 1.01(d), Merger Sub expressly
reserves the right to delay payment for all Shares in order to comply in whole
or in part with applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that such extension
shall be subject to Merger Sub's right to terminate the Offer and pursue the
Merger in connection with a Conversion Event in accordance with Section
1.01(e) and the parties' respective rights to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Article VIII. On or prior to the date that Merger Sub becomes
obligated to pay for Shares pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall provide or
cause to be provided to Merger Sub the funds necessary to pay for all Shares
that Merger Sub becomes so obligated to pay for pursuant to the Offer. The
Offer Price shall, subject to any applicable withholding Taxes, be paid net
to the seller in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer. The Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries will be tendered to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer. The
payment for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to and subject to the
conditions of the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer
Closing".

(e) Continuing Pursuit of the Merger.

  



  

(i) If the Company shall have made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
(other than with respect to an Intervening Event) pursuant to Section 6.04,
then Merger Sub may, at its sole option, irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer and concurrently therewith shall pursue the Merger as
contemplated in Section 6.05.

  



  

(ii) If at any then-scheduled Offer Expiration Date there shall exist a Top-
Up Impediment, then Merger Sub may, at its sole option, irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer and concurrently therewith shall pursue
the Merger as contemplated in Section 6.05. Each of the events in clauses (i)
and (ii) of this Section 1.01(e) that permit Merger Sub to irrevocably
and unconditionally terminate the Offer and concurrently therewith pursue the
Merger as contemplated in Section 6.05 are referred to in this Agreement as a
"Conversion Event".

  



  

(f) Termination of the Offer. The termination of the Offer pursuant to
Section 1.01(c) or Section 1.01(e) is referred to in this Agreement as the
"Offer Termination". If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub,
or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VIII, Merger Sub
shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of
Merger Sub to return, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof in
accordance with the terms of the Offer and applicable Law. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the Offer Termination shall not give rise to a
right of termination of this Agreement except to the extent expressly provided
for in Article VIII and that, absent any such termination of this Agreement,
the obligations of the parties hereunder other than those related to the
Offer shall continue to remain in effect, including those obligations with
respect to the Merger.

  



  

(g) Adjustments to Offer Price. The Offer Price shall be adjusted to the
extent appropriate to reflect the effect of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction with
respect to the Shares occurring or having a record date on or after the date
of this Agreement and prior to the payment by Merger Sub for the Shares;
_provided_ that this Section 1.01(g) shall not affect or supersede the
provisions of Section 6.01.

  



  

(h) Offer Documents. As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement
of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule
TO shall contain or incorporate by reference an offer to purchase and
forms of the related letter of transmittal, summary advertisement, notices to
brokers, dealers and clients, and all other ancillary Offer documents
(collectively, together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the "Offer Documents"). Parent and Merger Sub shall include in the Offer
Documents a copy of this Agreement to fulfill the requirements of Section
607.1104(3) of the FBCA. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent in
writing all information concerning the Company that may be required by
applicable federal securities Laws for inclusion in the Offer Documents.
Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Offer Documents ( _i_ ) to be promptly
disseminated to the holders of the Shares as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities Laws and ( _ii_ ) to comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable
rules and regulations of the NYSE American and all other applicable Laws.
Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that it shall be or shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the
Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of the Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities Laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents
before they are filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to
all additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its
counsel. In addition, Parent and Merger Sub agree to provide the Company and
its counsel with any comments, whether written or oral, that Parent or Merger
Sub or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such
comments, to consult with the Company and its counsel prior to responding to
any such comments and to provide Company and its counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to participate in ( _A_ ) the formulation of any response to any
such comments and ( _B_ ) any discussions with the SEC or its staff concerning
such comments. Parent shall provide the Company with copies of all such
written responses (or if oral responses, summaries thereof) submitted to
the SEC. Parent shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents.

Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 6.04, the Company shall, on
the date the Schedule TO is filed with the SEC, file with the SEC a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all
amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") which,
subject to Section 6.04, shall contain the Company Board Recommendation. The
Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to ( _i_ ) be promptly disseminated to
the holders of the Shares as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities Laws and ( _ii_ ) comply as to form in all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable rules and regulations of
the NYSE American and all other applicable Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly furnish to the Company in writing all information concerning Parent
and Merger Sub that may be required by applicable federal securities Laws for
inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company, on the one hand, and each of
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that it shall be or shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case,
as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. Parent
and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of Shares, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to all additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by
Parent and its counsel. In addition, the Company agrees to provide Parent and
its counsel with any comments, whether written or oral, that the Company or
its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments, to
consult with Parent and its counsel prior to responding to any such comments
and to provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to
participate in ( _A_ ) the formulation of any response to any such comments
and ( _B_ ) any discussions with the SEC or its staff concerning such
comments. The Company shall provide Parent with copies of all such written
responses (or if oral responses, summaries thereof) submitted to the SEC. The
Company shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9.

  



  

(b) Shareholder Lists. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause
its transfer agent to promptly (but in any event not later than three (3)

holders of Shares and with security position listings of Shares held in
stock depositories, each as of a recent date, together with all other

Section 1.03 Top-Up Option.

  



  

(a) Top-Up Option. Subject to Section 1.03(b) and Section 1.03(c), the
Company grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable and non-transferable option, for
so long as this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions
hereof (the "Top-Up Option"), to purchase from the Company such number of
authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Option
Shares") that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent and its
Subsidiaries at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one
(1) share of Company Common Stock more than 80% of the outstanding Shares on a
fully diluted basis after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares. Upon Merger Sub's written request, the Company shall, as soon as
practicable following receipt of such request (and in no event later than the
Offer Closing), cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to Merger Sub
the number of Shares outstanding as of immediately prior to the exercise of
the Top-Up Option and after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up
Option Shares.

  



  

(b) Exercise of Top-Up Option. Without the prior written consent of the
Company, the Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Sub, in whole and not
in part, only once, at any time following the Offer Closing until the tenth
(10th) Business Day thereafter;  _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable
to the extent: ( _i_ ) the number of Top-Up Option Shares issuable upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option would exceed the number of authorized but
unissued shares of Company Common Stock (giving effect to the Company Common
Stock issuable pursuant to all then-outstanding Company Stock Options, under
the Company ESPP and any other rights to acquire Company Common Stock as if
such shares were outstanding), ( _ii_ ) any provision of applicable Law or
any judgment, injunction, order or decree of any Governmental Entity shall
prohibit such exercise, or require any action, consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, action by, or filing with or notification to, any
Governmental Entity in connection with such exercise or the delivery of the
Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise, if such action, consent,
approval, authorization or permit, action, filing or notification has
not theretofore been obtained or made, or ( _iii_ ) the conditions set forth
in Section 7.01(d) are not satisfied as of the time of the issuance of the
Top-Up Option Shares. The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up
Option Shares being purchased by Merger Sub pursuant to the Top-Up Option
shall be determined by multiplying the number of such Top-Up Option
Shares then-subject to the Top-Up Option by the Offer Price. Such purchase
price shall be paid by Parent or Merger Sub, by paying in cash an amount
equal to the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option Shares and by executing
and delivering to the Company a promissory note (the "Promissory Note")
having a principal amount equal to the balance of such purchase price. The
Promissory Note ( _A_ ) shall be due on the first (1st) anniversary of the
Top-Up Closing, ( _B_ ) shall bear simple interest of 5% per annum, ( _C_ )
shall be full recourse to Parent and Merger Sub, ( _D_ ) may be prepaid, in
whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, and ( _E_ ) shall
have no other material terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub may
elect to pay (or cause to be paid) all or a portion of the aggregate purchase
price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares being purchased by Merger Sub in
cash.

(c) Top-Up Notice; Top-Up Option Closing. In the event Merger Sub elects,
subject to the provisions of this Section 1.03, to exercise the Top-Up
Option, Parent or Merger Sub shall deliver to the Company a written notice
(the "Top-Up Notice") setting forth ( _i_ ) its election to so exercise and
purchase the Top-Up Option Shares then-subject to the Top-Up Option, and (
_ii_ ) the place (if other than as set forth in Section 2.02) and time at
which the simultaneous exercise and purchase of such Top-Up Option Shares by
Merger Sub is to take place. The Top-Up Notice shall also include an
undertaking signed by Parent and Merger Sub that in addition to the
provisions of Section 1.03(b), it shall be a condition to the exercise of the
Top-Up Option that, immediately after such exercise of the Top-Up Option and
the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, as soon as reasonably practicable, consummate the Merger
in accordance with Section 607.1104 of the FBCA as contemplated by Section
6.05(c). At the simultaneous exercise and purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares (the "Top-Up Closing"), Parent or Merger Sub shall cause to be
delivered to the Company the consideration required to be delivered in
exchange for the Top-Up Option Shares and consummation of the Merger, and the
Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a certificate representing the
Top-Up Option Shares. Such certificate shall include any legends that are
required by federal or state securities Laws. The parties hereto agree to use
their reasonable best efforts to cause ( _A_ ) the exercise of the Top-Up
Option, ( _B_ ) the issuance and closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares on the date of the Top-Up Notice, and ( _C_ ) the consummation of the
Merger in accordance with Section 607.1104 of the FBCA as contemplated by
Section 6.05(c) to occur simultaneously.

  



  

(d) Exemption from Registration. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the
Top-Up Option Shares that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act"),
and will be issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration
under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and
warrants to the Company that Merger Sub will be, upon the purchase of the
Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of
Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up
Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-
Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

(e) Availability of Common Stock. From the date hereof until the Effective
Time, the Company shall cause to be reserved and kept available out of its
authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock, the number of shares
of Company Common Stock that will be sufficient to permit the exercise in
full of the Top-Up Option pursuant to this Section 1.03 in addition to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the
exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants or upon the conversion of
any outstanding securities issued by the Company.

  



  

(f) No Impact on Appraisal Rights. Any impact on the value of the Shares as a
result of the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares will not be taken into
account in any determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Section 607.1302 of the FBCA as contemplated by Section 3.06.

  



  

Section 1.04 Offer Documents; Schedule 14D-9; Proxy Statement. Without
limiting any other provision of this Agreement, whenever any party hereto
becomes aware of any event or change which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 or the
Company Proxy Statement, such party shall promptly inform the other parties
thereof and each of the parties shall cooperate in the preparation, filing
with the SEC and (as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities Laws) dissemination to the Company's shareholders of such
amendment or supplement.

Article III

  

Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock

  



  

Section 3.01 Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, as
a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company or the holder of any capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company:

  



  

(a) Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock. Each share, if any, of
Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or
any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries will
automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and no
consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(b) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (
_i_ ) shares to be cancelled and retired in accordance with Section 3.01(a)
and ( _ii_ ) Dissenting Shares (as defined below)), shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer
Price, without interest (the "Merger Consideration").

  



  

(c) Cancellation of Shares. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company
Common Stock (including any such shares underlying a Company Restricted Stock
Award as set forth in Section 3.10(b)) will no longer be outstanding and all
shares of Company Common Stock will be cancelled and retired and will cease
to exist, and, subject to Section 3.06, each holder of a certificate formerly
representing any such shares (each, a "Certificate") will cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 3.03 hereof.

  



  

(d) Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each Merger Sub Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one newly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Entity.

  



  

Section 3.02 Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint
(with the Company's prior approval) the Paying Agent to act as paying agent
for the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article III and
shall enter into an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
the Company with the Paying Agent. At the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in immediately available funds in
the aggregate amount required to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of
the Shares (such cash amount being referred to herein as the "Exchange Fund").
The Exchange Fund shall be used solely for purposes of paying the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Article III, and shall not be used to
satisfy any other obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of
the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger
Consideration.

Section 3.03 Exchange Procedures.

  



  

(a) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days thereafter), the Paying Agent shall mail or otherwise provide
to each former holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding Shares
(other than the holders of Shares cancelled pursuant to Section 3.01(a) and
Dissenting Shares) subsequently converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, as set forth in Section 3.01: ( _i_ ) a letter of
transmittal (a "Letter of Transmittal") that ( _A_ ) shall specify that
delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent
(or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof, together with any bond or indemnity
agreement, as contemplated by Section 3.09) and ( _B_ ) shall be in a
customary form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably agree prior to the Closing; and ( _ii_ ) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.01 (together with the
Letter of Transmittal, the "Transmittal Materials").

  



  

(b) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancelation to the Paying Agent,
together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and executed and any
other documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent pursuant to the
Transmittal Materials, in the case of certificated Shares, ( _i_ ) the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the
product obtained by multiplying ( _A_ ) the number of Shares represented by
such Certificates by ( _B_ ) the Merger Consideration, and ( _ii_ ) the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on the cash payable upon surrender of the Certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.03, each such Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or
a Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Article III. Each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose
shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration shall automatically upon the Effective Time ( _i_ ) be
entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and
deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, a
cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the product obtained by
multiplying ( _A_ ) the number of Book-Entry Shares of such holder by ( _B_ )
the Merger Consideration and ( _ii_ ) the Book-Entry Shares of such
holder shall immediately be canceled.

  



  

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company or if payment is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, the appropriate amount of the Merger Consideration may be paid to
a transferee if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the
Paying Agent properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and accompanied by all documents
reasonably required by the Paying Agent to evidence and effect such transfer
and to evidence that any applicable Taxes have been paid.

  



    

11

Section 3.04 No Further Ownership Rights. All Merger Consideration paid upon
the surrender for exchange of the Certificates representing Shares in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares and, after the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the transfer
books of the Surviving Entity of the Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article III.

  



  

Section 3.05 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) that
remains undistributed to the former shareholders of the Company on the date
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon
demand, and any former holder of Shares who has not theretofore received
any applicable Merger Consideration to which such Company Shareholder is
entitled under this Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent and the
Surviving Entity (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) for payment of claims with respect thereto.

  



  

Section 3.06 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, if required by the FBCA (but only to the extent required
thereby), any Shares (other than Shares cancelled pursuant to Section 3.01(a))
that are held by holders ( _a_ ) that are entitled to and properly demand and
exercise their dissenters' rights and who comply in all respects with the
provisions of Section 607.1301 to 607.1333 of the FBCA and ( _b_ ) who have
not effectively withdrawn such demand (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares")
shall not be converted into the right to receive, as of the Effective Time,
the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.01(b), unless and until such
Person shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost or failed to
perfect such Person's right to appraisal or payment under the FBCA, at which
time such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted into and
become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.01, without interest, and such
Shares shall not be deemed Dissenting Shares, and such holder thereof shall
cease to have any other rights with respect to such Shares. Each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by
the provisions of Sections 607.1301 through 607.1333 of the FBCA with respect
to such Dissenting Shares, unless and until such Person shall have effectively
withdrawn or otherwise lost or failed to perfect such Person's right to
appraisal or payment under the FBCA. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of receiving any demands for appraisal, withdrawals or attempted
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant
to applicable Law with respect to appraisal rights. Parent shall have the
right to direct and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any such demands, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands and any
other actions in respect of the shareholders of the Company's rights of
appraisal; _provided_ that prior to the Effective Time Parent shall
consult with the Company and consider in good faith the Company's advice with
respect to such negotiations and proceedings and the Company shall have the
right to participate in any such negotiations and proceedings. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, and prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall not, except with the prior written consent of the
Company, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer
to settle or compromise, or settle or compromise or otherwise negotiate, any
such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or otherwise to
comply with the provisions under Sections 607.1301 through 607.1333 of the
FBCA, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 3.07 Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur (other than the issuance or
redemption of shares of capital stock of the Company as permitted by this
Agreement), including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split (including reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or distribution paid in stock,
the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change.

  



  

Section 3.08 Withholding Rights. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub
and the Surviving Entity shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and applicable Treasury Regulations issued pursuant thereto (the "Code"), or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so deducted and withheld by the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Entity and paid to the applicable taxing authority, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Entity, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

  



  

Section 3.09 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by and at the discretion of Parent or the Surviving Entity,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent
or the Surviving Entity may direct, or the execution and delivery by such
Person of an indemnity agreement in such form as Parent or the Surviving
Entity may direct, in each case as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
appropriate amount of the Merger Consideration.

  



  

Section 3.10 Treatment of Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Compensation.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each option (or portion thereof) under the Company
2003 Stock Incentive Plan or the Company 2013 Incentive Compensation Plan
(together, the "Company Stock Plans") or otherwise to acquire shares of
Company Common Stock, other than a Company ESPP Right (each, a "Company Stock
Option") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
or not then vested or exercisable, shall be, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder
of that Company Stock Option or any other Person, fully vested and cancelled
and converted into only the right to receive from Parent and the Surviving
Entity, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of ( _i_ )
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by ( _ii_ )
the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share
exercise price of such Company Stock Option, less any Taxes required to be
withheld in accordance with Section 3.08 (such amounts payable hereunder, the
"Stock Option Payments"). The Surviving Entity shall cause each Stock Option
Payment to be paid as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time
(and not later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date on or after
the fifth Business Day after the Effective Time) through its payroll systems.
For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Stock Option which has a per share
exercise price that is greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration shall
be canceled at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment.

(b) At the Effective Time, each award for shares of Company Common Stock
under any Company Stock Plan or otherwise that is subject to service-based
restrictions or vesting conditions (each, a "Company Restricted Stock Award")
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of that Company Restricted Stock Award or
any other Person, fully vested and converted in accordance with Section
3.01(b) into only the right to receive from Parent and the Surviving Entity an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of ( _i_ ) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of such Company
Restricted Stock Award multiplied by ( _ii_ ) the Merger Consideration, less
any Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with Section 3.08 (such
amounts payable hereunder, the "Restricted Stock Award Payments"). The
Surviving Entity shall cause each Restricted Stock Award Payment to be paid,
as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (and not later
than the first regularly scheduled payroll date on or after the fifth
Business Day after the Effective Time) through its payroll systems.

  



  

(c) The Company shall take all requisite action to: ( _i_ ) cause any
offering period (or similar period during which shares of Company Common
Stock may be purchased) underway as of the date hereof under the Company 2017
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Company ESPP") to be the final offering
period under the Company ESPP, such that no new offering period will commence
under the Company ESPP after the date hereof and the current offering period
underway shall be terminated as soon as practicable, but no later than thirty
(30) days following the execution of this Agreement (the "Final Purchase
Date"); ( _ii_ ) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary and that
are permissible under the terms of the Company ESPP and applicable Law to
reflect the shortened offering period (or similar period), but otherwise treat
such shortened offering period (or similar period) as a fully effective and
completed offering period for all purposes under the Company ESPP; ( _iii_ )
cause each participant's purchase right under the Company ESPP (the "Company
ESPP Rights") to be exercised as of the Final Purchase Date; ( _iv_ ) ensure
no new participants enroll in the Company ESPP after the date hereof and
that no current participant in the Company ESPP can increase his or her
payroll deductions from those in effect on the date hereof; and ( _v_ )
terminate the Company ESPP as of the Final Purchase Date. On the Final
Purchase Date, the funds credited as of such date under the Company ESPP
within the associated accumulated payroll withholding account for each

(a) The bulk liquor and other raw materials inventory used or held for use
in the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries at a production facility
or a warehousing facility (the "Raw Materials Inventory") has the properties
necessary to permit it to be made in the ordinary course into Finished Goods
Inventory of a quality and type consistent with past practice, except for the
normal and customary allowances for spoilage, obsolescence, damage or
otherwise unsellable products ("Unsellable Inventory"). All of the
Finished Goods Inventory is of a quality usable and salable in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, except for Unsellable
Inventory. All of the Finished Goods Inventory has been packaged, produced and
labeled in accordance with applicable Laws, and the Company has provided to
Parent substantiation for all labeling and marketing claims made on or in
reference to the Finished Goods Inventory. No Finished Goods Inventory has
been labeled or marketed deceptively. All items included in the Raw Materials
Inventory and the Finished Goods Inventory are the property of the Company,
free and clear of any Lien other than Permitted Liens, and conform in all
material respects to all standards applicable to such inventory or its use or
sale imposed by Governmental Entities. Section 4.22(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of August 27, 2019, a list of all ( _x_
) bulk bourbon whiskey and rye whiskey used or held for use in the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and stored in barrels at a production
facility or a warehousing facility and (y) Finished Goods Inventory consisting
of finished case goods of bourbon whiskey and rye whiskey, including ( _i_ )
its name, ( _ii_ ) its source (where available), ( _iii_ ) its mash bill
(where available), ( _iv_ ) its vintage, ( _v_ ) its age, ( _vi_ ) its
quantity, ( _vii_ ) its cost per barrel or proof gallon, as applicable, and (
_viii_ ) the warehouse in which it is located.

  



  

(b) Since January 1, 2017, there have been no product recalls or
extraordinary product returns in connection with the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge of the Company, none are
threatened or pending. All products distributed or sold by the Company or its
employees or agents (the "Products" and each a "Product") and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, all of the Company's suppliers' products used in
the manufacture of the Products (the "Supplier Products" and each a
"Supplier Product"), have been sold in compliance in all material respects
with all applicable Laws (including Alcohol Laws or Orders). To the Knowledge
of the Company, each Product and each Supplier Product complies in all
material respects with all applicable product safety standards of each
applicable product safety agency, commission, board or other Governmental
Entity. To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company has no material
liability arising out of any injury to individuals or property as a result of
the sale of any Products.

  



  

(c) The quantity of the Raw Materials Inventory and Finished Goods Inventory
are, in each case, sufficient for the operation of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries after the Closing consistent with its operation during
the two (2) year period prior to the date of this Agreement. Since January
1, 2017, to the knowledge of the Company, without independent investigation,
the average annual evaporation loss of all bulk bourbon whiskey and rye
whiskey used or held for use in the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and stored in barrels at a production facility or a warehousing
facility is not expected to have exceeded three percent (3%) per annum.

Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby jointly and severally represents and

set forth below in this Article V:

  



  

Section 5.01 Organization. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of their
respective jurisdictions of organization. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has
the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now
conducted, except where the failure to have such power and authority,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially delay or have a material adverse effect on the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) in each
jurisdiction where the character of the assets and properties owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or
license necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or
to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to prevent, materially delay or have a material adverse effect on
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.02 Authority; Non-contravention; Governmental Consents.

power and authority to enter into and to perform its obligations under the

the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. The execution and
delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transaction Documents to which they
are a party, and the consummation by them of the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Documents to which they are a party, have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and
Merger Sub (including, in the case of the consummation of the Merger, the
adoption of this Agreement by the sole shareholder of Merger Sub) and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent and Merger Sub are necessary
to authorize the execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents to which
they are a party or to consummate the Offer, Top-Up Option, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming
due execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and Merger
Sub in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited
by the Enforceability Exceptions. The other Transaction Documents have been
duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming due
execution and delivery by the other parties thereto (including the Company),
constitute the valid and binding obligation of each of them,
enforceable against them in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions.

  



  

(b) Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and performance of the
Transaction Documents by each of Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by
each of Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents, do not and at the Closing will not: ( _i_ ) contravene
or conflict with, or result in any material violation or material breach of,
the Organizational Documents of Parent or Merger Sub; ( _ii_ ) subject to
compliance with the requirements set forth in clauses (i)-(v) of Section
5.02(c), conflict with or violate any Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub
or any of their respective properties, assets or rights; ( _iii_ ) result in
any material breach of or constitute a material default (or an event that with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a material default) under, or
require any Consent under, any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub are a
party or otherwise bound, or cause or permit termination, cancellation,
acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the loss of any
benefit under, any Contract or Permit of Parent or Merger Sub; or ( _iv_ )
result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any of the
properties, assets or rights of Parent or Merger Sub, except, in the case of
clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), for any conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults, failures to obtain Consent or creation of any Liens, in each case,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially delay or have a material adverse effect on the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents.

  



  

(c) Governmental Consents. No Consent of, or Filing with, any Governmental
Entity is required under applicable Law to be obtained or made by Parent or

NYSE American as may be required in connection with this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; ( _iii_
) such Filings and Consents as may be required under the HSR Act; ( _iv_ )
such Filings and Consents as may be required under applicable state
securities or "blue sky" laws and the securities Laws of any foreign
country or the rules and regulations of the NYSE American; and ( _v_ ) such
other Consents which if not obtained or made would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

Section 5.03 Legal Proceedings. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, Legal Action against
Parent or any of its respective Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, nor is
there any Order imposed upon Parent, or any of its respective Subsidiaries,
including Merger Sub, in each case, by or before any Governmental Entity, that
would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent,
materially delay or have a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent
or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents.

  



  

Section 5.04 Information Supplied. Neither the Offer Documents nor any
information supplied (or to be supplied) in writing by or on behalf of Parent
or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the

the Company, or on the Offer Expiration Date, as the case may be, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. The information supplied by Parent specifically for inclusion (or
incorporation by reference) in the Company Proxy Statement will not, on
the date it is first mailed to shareholders of the Company (or any amendments
or supplements thereto) and at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. The Offer Documents will comply as to form in all

Representatives.

and expenses of the Offer and the Merger.

of 1,000 shares of Merger Sub Shares, of which one hundred shares are validly
issued and outstanding. Each issued and outstanding Merger Sub Share is, and
at the Effective Time will be, owned directly or indirectly by Parent. Merger
Sub does not have any outstanding option, warrant, right, or other agreement
pursuant to which any Person other than the sole shareholder of Merger Sub
may acquire any equity security of Merger Sub. Merger Sub has been formed
solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Since its date of incorporation, Merger Sub has not, and prior to
the Effective Time will not have, carried on any business nor conducted any
operations other than the execution of the Transaction Documents to which it
is a party, the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and
matters ancillary thereto and has, and prior to the Effective Time will have,
no assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident
to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 5.07 Ownership of Company Common Stock. During the period three years
prior to the date hereof (other than by reason of the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby), neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries or

Company, as such term is defined in Section 607.0901 of the FBCA, or was
required to file a Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G with respect to its ownership
of securities of the Company pursuant to the Exchange Act. As of the date of
this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates beneficially owns (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act)
any shares of Company Common Stock or any securities that are convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock,
or holds any rights to acquire or vote any shares of Company Common Stock, or
any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, swap
agreement or other security, contract right or derivative position, whether or
not presently exercisable, that provides Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their
respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries with an exercise or conversion privilege
or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to the value of the
Company Common Stock or a value determined in whole or part with
reference to, or derived in whole or part from, the value of the Company
Common Stock, in any case without regard to whether ( _i_ ) such derivative
conveys any voting rights in such securities to such Person or such Person's
Affiliates, ( _ii_ ) such derivative is required to be, or capable of being,
settled through delivery of securities or ( _iii_ ) such Person or
such Person's Affiliates may have entered into other transactions that hedge

to Regulation 14D promulgated under the Exchange Act within ten (10) Business
Days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer (it being understood
and agreed that any communication made in accordance with Section 6.04(a), or
the failure by the Company Board to take a position with respect to such
tender offer or exchange offer, shall not be deemed a change to the Company
Board Recommendation if such communication is made or such position is taken
prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day after the commencement (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or
exchange offer, or ( _E_ ) adopt, approve or recommend to the shareholders
of the Company, or formally resolve to or publicly propose or announce its
intention to adopt, approve or recommend to the shareholders of the Company,
a Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i), a "Company
Adverse Recommendation Change") or ( _ii_ ) authorize or cause the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
at any time prior to the earlier of the Offer Closing or if the Offer
Termination has occurred, the Effective Time, the Company Board may,
in response to a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change of the type described in clause (A) of the
definition thereof and, solely in response to a Superior Proposal, terminate
this Agreement in order to enter into (or permit any Subsidiary to enter
into) a Company Acquisition Agreement if, ( _i_ ) the Company Board, prior to
effecting the Company Adverse Recommendation Change or delivering notice of
termination pursuant to Section 8.04(a), provides Merger Sub five (5)
Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action,
which notice shall include a description in reasonable detail of such
Superior Proposal (and any written proposals, draft agreements and all draft
or executed financing commitments and related documentation thereto) or
Intervening Event, ( _ii_ ) the Company is and remains in compliance with
this Section 6.04; ( _iii_ ) during the five (5) Business Days following such
written notice, the Company Board and, if requested by Merger Sub, and
Parent's Representatives have negotiated in good faith with Merger Sub
regarding any revisions to the terms and conditions of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger; and ( _iv_ ) at the end
of the five (5) Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (iii),
the Company Board concludes in good faith (taking into account any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement to which Parent and
Merger Sub have committed to in writing): ( _1_ ) after consultation with the
Company's outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Takeover
Proposal (if any) continues to constitute a Superior Proposal, if applicable,
and, after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, that the
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or the failure to
terminate this Agreement in order to enter into (or permit any Subsidiary of
the Company to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement, as applicable,
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or ( _2_
) after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, that the
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such
Intervening Event, as applicable, would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. Any material change to the terms, facts and
circumstances relating to the Superior Proposal or Intervening Event will be
deemed to be a new Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable, for
purposes of this Section 6.04; _provided_ that the time periods referred to
in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) shall be three (3) Business Days
instead of five (5) Business Days.

under the Exchange Act or ( _ii_ ) from making any "stop, look and listen"

under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any such communication
does not contain either an express Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
any other statements by or on behalf of the company or the Company Board that
would reasonably be expected to have the same effect as a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change.

promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its
staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements
to the Company Proxy Statement and shall promptly provide Parent with copies
of all correspondence between the Company and its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand. In the event that the
Company receives any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Company Proxy
Statement, Parent shall promptly provide to the Company, upon receipt of
notice from the Company, any information required for inclusion in the
response of the Company to such comments or such request and shall promptly
provide such other information or assistance in the preparation thereof as
may be reasonably requested by the Company. The Company agrees to reasonably
consult with Parent and its counsel prior to responding to any such comments
and to provide Parent with copies of all such written responses (or if oral
responses, summaries thereof).

(b) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Proxy
Clearance Date and in accordance with the Charter Documents and applicable
Law, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
a meeting of its shareholders (the "Company Shareholders Meeting") for the
purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote. The Company shall, through
the Company Board, declare that this Agreement is advisable and recommend to
its shareholders adoption of this Agreement and the Company will use
reasonable best efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of
the approval of this Agreement and the Merger; _provided_ that the
Company shall not have the foregoing obligation if there shall have been a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 6.04.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company
Shareholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Company Proxy Statement is provided to the
Company's shareholders or, if as of the time for which the Company
Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Company
Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct business at such meeting; _provided_ that no adjournment
may be to a date on or after two (2) Business Days prior to the End Date.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, following the Offer Closing and the
exercise, if any, of the Top-Up Option, Parent and its Affiliates shall own at
least 80% of the outstanding shares of each class and series of outstanding
capital stock of the Company, the parties shall take all necessary and
appropriate action, including with respect to the transfer to Merger Sub of
all Shares held by Parent or its Affiliates, to cause the Effective Time to
occur as soon as practicable after the Offer Closing without the Company
Shareholders Meeting in accordance with Section 607.1104 of the FBCA.

  



  

Section 6.06 Notices of Certain Events. The Company shall notify Merger Sub,
and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall notify the Company, promptly of ( _i_
) any material notice or other material communication from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, ( _ii_ ) any material notice or
other material communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, ( _iii_ ) any Legal Actions
commenced, or to such party's knowledge, threatened, against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
that are related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
("Transaction Litigation"), ( _iv_ ) any fact, event or circumstance that has
had or would reasonably be expected to result in any Company Material Adverse
Effect and ( _v_ ) the occurrence of any event, change or effect following the
date of this Agreement which has resulted or is reasonably likely to result
in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.02(a), Section
7.02(b) or Annex A of this Agreement (in the case of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) or Section 7.03(a) or Section 7.03(b) of this Agreement (in the
case of Parent and Merger Sub). In no event shall the delivery of any
notice by a party pursuant to this Section 6.06 limit or otherwise affect the
respective rights, obligations, representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement. Without limiting the preceding sentence, the Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any Transaction Litigation and
shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement,
or entry into any other agreement with respect to such Transaction
Litigation, including the opportunity to review and comment on all Filings or
responses to be made by the Company in connection with any Transaction
Litigation, and the Company shall consider any such comments in good faith.
The Company agrees that, without Parent's prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, the
Company shall not offer to make or make any payment with respect to any
Transaction Litigation or enter into any settlement or similar agreement
relating to any Transaction Litigation.

Section 6.07 Employees; Benefit Plans.

  



  

(a) For the period commencing as of immediately following the Effective Time
and continuing through the end of Parent's fiscal year in which the Effective
Time occurs, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity and each of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to provide the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries who remain employed by the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries
immediately after the Effective Time (collectively, the "Company Continuing
Employees") with ( _x_ ) annual base salary or wage level no less favorable
than that provided immediately prior to the Effective Time and ( _y_ )
employee benefits (excluding any equity-based, non-recurring or transaction-
related compensation, or any retiree healthcare or defined benefit retirement
benefits) that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than, as determined
in Parent's sole discretion, either those provided to ( _i_ ) similarly
situated employees of Parent (or the entity by which the Company Continuing
Employee is employed, as applicable) or ( _ii_ ) the Company Continuing
Employees by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

  



  

(b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, excluding any ( _i_
) retiree healthcare plans, ( _ii_ ) defined benefit retirement plans or
programs, ( _iii_ ) frozen or grandfathered programs and ( _iv_ ) equity
compensation arrangements, in each case, maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, "Parent Benefit Plans") in which any Company
Continuing Employees will participate on or after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to use commercially reasonable
efforts to, credit all service of the Company Continuing Employees with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be as if such service were
with Parent for all purposes in such Parent Benefit Plans; _provided_ that
such service shall not be credited to the extent that: ( _i_ ) such crediting
would result in a duplication of benefits; or ( _ii_ ) such service was not
credited for the same purposes under the corresponding Company Employee Plan.

  



  

(c) Unless otherwise requested in writing by Parent at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Offer Closing, the Company will take (or cause to
be taken) all reasonably necessary or appropriate actions to withdraw as a
participating employer in any Company Employee Plan intended to meet the
requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code (each such Company Employee Plan,
a "Company 401(k) Plan"), with such withdrawal contingent upon, and effective
as of, no later than the Business Day preceding the Business Day on which the
Offer Closing occurs, in compliance with the terms of such Company 401(k)
Plan, any related agreements and applicable Laws. The Company will
provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the
form and substance of materials prepared to withdraw as a participating
employer in such Company 401(k) Plan, and will provide Parent with evidence
that the Company has withdrawn as a participating employer in the Company
401(k) Plan in accordance with the preceding sentence. In the event that an
Offer Termination occurs (other than as a result of a termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms) the term "Offer Closing" shall be
deemed replaced by the term "Effective Time" in this Section 6.07(c).

(d) This Section 6.07 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.07,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.07. Nothing
contained herein, express or implied shall ( _i_ ) be construed to establish,
amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, ( _ii_ )
alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Entity, Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any compensation or
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them or ( _iii_ ) shall prevent
the Surviving Entity, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, as
applicable, from terminating the employment of any Company Continuing Employee
following the Effective Time. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the terms set forth in this Section 6.07 shall not create any right in any
Company Employee or any other Person to any continued employment with the
Surviving Entity, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever, or otherwise alters
any existing at-will employment relationship between any Company Employee and
the Surviving Entity or Parent.

  



  

(e) The Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent regarding material
written communications related to the transactions contemplated hereby that
are intended for broad-based and general distribution to any current or
former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and shall provide
Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such
communications prior to dissemination.

  



  

Section 6.08 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

  



  

(a) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (and rights for advancement of expenses) now existing in
favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in their respective
Organizational Documents and any indemnification or other agreements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement (an
"Indemnification Agreement") shall be assumed by the Surviving Entity in the
Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, and any claim
made pursuant to such rights within such six (6) year period shall continue to
be subject to this Section 6.08(a) and the rights provided under this Section
6.08(a) until disposition of such claim. Further, the provisions in the
Surviving Entity's Organizational Documents with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and
officers shall be no less favorable to such directors and officers than
such provisions contained in the Company's Organizational Documents in effect
as of the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
individuals.

  



    

53

--- 

    



  

(b) Parent shall maintain, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to maintain,
at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for at least six (6) years from
the Effective Time the current policies of the directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company (provided that Parent or the Surviving Entity may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which
are not less advantageous to any beneficiary thereof) with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and from insurance
carriers having at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with respect
to directors' and officers' liability insurance. Section 6.08(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter lists the current policies of the directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company. At the Company's option, the Company may purchase from insurance
carriers with comparable credit ratings, prior to the Effective Time, a six-
year prepaid "tail policy" providing at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured
than the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or
before the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated hereby, and
from insurance carriers having at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with
respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance. In the event the
Company elects to purchase such a "tail policy", the Surviving Entity shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to) maintain such "tail policy"
in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations
thereunder. Parent agrees to honor and perform under, and to cause the
Surviving Entity to honor and perform under, all indemnification agreements
entered into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries with any Indemnified
Party.

  



  

(c) This Section 6.08 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is
intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving Entity and each Indemnified
Party, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity
and Parent, and shall be enforceable by each of the Indemnified Parties and
their heirs and Representatives. The provisions of this Section 6.08 are
intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, his or her heirs, and his or her representatives and are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

  



  

(d) In the event that the Surviving Entity or its successors or assigns (
_i_ ) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or ( _ii_ ) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Entity shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.08. In
addition, the Surviving Entity shall not distribute, sell, transfer or
otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to render the Surviving Entity unable to satisfy its obligations
under this Section 6.08.

  



    

54

--- 

    



  

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.08 shall be
in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
Organizational Documents of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries, or
under any Indemnification Agreements. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors' and officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has
been in existence with respect to the Company or its officers, directors and
employees, it being understood that the indemnification provided for in this
Section 6.08 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims
under any such policies.

  



  

Section 6.09 Reasonable Best Efforts.

  



  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to fulfill all conditions applicable to such
party pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate and make effective, in an
expeditious manner, the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, including ( _i_ )
obtaining all necessary, proper or advisable actions or non-actions, waivers,
consents, qualifications and approvals from Governmental Entities and making

exemption from any Governmental Entity (including, without limitation under
the HSR Act and other Antitrust Law(s) (if applicable)), ( _ii_ ) obtaining
all necessary, proper or advisable consents, qualifications, approvals,
waivers or exemptions from non-governmental third parties, ( _iii_ ) making

NYSE American and any other applicable Law and ( _iv_ ) executing and
delivering any additional documents or instruments necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry
out the purposes of, the Transaction Documents. Subject to applicable Law, the
parties hereto shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with
the making of all such filings and notifications, including by providing
copies of all relevant documents to the non-filing party and its advisors
before filing.

  



  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, ( _i_ ) to the extent applicable, each
of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the
HSR Act and any additional consents and filings under any other Antitrust Law
as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement ( _provided_
that in the case of the filing under the HSR Act, such filing shall be made
within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement) and thereafter to
respond as promptly as practicable to any request for additional information
or documentary material that may be made under the HSR Act or any
other applicable Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Documents and any other required or advisable submissions
under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Law, in each case with respect
to the Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents, and to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or other
applicable Antitrust Law as soon as practicable and ( _ii_ ) Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall cooperate with one another in promptly ( _A_ )
determining whether any filings are required to be or should be made or
consents, approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be or should
be obtained under any other federal, state or foreign Law or regulation or
whether any consents, approvals or waivers are required to be or should be
obtained from other parties to loan agreements or other contracts or
instruments material to the Company's business in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and
( _B_ ) making any such filings, furnishing information required in
connection therewith and seeking to obtain timely any such consents,
permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers.

(c) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or
private party challenging the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by the Transaction Documents, or any other
agreement contemplated hereby, ( _i_ ) each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use its
respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and
( _ii_ ) Parent and Merger Sub must defend, at their cost and expense, any
action or actions, whether judicial or administrative, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and take all reasonably necessary
steps to eliminate any impediments, including, but not limited to, such
administrative or judicial action or proceeding under the HSR Act (if
applicable) or any other applicable Antitrust Law, to the ability of the
parties to consummate the Merger and transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ that Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to take or agree
to take an action that would reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not
be required to agree to any term or take any action in connection with its
obligations under this Section 6.09(c) that is not conditioned upon
consummation of the Merger.

  



  

(d) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (
_i_ ) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing
or submission with a Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and
in connection with any investigation, litigation or other inquiry by or
before a Governmental Entity relating to the Offer, the Merger,
the Transaction Documents or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any proceeding initiated by a private Person, ( _ii_ )

promptly informing the other parties hereto of any material communication,
whether written or oral, received by such party from, or given by such party
to, the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the Department of Justice (the
"DOJ") or any other Governmental Entity and of any material communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private Person,
whether written or oral, in each case regarding any of the Transactions, (
_iii_ ) subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, and to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with the other
parties hereto with respect to any communication or documents to be submitted
by it to the FTC, the DOJ, or any foreign Governmental Entity, including
permitting the other party to review in draft any communication to be
submitted by it to, give reasonable consideration to the other party's
comments thereon, and consult with each other in advance of any in-person or
telephonic meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any
foreign Governmental Entity, in connection with the Transactions, ( _iv_ )
unless prohibited by the applicable Governmental Entity or other Person, give
the other parties hereto the opportunity to attend and participate in all
meetings, discussions, and conferences, whether in-person or telephonic, with
such Governmental Entity or other Person; and ( _v_ ) promptly provide the
other parties with copies of all written communications or submissions to or

this Section 6.09 as "Outside Counsel Only" or redact such materials ( _A_
) to remove references concerning the valuation of any of the assets subject
to the Transactions, ( _B_ ) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, and ( _C_ ) as necessary to address reasonable privilege
concerns, and further provided, that this subsection (v) shall not apply to
the Notification and Report forms (and attachments) filed by the parties
pursuant to the HSR Act, except for Item "4(c)" and "4(d)" documents as those
terms are used in the rules and regulations under the HSR Act.

of their respective Subsidiaries to commit to or agree) with any Governmental
Entity to stay, toll, or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR
Act or other applicable Antitrust Law, without the prior written consent
of the other. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any of their Affiliates shall
acquire or agree to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with,
or by purchasing a portion of the assets of or equity in any business or any
corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or
division thereof, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to,
or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents or materially increase
the risk of any Governmental Entity seeking or entering an order prohibiting
the consummation of the Transactions.

  



  

Section 6.10 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a release
mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent. Thereafter, each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub agrees that no public release or announcement
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party
without the prior written consent of the Company and Merger Sub (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as
such release or announcement may be permitted by Section 6.04 or required by
applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States
securities exchange or Governmental Entity to which the relevant party is
subject. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this
Section 6.10 shall not apply to any release or announcement made or
proposed to be made in connection with and related to a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or as contemplated by Section 6.04.

  



  

Section 6.11 Takeover Statutes. If any "business combination," "control share
acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover Law
(collectively, "Takeover Laws") becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then each of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective board of directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such Law inapplicable to
the foregoing.

reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or

delisting of the Company and of the shares of the Company Common Stock from

that are treated as dispositions under such rule and result from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each director or officer of
the Company who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company. In the event that an Offer

(comprised solely of "independent directors") in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
and satisfy the requirements of the nonexclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule
14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act. In the event that an Offer Termination occurs
(other than as a result of a termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms) the term "Offer Closing" shall be deemed replaced by the term
"Effective Time" in this Section 6.14.

the Offer Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent copies of payoff
letters in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent specifying the
aggregate amount (collectively, the "Payoff Amount") required to be paid to
fully satisfy all obligations under the Existing Credit Facilities as of the
Closing (including principal, interest, fees, breakage costs, expenses and
other amounts payable under the Existing Credit Facilities, but excluding
contingent indemnification and other obligations that expressly survive the
termination of the Existing Credit Facilities), together with the obligations
of the Company set forth on Section 6.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter
(the "Company Payoff Obligations") and providing, subject only to the payment
of the Payoff Amount, for the payoff, satisfaction, discharge and termination
in full of all such obligations and commitments under the Company

Section 8.06 shall accrue interest at the prime lending rate prevailing

paid until (but excluding) the date of actual payment, and on the basis of a
360-day year.

  



  

Section 8.07 Amendment. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived at any time prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by
each of the parties hereto or, in the case of a waiver, by each party against
whom such waiver is to be effective; _provided_ , _however_ , that following
the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, there shall be no amendment to or
waiver of the provisions of this Agreement which by Law or in accordance with
the rules and regulations of the NYSE American would require further approval
by the holders of Company Common Stock without such approval. No failure or
delay by any party hereto in exercising any right under this Agreement shall
operate as a waiver of such right nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or future exercise of any other right under this
Agreement.

Section 9.08 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Exhibits to this
Agreement), the Company Disclosure Letter, the Confidentiality Agreement
(other than standstill provisions thereof, which shall terminate upon the
execution of this Agreement) and the other Transaction Documents constitute
the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties to this Agreement with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency
between the statements in the body of this Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Company Disclosure Letter (other than an exception expressly
set forth as such in the Company Disclosure Letter), the statements in the
body of this Agreement will control.

  



  

Section 9.09 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for the right of ( _i_ )
the Indemnified Parties to enforce the provisions of Section 6.08 and this
Section 9.09, which are intended to be for the benefit of the Indemnified
Parties, ( _ii_ ) after the Offer Closing, each shareholder of the Company
validly tendering and not properly withdrawing their Shares before the Offer
Closing, with respect to the right to receive the Offer Price, ( _iii_ ) after
the Effective Time, each remaining shareholder of the Company (other than
holders of Shares cancelled pursuant to Section 3.01(a) and Dissenting Shares)
with respect to the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and each of whom shall have
the right to enforce such provisions directly and ( _iv_ ) prior to the
Effective Time, the rights of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
to pursue claims for damages and other relief, including equitable relief, for
Parent's or Merger Sub's breach of this Agreement; _provided_ that the rights
granted to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
foregoing clause (iv) of this Section 9.09 shall only be enforceable on behalf
of such holders by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion, this
Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their
permitted assigns and respective successors and nothing herein, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person or entity any
legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement.

Section 9.10 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of
this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision
in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  



  

Section 9.11 Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated
by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of ( _x_ ) the
Company (in the case of an assignment by either Parent or Merger Sub) or (
_y_ ) Merger Sub (in the case of an assignment by the Company). No
assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the first sentence of this Section 9.11, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment
not permitted under this Section 9.11 shall be null and void.

  



  

Section 9.12 Remedies. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement will be
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this
Agreement, at Law or in equity. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the exercise by a party to this Agreement of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy.

  



  

Section 9.13 Specific Performance. The parties' rights in this Section 9.13
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each party hereby waives any objections to any remedy referred to in this
Section 9.13. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed, or
were threatened to be not performed, in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached, and that money damages would not be an adequate
remedy, even if available. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any
other remedy that may be available to it, including monetary damages, each of
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and effect the
Closing exclusively in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware, or in the event
(but only in the event) that such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, in any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware. In the event any party seeks any remedy referred
to in this Section 9.13, such party shall not be required to prove damages or
obtain, furnish, provide or post any bond or similar instrument in connection
with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section
9.13 and each party waives any objection to the imposition of such relief
(including that the other party has an adequate remedy at law) or any right
it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing, providing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument.

Section 9.14 Disclosure Letter. No reference to or disclosure of any item or
other matter in the Company Disclosure Letter shall be construed as an
admission or indication that such item or other matter is material (nor shall
it establish a standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever) or that
such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Letter. The information set forth in the Company
Disclosure Letter is disclosed solely for the purposes of this Agreement,
and no information set forth therein shall be deemed to be an admission by
any party hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever, including any
violation of Law or breach of any Contract. The Company Disclosure Letter and
the information and disclosures contained therein are intended only to
qualify and limit the representations, warranties and covenants of the Company
or Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, contained in this Agreement. Nothing
in the Company Disclosure Letter is intended to broaden the scope of or
constitute any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or
create or constitute any covenant. Matters reflected in the Company
Disclosure Letter are not necessarily limited to matters required by the
Agreement to be reflected in the Company Disclosure Letter. Such additional
matters are set forth for informational purposes and do not necessarily
include other matters of a similar nature.

  



  

Section 9.15 Reliance on Counsel and Other Advisors. Each party has consulted
such legal, financial, technical or other expert as it deems necessary or
desirable before entering into this Agreement. Each party represents and
warrants that it has read, knows, understands and agrees with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.16 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be
an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when each party to this
Agreement shall have received counterparts hereof signed by all of the other
parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission,
by electronic mail in "portable document format" (" _.pdf_ ") form, or by any
other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial
appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of
the paper document bearing the original signature.

 _Annex A_

  



  

The capitalized terms used in this Annex A have the meanings set forth in the
Agreement to which this Annex A is attached, except that the phrase "the
Agreement" shall be deemed to refer to the Agreement to which this Annex A is
attached.

  



  

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, Merger Sub shall not be
required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules
and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act
(relating to Merger Sub's obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares
promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for, and may delay
the acceptance for payment of or, subject to the restriction referred to
above, the payment for, any tendered Shares, and (subject to the provisions of
the Agreement) may terminate the Offer and not accept for payment any
tendered Shares if ( _i_ ) there shall not have been validly tendered (other
than Shares tendered by guaranteed delivery where actual delivery has not
occurred) and not validly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer that
number of Shares which, when added to the Shares owned by Parent and its
Affiliates, would represent more than 50% of the Shares then outstanding
determined on a fully-diluted basis (the "Minimum Condition"), ( _ii_ ) any
waiting period applicable to the Offer or the Merger under the HSR Act shall
not have expired or been terminated prior to the expiration of the Offer or (
_iii_ ) at any time on or after the date of the Agreement and prior to the
expiration of the Offer, any of the following conditions shall exist and be
continuing as of the expiration of the Offer:

  



  

(a) Any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over any party hereto shall
have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Restraint of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement;

  



  

(b) Any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in (
_i_ ) Article IV of the Agreement (except for the representations and
warranties in Section 4.02, Section 4.03(a), Section 4.03(d), Section
4.06(i), Section 4.12 and Section 4.13 of the Agreement) shall not be true
and correct in all respects (without giving effect to any Materiality
Qualifier) when made and as of immediately prior to the Offer Closing, as if
made at and as of such time (or, if given as of a specific date, at and as
of such date), except where the failure of such representations and
warranties to be so true and correct would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect and
( _ii_ ) ( _x_ ) Section 4.03(a), Section 4.03(d), Section 4.12 and Section
4.13 shall not be true and correct in all material respects (without giving
effect to any Materiality Qualifier) or (y) Section 4.02 and Section 4.06(i)
shall not be true and correct in all but _de minimis_ respects (without
giving effect to any Materiality Qualifier);

  



  

(c) The Company shall not have performed in all material respects all
obligations or not complied in all material respects with the agreements and
covenants required under the Agreement to be performed or complied with at or
prior to the expiration of the Offer by it;

  



  

(d) Since the date of the Agreement, there has been any Company Material
Adverse Effect or occurrence, fact, condition, change or effect that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect;

  



    

A-1

(e) There shall have been a Company Adverse Recommendation Change;

  



  

(f) In the event that the exercise of the Top-Up Option is necessary to
ensure that Parent or Merger Sub owns at least eighty percent (80%) of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on a fully diluted basis
immediately after the Offer Closing, ( _i_ ) there shall exist under
applicable Law any restriction or legal impediment on Merger Sub's ability
and right to exercise the Top-Up Option or ( _ii_ ) the shares of Company
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option together with the
shares validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn are
insufficient for Merger Sub to reach at least eighty percent (80%) of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock on a fully diluted immediately after the
Offer Closing (after giving effect to such exercise) (each of clause (i) and
(ii), a "Top-Up Impediment");

  



  

(g) The Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms or
the Offer shall have been terminated in accordance with the terms of the
Agreement; or

  



  

(h) The Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a certificate signed
on behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer of the Company, dated
as of the Offer Closing, certifying that none of the conditions in paragraphs
(b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this Annex A shall have occurred and be
continuing. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a
limitation of, the rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate or
modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.

  



  

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and applicable Law,
may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub, in whole or in part, at any time and
from time to time (other than the Minimum Condition). The failure by Parent
or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

  



  

If the Offer is terminated, all tendered Shares not theretofore accepted for
payment shall forthwith be returned to the tendering shareholders.
