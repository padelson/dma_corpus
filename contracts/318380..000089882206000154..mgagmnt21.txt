anything in this Agreement otherwise to the contrary, the Company shall
cooperate with and agree to any reasonable changes requested by Parent
regarding the structure of the transactions contemplated herein (such
cooperation shall include entering into appropriate amendments to this
Agreement); provided that any such changes do not have an adverse effect on
either the holders of the Company Common Stock or the holders of the Company

Preferred Stock owned or held by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of
their respective direct or    -13-   indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries,
all of which shall be canceled as provided in Section 3.1(a)), shall be
converted into the right to receive one fully paid and nonassessable share of
Parent 8.7% cumulative redeemable preferred stock (the "PARENT 8.7% PREFERRED
STOCK"). Subject to Section 3.7, each share of Series D Preferred Stock if
any, which is issued and outstanding and has not been redeemed immediately
prior to the Effective Time in accordance with its terms (other than shares
of Series D Preferred Stock owned or held by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company

into the right to receive one fully paid and nonassessable share of Parent
8.75% cumulative redeemable preferred stock (the "PARENT 8.75% PREFERRED
STOCK" and together with the Parent 8.7% Preferred Stock, the "PARENT
PREFERRED STOCK"). Immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless all shares
of Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock have been redeemed
prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the respective terms thereof,
the articles of incorporation or other equivalent organizational documents of
Parent shall be modified in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements in
order to create the Parent 8.7% Preferred Stock and the Parent 8.75%
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, having preferences, conversion and other
rights, privileges, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as
to distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption
hereof identical to that of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock and the

distribution and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and
shall be pari passu with all issued and outstanding preferred stock of Parent

Company Common Stock and each share of Company Preferred Stock (to the extent
not previously redeemed in accordance with its terms) shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be retired and shall cease to be
outstanding, and each holder of a certificate representing any such share(s)
(a "CERTIFICATE") shall cease to have any rights with respect to Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock (as the case may be), except (i) the
right to receive the Merger Consideration or Parent Preferred Stock, as the
case may be, (ii) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to be paid in consideration for shares of Company Common Stock, and
(iii) any dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled,
all in accordance with Section 3.2 upon the surrender of
such Certificate.   (e) At the Effective Time, each limited liability
company interest of Merger Sub shall remain outstanding and represent a
limited liability company interest of the Surviving Company.   SECTION 3.2.
EXCHANGE OF SHARE CERTIFICATES.   (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall designate a bank, trust company or other Third Party
entity reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "EXCHANGE
AGENT") for (i) the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the
Merger Consideration to which such holders shall become entitled with respect
to such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(b)
and (ii) the holders of shares of Company Preferred Stock to receive the
shares of Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable, to which such holders shall
become entitled with respect to such holder\'s shares of Company Preferred
Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(c); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if all shares
of    -14-   Company Preferred Stock are redeemed prior to the Effective
Time in accordance with the terms thereof, this Section 3.2 shall be
inapplicable to the Company Preferred Stock. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to deposit with the Exchange Agent: (x) that
number of Parent Common Stock certificates in any denominations as the
Exchange Agent shall specify, (y) that number of Parent Preferred Stock
certificates in any denominations as the Exchange Agent shall specify and (z)
the cash in respect of fractional shares, if any, in each case as are
issuable or payable pursuant to this Article III in respect of shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock for which Certificates or
Book Entry Shares have been properly delivered to the Exchange Agent. The
deposit made by Merger Sub or the Surviving Company, as the case may be,
pursuant to this Section 3.2(a) is hereinafter referred to as the
"EXCHANGE FUND." The Exchange Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be held
for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock to be applied promptly to making the payments provided for in Section
3.2(b); provided that any interest earned on any cash in the Exchange Fund
shall be for the benefit of Merger Sub. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement.   (b)
PAYMENT PROCEDURES.   (i) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
but in no  event later than three Business Days after the Effective Time,
the  Surviving Company shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
record  holder, as of the Effective Time (the "HOLDERS"), (A) a letter of 
transmittal specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss  and
title to the Certificates held by any Holder representing Company  Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock shall pass only upon delivery of  such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange  Agent
or, in the case of Book Entry Shares, upon adherence to the  procedures set
forth in the letter of transmittal, such letter of  transmittal to be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent and  the Company may reasonably
agree and (B) instructions for use in effecting  the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration  or the applicable
Parent Preferred Stock, as the case may be, or, in the  case of Book Entry
Shares, the surrender of such shares, for payment of the  Merger
Consideration or the applicable Parent Preferred Stock therefor.   (ii) Upon
surrender by a Holder of the Company Common Stock to  the Exchange Agent of
any Certificate (or evidence of loss in lieu thereof)  or Book Entry Shares,
as applicable, for cancellation together with a duly  executed letter of
transmittal, the Holder shall be entitled to receive in  exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to  receive pursuant to
this Article III (and the amount of cash in respect of  any dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is entitled  pursuant to Section
3.2(b)(iv), if any) and the Certificate or Book Entry  Shares so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be  paid or accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of the  Certificates or Book Entry Shares.
In the event of a transfer of ownership  of shares of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer  records of the Company, payment may
be issued to such a transferee if the  Certificate formerly representing such
shares of Company Common Stock is  presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to  evidence and effect such transfer,
and the Person requesting such issuance  pays any transfer or other
Taxes    -15-    required by reason of such payment to a Person other
than the registered  holder of such Certificate or establishes to the
satisfaction of Parent and  the Company that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.   (iii) Each holder of Series C Preferred Stock upon surrender 
of any Certificate or Book Entry Shares, as applicable, to the Exchange 
Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such 
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, shall 
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate or certificates 
representing the number of shares of Parent 8.7% Preferred Stock into which 
the aggregate number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock previously 
represented by such Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall have been 
converted pursuant to this Agreement and the amount of cash in respect of 
any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled 
pursuant to Section 3.2(b)(iv), if any. Each holder of Series D Preferred 
Stock upon surrender of any Certificate or Book Entry Shares, as  applicable,
to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal,  duly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by  the
Exchange Agent, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a

8.75% Preferred Stock into which the aggregate number of shares of Series D 
Preferred Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Book Entry 
Shares shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement and the amount

holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(b)(iv), if any.   (iv) No
dividends or other distributions with respect to  securities of the Parent
Common Stock or the Parent Preferred Stock with a  record date after the
Closing Date shall be paid to the holder of any  Certificates or Book Entry
Shares not surrendered until such Certificates  or Book Entry Shares, as
applicable, are surrendered as provided in this  Section 3.2. Following such
surrender, there shall be paid, without  interest, to the Person in whose
name the Parent Common Stock or Parent  Preferred Stock, as applicable, has
been registered, (A) at the time of  surrender, the amount of all dividends
or other distributions with a record  date after the Closing Date previously
paid or payable on the date of such  surrender with respect to such Parent
Common Stock or Parent Preferred  Stock, as applicable, and (B) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount  of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Closing  Date and prior to surrender and with a
payment date subsequent to surrender  payable with respect to such Parent
Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock,  as applicable.   (c) TRANSFERS.
After the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time.   (d) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund relating to the Merger Consideration or the Parent Preferred
Stock that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock, as the case may be, six months after the Effective
Time shall be returned to Parent, the Surviving Company or another affiliate
of Parent, as may be designated by Parent or the Surviving Company. Any
holders of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock who have not
theretofore complied with    -16-   this Article III shall thereafter
look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration or Parent
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, upon due surrender of their Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Company, the
Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal Requirements. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by such holders three years after the Effective Time (or
such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Government Entity) shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the property of the
Surviving Company free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.   (e) LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES.
In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Company with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration or the applicable
Parent Preferred Stock.   (f) FRACTIONAL SHARES. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock will be issued and any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock but for this
Section 3.2(f) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu thereof,
in an amount equal to such holder\'s proportionate interest in the net
proceeds from the sale or sales in the open market by the Exchange Agent, on
behalf of all such holders, of the shares of Parent Common Stock constituting
the excess of (i) the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock delivered
to the Exchange Agent by Parent over (ii) the aggregate number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to holders of Company Common
Stock (such excess being herein called the "EXCESS SHARES"). As soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine
the number of Excess Shares and, as agent for the former holders of Company
Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at the prevailing prices on the
New York Stock Exchange. The Exchange Agent shall deduct from the proceeds of
the sale of the Excess Shares all commissions, transfer Taxes and other out-
of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the
Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with such sale of Excess Shares. Until
the net proceeds of such sale have been distributed to the former holders of
Company Common Stock, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for
such former holders. As soon as practicable after the determination of the
amount of cash to be paid to such former holders in lieu of any fractional
interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available in accordance with this
Agreement such amounts to such former holders.   (g) WITHHOLDING RIGHTS.
Each of Parent, the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent, as applicable,
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of any Legal Requirement applicable to Taxes. If Parent
or the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, so
withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes   
-17-   of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company Common Stock or Options, as applicable, in respect of which Parent or
the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding.   SECTION 3.3. ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVENT DILUTION.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if, after the
date hereof, and prior to the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar
transaction, then the Merger Consideration and Exchange Ratio and any other
similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide to Parent, Merger Sub and the holders of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such action, and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event,
be the Merger Consideration, the Exchange Ratio or other dependent item, as
applicable, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this
sentence.   SECTION 3.4. NO FURTHER RIGHTS. From and after the Effective
Time, holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights as shareholders
of the Company, except as expressly provided herein or by applicable
Legal Requirements.   SECTION 3.5. DISSENTING SHARES. Notwithstanding
Section 3.1(a), shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has complied with the
provisions of Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA that are applicable prior to the
Effective Time ("DISSENTING SHARES") shall not be converted into or represent
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder withdraws
or otherwise loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his, her or its
right to obtain payment of the fair value of his or its Dissenting Shares,
but shall instead be entitled only to such rights with respect to such
Dissenting Shares as may be granted to such holder pursuant to Chapter 23B.13
of the WBCA. If after the Effective Time such holder withdraws or loses
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) his, her or its right to obtain
payment of the fair value of his, her or its Dissenting Shares under Chapter
23B.13 of the WBCA, such Dissenting Shares shall be treated as if they had
been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable with respect thereto. The Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to give Parent notice of any notice of intent to demand payment
under Section 23B.13.210, demand for payment under Section 23B.13.230
or withdrawal of any such demands received by the Company and involve Parent
in the negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.   SECTION
3.6. STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS.   (a) The
Company shall not grant Options after the date of this Agreement under the
Company Option Plans, or otherwise.   (b) The Company shall take such
actions as are necessary to cause all outstanding Options to become fully
vested and exercisable at the Effective Time and to cause    -18-   all
shares of Restricted Stock to become fully vested immediately after
the Effective Time. For purposes of vesting under the Company Option Plans,
any holder of Restricted Stock whose employment is terminated by the Company
or Parent as of the Effective Time shall be deemed to have been
terminated immediately after the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each
holder of a then-outstanding and unexercised Option shall receive, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
options exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock having the same terms
and conditions as the Options (including such terms and conditions as may be
incorporated by reference into the agreements evidencing the Options pursuant
to the plans or arrangements pursuant to which such Options were granted),
except that (i) the number of shares issuable upon exercise of each Option
shall be multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (and rounded down to the nearest
share), and (ii) the exercise price of each outstanding Option shall be
divided by the Exchange Ratio (and rounded up to the nearest cent). Parent
and Merger Sub shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the Options
(i) shall be converted in a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the
Code, and (ii) shall be converted in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code.   (c) As of the Effective Time,
each holder of a Restricted Stock Unit shall have such Restricted Stock Unit
converted, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, into a restricted stock unit settleable in Parent Common
Stock or cash (based on the fair market value of Parent Common Stock), having
the same terms and conditions as the Restricted Stock Unit (including such
terms and conditions as may be incorporated by reference into the agreement
evidencing the Restricted Stock Unit pursuant to the Company Option Plan
pursuant to which such Restricted Stock Unit was granted) (a "PARENT
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT"), provided that (i) the number of Parent Restricted
Stock Units into which the Restricted Stock Units are converted shall equal
the number of Restricted Stock Units multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, (ii)
25% of the Parent Restricted Stock Units shall be vested as of immediately
after the Effective Time notwithstanding any termination of employment by the
Company or Parent occurring as of the Effective Time (the "VESTED PARENT
RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS") and the remaining 75% of the Parent Restricted Stock
Units (the "UNVESTED PARENT RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS") shall vest ratably
thereafter on each of the first five anniversaries of the Closing
Date, subject to the holder of such Parent Restricted Stock Units continuing

employee  or group of employees or former employees of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries  located outside of the United States; (ii) increase any

under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign Legal Requirement) or (B) as a transferee or
successor or (C) by Contract or otherwise (not including any gross-ups for
withholding Taxes or tax indemnities for equipment leasing).   (o) Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary holds any asset the disposition of which would
subject the Company to taxation under Section 337(d) of the Code, the
Treasury Regulations thereunder or IRS Notice 88-19 (or any comparable

holds any asset the disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to
Section 1374 of the Code.    -34-     (p) The Company has the right to
make or to require, and, after the Effective Time of the Merger will continue
to have the right to make or to require, each Subsidiary that is treated for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership to make, in the manner
provided in Section 1.754-1(b) of the Treasury Regulations, an election under
Section 754 of the Code (and any corresponding elections under state or local
tax law) (a "SECTION 754 ELECTION") to adjust the basis of its property as
provided in Sections 734(b) and 743(b) of the Code. At no time prior to the
Merger will there have been a revocation or attempted revocation of a Section

Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under
Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two years prior to the date of this

355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (r) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has (i) agreed to or

been paid by the Company or any of the Company\'s ERISA Affiliates, and no
amount is expected to be paid by the Company or any of the Company\'s ERISA
Affiliates, which would be subject to the provisions of Section 162(m) of the
Code such that all or a part of such payments would not be deductible by the
payor.   (u) The aggregate basis of the assets that will be sold to

determined for federal income tax purposes.    -35-     SECTION 4.15.
PROPERTIES.   (a) The Company or one of its Subsidiaries (each a "COMPANY
PROPERTY OWNER") owns fee simple title to each of the real properties (or the
applicable portion thereof) set forth on Schedule III entitled, "Real Estate
and Accumulated Depreciation", of the Company\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 as being owned in fee (and which
do not otherwise qualify as Leased Properties as defined below), as adjusted
to reflect purchases and sales disclosed in the Company SEC Documents prior
to the date hereof or on SCHEDULE 4.15(A) or SCHEDULE 4.6 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (together with the land underlying such properties and
all buildings, structures and other improvements and fixtures located on or
under such land and all easements, rights and other appurtenances thereto,
collectively, the "COMPANY PROPERTIES"), and a valid leasehold estate to each
of the real properties identified as being leased and set forth on SCHEDULE
4.15(A)(I) or SCHEDULE 4.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (collectively,

"COMPANY LEASES"). The Company has delivered or made available to Parent true
and complete copies of the Company Leases, and except as would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, each Company Lease is valid, binding and in
full force and effect. The Company Properties and the Leased Properties are
all of the real properties owned or leased by the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the interests
of the Company Property Owners in the Company Properties and the Leased
Properties are good and marketable and the same are owned free and clear of
Liens except for Permitted Liens. No written termination of or notice of
default has been received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under a
Company Lease, and to the Company\'s Knowledge no event has occurred which,
with due notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default
or violation thereunder or which might interfere with the quiet enjoyment of
the tenant under any Company Lease, except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   (b) American Land Title Association (or TLTA, CLTA or other
similar local equivalent) policies of title insurance (or marked title
insurance commitments having the same force and effect as title insurance
policies) have been issued by national title insurance companies insuring the
good and marketable fee simple or leasehold, as applicable, title of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, with respect to each of the
Company Properties and the Leased Properties that are located in the United
States, with the only exceptions or exclusions from such coverage being
Permitted Liens, except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each such policy
is in full force and effect and no claims have been made or are pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened thereunder. The Company has
delivered or made available to Parent true and complete copies of all such
policies except where the failure to do so would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   (c) The Company and the Subsidiaries have good title to
the personal properties and assets (i) reflected on the consolidated
financial statements included in the Company SEC Documents or acquired since
the date of such financial statements and (ii) sufficient for the conduct and
operation of their respective businesses as currently conducted,   
-36-   except for properties and assets not material in the aggregate to
the Business and disposed of in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice and except for such defects in title which, individually
or in the aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

or which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Company Property and Leased

sound and free of latent or patent structural, mechanical or
other significant defects, with no alterations or repairs being required
thereto under applicable Legal Requirements or insurance company
requirements; (ii) has not suffered any casualty or other damage that has not
been repaired; (iii) consists of sufficient land, parking areas, driveways
and other improvements and lawful means of access to permit the use thereof
in the manner and for the purposes to which it is presently devoted; and (iv)
is otherwise suitable, sufficient, adequate and appropriate in all respects
(whether physical, structural, legal, practical or otherwise) for its current
use, operation and occupancy, except, in each such case, to the extent that
failure to meet such standards does not impair or adversely affect the manner
or extent of the current use, operation or occupancy of such property. Except
as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Business will, at
the Closing Date, include all right, title and interest in and to all assets
that are used primarily in or that are being held primarily for use or are
otherwise necessary in the operation of the Business as currently
conducted.   (e) Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.15(E) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule or which, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, there
are no (i) pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened (in
writing) requirements by any insurance company which has issued an insurance
policy covering any Company Property or Leased Property which require any
repairs or work to be done on any Company Property or Leased Property, (ii)
condemnation, eminent domain or rezoning or proceedings that are pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened (in writing) with respect to any
portion of any of the Company Properties or Leased Properties; (iii) pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company (after reasonable inquiry), threatened
(in writing) action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity for assessment
or collection of taxes, impact fees or special assessments affecting any part
of any Company Property or Leased Property; or (iv) zoning, building, land-
use, fire, safety and signage or other applicable Laws (including to the

are presently being violated or will be violated by the continued
maintenance, operation or use of any buildings or other improvements on any
of the Company Properties or Leased Properties or by the continued
maintenance, operation or use of the parking areas related thereto.   (f)
Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 4.15(F), SCHEDULE 4.18 or SCHEDULE 6.3 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, no Company Property or Leased Property is
subject to any sales contract, option, right of first refusal or similar
agreement or arrangement in favor of any Third Party the exercise of which
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (g) Except in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has distributed or authorized the distribution of   
-37-   any localized, mass or direct mailing which provides any coupons,

to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and

or assets to any Person or group (so long as such Person or group is not in
breach of the "standstill" provisions of any Third Party Confidentiality
Agreement), and may negotiate and participate in discussions and negotiations
with such Person or group concerning an Acquisition Proposal if: (w) such
Person or group has submitted an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal which did
not result from a material breach by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any Representative of the terms and conditions set forth herein and which the
Company Board believes in good faith (after consultation with its legal and
financial advisors) is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal; (x)
if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
legal advisors) that failing    -55-   to do so would be a breach of
its fiduciary duties, including the standards of conduct set forth in Section
23B.08.300 of the WBCA, (y) prior to providing any nonpublic information
permitted to be provided pursuant to this sentence, the Company shall have
entered into a confidentiality agreement with such Person or Group on terms
no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement (without regard to
any modification thereof pursuant hereto), and (z) the Company shall provide
Parent a copy of any nonpublic information to be provided pursuant to this
sentence prior to furnishing such information to such Person or group,
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be required to provide Parent
any such non-public information that is already contained in the Intralinks
data room as of the date hereof.   (b) Except as set forth in this Section
6.4(b), neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)

any such committee of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement with

an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (each, a
"SUBSEQUENT DETERMINATION"), in each case if (x) the Company shall not have
violated its obligations under this Section 6.4 in any material respect and
shall have received a Superior Proposal, (y) the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with its legal advisors) that
failing to take such action would be a breach of its fiduciary duties
including the standards of conduct set forth in Section 23B.08.300 of the
WBCA, and (z) prior to taking such action, the Company provides four Business
Days written notice to Parent advising Parent that the Company Board has made
the determination described in clause (y) immediately above and complies with
Section 10.1(d)(i).   (c) From and after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) advise Parent of
the receipt of any inquiries, requests, proposals or offers relating to an
Acquisition Proposal received by the Company and keep Parent informed as to
the status of and any material developments regarding any such inquiries,
requests, proposals or offers. Any such notice shall be made in writing and
shall indicate the material terms and conditions thereof (including the
identity of the party making the Acquisition Proposal and a copy of the
Acquisition Proposal and any modifications thereto).   SECTION 6.5. TAX
MATTERS.   (a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,

Returns and other documents required to be filed by it with federal, state,
local and any non-U.S. Tax authorities, subject to extensions permitted by
any Legal Requirement and properly granted by the appropriate authority,
provided that the Company notifies Parent that it or any of its Subsidiaries

Code.    -56-     (b) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall cooperate
in the preparation, execution, and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications, or other documents regarding any real property transfer or
gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes
(together with any related interest, penalties or additions to such Taxes,
"TRANSFER TAXES") which become payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize
the amount of such Transfer Taxes.   (c) The Company shall provide Parent an
opinion of Perkins Coie LLP or other outside counsel reasonably satisfactory
to Parent, dated as of the Closing Date, to the Company substantially in the
form of EXHIBIT C and reasonably satisfactory to Parent (the "COMPANY REIT

the Company shall report and treat the Merger as a taxable disposition by
the Company of all of the Company\'s assets to Merger Sub in exchange for the
Merger Consideration, the cash paid pursuant to Section 3.7, the Parent
Preferred Stock, if any, and the assumption of all of the Company\'s
liabilities, followed by a liquidating distribution of such Merger
Consideration, cash paid pursuant to Section 3.7 and Parent Preferred Stock,
if any, to the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock
under Sections 331 and 562 of the Code. This Agreement constitutes a "plan of
liquidation" of the Company for federal income tax purposes and the Company
Board, prior to that date on which the Effective Time of the Merger occurs,
will adopt this Agreement as such plan.   (e) Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to merge or otherwise convert
each Subsidiary of the Company that is a Qualified REIT Subsidiary into a
limited liability company or entity that is treated, and will continue to be
treated after the Effective Time, as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, and the Company shall notify Parent prior to the
Effective Time of the name of each Subsidiary that is a Qualified REIT
Subsidiary that will not be so merged or converted prior to the Effective
Time.   SECTION 6.6. DIVIDENDS. From and after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall not declare or pay any dividend or distribution
to its shareholders without the prior written consent of Parent; provided,
that the written consent of Parent shall not be required for the
authorization and payment of (a) additional distributions required by the
Code for the Company to maintain its REIT status or necessary to eliminate
any federal Tax liability, after giving effect to any payments made pursuant
to clauses (b), (c), (d) and (e) below, and provided that the Company shall
consult with Parent prior to making any such dividend or distribution
pursuant to this clause (a) as to the requirement or necessity thereof; (b)
dividends or distributions of up to $2.175 per year per share to holders of
the Series C Preferred Stock and dividends or distributions of up to $2.1875
per year per share to holders of the Series D Preferred Stock which are paid
in accordance with past practices (including record and payment dates) and
the terms of the Certificates of Designation of such series of Company
Preferred Stock; (c) the previously declared quarterly distributions of $0.56
per share of Company Common Stock payable during the first quarter of 2006,
with record and payment dates of March 3, 2006 and March 13, 2006,
respectively; (d) distributions payable to holders of Company
Common Stock,    -57-   the record date of which shall be the earlier
of June 3, 2006 or the last Business Day immediately preceding the Closing
Date (the "SECOND QUARTER RECORD DATE"), which distributions shall be in an
amount per share equal to (x) $0.56 less (y) the per share amount of any
distributions paid or declared pursuant to clause (a) above during the period
following March 6, 2006 to the Second Quarter Record Date; and (e)
distributions to holders of Company Common Stock for each calendar quarter
thereafter (commencing July 1, 2006) ending on or prior to the Closing Date
in an amount per share equal to the (x) regular quarterly distribution per
share then paid to holders of Parent Common Stock (which Parent presently
intends, subject to declaration by Parent\'s board of directors, will be
$0.50 per share of Parent Common Stock) multiplied by (y) the Exchange
Ratio, and (z) in each case less the per share amount of any distributions
pursuant to clause (a) above paid or declared following the date hereof and
not previously deducted in computing the distributions payable pursuant to
clause (d) or this clause (e) (any such excess being carried forward),
provided, that the record and payment dates for each quarterly distribution
with respect to the Company Common Stock pursuant to this clause (e) shall be
the same as the record and payment dates for the applicable regular quarterly
distribution for the Parent Common Stock, provided that each such record date
shall be in the applicable calendar quarter, and that such record and payment
dates shall be provided by Parent to the Company by written notice not less
than twenty Business Days prior to the record date for such quarterly Parent
distribution. In the event that a distribution with respect to the Company
Common Stock or the Company Preferred Stock permitted by this Section 6.6 has
(x) a record date prior to the Effective Time and (y) has not been paid as of
the Effective Time, the holders of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive such distribution from the
Company at the time such shares are exchanged pursuant to Article II and
Article III of this Agreement. It is understood and agreed that Parent may
set the record date for the regular quarterly distribution payable to holders
of Parent Common Stock on the same date as the Second Quarter Record Date,
which distribution shall be in an amount per share equal to the regular
quarterly distribution per share then paid to holders of Parent Common Stock.
It is the intention of the parties hereto that each holder of a share of
Company Common Stock (assuming such holder owned such share prior to and as
of March 2, 2006 and does not subsequently transfer such share during the
remainder of 2006 except in connection with the conversion into Parent Common
Stock in connection with the Merger) shall receive one quarterly distribution
during each of the four calendar quarters of 2006, either as a Company
shareholder in accordance with clauses (d) and (e) above or, after
the Effective Time, as a Parent shareholder by receipt of a regular
quarterly distribution.   SECTION 6.7. PREFERRED STOCK. On or before the
date the Proxy Statement is mailed to holders of Company Common Stock (but in
no event more than 90 days prior to the anticipated Closing Date), the
Company shall publish a notice of redemption in a publication of general
circulation in the City of New York, once a week for two successive weeks,
and mail a notice to each holder of record of shares of Series C Preferred
Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, such notice to state that the Company
will redeem all of the Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock
immediately prior to and conditioned upon the Closing and otherwise
containing such other information required by the terms of the Series C
Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock and shall, subject to compliance
by Parent with Section 3.7, otherwise take such action as necessary to cause
the redemption of all of the Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred
Stock immediately prior to and conditioned upon the Closing.   
-58-     ARTICLE VII.   COVENANTS OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB   Parent
covenants and agrees with the Company that, at all times before the Closing
and to the extent specified, after the Closing, Parent at its expense will

this Agreement.   SECTION 7.1. OBLIGATION OF PARENT TO MAKE MERGER

of Parent and Merger Sub and will furnish the Company with such financial and
operating data and other information with respect to the business, personnel
and properties of Parent and Merger Sub or the transactions contemplated

any of Parent\'s Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate the rights
of any Person with which it has a business relationship, constitute a waiver
of the attorney-client privilege or contravene any Legal Requirement.   (b)
The Company will hold and treat and will cause its Representatives to hold
and treat in confidence all documents and information concerning Parent or
Merger Sub or their Subsidiaries furnished or otherwise made available to

propose to do, or permit or  consent to any amendment, modification or repeal
of its Articles of  Incorporation or Restated By-Laws (or equivalent
organizational document)  in such a manner as would cause holders of Company
Common Stock that  receive Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger to be
treated  differently than other holders of Parent Common Stock;   (iii)
take any action, or fail to take any action, which can  reasonably be
expected to cause Parent to fail to qualify as a REIT; or   (iv) take,
undertake, incur, authorize, commit or agree to  take any of the foregoing

practicable  of (and, in the case of any written notice, provide to the

exculpation and release now existing in favor of the officers   
-60-   and directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including
any Person who was or becomes a director or officer prior to the Effective
Time) (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") under the WBCA or as provided in the
Company\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' articles of incorporation, by-laws,
resolutions or any other written agreement between them with respect to
matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six
years after the Effective Time (or, in the case of claims or other matters
occurring on or prior to the expiration of such six-year period which have
not been resolved prior to the expiration of such six-year period, until such
matters are finally resolved), and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company
and its Subsidiaries to, and the Surviving Company shall, honor all such
rights. Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect for not less than six
years from the Effective Time the current policies of the directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that
Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous)
PROVIDED, that in no event shall Parent be required to pay aggregate premiums
for insurance under this Section 7.5(a) in excess of 200% of the aggregate
premiums paid by the Company in 2005 for such purpose and, if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that
officers and directors of the Company or any Subsidiary may be required to
make application and provide customary representations and warranties to
Parent\'s insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such insurance.
Until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and its Affiliates
shall not amend, modify or repeal the provisions for indemnification of
directors or officers contained in the articles of incorporation or by-laws
(or comparable charter documents) of the Surviving Company or its
Subsidiaries in such a manner as would adversely affect the rights of any
individual who has served as a director or officer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time to be indemnified in respect of
their serving in such capacities prior to the Effective Time.   (b)
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is made against or involves any Indemnified Party, on
or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of
this Section 7.5 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.   (c) This covenant is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives. The
indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to
any Legal Requirement, contract or otherwise.   (d) In the event Parent or
any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.5.    -61-

employment (each a "COMPANY U.S. EMPLOYEE") will continue to be provided

the Company Disclosure Schedule; provided that discretionary benefits  shall
remain discretionary.   (ii) For purposes of all employee benefit plans,
programs and  agreements maintained by or contributed to by Parent and its
Subsidiaries  (including, after Closing, the Surviving Company), Parent
shall, or shall  cause its Subsidiaries to cause each such plan, program or
arrangement to  treat the prior service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries located  in the United States of any Company U.S. Employee (to
the same extent such  service is recognized under analogous plans, programs
or arrangements of  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries located in the
United States prior  to the Effective Time) as service rendered to Parent or
any of its  Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for all purposes; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that  such crediting of service shall not (i) operate to duplicate
any benefit or  the funding of such benefit under any plan, (ii) require the
crediting of  past service for benefit accrual purpose under any defined
benefit pension  plan or (iii) be credited if past service credit has not
been or will not  be provided to employees or Parent or its Subsidiaries
participating in  such plan. Company U.S. Employees shall also be given
credit for any  deductible or co-payment amounts paid in respect of the plan
year in which  the Closing occurs, to the extent that, following the Closing,
they  participate in any other plan for which deductibles or co-payments
are  required. Parent shall also cause each Parent Plan (as defined below)
to  waive any preexisting condition or waiting period limitation which
would  otherwise be applicable to a Company U.S. Employee on or after the 
Effective Time (to the extent such limitation would not apply under the 
corresponding U.S. Employee Benefit Plan). Parent shall recognize any 
accrued but unused vacation of the Company U.S. Employees as of the 
Effective Time, and Parent shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries 
located in the United States to provide such paid vacation. For purposes of 
this Agreement, a "PARENT PLAN" shall mean such employee benefit plan, as 
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or a nonqualified employee benefit or 
deferred compensation plan, stock option, bonus or incentive plan or other 
employee benefit or fringe benefit program, that may be in effect generally

from time to time.   (iii) (A) During the Benefits Continuation Period,
Parent  shall satisfy or Parent shall cause the Company to satisfy any
liability  for all severance and similar obligations payable to any Company
U.S.  Employee, including for any Company U.S.    -62-    Employee who
is terminated by Parent or the Company, or any of their  respective
Subsidiaries located in the United States on terms no less  favorable than
those provided under the applicable Company severance plan  set forth in
SCHEDULE 7.6(A)(III)(A) of the Company Disclosure Schedule;  PROVIDED, that
all payment under such plans and programs that are  discretionary shall
remain discretionary, and (B) notwithstanding anything  herein to the
contrary, during the one year period following the Closing  Date, Parent
shall satisfy or Parent shall cause the Company to satisfy any  liabilities
incurred pursuant to the programs set forth on SCHEDULE  7.6(A)(III)(B) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule.   (iv) Except as provided in this Section
7.6(a), nothing in  this Agreement shall limit or restrict the rights of
Parent or the Company  to modify, amend, terminate or establish employee
benefit plans or  arrangements, in whole or in part, at any time after the
Effective Time.   (v) No provision of this Section 7.6(a) shall create any 
third party beneficiary rights in any Company U.S. Employee or any current 
or former director or consultant of the Company or its Subsidiaries located 
in the United States in respect of continued employment (or resumed 
employment) or any other matter.   (b) EMPLOYEE BENEFITS - NON-U.S.
EMPLOYEES. Parent agrees that, at the Effective Time, Parent shall be
responsible for and shall pay to any participant who holds gain sharing
rights under the Shurgard Europe Gain Sharing Plan (the "GAIN SHARING PLAN"),
any amounts due to such participant pursuant to Rule 7.1 of the Gain Sharing
Plan. At the Effective Time, any gain sharing rights that were held by
participants under the Gain Sharing Plan immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall become fully matured pursuant to sub-Rule 5.1.5 of the Gain
Sharing Plan.   (c) EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS. Parent agrees to cause the

or amendment rights), which are applicable with respect to any employee,
officer, director or executive or former employee, officer, director, or
executive of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the
"EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS"). Parent acknowledges that a "Business Combination"
as that term is used in the Employment Agreements, shall occur at the
Effective Time. Neither this Section 7.6(c) nor any other provision of this
Agreement shall limit the ability or right of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any of their respective employees
after the Effective Time (subject to any rights of any such employees
pursuant to any binding Contract, arrangement, policy, plan or
commitment).   SECTION 7.7. TAX MATTERS.   (a) From the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, Parent and its Subsidiaries will duly and
timely file all Tax Returns and other documents required by it to be filed
with federal, state and local Tax authorities, subject to extensions
permitted by any Legal Requirement and properly granted by the appropriate
authority, provided that such extensions do not adversely affect Parent\'s
status as a REIT under the Code.    -63-     (b) Parent and its
Subsidiaries shall cooperate in the preparation, execution, and filing of all

assets to Merger Sub in exchange for the Merger Consideration, the cash paid
pursuant to Section 3.7, the Parent Preferred Stock, if any, and the
assumption of all of the Company\'s liabilities, followed by a liquidating
distribution of such Merger Consideration, cash paid pursuant to Section 3.7
and the Parent Preferred Stock, if any, to the holders of the Company Common
Stock and Company Preferred Stock pursuant to Sections 331 and 562 of the
Code.   (d) Parent shall provide to the Company an opinion of Hogan

parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such

the parties contained in this Section 8.2, if any objections are asserted
with respect to the Merger contemplated hereby under any antitrust or
competition law, each of Parent and the Company agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts (which under no circumstances shall involve divesting of
material assets) to resolve any antitrust concerns, federal, state, foreign
or private, obtain all Permits and Consents and obtain termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable law and the
termination of any outstanding judicial or administrative orders prohibiting

practicable. In furtherance and not in limitation thereof, if any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by
a private party, is instituted (or threatened in writing to be
instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as
violative of any law or regulation, or if any statute, rule, regulation,
executive order, decree, injunction or administrative order is enacted,
entered, promulgated or enforced by a Governmental Entity that would make the
Merger illegal or would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or delay the

cooperate with Parent in all respects in responding thereto, and each shall
use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest, resist and/or attempt
to resolve any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to have such statute, rule,
regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or administrative order
repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the
Merger.   (e) In connection with the obtaining of Consents from Third
Parties or obviating the need to obtain such Consents, if requested in
writing by Parent, the Company shall or shall cause its Subsidiaries to

Subsidiaries in connection with any actions taken by the Company or its
Subsidiaries at the direction of Parent in accordance with this Section
8.2(e). If the Closing is not consummated and this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, Parent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and its Subsidiaries from and against any and all liabilities arising
or resulting from, or suffered or incurred by any of them, in connection with
any actions taken in good faith or at Parent\'s direction in connection with
this Section 8.2(e).   SECTION 8.3. LISTING OF SHARES. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock and the

Affiliate Letter to deliver a written agreement, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent, in connection with restrictions on
affiliates under Rule 145.   SECTION 8.5. SECTION 16(B). Assuming that the
Company delivers to Parent the Company Section 16 Information (as hereinafter
defined) in a timely fashion prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of Parent, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as

and Merger Sub may not terminate this  Agreement pursuant to this Section

Agreement.   SECTION 10.2. EFFECT OF TERMINATION. (a) In the event of
termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent or Merger Sub
as provided in Section 10.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company, except (i) that the terms and conditions set forth
in this Article X shall continue to remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding any such termination, (ii) as otherwise provided in Section
11.1, and (iii) that nothing contained herein shall relieve any party for
willful breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement.   (b) In the event this Agreement
is terminated (x) by the Company pursuant to Section 10.1(d)(i) or (y) by
Parent pursuant to Section 10.1(e)(i), then the Company shall pay, or cause
to be paid, to Parent (A) in the case of clause (x) above, on the date of
such termination and immediately prior to and as a condition to the
termination and (B) in the case of clause (y) above, within two Business Days
after such termination, an amount equal to the Termination Fee (as defined
below) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Parent.   (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated
by any party pursuant to Section 10.1(c)(i) or by the Company pursuant to
Section 10.1(d)(iii) or by Parent pursuant to Section 10.1(e)(ii) and, in
each case, an Acquisition Proposal shall at the time of such termination have
been publicly proposed or publicly announced and within 12 months of the
termination of this Agreement, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
consummates a transaction included in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
(or enters into an agreement with respect to such a transaction which
subsequently closes), then the Company shall pay Parent an amount equal to
the Termination Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Parent, within two Business Days after the consummation
of such Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this Section 10.2(c), the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" contained in this Agreement shall be
applied by substituting "25%" for "10%" in such definition.   
-73-     (d) As used in this Agreement, the "TERMINATION FEE" shall be
an amount equal to the lesser of (x) $125 million (the "BASE AMOUNT") less
the amount of any Parent Termination Costs which have previously been paid
pursuant to Section 10.2(e) and (y) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that
can be paid to Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements
of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of
such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H)
and 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code ("QUALIFYING INCOME"), as determined by
independent accountants to Parent, and (B) in the event Parent receives and,
prior to the date the Termination Fee is due to be paid to Parent as
described above, provides a copy to the Company of an opinion or a letter
from outside counsel (the "TERMINATION FEE TAX OPINION") indicating that
Parent has received an opinion of counsel or a ruling from the IRS holding
that Parent\'s receipt of the Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying
Income or would be excluded from gross income of Parent within the meaning of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the "REIT REQUIREMENTS"), the Base
Amount less the amount payable under clause (A) above. In the event that
Parent is not able to receive the full Base Amount on the date the
Termination Fee is due as described above, the Company shall place the amount
by which the Base Amount exceeds the amount paid under clause (y)(A) of the
preceding sentence above (the "UNPAID BASE AMOUNT") with an escrow agent
selected by Parent which shall not release any portion thereof to Parent
unless and until Parent provides the escrow agent (with a copy to
the Company) with either one of the following: (A) a letter from
Parent\'s independent accountants indicating the maximum portion of the
Unpaid Base Amount that can be paid at that time to Parent without causing
Parent to fail to meet the REIT Requirements or (B) a Termination Fee Tax
Opinion, in either of which events the escrow agent shall pay to Parent from
the escrow the lesser of the Unpaid Base Amount and, if applicable, the
maximum amount stated in the accountants\' letter referred to in clause (A)
of this sentence. The escrow agent\'s obligation to pay any portion of the
Unpaid Base Amount shall terminate three years from the Effective Time.
Amounts remaining in escrow after such obligation terminates shall be
released to the Company.   (e) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 10.1(c)(i) and an Acquisition Proposal shall at the time of such
termination have been publicly proposed or publicly announced, the Company
shall pay to Parent all of the costs and expenses incurred by Parent or its
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement up to a maximum amount of $10,000,000
(collectively, "PARENT TERMINATION COSTS"), such payment to be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent
not later than two Business Days after being notified by Parent of the amount
of such costs and expenses. Parent may reduce the amount of such Parent
Termination Costs to be paid by the Company as not to adversely affect
Parent\'s ability to meet the requirements of either or both of
Sections 856(c)(2) or (3) of the Code and the amount of such reduction shall
be placed in escrow by the Company and shall not be released unless Parent
provides the Company with a Termination Fee Tax Opinion, and at such time any
Termination Fee Tax Opinion is delivered, shall promptly release the amount
referred to in such Termination Fee Tax Opinion to Parent. Such escrow
arrangement shall expire, and remaining funds returned to the Company, on the
date that is three years after the date of this Agreement. Nothing herein
shall be construed to limit the number of distributions pursuant to this
escrow prior to the date of the expiration of such escrow.    -74-    
(f) The Company and Parent agree that the agreements contained in this
Section 10.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that the payments to be made thereunder shall be
compensation for the loss suffered by the applicable party as a result of the
failure of the Merger to be consummated and constitute liquidated damages and
not a penalty.   ARTICLE XI.   GENERAL PROVISIONS   SECTION 11.1. NON-
