RECITALS 

   

 1. Parent is engaged, directly and indirectly, in the Snacks Business; 

  

 2. Parent has determined that it would be appropriate and desirable to separate the Snacks Business from Parent and to divest the Snacks Business in the manner contemplated hereby; 

  

 3. The Parties contemplate that the Snacks Business will be transferred to Wimbledon as provided in the Separation Agreement and, in connection therewith, the Recapitalization will take place, including Wimbledons payment of the Recapitalization Amount; 

  

 4. The Parties contemplate that, immediately following the Wimbledon Transfer and Recapitalization, Parent will either (i) distribute all of the shares of Wimbledon Common Stock to Parent shareholders without consideration on a pro rata basis (a " _One-Step Spin-Off_ ") or (ii) consummate an offer to exchange (an " _Exchange Offer_ ") shares of Wimbledon Common Stock for currently outstanding shares of Parents common stock (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") and, in the event that Parents shareholders subscribe for less than all of the Wimbledon Common Stock in the Exchange Offer, Parent will distribute, _pro rata_ to its shareholders, any unsubscribed Wimbledon Common Stock on the Distribution Date immediately following the consummation of the Exchange Offer so that Parent will be treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as having distributed all of the Wimbledon Common Stock to its shareholders (the " _Clean-Up Spin-Off_ "); 

  

 5. The disposition by Parent of 100% of the Wimbledon Common Stock, whether by way of the One-Step Spin-Off or the Exchange Offer (followed by any Clean-Up Spin-Off) is referred to herein as the " _Distribution_ ;" 

  

 6. The Boards of Directors of Parent, Wimbledon and Acquiror and the Board of Managers of Merger Sub have each approved and declared advisable the Merger of Wimbledon with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity in the Merger, such Merger to take place immediately following the Distribution, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL and the DLLCA; 

  

 7. Pursuant to the plan of reorganization and as soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, Parent will effect the Parent Cash Distribution to Parents 

   ##### 

  

 

creditors in retirement of outstanding Parent indebtedness in the manner
described in this Agreement; 

   

 8. For U.S. federal income Tax purposes, the Parties intend that (i) the Wimbledon Transfer, taken together with the Distribution, qualify as a reorganization pursuant to Section 368 of the Code, (ii) the Distribution, as such, qualify as a distribution of Wimbledon Common Stock to Wimbledon shareholders pursuant to Section 355 of the Code, (iii) the Merger qualify as a reorganization pursuant to Section 368 of the Code, (iv) the Parent Cash Distribution qualify as money distributed to creditors in connection with the reorganization within the meaning of Section 361(b)(1) of the Code, and (v) the execution of this Agreement constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code; and 

  

 9. The Parties intend in this Agreement to set forth the principal arrangements among them regarding the Recapitalization, Distribution and Merger. 

  

 Accordingly, the Parties agree as follows: 

  

I. TRANSACTION 

   

 1.01 __Closing__ _._ On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at Jones Day, 222 East 41st Street, New York, New York, at 10:00 a.m., local time on the last Business Day of the calendar month in which the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article V_ occurs (other than those conditions, including the Distribution, that by their nature or pursuant to the terms of this Agreement are to be satisfied at or immediately prior to the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, where permitted, the waiver of those conditions);  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions occurs (a) prior to the first day set forth in the range of 2011 Target Dates, then the Closing will be on the date Parent identifies to Acquiror in writing that it has selected within the range of 2011 Target Dates and (b) after the 2011 Target Dates, but prior to the first day set forth in the range of 2012 Target Dates, then the Closing will be on the date Parent identifies to Acquiror in writing that it has selected within the range of 2012 Target Dates; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions occurs after the 2012 Target Date but prior to the End Date, then in any event the Closing will occur on such day within the last week of the month in which satisfaction of such conditions occurs or the first week of the following month as identified in writing by Parent to Acquiror that it has selected, in each case, prior to the End Date. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_." 

  

 1.02 __Recapitalization of Wimbledon__. Parent and Wimbledon will cause the following to occur at the Business Transfer Time: 

  

 (a) _General._ In partial consideration for the Conveyance of Assets contemplated by  _Section 1.1_ of the Separation Agreement, Wimbledon will: 

   

 (i) issue and deliver to Parent additional shares of Wimbledon Common Stock (the " _Wimbledon Stock Issuance_ "); 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) distribute to Parent the Recapitalization Amount in cash in immediately available funds to an account specified for this purpose by Parent; and 

  

 (iii) assume the Wimbledon Liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Separation Agreement. 

  

 (b) _Wimbledon Indebtedness_. Wimbledon, together with the other members of the Wimbledon Group, will enter into the definitive Wimbledon Credit Documents contemplated by the Wimbledon Commitment Letter attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (such credit facility, the " _Wimbledon Credit Facility_ ") (the Wimbledon Credit Facility, the Wimbledon Stock Issuance and the Recapitalization Amount, together the " _Recapitalization_ "), and will borrow sufficient funds under the Wimbledon Credit Facility to allow Wimbledon to promptly distribute the Recapitalization Amount to Parent less any amount borrowed pursuant to the proviso in the first sentence of _Section 1.7(a)_ of the Separation Agreement. 

   

 (c) _Cash Distribution_. Parent will maintain a portion of the Recapitalization Amount approximately equal to Parents estimated adjusted Tax basis in Wimbledon Common Stock as of the Distribution Date in a segregated account (the " _Segregated Cash Amount_ ") and will take into account for Tax purposes all items of income, gain, deduction or loss associated with the funds while maintained in this segregated account. Pursuant to the plan of reorganization and as soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, Parent will distribute the Segregated Cash Amount, and all remaining amounts in the above-described segregated account, to Parents creditors in retirement of outstanding Parent indebtedness (the " _Parent Cash Distribution_ "). Prior to effecting the Parent Cash Distribution, Parent will adopt a corporate resolution specifying that such distribution will be made from the funds maintained in the segregated account referenced in this _Section 1.02(c)_. 

   

 1.03 __Form and Manner of Distribution__. (a) Parent may elect, in its sole discretion, to effect the Distribution in the form of either (i) a One-Step Spin-Off or (ii) an Exchange Offer (including any Clean-Up Spin-Off, as set forth below). 

  

 (b) If Parent elects to effect the Distribution in the form of a One-Step Spin-Off, the Board of Directors of Parent, in accordance with applicable Law, will establish (or designate Persons to establish) a Record Date and the Distribution Date and Parent will establish appropriate procedures in connection with the Distribution. All shares of Wimbledon Common Stock held by Parent on the Distribution Date will be distributed to the Record Holders in the manner determined by Parent and in accordance with _Section 1.04(f)_. 

   

 (c) If Parent elects to effect the Distribution as an Exchange Offer, Parent will determine in its sole discretion the terms and conditions of such Exchange Offer, including the number of shares of Wimbledon Common Stock that will be offered for each validly tendered share of Parent Common Stock, the period during which such Exchange Offer will remain open, the procedures for the tender and exchange of shares and all other terms and conditions of such Exchange Offer, which will comply with securities Law requirements applicable to such Exchange Offer. In the event that 

      ##### 

  

    

Parents shareholders subscribe for less than all of the Wimbledon Common
Stock in the Exchange Offer, Parent will consummate the Clean-Up Spin-Off on
the Distribution Date immediately following the consummation of the Exchange
Offer. 

   

 1.04 __The Distribution__. (a) To the extent the Distribution is effected as a One-Step Spin-Off, subject to the terms thereof, in accordance with _Section 1.04(f)_, each Record Holder will be entitled to receive for each share of Parent Common Stock held by such Record Holder a number of shares of Wimbledon Common Stock equal to the total number of shares of Wimbledon Common Stock held by Parent on the Distribution Date, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is number of Parent Common Stock held by such Record Holder and the denominator of which is the total amount of Parent Common Stock outstanding on the Distribution Date. Without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision hereof, it is a condition to the completion of the Distribution as a One-Step Spin-Off that Parent shall have given Acquiror at least two Business Days notice of such election prior to or during the applicable range of Target Dates or, if the Closing occurs after the last day in the range of 2012 Target Dates, the Closing Date. 

  

 (b) Subject to the terms thereof, to the extent the Distribution is effected as an Exchange Offer, each Parent shareholder may elect in the Exchange Offer to exchange a number of Parent Common Stock held by such Parent shareholder for shares of Wimbledon Common Stock subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Wimbledon Form S-1/S-4. 

   

 (c) None of the Parties will be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Wimbledon Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) that are delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (d) Parent and Wimbledon, as the case may be, will be entitled, and may instruct the transfer agent or the exchange agent in the Distribution, as applicable, to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payments under the Code or any provision of local or foreign Tax Law. Any withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Persons otherwise entitled thereto. 

   

 (e) The terms and conditions of any Clean-Up Spin-Off will be as determined by Parent in its sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) any Wimbledon Common Stock that is not subscribed for in the Exchange Offer must be distributed to the Parents shareholders in the Clean-Up Spin-Off and (ii) such distribution must take place on the Distribution Date immediately following the consummation of the Exchange Offer so that Parent will be treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as having distributed all of the Wimbledon Common Stock to its shareholders. 

  

 (f) Upon the consummation of the One-Step Spin-Off or the Exchange Offer, Parent will deliver to the Exchange Agent a global certificate representing the Wimbledon Common Stock being distributed in the One-Step Spin-Off or exchanged in 

      ##### 

  

    

the Exchange Offer, as the case may be, for the account of the Parent
shareholders that are entitled thereto. Upon a Clean-Up Spin-Off, if any,
Parent will deliver to the Exchange Agent an additional global certificate
representing the Wimbledon Common Stock being distributed in the Clean-Up
Spin-Off for the account of the Parent shareholders that are entitled
thereto. The Exchange Agent will hold such certificate or certificates, as
the case may be, for the account of the Parent shareholders pending the
Merger.

   

 1.05 __Plan of Reorganization__. This Agreement will constitute a "plan of reorganization" for the Transactions under Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g). Pursuant to the plan of reorganization, (a) Parent will complete the Distribution through either (i) a One-Step Spin-Off or (ii) the Exchange Offer and any Clean-Up Spin-Off (which Clean-Up Spin-Off will be completed on the Distribution Date immediately following the consummation of the Exchange Offer) and (b) Wimbledon will merge with and into Merger Sub immediately following the Distribution, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity. 

  

 1.06 __The Merger__. (a) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Wimbledon will be merged (the " _Merger_ ") with and into Merger Sub in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL and the DLLCA. Immediately following the Merger, Merger Sub will continue as the surviving entity (the " _Surviving Company_ ") and will be a wholly owned Subsidiary of Acquiror, and the separate corporate existence of Wimbledon will cease; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement or any Other Transaction Agreement will preclude Acquiror from liquidating or merging Merger Sub with and into Acquiror following the completion of the One-Year Period. 

  

 (b) The Merger will be consummated by the filing of a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the DLLCA (the date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as is specified in the Certificate of Merger and as is agreed to by Parent and Acquiror, the " _Effective Time_ "). 

   

 (c) The Merger will have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the DLLCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of Wimbledon and Merger Sub will vest in Merger Sub as the Surviving Company and all debts, liabilities and duties of Wimbledon (including all of the obligations under the Wimbledon Credit Facility) and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of Merger Sub as the Surviving Company. 

   

 (d) The text of the certificate of formation of the Surviving Company in effect at the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and restated so as to be identical to the certificate of formation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the name of the entity set forth in the certificate of formation of the Surviving Company will continue to be "The Wimble Company"), until 

      ##### 

  

    

thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The
bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
will be the bylaws of the Surviving Company until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

   

 (e) The initial managers of the Surviving Company at the Effective Time will be the managers of Merger Sub. The initial officers of the Surviving Company at the Effective Time will be the officers of Wimbledon at the Effective Time (after taking into account the resignations contemplated by _Section 2.2(a)(iv)_ of the Separation Agreement). Each of such initial officers and managers of the Surviving Company will hold office from the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in the manner provided by the certificate of formation and bylaws of the Surviving Company or as otherwise provided by Law. 

   

 1.07 __Conversion Of Capital Stock in the Merger__. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Wimbledon, Acquiror or the holders of the following securities, subject to _Section 1.11_, each share of Wimbledon Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive one fully paid and nonassessable share of Acquiror Common Stock (together with the associated Acquiror Right (as defined in _Section 3.05(a)_) under the Acquiror Rights Agreement (as defined in _Section 3.05(a)_ ) (such ratio, the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), in an aggregate amount equal to the Wimbledon Stock Amount. The shares of Acquiror Common Stock (including associated Acquiror Rights) to be issued upon the conversion of shares of Wimbledon Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 1.07_ and cash in lieu of fractional shares of as contemplated by _Section 1.11_ are referred to collectively as " _Merger Consideration_." As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Wimbledon Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and any holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Wimbledon Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate, without interest. The issuance of Acquiror Common Stock (including associated Acquiror Rights) in connection with the Merger is referred to as the " _Acquiror Stock Issuance_." 

  

 1.08 __Exchange Of Certificates__. (a) Pursuant to _Section 1.04(f)_, the Exchange Agent will hold, for the account of the relevant Parent shareholders, the global certificate(s) representing all of the outstanding shares of Wimbledon Common Stock distributed in the Distribution. Such shares of Wimbledon Common Stock will be converted into shares of Acquiror Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this _Article I_. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Closing, Parent will appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Acquiror as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Prior to or at the Effective Time, or as reasonably requested by Parent, Acquiror will deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Wimbledon Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this  _Article I_ through the Exchange Agent, evidence in book entry form representing the shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable pursuant to this _Article I_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Wimbledon 

      ##### 

  

    

Common Stock (such shares of Acquiror Common Stock, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred
to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). For the purposes of such deposit, Acquiror

Stock. Acquiror will make available to the Exchange Agent, for addition to
the Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed or as reasonably requested by
Parent, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in

Payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock will be made solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Acquiror of issuing fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock and will not represent separately bargained-for consideration.

The representations and warranties made in this Agreement and the Other Transaction Agreements with respect to the Acquiror and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Other Transaction Agreements are in lieu of all other representations and warranties Acquiror and its Subsidiaries might have given Parent, including implied warranties of merchantability and implied warranties of fitness for a particular purpose.

Parent acknowledges that, except as provided herein or in the Other Transaction Agreements, neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any other Person acting on their behalf will have or be subject to any Liability or indemnification obligation to Parent or any other Person acting on its behalf resulting from the distribution in written or oral communication to Parent, or use by Parent of, any information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available to Parent, confidential information memoranda or management interviews and presentations in expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Other Transaction Agreements. 

  

IV. COVENANTS 

   

 4.01 __Conduct Of Snacks Business Pending The Closing__. (a) Except as contemplated by this Agreement or any Other Transaction Agreement and except as set forth in _Section 4.01_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, Parent and each of its Subsidiaries will conduct the Snacks Business in all material respects only according to the ordinary and usual course of business consistent in all material respects with past practice (except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement or any Other Transaction Agreement or as consented to in writing by Acquiror). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, Parent may take such actions as it determines in good faith are commercially reasonable to respond to events resulting, in whole or in part, from the announcement of this Agreement and to preserve the Snacks 

   ##### 

  

 

Business and existing employee, customer and supplier relationships (including
replacing any key employees of the Snacks Business who cease to be employed
by Parent and its Subsidiaries). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, a
determination as to whether a particular employee is a "key" employee will be
made by Parent in good faith and Parent will be permitted to use a non-
Wimbledon Employee (a " _Temporary Employee_ ") to replace such identified
key employee for purposes of satisfying its obligations under this _Section
4.01_. For the avoidance of doubt, a Temporary Employee will not be deemed to
be a Wimbledon Employee unless mutually agreed to by Parent and Acquiror. 

   

 (b) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries will take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or fail to cause any action to be taken, which action or failure to act could (i) cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code or (ii) cause (x) gain or loss to be recognized by the Parent shareholders in connection with the Distribution or (y) gain or loss to be recognized by Parent in connection with the Distribution (other than with respect to a portion of the Recapitalization Amount). For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 4.01(b)_ will not be deemed to require Parent to obtain a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service in respect of the Tax treatment to be accorded to the Transactions, and the parties acknowledge that no such private letter ruling is contemplated to be obtained in connection herewith. 

   

 (c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 4.01(a)_ or _Section 4.01(b)_ and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, required by Law or set forth on _Section 4.01_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, Parent will not, without the prior written consent of Acquiror (which consent in the case of clauses (iv), (v) or (vi) below and in the case of clause (vii) insofar as it relates to clauses (iv), (v) or (vi) will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), nor will it permit any of its Subsidiaries to: 

   

 (i) sell, pledge, dispose of, grant, transfer, lease, license, guarantee, encumber or authorize the sale, pledge, disposition, grant, transfer, lease, guarantee or encumbrance of any Assets that are (or would otherwise be) Wimbledon Assets (other than inventory) pursuant to the Separation Agreement other than in the ordinary course of business and consistent in all material respects with past practice, including any Contract for the sale of obsolete or unused equipment. 

  

 (ii) (A) acquire (including by merger, consolidation, or acquisition of stock or assets) any interest in any Person or any division thereof or any assets that would be Wimbledon Assets, other than in the ordinary course of business in a manner consistent in all material respects with past practice or (B) other than Liabilities that would not be included in the Wimbledon Liabilities, incur any indebtedness for borrowed money or issue any debt securities or assume, guarantee or endorse, or otherwise as an accommodation become responsible for, the obligations of any Person for borrowed money; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (iii) issue or authorize the issuance of any shares of Wimbledon Common Stock or any Wimbledon Equity Interests, except as expressly provided in this Agreement and the Other Transaction Agreements; 

  

 (iv) in the case of each of the following to the extent it relates solely to the Snacks Business, (A) make a material change in its accounting or Tax reporting or accounting principles, methods or policies, except as required by a change in GAAP, (B) make, change or revoke any material Tax election or method of accounting on which Tax reporting is based, (C) settle or compromise any material Tax claim or Liability, or enter into any material Tax closing agreements, or (D) amend any Tax Return if, with respect to (B), (C) and (D), any such action would increase the Wimbledon Entities Tax obligations following the Closing; 

  

 (v) adopt or amend any Compensation And Benefit Plans or increase the salaries, wage rates, target bonus opportunities or equity based compensation of Wimbledon Employees, in each case except (A) in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice as applicable generally to Parent Group employees in the relevant jurisdictions, (B) in connection with the adoption or amendment of Compensation And Benefit Plans (or other practices) that are applicable generally to Parent Group employees in the relevant jurisdictions, or (C) as required (1) to comply with applicable Law, (2) by the terms of any Compensation And Benefit Plan in effect on the date hereof or (3) by the terms of any agreement of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date hereof, the existence of which agreement does not constitute a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement; 

  

 (vi) amend, modify, terminate (partially or completely), grant any waiver under or give any consent with respect to, or enter into any agreement to amend, modify, terminate (partially or completely), grant any waiver under or give any consent with respect to, any of the Wimbledon Material Contracts (excluding for this purpose Other Wimbledon Material Contracts) or enter into any Contract that if in effect on the date hereof would be a Wimbledon Material Contract (excluding for this purpose Other Wimbledon Material Contracts); or 

  

 (vii) agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any of the foregoing actions. 

  

 4.02 __Efforts To Close; Antitrust Clearance__. (a) In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or in any Other Transaction Agreement, each of the Parties will cooperate with each other and use (and will cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to use) their reasonable best efforts, prior to, at and after the Closing Date, to take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or to cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary on its part under applicable Law or Contractual obligations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Other Transaction Agreements as promptly as practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the level of efforts required to be utilized in connection with the Wimbledon Transfer will be as set forth in the Separation Agreement, (ii) Parent will not be required to make any payments, incur any Liability, or 

   ##### 

  

 

offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party
in connection with obtaining any Consent, (iii) Parent will not be required
to offer or agree to sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or
otherwise encumber before or after the Closing any Assets, licenses,
operations, rights, products lines, business or interests therein of Parent or
any of its Affiliates or agree to make any material changes or restriction
on, or other impairment of Parents or Affiliates ability to own, operate or
exercise rights in respect of, such sets, licenses, operations, rights,
products lines, business or interests therein, (iv) Acquiror will not
be required to offer or agree to sell, divest, lease, license, transfer,
dispose of or otherwise encumber before or after the Closing any Assets,
licenses, operations, rights, products lines, business or interests therein
of Parent or any of its Affiliates or Acquiror or any of its Affiliates or
agree to make any material changes or restriction on, or other impairment
of Acquirors or its Affiliates (including after the Closing, any member of
the Wimbledon Group) ability to own, operate or exercise rights in respect
of, such sets, licenses, operations, rights, products lines, business or
interests therein where the effect of such sale, divestiture,
license, transfer, disposition, encumbrance, hold separate arrangement or
other restriction would be materially adverse to the business, financial
condition or results of operations of Acquiror and its Affiliates (including
after the Closing, the Wimbledon Group), taken as a whole, and (v) for the
avoidance of doubt, this _Section 4.02_ will not be deemed to limit in any
respect Parents exercise of discretion under _Section 1.03_ or _Section
1.04_. 

   

 (b) Parent and Acquiror will comply fully with all applicable notification, reporting and other requirements. Parent and Acquiror, within 30 Business Days after the date of this Agreement, will file the required notifications with the appropriate Governmental Authorities pursuant to and in compliance with the HSR Act and make other filings under Antitrust Laws in accordance with  _Schedule 4.02(b)_. Parent and Acquiror will as soon as practicable file any additional information reasonably requested by any Governmental Authority. 

   

 (c) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 4.02(a)_ and _4.02(d)_ , Parent and Acquiror will each use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as soon as practicable, the Governmental Approvals that may be or become necessary for the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the Other Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the Transactions and will cooperate fully with each other in promptly seeking to obtain such Governmental Approvals. 

   

 (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants contained in _Section 4.02(c)_ , Acquiror will offer to take (and if such offer is accepted, commit to take) all necessary steps to eliminate impediments under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and to prevent the entry of any Order sought by any Governmental Authority or private Person under any Antitrust Law that would result in the failure of any condition to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the Transactions to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror will be permitted to take such actions as it may deem desirable to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any order under any Antitrust Law that would restrain or prevent the Closing, including defending through litigation 

      ##### 

  

    

any claim asserted in any court or proceeding by any Person. If Acquiror is
not able to avoid the entry of any order under any Antitrust Law that would
restrain or prevent the Closing from occurring prior to the End Date, then
Acquiror will propose, negotiate, cooperate with Parent, and effect (or
permit Parent to effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise,
the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of the
Snacks Business (or otherwise take any action that limits the freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of its businesses,
product lines, or assets or those of the Snacks Business) as may be required
in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent), which would otherwise have the
effect of preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
prior to the End Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror will not be
required to offer or agree to sell, divest, dispose of or take such
other action where the effect of such sale, divestiture, disposition or other
action would be materially adverse to the business, financial condition or
results of operations of Acquiror and its Affiliates (including after the
Closing, the Wimbledon Group), taken as a whole. 

   

 4.03 __Public Announcements__. Parent and Acquiror agree that the press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Transactions will be in the form attached as _Exhibit D_ and the investor presentation to be utilized by Acquiror with respect to the Transactions (together with such press release, the " _Transaction Announcements_ ") will be in the form attached as _Exhibit D_. The Parties further agree that the Acquiror investor presentation to be made in connection with the announcement of the Transactions will be in substantially the form included in Exhibit D and that both the initial press release and the investor presentation concerning the Transactions will be filed by Acquiror as exhibits to a Form 8-K filing promptly after the execution of this Agreement. From the date hereof through the Closing, and without limiting the effect of _Section 4.13_, neither Parent nor Acquiror will publish any press releases, or publish any other public statements (including to securities analysts) that contradicts any Transaction Announcement with respect to this Agreement, the Other Transaction Agreements and the Transactions (or the portion thereof relating to this Agreement, the Other Transaction Agreements and the Transactions) without the prior approval of the other Party, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as such Party determines in good faith may be required by Law in connection with actions taken pursuant to  _Section 4.10_ hereof or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange. Except as Parent determines in good faith to be required by Law, in the event Parent elects to pursue the Exchange Offer, Parent will not publish any press release or publish any other public statement announcing the terms of the Exchange Offer prior to the commencement of the Exchange Offer. 

  

 4.04 __Notification of Certain Matters__. (a) Each of Parent and Acquiror will give prompt written notice to the other of (i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the Consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, (ii) any Action commenced or threatened in writing against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting it or any of its Subsidiaries that relate to the consummation of the Transactions, and (iii) any change that is reasonably expected to 

   ##### 

  

 

have, individually or in the aggregate, a Snacks Business MAE or reasonably
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an Acquiror MAE, as the
case may be. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Closing, Parent may deliver to Acquiror supplements or updates to the sections of the Parent Disclosure Letter and the Schedules attached to the forms of TSA and Facilities Agreement which this Agreement, the Separation Agreement or the Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, explicitly provides may be supplemented or updated; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such supplement or update will be considered for purposes of determining whether the condition set forth in _Section 5.02(c)_ has been satisfied. 

   

 4.05 __Financial Statements__. (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, and using reasonable best efforts to do so, Parent will provide Acquiror with (i) the audited combined financial statements of the Snacks Business, including the combined balance sheets of the Snacks Business as of June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2010, and the combined statements of income, equity and cash flows of the Snacks Business for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008, June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2010 (collectively, the " _Audited Financial Statements_ "), (ii) the unaudited combined statements of income, equity and cash flows of the Snacks Business for the six-month periods ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, and (iii) the unaudited combined balance sheet of the Snacks Business as of December 31, 2010, in each case together with the notes thereto, prepared in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and the rules and regulations of the Commission and which present fairly in all material respects the combined financial position and combined results of operations of the Snacks Business as of and for the periods shown therein. 

  

 (b) Parent will prepare and furnish to Acquiror copies of combined financial statements of the Snacks Business as of and for the periods ending March 31, 2011, June 30, 2011 and any subsequent fiscal periods for which financial statements are required to be included in the documents referred to in _Section 4.08_ prepared in accordance with GAAP and the rules and regulations of the Commission and, in the case of the combined financial statements of the Snacks Business as of and for the year ending June 30, 2011, will be accompanied by a report of the independent accountants for the Snacks Business. Parent acknowledges that Acquirors ability to comply with its obligations under _Section 4.08_ depend, in part, on Parents timely compliance with this _ Section 4.05_, and therefore Acquiror will be afforded a reasonable period to comply with such obligations based upon the timing of Parent providing the financial statements herein contemplated. 

   

 4.06 __Conduct of Acquiror Pending The Closing__. (a) Except as contemplated by this Agreement or any Other Transaction Agreement and except as set forth in _Section 4.06_ of the Acquiror Disclosure Letter, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries will conduct their respective operations in all material respects only according to the ordinary and usual course of business consistent in all material respects with past practice (except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement or as consented to in writing by Acquiror). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries will take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or fail to cause any action to be taken, which action or failure to act could (i) cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code or (ii) cause (x) gain or loss to be recognized by the Parent shareholders in connection with the Distribution or (y) gain or loss to be recognized by Parent in connection with the Distribution. For the avoidance of doubt, this  _Section 4.06(b)_ will not be deemed to require Acquiror to obtain a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service in respect of the Tax treatment to be accorded to the Transactions, and the Parties acknowledge that no such private letter ruling is contemplated to be obtained in connection herewith. 

   

 (c) Without limiting the generality of _Sections 4.06(a)_ and _4.06(b)_ , and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, required by Law or set forth on _Section 4.06_ of the Acquiror Disclosure Letter, before the Closing, Acquiror will not, without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent will, in the case of clauses (iv) and (v) below and in the case of clause (vi) insofar as it relates to clauses (iv) and (v), not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), nor will it permit any of its Subsidiaries to: 

   

 (i) amend or otherwise change its articles of incorporation or bylaws, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 (ii) declare, set aside, make or pay any dividends or other distribution, payable in cash, stock, property or otherwise, with respect to any of its capital stock (other than (x) regular quarterly cash dividends not in excess of $0.05 per share of Acquiror Common Stock declared and paid in the ordinary course and consistent with past practice, (y) dividends payable by a wholly owned Subsidiary of Acquiror to Acquiror or another wholly owned Subsidiary), enter any agreement with respect to the voting of its capital stock or purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any Acquiror Equity Interests and (z) repurchases of shares of Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to restricted stock purchase agreements or stock option exercise agreements under which Acquiror has the right to repurchase such shares; 

  

 (iii) reclassify, combine, split or subdivide, directly or indirectly, any of its capital stock, or issue or authorize the issuance of any shares of Acquiror Common Stock or any other Acquiror Equity Interests, other than in connection with the exercise of currently outstanding stock options and equity awards under existing Acquiror Compensation And Benefit Plans or the grant of new equity awards to service providers of Acquiror in an amount not to exceed 1,000,000 shares of Acquiror Common Stock in the aggregate; 

  

 (iv) sell, pledge, dispose of, grant, transfer, lease, license, guarantee, encumber or authorize the sale, pledge, disposition, grant, transfer, lease, guarantee or encumbrance of any assets, other than (x) in the ordinary course of business and consistent in all material respects with past practice or (y) not in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice but not in excess of

any refinancing thereof; 

   

 (v) (A) other than (x) in the ordinary course of business in a manner consistent in all material respects with past practice, or (y) not in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice but not in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate after the date of this Agreement, acquire (including by merger, consolidation, or acquisition of stock or assets) any interest in any Person or any division thereof or any assets; or (B) incur any indebtedness for borrowed money or issue any debt securities or assume, guarantee or endorse, or otherwise as an accommodation become responsible for, the obligations of any Person for borrowed money, except for (1) indebtedness for borrowed money incurred in the ordinary course of business or in connection with transactions otherwise permitted by this Agreement or any Other Transaction Agreement, (2) indebtedness incurred to refinance any existing indebtedness, or (3) other indebtedness for borrowed money under existing credit facilities;

 (vii) agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any of the foregoing actions. 

  

 4.07 __Access; Permits__. (a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by Law, each of Parent and Acquiror will allow all designated officers, attorneys, accountants and other representatives of Parent or Acquiror, as the case may be, access at reasonable times upon reasonable notice and in a manner as will not adversely impact the conduct of the business of either Party or the Snacks Business to the personnel, records files, correspondence, audits and properties, as well as to all information relating to commitments, contracts, coupon activities, promotional programs, titles and financial position, or otherwise pertaining to the business and affairs of the Snacks Business and Acquiror and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, including as to matters that might arise outside the ordinary course of business;  _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that (i) no investigation pursuant to this _Section 4.07_ will affect any representation or warranty given by any Party hereunder and (ii) that notwithstanding the provision of information or investigation by any Party, no Party will be deemed to make any representation or warranty except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) no Party will be required to provide any information which it determines in good faith it may not provide to the other Party by reason of applicable Law (including any information in confidential personnel files), which such Party determines in good faith constitutes information protected by attorney/client privilege or which it is required to keep confidential by reason of Contracts with third 

   ##### 

  

  

parties, (B) Parent will not be required to provide access to any performance
review materials or any information from personnel files that relates to an
employees participation in bonus plans and similar incentive compensation
arrangements (other than individual bonus opportunities based on target bonus

access to any of its properties if such access results in damage to such
property or if such access is for the purpose of performing any onsite
procedure or investigation (including any Phase II or other onsite
environmental investigation or study), without that Partys written consent,
which the Party may grant or deny in its sole discretion; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Parties will reasonably cooperate to permit Acquiror to
conduct a Phase I environmental review of the Owned Real Property. The
Parties will make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions in clauses (A)
through (C) of the preceding sentence apply. Each of Parent and Acquiror
agrees that it will not, and will cause its respective Representatives not
to, use any information obtained pursuant to this _Section 4.07_ for
any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the Transactions. All
information provided by a Party to the other Party hereunder will be kept
confidential to the same extent as would be applicable if the Confidentiality
Agreements were in effect. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Closing, Parent and Acquiror will cooperate in good faith to identify all material Permits required to operate the Snacks Business as currently conducted. To the extent any Permit so identified is not exclusive to the Snacks Business, and solely to the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent will provide Acquiror with reasonable cooperation and assistance in Acquirors efforts to obtain replacement Permits. 

   

 4.08 __Preparation of SEC Filings__. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, to the extent such filings are required by applicable Law, Parent and Acquiror will jointly prepare, and (i) Acquiror will file with the Commission a registration statement on Form S-4 (the " _Acquiror Form S-4_") to register the shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued in the Merger, and a proxy statement (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the Acquiror Stockholder Approval (which Proxy Statement will be included in the Acquiror Form S-4), (ii) Wimbledon will file with the Commission a registration statement on Form 10 or Form S-1, as applicable, and/or a registration statement on Form S-4 (the " _Wimbledon Form S-1/S-4_ ") to register the shares of Wimbledon Common Stock to be distributed in the Distribution, (iii) after the Acquiror Form S-4 and the Wimbledon Form S-1/S-4 have been declared effective, Parent will file with the Commission a Schedule TO (the " _Schedule TO_") if Parent elects to effect the Distribution in whole or in part by means of an Exchange Offer, and (iv) the Parties will file such other appropriate documents as may be applicable. Each of Parent and Acquiror will use their best efforts to have the Wimbledon Form S-1/S-4, the Acquiror Form S-4 and other registration statements as may be required declared effective under the Exchange Act or Securities Act, as applicable, as promptly as practicable after such filing. Acquiror will use its best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to Acquirors stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Wimbledon Form S-1/S-4 and the Acquiror Form S-4 are declared effective under the Securities Act. Each of Acquiror and Parent will also take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any 

   ##### 

  

 

jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified) required to be taken under
any applicable state securities Laws in connection with, in the case of
Acquiror, the issuance of Acquiror Common Stock in the Wimbledon Merger and,
in the case of Parent, the issuance of Wimbledon Common Stock in the
Distribution. Parent will furnish all information concerning Parent and
Wimbledon, and Acquiror will furnish all information concerning Acquiror and
Merger Sub, as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action
and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement, the
Acquiror Form S-4, the Wimbledon Form S-1/S-4 and the Schedule TO. No filing
of, or amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Acquiror Form
S-4 will be made by Acquiror, no filing of, or amendment or supplement to,
the Wimbledon Form S-1/S-4 will be made by Wimbledon and no filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Schedule TO will be made by Parent, in each
case without providing the other Parties a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment thereon. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to Parent or Acquiror or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by Parent or Acquiror
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Proxy
Statement, the Acquiror Form S-4, the Wimbledon Form S-1/S-4 or the Schedule
TO, so that any such document would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party which discovers such information will promptly
notify the other Parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information will be promptly filed with the Commission and, to
the extent required by Law, disseminated to the applicable stockholders. The
Parties will notify each other promptly of the receipt of any comments from
the Commission or its staff and of any request by the Commission or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, the Acquiror Form S-4,
the Wimbledon Form S-1/S-4 or the Schedule TO or for additional information
and will supply each other with copies of all correspondence between it or
any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the Commission or its staff,
on the other hand, with respect thereto and will respond as promptly as
practicable to any such comments or requests. 

   

 4.09 __Acquiror Stockholder Meeting__. Following the date of this Agreement, in compliance with applicable Law, Acquiror and Parent will, acting in good faith, mutually agree upon a meeting date and record date for a meeting of the Acquiror Stockholders, and Acquiror will establish such record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold such meeting of the Acquiror Stockholders (the " _Acquiror Stockholder Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the Acquiror Stockholder Approval. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge that Acquiror may also propose for consideration at the Acquiror Stockholder Meeting the election of directors, an increase in the authorized number of shares reserved under Acquirors 2005 Equity Incentive Plan or an increase in authorized common stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) Acquirors obligations under this Agreement or any Other Transaction Agreement will not be subject to stockholder approval of any such other matter and (b) Acquiror will not postpone the Acquiror Stockholder Meeting to solicit proxies for any matter other than obtaining the Acquiror Stockholder Approval. Acquiror may adjourn or postpone the Acquiror Stockholder Meeting (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement that it determines in good faith is required by Law (which determination 

   ##### 

  

 

will not be made until after consultation with Parent, except with respect to
any Acquisition Takeover Proposal or as otherwise provided in _Section
4.10_) to be provided to the Acquiror Stockholders in advance of the Acquiror
Stockholder Meeting, (ii) if, as of the time that the Acquiror Stockholder
Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of
Acquiror Common Stock represented (either in person or proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Acquiror Stockholder Meeting,
or (iii) if, as of the time that the Acquiror Stockholder Meeting is
originally scheduled, adjournment of the Acquiror Stockholder Meeting
is necessary to enable Acquiror to solicit additional proxies if there are
not sufficient votes in favor of the Acquiror Stockholder Approval. Subject
to _Section 4.10_, Acquiror will, through its Board of Directors, recommend
to its stockholders that they give Acquiror Stockholder Approval and will
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Acquiror agrees that its obligations
pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 4.09_ will not be affected
by (A) the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication
to Acquiror of any Acquiror Takeover Proposal or (B) the withdrawal
or modification by the Board of Directors of Acquiror of its approval or

 (i) if Parent or Wimbledon breaches any of its representations and warranties or covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Article V_ and (B) cannot be or has not been cured within 60 days after the giving of written notice to Parent of such breach; or 

  

 (ii) if any of the conditions set forth in _Section 5.01_ or _Section 5.02_ become incapable of fulfillment, and have not been waived by Acquiror; 

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the Party seeking termination pursuant to
clauses  _(c)(i)_ , _(c)(ii)_ , _(d)(i)_ , or _(d)(ii)_ is not in material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned as described in this _Article VI_, this Agreement will become void and of no further force and effect, except for the provisions of this _Section 6.03_ and _Article VII_ (other than _Section 7.12_ which will terminate with the other provisions of this Agreement except as specifically provided herein) containing general provisions. Nothing in this _Article VI_ will be deemed to release any Party from any Liability for any knowing breach by such Party of any representation or warranty in this Agreement or the Separation Agreement, or any deliberate breach of any covenant herein or therein, or to impair the right of any Party to compel specific performance by another Party of its obligations under this Agreement or the Separation Agreement (whether or not the breach was willful or deliberate) that specifically survive such termination as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. For the avoidance of doubt, receipt by Parent of a payment in accordance with the terms of _Section 6.03(b)_ in circumstances in which Parent terminates this Agreement will be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent or any other Person in connection the matters forming the basis for such termination, and Parent will not be entitled to bring or maintain further claim, action or proceeding against Acquiror or any of its Affiliates arising out of such matters; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.01(c)(iv)_, Parent will have the right to sue for damages arising out of Acquirors deliberate breach of _Section 4.10_ in lieu of payment of the Break-Up Fee and reimbursement of the Certified Parent Expenses pursuant to  _Section 6.03(b)_ and (ii) nothing herein or in any Other Transaction Agreement will limit a Partys rights under _Section 7.12_. For purposes of _Sections 6.01(c)(iv)_ and  _6.03(a)_ , (A) a "knowing" breach of a representation and warranty will be deemed to have occurred only if an executive officer of the Party alleged to have breached the representation or warranty had actual knowledge of such breach as of the date hereof (without any independent duty of investigation or verification other than that such executive officer has made inquiry that such representations and warranties were made in good faith), (B) a "deliberate" breach of any covenant will be deemed to have occurred only if the Party allegedly breaching the covenant took or failed to take action with actual knowledge that the action so taken or omitted to be taken constituted a breach of such covenant, and (C) the term "executive officer" will have the meaning given to the term "officer" in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act. 

   

 (b) Acquiror will pay to Parent: 

   

 (i) if (A) either Party terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.01(b)(i_), (B) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to any such termination, an Acquiror Takeover Proposal with respect to Acquiror shall have been publicly announced, publicly proposed or commenced (provided that for purposes of determining whether an Acquiror Takeover Proposal exists under this clause (i), the references in the definition of such term to "15%" and "85%" will be deemed to be "50%"), and (C) within 12 months after the date of such termination, (1) an Acquiror

 (iii) the Break-up Fee plus the Certified Parent Expenses, which amounts Acquiror must pay to Parent if Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Sections 6.01(c)(iii)_ or  _6.01(c)(iv)_ , promptly following such termination. 

 

Any fee due under this _Section 6.03(b)_ will be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (to an account specified by Parent). The fee
described in clause (iii) will be paid by Acquiror promptly following
termination of this Agreement. The fees described in clauses (i) and (ii)
will be paid by Acquiror at or before entering into the agreement relating to
an Acquiror Acquisition described therein. If Acquiror makes a payment to
Parent pursuant to  _Sections 6.03(b)(i)_, _6.03(b)(ii)_ or _6.03(b)(iii)_ ,
it will not be obligated to make any subsequent payment under the other
subsections of _Section 6.03(b)_ as applicable. Upon payment of the
termination fees in accordance with this _Section 6.03(b)_, Acquiror will
have no further Liability to Parent at Law or in equity under this Agreement
except as set forth in _Section 6.03(a)_.

respect to such claims (net of expenses incurred by Parent or Acquiror, as
applicable, in connection therewith) may, in Parents or Acquirors, as

 7.09 __Construction__. The descriptive headings herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a substantive part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever required by the context, any pronoun used in this Agreement or the Parent Disclosure Letter or Acquiror Disclosure Letter will include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular forms of nouns, pronouns, and verbs will include the plural and vice versa. Reference to any agreement, document, or instrument means such agreement, document, or instrument as amended or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof, and if applicable hereof. The use of the words "include" or "including" in this Agreement or the Parent Disclosure Letter or Acquiror Disclosure Letter will be by way of example rather than by limitation. The use of the words "or," "either" or "any" will not be exclusive. The use of the words "deliver," "furnish," "made available" or "provide" will mean that with respect to Parent or its Representatives that such documents or information referenced shall have been delivered to Parent or its Representatives or contained in the electronic data room maintained by Fenwick and West LLP and with respect to Acquiror or its Representatives that such documents or information referenced shall have been delivered to Acquiror or its Representatives or contained in the electronic data room maintained by Intralinks, Inc. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the Other Transaction Agreements. In the event an ambiguity    

     ##### 

  

  

 or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be
construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or
burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Except as otherwise
expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement or any Other Transaction
Agreement, any provision herein which contemplates the agreement, approval or
consent of, or exercise of any right of, a Party, such Party may give or
withhold such agreement, approval or consent, or exercise such right, in its
sole and absolute discretion, the Parties hereby expressly disclaiming any
implied duty of good faith and fair dealing or similar concept. 

   

 7.10 __Severability__. The Parties agree that (a) the provisions of this Agreement will be severable in the event that for any reason whatsoever any of the provisions hereof are invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, (b) any such invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable provisions will be replaced by other provisions which are as similar as possible in terms to such invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable provisions but are valid and enforceable, and (c) the remaining provisions will remain valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. 

  

 7.11 __Counterparts__. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts (any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than one Party), each of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together will constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement, and any amendments hereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or other electronic transmission, will be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement and will be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any Party, the other Party will re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to the requesting Party. No Party will raise the use of a facsimile machine or other electronic means to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine or other electronic means as a defense to the formation of a Contract and each such Party forever waives any such defense. 

  

 7.12 __Specific Performance__. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the Parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. 

   

 7.13 __Disclosure Letters__. There may be included in the Parent Disclosure Letter and/or the Acquiror Disclosure Letter items and information that are not "material," and such inclusion will not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or agreement that any such item or information (or any non-disclosed item or information of comparable or greater significance) is "material," or to affect the interpretation of such term for purposes of this Agreement. Matters reflected in the Parent Disclosure Letter and Acquiror Disclosure Letter are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be disclosed therein. The Parent  Disclosure Letter and Acquiror   

   ##### 

  

  

Disclosure Letter set forth items of disclosure with specific reference to the
particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information
in the Parent Disclosure Letter and Acquiror Disclosure Letter, as

in one Section of such disclosure letter will be deemed to apply to
each other Section or subsection thereof to which its relevance is reasonably
apparent on its face. 

  

 7.14 __Waiver__. Acquiror acknowledges, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that Jones Day has represented, is representing and will continue to represent Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Other Transaction Agreements, and that Jones Day will only represent the interests of Parent in connection with such transactions. Acquiror waives, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, any conflict of interest that it or they may assert against Jones Day in connection with such representation and agrees not to challenge Jones Days representation of Parent with respect to such transactions or to assert that a conflict of interest exists with respect to such representation. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Acquiror agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that Jones Day may represent Parent in any litigation, arbitration, mediation or other Action against or involving Acquiror and/or any of its Affiliates, arising out of or in connection with such transactions.
