</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Transaction Agreement (this &#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;), dated as of April&nbsp;5, 2011, is among The
Procter &#038; Gamble Company, an Ohio corporation (&#147;<U>Parent</U>&#148;), The Wimble Company, a Delaware
corporation and presently a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (&#147;<U>Wimbledon</U>&#148;), Diamond Foods,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>Acquiror</U>&#148;), and Wimbledon Acquisition LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of Acquiror (&#147;<U>Merger Sub</U>&#148;).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Parent is engaged, directly and indirectly, in the Snacks Business;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Parent has determined that it would be appropriate and desirable to separate the Snacks
Business from Parent and to divest the Snacks Business in the manner contemplated hereby;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;The Parties contemplate that the Snacks Business will be transferred to Wimbledon as
provided in the Separation Agreement and, in connection therewith, the Recapitalization will take
place, including Wimbledon&#146;s payment of the Recapitalization Amount;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;The Parties contemplate that, immediately following the Wimbledon Transfer and
Recapitalization, Parent will either (i)&nbsp;distribute all of the shares of Wimbledon Common Stock to
Parent shareholders without consideration on a pro rata basis (a &#147;<U>One-Step Spin-Off</U>&#148;) or
(ii)&nbsp;consummate an offer to exchange (an &#147;<U>Exchange Offer</U>&#148;) shares of Wimbledon Common Stock
for currently outstanding shares of Parent&#146;s common stock (&#147;<U>Parent Common Stock</U>&#148;) and, in
the event that Parent&#146;s shareholders subscribe for less than all of the Wimbledon Common Stock in
the Exchange Offer, Parent will distribute, <I>pro rata </I>to its shareholders, any unsubscribed
Wimbledon Common Stock on the Distribution Date immediately following the consummation of the
Exchange Offer so that Parent will be treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as having
distributed all of the Wimbledon Common Stock to its shareholders (the &#147;<U>Clean-Up
Spin-Off</U>&#148;);
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;The disposition by Parent of 100% of the Wimbledon Common Stock, whether by way of the
One-Step Spin-Off or the Exchange Offer (followed by any Clean-Up Spin-Off) is referred to herein
as the &#147;<U>Distribution</U>;&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;The Boards of Directors of Parent, Wimbledon and Acquiror and the Board of Managers of
Merger Sub have each approved and declared advisable the Merger of Wimbledon with and into Merger
Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity in the Merger, such Merger to take place
immediately following the Distribution, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL and the DLLCA;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Pursuant to the plan of reorganization and as soon as practicable following the
Distribution Date, Parent will effect the Parent Cash Distribution to Parent&#146;s

occurred only if an executive officer of the Party alleged to have breached the representation or
warranty had actual knowledge of such breach as of the date hereof (without any independent duty of
investigation or verification other than that such executive officer has made inquiry that such
representations and warranties were made in good faith), (B)&nbsp;a &#147;deliberate&#148; breach of any covenant
