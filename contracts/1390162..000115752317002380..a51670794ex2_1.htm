immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _First Mariner Warrant_ ") shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive from Howard a cash payment
equal to the difference, if positive, between the Per Share Cash Amount and
the exercise price of such First Mariner Warrant. Any First Mariner Warrant
with an exercise price that equals or exceeds the Per Share Cash Amount shall
be canceled and extinguished at the Effective Time with no consideration being
paid to the holder of such First Mariner Warrant with respect to such First
Mariner Warrant. Howard shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the

No certificate, book-entry share or scrip representing fractional shares of
Howard Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, no dividend or distribution of Howard shall relate to such
fractional share interests, and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Howard.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of First Mariner Common Stock or First Mariner Series A Preferred Stock
exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Howard Common Stock (after taking into
account all certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash rounded up to the nearest cent (without interest) in an amount
equal to such fractional part of a share of Howard Common Stock that such
holder of shares of First Mariner Common Stock or First Mariner Series A
Preferred Stock would otherwise have been entitled multiplied by the Per Share
Cash Consideration. No such holder will be entitled to dividends, voting
rights, or any other rights as a stockholder in respect of any fractional
shares.

  

  

ARTICLE 3 
  EXCHANGE OF SHARES

  

  

    

3.1

  |  

Exchange Procedures.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

(a) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or promptly following the Effective
Time, Howard shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
Computershare, Inc., or another exchange agent reasonably acceptable to First
Mariner (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the benefit of the holders of record of
shares of First Mariner Common Stock and First Mariner Series A Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Holders_ "), for exchange in accordance with this Article 3, (i) evidence of
Howard Common Stock in book-entry form issuable pursuant to Section Article
2(c) and Section Article 2(d) (collectively referred to as " _Howard
Certificates_ ") for shares of Howard Common Stock equal to the aggregate
Merger Consideration to be issued to holders of First Mariner Common Stock and
First Mariner Series A Preferred Stock and (ii) immediately available funds
equal to, to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.13 (collectively, the " _Exchange
Fund_ ") and Howard shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares, in accordance with this
Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
Exchange Agent as directed by Howard or the Surviving Bank. Interest and other
income on the Exchange Fund shall be the sole and exclusive property of Howard
and the Surviving Bank and shall be paid to Howard or the Surviving Bank, as
Howard directs. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Howard, the
Surviving Bank or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this
Article 3 and following any losses from any such investment, Howard shall
promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent to the extent
necessary to satisfy Howard's obligations hereunder for the benefit of the
Holders, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange
Fund.

  

 

5  

  

(b) _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each Holder of
record of a Certificate a notice advising such Holders of the effectiveness of
the Merger, including appropriate transmittal materials specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates and instructions for
surrendering the Certificates to the Exchange Agent (such materials and
instructions to include customary provisions with respect to delivery of an
"agent's message" with respect to Certificates that are book-entry shares).
Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with the appropriate transmittal materials, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
Holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such
Holder has a right to receive pursuant to Section 1.13 and any dividends or
distributions which such Holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
3.1(d) with respect to the shares of First Mariner Common Stock and First
Mariner Series A Preferred Stock formerly represented by such Certificate and
such Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will
be paid or accrued for the benefit of Holders of the Certificates on the
Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates. Unless
otherwise agreed to by Howard, the portion of the Howard Certificates
delivered to each Holder shall be in book-entry form.

  

  

(c) _Share Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of
First Mariner shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of First Mariner Common Stock or First
Mariner Series A Preferred Stock. From and after the Effective Time, Holders
who held shares of First Mariner Common Stock or First Mariner Series A
Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein.
Until surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of this
Article 3, each Certificate theretofore representing shares of First Mariner
Common Stock or First Mariner Series A Preferred Stock (other than the
Canceled Shares) shall from and after the Effective Time represent for all
purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
Article 3, including the right, if any, to receive pursuant to Section 1.13,
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Howard Common Stock into which such
shares of First Mariner Common Stock and First Mariner Series A Preferred
Stock have been converted together with the amounts, if any, payable pursuant
to Section Article 3(d). On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Exchange Agent, Howard or the Surviving Bank for any reason
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares (if any) pursuant to Section 1.13 and any dividends or
distributions (if any) pursuant to Section Article 3(d) with respect to the
shares of First Mariner Common Stock and First Mariner Series A Preferred
Stock formerly represented thereby.

  

  

(d) _Dividends with Respect to Howard Common Stock_. No dividends or other
distributions declared with respect to Howard Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the whole shares of Howard Common Stock issuable
with respect to such Certificate in accordance with this Agreement until the
surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in
accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) there
shall be paid to the record holder of the whole shares of Howard Common Stock,
if any, issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) all dividends and
other distributions payable in respect of any such whole shares of Howard
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on
or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid to the
applicable holder and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such shares of Howard Common Stock.

  

 

6  

  

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) which
remains undistributed to the former Holders on the first anniversary of the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Howard, and any former Holders who have
not theretofore received any Merger Consideration (including any cash in lieu
of fractional shares and any applicable dividends or other distributions with
respect to Howard Common Stock) to which they are entitled under this Article
3 shall thereafter look only to Howard and the Surviving Bank for payment of
their claims with respect thereto.

  

  

(f) _No Liability_. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior
to three years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which the Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the property
of any Regulatory Authority), any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Howard, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto or their successors, assigns, or personal representatives.
None of Howard, First Mariner, the Surviving Bank or the Exchange Agent, or
any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate of any of them, shall be
liable to any Holder in respect of any cash that would have otherwise been
payable in respect of any Certificate from the Exchange Fund delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  

  

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each and any of Howard, the Surviving Bank or the
Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the Merger Consideration and any other amounts or property otherwise payable
or distributable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts or
property (or portions thereof) as Howard, the Surviving Bank or the Exchange
Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment or distribution under the Code, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Regulatory Authority by Howard, the Surviving Bank, or the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by Howard, the Surviving Bank, or the Exchange Agent,
as applicable.

  

  

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Howard, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary
amount as Howard may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article
3.

  

  

(i) _Change in Name on Certificate_. If any Howard Certificate representing
shares of Howard Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in
which the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered,
it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that
the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance
any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
Howard Certificate representing shares of Howard Common Stock in any name
other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or
required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

Dissenting Stockholders.

(j) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
First Mariner Common Stock and First Mariner Series A Preferred Stock that are
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are
held by any Holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of
such shares of First Mariner Common Stock or First Mariner Series A Preferred
Stock pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Sections 3-718, 3-719 and 3-720 of the MCFI, shall not be converted into or be
exchangeable for the right to receive any of the consideration as specified in
Article 2 (the " _First Mariner Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such Holder
shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such First Mariner
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Sections 3-718, 3-719
and 3-720 of the MCFI. At the Effective Time, all First Mariner Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each Holder of First Mariner Dissenting
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the fair value of such First Mariner Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Sections 3-718, 3-719 and 3-720 of the MCFI.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such Holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Sections
3-718, 3-719 and 3-720 of the MCFI, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such Holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Sections
3-718, 3-719 and 3-720, then the right of such Holder to be paid the fair
value of such Holder's First Mariner Dissenting Shares under Sections 3-718,
3-719 and 3-720 of the MCFI shall cease and such First Mariner Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and
shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
in Section Article 2(c) of this Agreement, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares (if any) pursuant to Section 1.13 and any dividends or distributions
(if any) pursuant to Section Article 3(d).

  

  

(k) First Mariner shall give Howard prompt written notice (but in any event
within 24 hours) to Howard of any demands for appraisal of any shares of First
Mariner Common Stock or First Mariner Series A Preferred Stock and any
withdrawals of such demands, and Howard shall have the right to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
First Mariner shall not, except with the prior written consent of Howard,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to
settle, any such demand for payment.

  

  

(l) Howard, as the sole stockholder of Howard Bank, affirmatively waives its
rights of appraisal or any dissenters' rights that Howard may have (whether
under the MCFI, MGCL or otherwise) or could potentially have or acquire in
connection with the Merger.

paid all accrued salaries, wages, bonuses, commissions, incentives and other
cash compensation due to be paid through the date hereof. Each of the First
Mariner Entities is and at all times has been in material compliance with all
material Laws governing the employment of labor and the withholding of taxes,
including but not limited to, all contractual commitments and all such Laws
relating to wages, hours, affirmative action, collective bargaining,
discrimination, civil rights, disability accommodation, employee leave, safety
and health, workers' compensation, unemployment and the collection and payment
of withholding and/or Social Security Taxes and similar Taxes.

  

  

(uu) There have not been any wage and hour, discrimination, disability
accommodation, or other employment claims or charges by any employee of any
First Mariner Entity since December 31, 2012, nor, to First Mariner's
Knowledge, are there any such claims or charges currently threatened by any
employee of any First Mariner Entity. Except for claims for benefits in the
Ordinary Course under a First Mariner Benefit Plan, there have not been any
proceedings by any employee of any First Mariner Entity related to their
employment with such First Mariner Entity since December 31, 2012, nor, to the
Knowledge of First Mariner, are there any proceedings currently threatened by
any employee of any First Mariner Entity related to their employment with such
First Mariner Entity. To the Knowledge of First Mariner, there are no
governmental investigations open with or under consideration by the Department
of Labor, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Office of Federal Contract
Compliance Programs or any other federal or state governmental body charged
with administering or enforcing employment related laws or regulations.

  

  

(vv) All of the First Mariner Entities' employees are employed in the United
States and are either United States citizens or are legally entitled to work
in the United States under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, as
amended, other United States immigration Laws and the Laws related to the
employment of non-United States citizens applicable in the state in which the
employees are employed. Each individual who renders services to any First
Mariner Entity has provided proof of employment eligibility and is properly
classified by First Mariner as having the status of an employee or Contractor
or other non-employee status (including for purposes of taxation and Tax
reporting and under First Mariner Benefit Plans).

Employee Benefit Plans.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

(ww) First Mariner has made available to Howard prior to the execution of this
Agreement, true and correct copies of each Employee Benefit Plan currently
adopted (including all amendments thereto), maintained by, sponsored in whole
or in part by, or contributed to by any First Mariner Entity or ERISA
Affiliate thereof for the benefit of its or their employees, retirees,
directors, independent contractors, or their dependents, spouses, or other
beneficiaries or under which its or their employees, retirees, former
employees, directors, independent contractors, or their dependents, spouses or
other beneficiaries are eligible to participate or with respect to which First
Mariner or any ERISA Affiliate has or may have any obligation or Liability
(collectively, the " _First Mariner Benefit Plans_ "). Section Article 4(ww)
of First Mariner's Disclosure Memorandum has a complete and accurate list of
all First Mariner Benefit Plans. No First Mariner Benefit Plan is subject to
any Laws other than those of the United States or any state, county, or
municipality in the United States.

  

  

(xx) First Mariner has made available to Howard prior to the execution of this
Agreement (i) all trust agreements or other funding arrangements currently in
effect for all First Mariner Benefit Plans, (ii) the most recent
determination, opinion or advisory letter from the United States Internal
Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") as to the qualification under Section 401(a) of
the Code as to any Employee Benefit Plan intended to meet the qualification
requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code and all other determination
letters, opinion letters, information letters or advisory opinions currently
in effect issued by the IRS, the United States Department of Labor (" _DOL_ ")
or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") with respect to a
First Mariner Benefit Plan, (iii) annual reports or returns on Form 5500,
audited or unaudited financial statements, actuarial reports, non-
discrimination tests and valuations, if any, prepared for any First Mariner
Benefit Plan for the current plan year and the preceding plan year, (iv) the
most recent summary plan descriptions and any material modifications thereto
for any First Mariner Benefit Plan, and (v) any correspondence with the DOL,
IRS, PBGC, or any other governmental entity regarding an audit investigation
or correction filing with respect to a First Mariner Benefit Plan since
January 1, 2013.

  

  

(yy) Each First Mariner Benefit Plan is and has been maintained in material
compliance with the terms of such First Mariner Benefit Plan, and in material
compliance with the applicable requirements of the Code, ERISA, and any other
applicable Laws. Each First Mariner Benefit Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has received a
favorable determination letter, or for a prototype or volume submitter plan,
opinion letter, from the IRS that is still in effect and applies to the First
Mariner Benefit Plan and on which such First Mariner Benefit Plan is entitled
to rely. Nothing has occurred and no circumstance exists that could reasonably
be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of such First Mariner
Benefit Plan. The treatment of the First Mariner Stock Options as required
under Section 1.11 of this Agreement is permitted by applicable Law and the
terms of the applicable plan and award agreement.

  

  

(zz) There are no threatened or pending claims or disputes under the terms of,
or in connection with, the First Mariner Benefit Plans other than claims for
benefits in the Ordinary Course, and no action, proceeding, prosecution,
inquiry, hearing or investigation has been commenced that remain outstanding
other than such routine claims in the Ordinary Course with respect to any
First Mariner Benefit Plan.

  

  

(aaa) Neither First Mariner nor any First Mariner Entity has engaged in any
prohibited transaction under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA
for which there is not an exemption available, within the meaning of Section
4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, with respect to any First Mariner
Benefit Plan and no such prohibited transaction has occurred with respect to
any First Mariner Benefit Plan that would be reasonably expected to result in
any material liability or excise Tax under ERISA or the Code. Neither First
Mariner, any First Mariner Entity, nor any committee of which any First
Mariner Entity employee is a member has breached its fiduciary duty with
respect to a First Mariner Benefit Plan in connection with any acts taken (or
failed to be taken) with respect to the administration or investment of the
assets of any First Mariner Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to
result in any material liability or excise Tax under ERISA or the Code being
imposed. To First Mariner's Knowledge, no other fiduciary, within the meaning
of Section 3(21) of ERISA, has breached its, his or her fiduciary duty with
respect to a First Mariner Benefit Plan or otherwise has any liability in
connection with any acts taken (or failed to be taken) with respect to the
administration or investment of the assets of any First Mariner Benefit Plan
that would reasonably be expected to result in any material liability or
excise Tax under ERISA or the Code being imposed.

  

 

21  

  

(bbb) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is a health plan has been amended and
administered in all material respects in accordance with the requirements of
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The First Mariner
Entities maintain a health plan or plans that satisfies the requirements for
"minimum essential coverage" under Section 4980H(a) of the Code (as applicable
to "applicable large employers" within the meaning of Section 4980H(a) of the
Code, without regard to whether any such First Mariner Entity is an
"applicable large employer"), which minimum essential coverage satisfies an
affordability safe harbor under Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980H-5 and
provides "minimum value" as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
54.4980H-1(a)(28), and the First Mariner Entities have offered such minimum
essential coverage to all "full-time employees" (within the meaning of Section
4980H of the Code) and their dependents to the extent required under Section
4980H of the Code and the regulations thereunder. None of the First Mariner
Entities have or could reasonably be expected to have any material liability
for Taxes under Sections 4975 through 4980 or Sections 4980C through 4980I of
the Code.

  

  

(ccc) Each First Mariner Benefit Plan, employment agreement, or other
compensation arrangement of First Mariner that constitutes a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" subject to Section 409A of the Code has been
written, executed, and operated in compliance with Section 409A of the Code
and the regulations thereunder. Neither First Mariner nor any ERISA Affiliate
has at any time within the last six years, been a party to or maintained,
sponsored, contributed to or has been obligated to contribute to, or had any
liability with respect to, nor could First Mariner or any ERISA Affiliate
reasonably be expected to have any liability with respect to such arrangement
in existence prior to such six year period, (i) any plan subject to Title IV
of ERISA, including a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in ERISA Section 3(37)
and 4001(a)(3)); (ii) a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of ERISA
or the Code); (iii) a self-funded health or welfare benefit plan, within the
meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA (other than a medical expense reimbursement
account); (iv) any voluntary employees' beneficiary association (within the
meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code); or (v) an arrangement that is not
either exempt from, otherwise not subject to or in compliance with, Section
409A of the Code or that provides for indemnification for or gross-up of any
taxes thereunder. All First Mariner Stock Options, and any other stock options
granted by a First Mariner Entity and outstanding at any time within the last
three years, were granted at no less than "fair market value" for purposes of
Section 409A of the Code, and each such stock option has at all times been
exempt from Section 409A of the Code. First Mariner has made available to
Howard prior to the execution of this Agreement a true and complete copy of
the most recently available actuarial valuation and the most recent statement
of assets for each of the First Mariner Benefit Plans that is subject to Title
IV of ERISA. Each of the First Mariner Benefit Plans that is subject to Title
IV of ERISA is fully funded on a termination basis and can be terminated
immediately after Closing without the need for any additional funding or other
costs.

  

  

(ddd) No First Mariner Entity has any Liability or obligation to provide
postretirement medical or life insurance benefits to any First Mariner
Entity's employees or former employees, officers, or directors, or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof, except as otherwise required under state or
federal benefits continuation Laws and, for which the covered individual pays
the full cost of coverage. There are no restrictions on the rights of each
First Mariner Entity to amend or terminate any First Mariner Benefit Plan that
is a retiree health or benefit plan described in the preceding sentence and
such termination will not result in any material Liability thereunder. No Tax
under The Code Sections 4980B or 5000 has been incurred with respect to any
First Mariner Benefit Plan and no circumstance exists which could reasonably
be expected to give rise to such Tax.

  

 

22  

  

(eee) All contributions required to be made to any First Mariner Benefit Plan
by applicable Law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance
policies funding any First Mariner Benefit Plan, for any period through the
date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully
reflected in according with First Mariner's customary accounting method on the
Books and Records of First Mariner.

  

  

(fff) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability
or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or
other compensation or benefit to any employee, officer, director or other
service provider of any First Mariner Entity, or result in any of the
following: (a) requirement to fund any benefits or set aside benefits in a
trust (including a rabbi trust) (b) limitation on the right of any First
Mariner Entity to amend, merge, or terminate any First Mariner Benefit Plan or
related trust in accordance with its terms and applicable Law, (c)
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such payment, right,
compensation or benefit, except as expressly provided in Section 1.11 herein,
or (d) entitlement by any recipient of any payment or benefit to receive a
"gross up" payment for any income or other Taxes that might be owed with
respect to such payment or benefit. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the
form of benefits) by the First Mariner Entities in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a
result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code
(taking into account Section Article 7(w) hereof). Section Article 4(fff) of
First Mariner's Disclosure Memorandum sets forth complete and accurate
calculations with respect to each individual who has a contractual right to
severance pay under any Contract with any First Mariner Entity (based upon the
assumptions set forth therein) triggered by a change in control, and the
amounts potentially payable to each such individual under such contractual
right in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) or as a result of a termination of
employment or service, taking into account any contractual provisions relating
to Section 280G of the Code. No First Mariner Benefit Plan provides for the
gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 280G, Section 4999 or 409A of
the Code, or otherwise.

  

  

(ggg) No "reportable event" (as described in ERISA Section 4043(c) and the
regulations thereunder, and determined without regard to whether the PBGC has
waived the requirement to report the occurrence of such event) has occurred
with respect to any such Employee Benefit Plan.

  

  

(hhh) Without limiting the generality of any other representation contained
herein, there exists no lien against any of the Assets arising under ERISA
Sections 302(f) or 4068(a) or Code Section 412(n).

(assuming such Contract was terminated on the Closing Date), (n) any Contract
containing any standstill or similar agreement pursuant to which any First
Mariner Entity has agreed not to acquire Assets or equity interests of another
Person, (o) any Contract that provides for indemnification by any First

required to file or voluntarily filed such SEC Reports (together with all
Contracts referred to in Sections 1.27, Article 4(ww) and 1.49, the " _First
Mariner Contracts_ "). With respect to each First Mariner Contract: (i) the
Contract is legal, valid and binding on First Mariner or a Subsidiary of First

its terms; (ii) no First Mariner Entity is in material Default thereunder;

Howard and Howard Bank. All of the indebtedness of any First Mariner Entity
for money borrowed is prepayable at any time by such First Mariner Entity
without penalty or premium.

Loan Matters.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

(mmm) Neither First Mariner nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
written or oral Loan in which First Mariner or any of its Subsidiaries is a
creditor which as of June 30, 2017, had an outstanding balance of $100,000 or
more and under the terms of which the obligor was, as of June 30, 2017, over
90 days delinquent in payment of principal or interest. Except as such
disclosure may be limited by any applicable Law, Section Article 4(mmm) of the
First Mariner Disclosure Memorandum sets forth a true, correct and complete
list of all of the Loans of First Mariner and its Subsidiaries that, as of
June 30, 2017 had an outstanding balance of $100,000 or more and were
classified by First Mariner as "Other Loans Specially Mentioned," "Special
Mention," "Substandard," "Doubtful," "Loss," "Classified," "Criticized,"
"Credit Risk Assets," "Concerned Loans," "Watch List" or words of similar
import, together with the principal amount of and accrued and unpaid interest
on each such Loan and the aggregate principal amount of and accrued and unpaid
interest on such Loans as of such date.

  

  

(nnn) Each Loan _currently outstanding,_ (i) is evidenced by notes, agreements
or other evidences of indebtedness that are true, genuine and what they
purport to be, (ii) to the extent secured, has been secured by valid Liens
which have been perfected and (iii) is a legal, valid and binding obligation
of the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except
in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, receivership, conservatorship, moratorium, or
similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
except that the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance
or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which
any proceeding may be brought). The notes or other credit or security
documents with respect to each such outstanding Loan were in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable Laws at the time of origination or
purchase by any First Mariner Entity and are complete and correct in all
material respects.

  

  

(ooo) Each outstanding Loan (including Loans held for resale to investors) was
solicited and originated, and is and has been administered and, where
applicable, serviced, and the relevant Loan files are being maintained, in all
material respects in accordance with the relevant notes or other credit or
security documents, First Mariner's written underwriting standards (and, in
the case of Loans held for resale to investors, the underwriting standards, if
any, of the applicable investors) and with all applicable requirements of
Laws.

  

  

(ppp) None of the Contracts pursuant to which any First Mariner Entity has
sold Loans or pools of Loans or participations in Loans or pools of Loans
contains any obligation to repurchase such Loans or interests therein solely
on account of a payment default by the obligor on any such Loan. Except as

essential coverage satisfies an affordability safe harbor under Treasury
Regulation Section 54.4980H-5 and provides "minimum value" as defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980H-1(a)(28), and the Howard Entities offer

Consents of Regulatory Authorities.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

(g) Howard and First Mariner and their respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate
and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all documentation,
to effect all applications, notices and filings and to obtain all Permits and
Consents of all third parties and Regulatory Authorities which are necessary
or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all
such Permits and Consents of all such third parties and Regulatory
Authorities. Howard shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve
objections, if any, which may be asserted with respect to the Merger under any
applicable Law or Order; provided, that in no event shall Howard be required
to accept any new restriction or condition on any of the Howard Entities or
First Mariner Entities which is not customary in transactions similar to the
Merger, which is materially burdensome on Howard's business, including the
business of Howard Bank, or on the business of First Mariner, in each case
following the Closing or which would reduce the economic benefits of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to Howard to such a degree that
Howard would not have entered into this Agreement had such condition or
restriction been known to it at the date hereof (any such condition or
restriction, a " _Burdensome Condition_ "). Each of Howard and First Mariner
shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each
will consult with the other, in each case subject to applicable Laws relating
to the exchange of information, with respect to, all material written
information submitted to any third party or Regulatory Authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the
foregoing right, each of the Parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. Each Party hereto agrees that it will consult with
the other Party hereto with respect to the obtaining of all material Permits
and Consents of third parties and Regulatory Authorities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each Party will keep the other Party apprised of the status of material
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including advising the other Party upon receiving any communication from a
Regulatory Authority the Consent of which is required for the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement that
causes such Party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any
required consent or approval from a Regulatory Authority will not be obtained
or that the receipt of such consent or approval may be materially delayed (a "
_Regulatory Communication_ "). Upon the receipt of a Regulatory Communication,
without limiting the scope of the foregoing paragraphs, the receiving Party
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law (i) promptly advise the other
Party of the receipt of such Regulatory Communication, (ii) provide the other
Party with a reasonable opportunity to participate in the preparation of any
response thereto and the preparation of any other substantive submission or
communication to any Regulatory Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and to review any such response, submission or
communication prior to the filing or submission thereof (other than portions
of materials to be filed or submitted in connection therewith that contain
confidential or non-public supervisory information or competitively sensitive
business or proprietary information), and (iii) if permitted by the applicable
Regulatory Authority, provide the other Party with the opportunity to
participate in any meetings or substantive telephone conversations that the
receiving party or its Representatives may have from time to time with any
Regulatory Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to the extent such meetings or telephone conversations do not
contain or involve confidential or non-public supervisory information,
competitively sensitive business or proprietary information.

  

 

50  

  

(h) Each Party agrees, upon request, to promptly furnish the other Party with
all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other Party or any of its Subsidiaries to any Regulatory
Authority.

Investigation and Confidentiality.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

(i) Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of any material change in
the normal course of its business or in the operation of its properties and,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, of any material governmental
complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that the
same may be contemplated), or the institution or the threat of a material
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving such Party or its
Affiliates.

  

  

(j) Each Party shall promptly advise the other Party of any fact, change,
event or circumstance known to such Party (i) that has had or is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on such Party or (ii) which such
Party believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article 8;
provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing
with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of
this Section Article 7(j) or the failure of any condition set forth in Section
1.101 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by
the Party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying
breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in
Section 1.101 to be satisfied.

  

  

(k) Prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall permit the other Party to
make or cause to be made such investigation of the business and properties of
it and its Subsidiaries and of their respective financial and legal conditions
as the other Party reasonably requests, provided that such investigation shall
not unreasonably interfere with normal operations of the applicable Party. No
Party nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide
access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would
result in the loss of the attorney-client privilege of the institution in
possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to
the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement
between the Parties) or contravene any Law or Order. The Parties will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. No investigation by a Party
shall affect the ability of such Party to rely on the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the other Party.

  

  

(l) Each Party shall, and shall cause its advisers and agents to, maintain the
confidentiality of all confidential information furnished to it by the other
Party concerning its and its Subsidiaries' businesses, operations, and
financial positions and shall not use such information for any purpose except
in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If this
Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall promptly
return or certify the destruction of all documents and copies thereof, and all
work papers containing confidential information received from the other Party.

public disclosure or communication (including communications to employees,
agents and contractors of First Mariner) related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by either Party (or its
Affiliates) without the prior written consent of the other Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided,
that nothing in this Section 1.88 shall be deemed to prohibit any Party from
making any press release or other public disclosure required by Law or the
rules or regulations of any United States or non-United States securities
exchange, in which case the Party required to make the release or disclosure
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other Party reasonable time
to comment on such release or disclosure in advance of the issuance thereof.
The Parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press release announcing the
execution of this Agreement.

Tax Treatment.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

(m) Each of the Parties intends, and undertakes and agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger, and to take no action which would
cause the Merger not, to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. The Parties shall cooperate and use their
reasonable best efforts in order to obtain the Tax Opinions. The Parties adopt
this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-2(g) and for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the
Code.

  

  

(n) Unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning
of Section 1313(a) of the Code, each of Howard, Howard Bank and First Mariner
shall report the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and shall not take any inconsistent position therewith in
any Tax Return.

Employee Benefits and Contracts.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

(o) First Mariner shall cooperate with Howard to afford Howard reasonable
access to the employees of First Mariner and its Subsidiaries during normal
business hours at locations designated by Howard prior to the Closing.

  

  

(p) For at least six months following the Effective Time, except as
contemplated by this Agreement, Howard will provide to officers and employees
who are actively employed by a First Mariner Entity on the Closing Date ("
_Covered Employees_ ") while employed by any Howard Entity following the
Closing Date, employee benefits under Employee Benefit Plans, on terms and
conditions which when taken as a whole are comparable to those currently
provided by Howard Entities to their similarly situated officers and
employees; provided, that in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible
to participate in any closed or frozen plan of any Howard Entity. Until such
time as Howard shall cause the Covered Employees to participate in the
applicable Howard Employee Benefit Plans, the continued participation of the
Covered Employees in the First Mariner Benefit Plans (other than any equity
arrangement or plan that provides for benefits in connection with a change in
control) shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this clause
(it being understood that participation in Howard's Employee Benefit Plans may
commence at different times with respect to each of Howard's Employee Benefit
Plans). Subject to the terms of each Howard Employee Benefit Plan, for
purposes of participation, eligibility for a benefit level under a vacation,
sick leave, paid time off or severance plan, and vesting, but not for purposes
of benefit accrual, under Howard's Employee Benefit Plans, the service of the
Covered Employees prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as service with
a Howard Entity participating in such employee benefit plans, to the same
extent that such service was recognized by the First Mariner Entities for
purposes of a similar benefit plan; provided, that such recognition of service
shall not (i) operate to duplicate any benefits of a Covered Employee with
respect to the same period of service or (ii) apply for purposes of any plan,
program or arrangement (x) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with
respect to level of benefits or participation, or (y) for purposes of retiree
medical benefits or level of benefits under a defined benefit pension plan.

  

 

52  

  

(q) If requested by Howard in a writing delivered to First Mariner following
the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, the First Mariner Entities
shall take all necessary action (including without limitation the adoption of
resolutions and plan amendments and the delivery of any required notices) to
terminate, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, any First
Mariner Benefit Plan that is intended to constitute a tax-qualified defined
contribution plan under Code Section 401(k) (a " _401(k) Plan_ "). First
Mariner shall provide Howard with a copy of the resolutions, plan amendments,
notices and other documents prepared to effectuate the termination of the
401(k) Plans in advance and give Howard a reasonable opportunity to comment on
such documents (which comments shall be considered in good faith by First
Mariner), and prior to the Closing Date, First Mariner shall provide Howard
with the final documentation evidencing the termination of the 401(k) Plans.
In the event of termination of the 401(k) Plan, Howard and First Mariner shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to afford participants in the 401(k) Plan
who are Continuing Employees with outstanding participant loans under such
plan to elect a rollover of the loan balance from the 401(k) Plan to a 401(k)
plan of Howard in connection with an election by such participant to rollover
his or her entire account in the 401(k) Plan to a 401(k) plan of Howard,
subject to the terms and conditions of the Howard's 401(k) plan and the
requirements of the Howard's 401(k) plan recordkeeper; provided, that each
such loan satisfies all material legal requirements, is not a nonexempt
"prohibited transaction" under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code and is not in default as of the date of the rollover.

  

  

(r) To the extent requested by Howard prior to the Closing Date, the First
Mariner Entities shall cooperate in good faith with Howard to amend, freeze,
terminate or modify any First Mariner Benefit Plan not covered by subsection
(c) of this Section 1.90 in accordance with the terms of such plan or
agreement and applicable Law, to be effective as of the Effective Time (or at
such time mutually agreed to by the parties), except that the winding up of
any such plan or agreement may be completed following the Closing Date. First
Mariner shall provide Howard with a copy of the resolutions, plan amendments,
notices and other documents prepared to effectuate the actions contemplated by
this Section Article 7(r), as applicable, and give Howard a reasonable
opportunity to comment on such documents (which comments shall be considered
in good faith by First Mariner), and prior to the Closing Date, First Mariner
shall provide Howard with the final documentation evidencing that the actions
contemplated herein have been effectuated.

  

  

(s) Prior to the Effective Time, First Mariner shall provide Howard with a
true, correct and complete list of all employees whose employment terminated
within the 90 days preceding the Closing Date, or whose work hours have been
reduced within the six months preceding the Closing Date. Such list will
indicate the employee's name, site of employment, position or job title,
starting date, employing entity, date of employment loss, termination or
layoff (if applicable), and the amount of hour reduction for each calendar
month during the six month period (if applicable).

  

  

(t) First Mariner shall establish a retention bonus pool based on the terms
set forth in Section Article 7(t) of First Mariner's Disclosure Memorandum.
Howard and First Mariner shall agree on employees that shall be entitled to
receive any retention bonus and shall jointly notify such employees.

  

 

53  

  

(u) Employees of First Mariner (other than those listed in Section Article
7(t)) of First Mariner's Disclosure Memorandum as of the date of the Agreement
who remain employed by First Mariner as of the Effective Time and whose
employment is terminated by Howard (absent termination for cause) within the
time period set forth in Section 7.8(g) of First Mariner's Disclosure
Memorandum shall receive severance pay equal to the amounts set forth in
Section 7.8(g) of First Mariner's Disclosure Memorandum.

  

  

(v) Without limiting the generality of Section 1.118, the provisions of this
Section 1.90 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no Covered Employee, current or former employee or any other individual
associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement:
(i) establish, amend, or modify any First Mariner Benefit Plan or any
"employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by
Howard, First Mariner or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or
limit the ability of Howard or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the
Closing Date, the First Mariner Entities) to amend, modify or terminate any
First Mariner Benefit Plan, employment agreement or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date, in
accordance with the terms of such plan or agreement and applicable Law; or
(iii) confer upon any current or former employee, officer, director or
consultant, any right to employment or continued employment or continued
service with Howard or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the
Closing Date, the First Mariner Entities), or constitute or create an
employment agreement with any employee, or interfere with or restrict in any
way the rights of the Surviving Bank, First Mariner, Howard or any Subsidiary
or Affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee,
officer, director or consultant of First Mariner or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.

  

  

(w) To the extent any payments made with respect to, or which arise as a
result of, this Agreement, could be characterized as an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code, First Mariner
shall (i) within two Business Days following the date of this Agreement (and
in any event prior to obtaining the consent of any recipient of such payment
in accordance with (ii) below), disclose its calculations with respect to the
excess parachute payments to Howard, along with the assumptions used to make
the calculations and the data necessary for Howard to confirm the accuracy of
the calculations, (ii) to the extent not already obtained, promptly obtain the
consent of the recipient of any such payment that would otherwise be due and
owing that such payment shall not be due and owing, paid or retained, absent
280G Stockholder Approval (as defined below), and (iii) promptly (and in any
case prior to the Closing Date) cause all such payments to be adequately
disclosed to, and submit such payments for approval by a vote of, the
stockholders of First Mariner in a manner meeting the requirements of the Code
and the applicable treasury regulations (" _280G Stockholder Approval_ "), and
in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Howard. Howard shall have the right to
review and approve (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) any consent required by clause (ii) and any disclosure required by
clause (iii) before such consent is sought or disclosure is made, as
applicable.

Indemnification.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

(x) Howard shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless, the present and former
directors or officers of the First Mariner Entities (each, an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") against all Costs and Expenses arising out of actions or omissions
arising out of the Indemnified Party's service or services as directors or
officers of First Mariner or, at First Mariner's request, of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) to the fullest extent permitted under the MCFI and by First
Mariner's charter and amended and restated bylaws as in effect on the date
hereof, including provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in the
defense of any Litigation and whether or not any Howard Entity is insured
against any such matter. Without limiting the foregoing, in any case in which
approval by Howard is required by First Mariner's charter or amended and
restated bylaws to effectuate any indemnification, Howard shall direct, at the
election of the Indemnified Party, that the determination of any such approval
shall be made by independent counsel mutually agreed upon between Howard and
the Indemnified Party.

  

 

54  

  

(y) Howard shall use its reasonable best efforts (and First Mariner shall
cooperate prior to the Effective Time in these efforts) to maintain in effect
for a period of six years after the Effective Time First Mariner's existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (provided that Howard may
substitute therefor (i) policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are substantially no less advantageous
or (ii) with the consent of First Mariner given prior to the Effective Time,
any other policy) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which
occurred prior to the Effective Time and covering persons who are currently
covered by such insurance; provided, that Howard shall not be obligated to
make aggregate premium payments for such six-year period in respect of such
policy (or coverage replacing such policy) which exceed, for the portion
related to First Mariner's directors and officers, the amount set forth in
Section Article 7(y) of First Mariner's Disclosure Memorandum (the " _Maximum
Amount_ "). If the amount of the premiums necessary to maintain or procure
such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Howard shall use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance obtainable for a premium equal to
the Maximum Amount. In lieu of the foregoing, Howard, or First Mariner in
consultation with Howard, may obtain on or prior to the Effective Time, a six-
year "tail" prepaid policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in
this Section Article 7(y) at a premium not to exceed the Maximum Amount. If
the premium necessary to purchase such "tail" prepaid policy exceeds the
Maximum Amount, Howard may purchase the most advantageous "tail" prepaid
policy obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount, and in each case,
Howard will have no further obligations under this Section Article 7(y) other
than to maintain such "tail" prepaid policy.

  

  

(z) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
Article 7(x), upon learning of any such Liability or Litigation, shall
promptly notify Howard thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve
Howard of any Liability it may have to such Indemnified Party or any
Litigation unless such failure adversely affects Howard with respect to such
Liability or Litigation. In the event of any such Litigation (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time): (i) Howard shall have the right to assume
the defense thereof and Howard shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party
for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if Howard elects not to assume such defense or independent legal
counsel for the Indemnified Party advises that there are substantive issues
which raise conflicts of interest between Howard and the Indemnified Party,
the Indemnified Party may retain counsel satisfactory to it, and Howard shall
pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Party
promptly as statements therefor are received; provided, that Howard shall be
obligated pursuant to this Section Article 7(z) to pay for only one firm of
counsel for all Indemnified Parties and shall not be liable to any Indemnified
Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof; (ii) the Indemnified Party will cooperate in the defense of any such
Litigation; and (iii) Howard shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent; and provided, further, that Howard shall
not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court
of competent jurisdiction shall determine, and such determination shall have
become final and not subject to further appeal, that the indemnification of
such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law.

  

  

(aa) If Howard or any successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of
such consolidation or merger or if Howard (or any successors or assigns) shall
transfer all or substantially all of its Assets to any Person, then and in
each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Howard shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 1.91.

  

 

55  

  

(bb) The provisions of this Section 1.91 are intended to be for the benefit of
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and its respective heirs
and Representatives.

  

  

(cc) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1.91 to the contrary, no
indemnification payments will be made to an Indemnified Party with respect to
an administrative proceeding or civil action initiated by any federal banking
agency unless all of the following conditions are met: (i) the Howard's board
of directors determines that the payment will not materially affect Howard's
safety and soundness (provided that if there is a delay in paying such
indemnification as a result of this subsection, such indemnification shall be
made at such later time when such payment will not materially affect Howard's
safety and soundness); (ii) the payment does not fall within the definition of
a prohibited indemnification payment under 12 C.F.R. Part 359; and (iii) the
Indemnified Party agrees in writing to reimburse the Howard, to the extent not
covered by permissible insurance, for payments made in the event that the
administrative or civil action instituted by a banking Regulatory Authority
results in a final order or settlement in which the Indemnified Party is
assessed a civil money penalty, is prohibited from banking, or is required to
cease an action or perform an affirmative action.

First Mariner, Howard and Howard Bank shall cooperate with each other in

Parties and the operation of Howard Bank (including the former operations of
First Mariner) after the Merger, and in preparing for the consolidation of
appropriate operating functions to be effective at the Effective Time or such
later date as Howard may decide. First Mariner shall take any action Howard
may reasonably request prior to the Effective Time to facilitate the
combination of the operations of First Mariner with Howard. Each Party shall
cooperate with the other Party in preparing to execute after the Effective
Time conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations generally
(including by entering into customary confidentiality, non-disclosure and
similar agreements with such service providers and/or the other party).
Without limiting the foregoing, senior officers of First Mariner and Howard
shall meet from time to time as First Mariner or Howard may reasonably request
to review the financial and operational affairs of First Mariner, and First
Mariner shall give due consideration to Howard's input on such matters, with
the understanding that, notwithstanding any other provision contained in this
Agreement, (a) neither Howard nor Howard Bank shall under any circumstance be
permitted, directly or indirectly, to exercise control of First Mariner or any
of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, (b) First Mariner shall not
be under any obligation to act in a manner that could reasonably be deemed to
constitute anti-competitive behavior under federal or state antitrust Laws,
and (c) First Mariner shall not be required to agree to any material
obligation that is not contingent upon the consummation of the Merger.

of any action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation, suit,
subpoena or summons issued, commenced, brought, conducted or heard by or
before, or otherwise involving, any Regulatory Authority or arbitrator pending
or, to the Knowledge of Howard or First Mariner, as applicable, threatened
against Howard, First Mariner or any of their respective Subsidiaries that (a)
questions or would reasonably be expected to question the validity of this
Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any
actions taken or to be taken by Howard, First Mariner or their respective
Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin or
otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. First
Mariner shall permit Howard to participate in the defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation against First Mariner and/or its directors relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no settlement of any such
litigation shall be agreed to without Howard's prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements

Regulatory Authority and any other third party that is required to be obtained
by First Mariner or Howard or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including,
any merger between a Subsidiary of Howard, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary
of First Mariner, on the other hand) or to vest the Surviving Bank with full
title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises
of any of the Parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each
Party and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action
as may be reasonably requested by Howard.

Change of Method.

Howard may at any time change the method of effecting the Merger if and to the
extent requested by Howard, and First Mariner agrees to enter into such
amendments to this Agreement as Howard may reasonably request in order to give
effect to such restructuring; provided, that no such change or amendment shall
(i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided
for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger
with respect to First Mariner's stockholders or (iii) be reasonably likely to
cause the Closing to be materially delayed or the receipt of the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals to be prevented or materially delayed.

any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each of Howard, Howard
Bank and First Mariner shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the
continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby from any applicable Takeover Law now or hereafter in effect. If any
Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby, each of Howard, Howard Bank and First Mariner will grant
such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of any Takeover Law on any of the transactions contemplated by

dispositions of First Mariner Common Stock, First Mariner Series A Preferred
Stock or First Mariner Stock Options and (ii) any acquisitions of Howard
Common Stock pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and

(c) By either Party in the event that the Merger shall not have been

obligations of Howard to consummate the Merger contained in Section 8.2 cannot

62

exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section 9.1(j), it shall give
written notice to Howard (provided that such notice of election to terminate

During the five-day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, Howard
shall have the option to increase the consideration to be received by the
holders of First Mariner Common Stock and First Mariner Series A Preferred
Stock hereunder, by adjusting the Exchange Ratio (calculated to the nearest
one one-thousandth) to equal the lesser of (x) a number (rounded to the
nearest one one-thousandth) obtained by dividing (A) the product of the
Starting Price, 0.80 and the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) by (B) the
Average Closing Price and (y) a number (rounded to the nearest one one-
thousandth) obtained by dividing (A) the product of the Index Ratio and the
Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) by (B) the Howard Ratio. If Howard so
elects within such five-day period, it shall give prompt written notice to
First Mariner of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no
termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 9.1(j) and this
Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except as the
Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified).

is given in accordance with Section 10.8.

  

  

(j) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,

---|--- 
  

  

  

The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that

It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled, without the
requirement of posting bond, to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are

action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be an adequate
remedy.

---|--- 
  

  

  

Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent
of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable.

referenced or cross-referenced in such disclosure or (b) the relevance of such
item to another Section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent on the face
of such disclosure (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference)
from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other
Sections of this Agreement.

Exhibit 1

  


 

  

Form of First Mariner Stockholder Agreement

  

    

  

  

Stockholder Agreement

  

  

This Stockholder Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into as of August 14,
2017 (the "Agreement Date"), by and among Howard Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland
corporation ("Howard"), Howard Bank, a Maryland chartered trust company and
wholly owned subsidiary of Howard ("Howard Bank"), and the undersigned
stockholders (each such undersigned, as to himself, herself or itself,
"Stockholder") of First Mariner Bank, a Maryland chartered trust company (the
"Bank"). Terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings
ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement (as defined below). If the terms of
this Agreement conflict in any way with the terms of the Merger Agreement,
then the terms of the Merger Agreement shall control.

  

  

RECITALS

  

  

A. Stockholder has executed and delivered this Agreement in connection with,
and concurrently with the execution and delivery of, that certain Agreement
and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of August 14, 2017 (the "Merger
Agreement"), by and among Howard, Howard Bank, and the Bank, pursuant to which
the Bank will merge with and into Howard Bank with Howard Bank to survive such
merger and become a wholly owned subsidiary of Howard (the "Merger").

  

  

B. Immediately after the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement,
Stockholder shall execute and deliver a stockholder consent of the Bank (the
"Bank Stockholder Consent") approving the Merger Agreement and approving,
among other things, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement.

  

  

C. Stockholder understands and acknowledges that the Bank, Howard Bank and
Howard are entitled to rely on (i) the truth and accuracy of Stockholder's
representations contained herein and (ii) Stockholder's performance of the
obligations set forth herein.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations, warranties,
covenants and other agreements contained in the Merger Agreement and herein,
and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as set forth
herein.

  

  

1. _Restrictions on Shares_.

  

  

1.1 Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, transfer (except as may be
specifically required by court order, by operation of law or pursuant to the
Merger Agreement), sell, exchange, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber
any of the Shares (as defined in _Section 3.1_ ), or enter into any agreement
or other arrangement relating thereto, at any time prior to the Expiration
Time (as defined below); provided, that Stockholder may (a) if Stockholder is
a partnership, limited liability company or corporation, distribute Shares to
its partners, members and equity holders (as applicable), (b) if Stockholder
is an individual, transfer any of the Shares to any member of Stockholder's
immediate family, or to a trust for the benefit of Stockholder or any member
of Stockholder's immediate family for estate planning purposes, and (c)
transfer any of the Shares upon the death or dissolution of Stockholder (each,
a "Permitted Transfer"); provided, further, that any such transfer shall be
permitted only if, as a condition to the effectiveness of such transfer, (x)
the transferee agrees in writing to be bound by all of the terms of this
Agreement and (y) such transfer would not require registration pursuant to any
applicable federal or state securities laws or result in the Bank being
required to register any class of its equity securities with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. As used herein, the term "Expiration Time"
as it applies to a Stockholder shall mean the earlier of (i) the Effective
Time, (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with _Article
9_ of the Merger Agreement and (iii) the termination of this Agreement as it
applies to a Stockholder by mutual consent of Howard and such Stockholder.

    

   

1.2 Until the Expiration Time and except pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, grant any proxies or
powers of attorney with respect to any of the Shares, deposit any of the
Shares into a voting trust, or enter into a voting agreement with respect to
any of the Shares.

  

  

1.3 Any shares of capital stock of the Bank ("Bank Capital Stock") that
Stockholder purchases or with respect to which Stockholder otherwise acquires
beneficial ownership after the Agreement Date and prior to the Expiration
Time, including by reason of (i) exercise, conversion or exchange of any other
Bank securities or (ii) any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as if
they constituted a portion of the Shares.

  

  

2. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. Prior to the Expiration Time, at every meeting of the Bank's stockholders called with respect to any of the following, and at every adjournment thereof, and on every action or approval by written resolution or consent of the Bank stockholders with respect to any of the following, Stockholder shall vote the Shares in respect of which Stockholder is entitled to vote at any such meeting or in connection with any such written consent against any Adverse Proposal (as defined below); provided, that nothing herein shall preclude Stockholder from exercising full power and authority to vote the Shares in Stockholder's sole discretion for or against any proposal submitted to a vote of the Bank's stockholders to approve any payment that, in the absence of such approval, constitutes a parachute payment under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). "Adverse Proposal" means (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any change in a majority of the board of directors of the Bank, (iii) any amendment to the Bank's charter or bylaws not approved in writing by Howard, (iv) any material change in the capitalization of the Bank (including the terms of any Bank securities) or the Bank's corporate structure (other than, if applicable, the conversion of shares of the Series A Non-Voting Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $10.00 per share, of the Bank (the "Bank Series A Preferred Stock") into shares of common stock, $10.00 par value per share, of the Bank (the "Bank Common Stock"), (v) any action that would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the Bank in the Merger Agreement and that would reasonably be expected to preclude fulfillment of a condition precedent under the Merger Agreement to the Bank's or Howard's obligation to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement ("Transactions"), (vi) any action that would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the Stockholder in this Agreement, or (vii) any other matter that would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the Merger or any of the other Transactions.

  

 

2  

  

3. _Representations and Warranties of Stockholder_. Stockholder hereby represents and warrants to Howard and Howard Bank as follows, which representations and warranties are accurate in all respects as of the Agreement Date, will be accurate in all respects at all times through the Expiration Time and will be accurate in all respects as of the Closing as if made at that time:

  

  

3.1 _Ownership of Securities_. As of the Agreement Date, Stockholder is the
beneficial owner of that number of shares of the Bank Capital Stock set forth
on the signature page executed by Stockholder (all such shares beneficially
owned by Stockholder on the Agreement Date, collectively, the "Shares") and,
except as otherwise set forth on the signature page executed by Stockholder,
did not acquire any shares of Bank Capital Stock in contemplation of the
Merger. Excluding any Equity Rights for any Bank Capital Stock or any other
Bank securities, the Shares constitute Stockholder's entire interest in all
the outstanding shares of Bank Capital Stock. No Person who is not a party
hereto (or such signatory's spouse for purposes of applicable community
property laws) has a beneficial interest in or a right to acquire or vote any
of the Shares except as set forth in that certain Stockholders' Agreement
dated June 17, 2014, by and among the Bank and certain stockholders of the
Bank named therein and that certain Registration Rights Agreement dated June
17, 2014, by and among the Bank and certain stockholders of the Bank named
therein (collectively, the "Bank Equity Documents") that will be waived
pursuant to Section 5 below (other than, if Stockholder is a partnership or a
limited liability company, the rights and interests of Persons that own
partnership interests or limited liability company membership interests or
units in Stockholder under the partnership agreement or operating agreement
governing Stockholder and applicable partnership or limited liability company
law, or if the Stockholder is a trust, the beneficiaries thereof). The Shares
are not subject to any Liens (other than Liens created pursuant hereto) except
as set forth in the Bank Equity Documents. On the Closing Date, the Shares
will not be subject to any Liens (other than Liens created pursuant hereto).
If Stockholder has purchased or otherwise acquired any Bank Capital Stock
subject to repurchase by the Bank, Stockholder has timely filed all elections
and notices under Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to such Bank Capital
Stock. Stockholder's principal residence or place of business is set forth on
the signature page hereto.

  

  

3.2 _Power, Authorization and Validity_. If Stockholder is an entity,
Stockholder is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. Stockholder has all requisite
power and authority (if Stockholder is an entity) or legal capacity (if
Stockholder is a natural person) to enter into this Agreement, and each other
agreement, document or certificate to which he, she or it may become a party
pursuant to this Agreement or the Merger Agreement (each, a "Stockholder
Ancillary Agreement"), and to perform his, her or its obligations under this
Agreement and each Stockholder Ancillary Agreement. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement and each Stockholder Ancillary Agreement by Stockholder and
the consummation by Stockholder of the Transactions have been duly authorized
by all necessary action, if any, on the part of Stockholder. This Agreement
has been, and on the Closing Date each Stockholder Ancillary Agreement will
have been, duly executed and delivered by Stockholder and constitutes a valid
and binding obligation of Stockholder, enforceable against Stockholder in
accordance with its terms, subject only to the effect, if any, of (i)
applicable bankruptcy and other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally and (ii) rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive
relief and other equitable remedies.

  

 

3  

  

3.3 _No Conflict_. The execution and delivery by Stockholder of this Agreement
and any Stockholder Ancillary Agreement and the consummation of the Merger or
any other Transaction do not, and Stockholder's performance of his, her or its
obligations under this Agreement and any Stockholder Ancillary Agreement will
not: (i) result in the creation of any Liens (other than Liens created
pursuant hereto) on any of the Shares or (ii) conflict with, or result in any
violation of or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both), or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of
any obligation or loss of any benefit under, or require any consent, approval
or waiver from any Person pursuant to, (A) if Stockholder is an entity, any
provision of the organizational documents of Stockholder, each as currently in
effect, (B) any Contract to which Stockholder is a party or by which
Stockholder or any of the Shares is bound or affected or (C) any Legal
Requirement.

  

  

3.4 _No Consents_. No consent, approval, order, authorization, release or
waiver of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental
Entity or other Person is necessary or required to be made or obtained by
Stockholder to enable Stockholder to lawfully execute and deliver, enter into,
and perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement or any
Stockholder Ancillary Agreement.

  

  

3.5 _Legal Proceedings_. As of the Agreement Date, there is no private or
governmental action, inquiry, claim, counterclaim, proceeding, suit, hearing,
litigation, audit or investigation, in each case whether civil, criminal,
administrative, judicial or investigative, or any appeal therefrom for which
Stockholder has received written notice (each, a "Legal Proceeding") pending
against Stockholder before any Governmental Entity that relates in any way to
this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, any Stockholder Ancillary Agreement or
any of the Transactions. To the knowledge of Stockholder, no such Legal
Proceeding has been threatened.

  

  

3.6 _No Brokers_. Stockholder is not obligated for the payment of any fees or
expenses of any investment banker, broker, advisor, finder or similar party in
connection with the origin, negotiation or execution of the Merger Agreement
or in connection with the Merger or any other Transaction. Neither Howard nor
the Surviving Corporation shall incur any Liability, either directly or
indirectly, to any such investment banker, broker, advisor, finder or similar
party as a result of the Merger Agreement or the Merger or any other
Transaction.

  

  

3.7 _Tax Matters_. Stockholder has had an opportunity to review with his, her
or its own tax advisors the tax consequences of the Merger, the Transactions
and any Stockholder Ancillary Agreements. Stockholder understands that he, she
or it must rely solely on his, her or its advisors and not on any statements
or representations made by Howard, the Bank or any of their agents or
representatives. Stockholder understands that Stockholder (and not Howard, the
Bank or Howard Bank) shall be responsible for any tax liability of Stockholder
that may arise as a result of the Merger or the Transactions.

  

  

4. _Covenants of Stockholder_. Stockholder hereby covenants to Howard and Howard Bank as follows:

  

  

4.1 _Compliance_. Prior to the Expiration Time, Stockholder (in his, her or
its capacity as such) shall not take any action that would (a) make any
representation or warranty contained herein untrue or incorrect in any
material respect or (b) reasonably be expected to have the effect of impairing
the ability of Stockholder to perform his, her or its obligations under this
Agreement or any Stockholder Ancillary Agreement (as defined in _Section 3.2_
) or preventing or materially delaying the consummation of any of the
Transactions; _provided_ that nothing contained in this _Section 4.1_ shall be
construed to prohibit Stockholder as a director of the Bank from exercising
his or her duties to the Bank or its stockholders under any Law or taking on
behalf of the Bank any of the actions permitted to be taken by the Bank under
_Section 6.1_ of the Merger Agreement.

  

 

4  

  

4.2 _No Solicitation_. Stockholder acknowledges that he, she or it has
received a copy of the Merger Agreement. Until the Expiration Time,
Stockholder (in his, her or its capacity as such) shall not, directly or
indirectly, take any action prohibited by _Section 7.2_ of the Merger
Agreement. In the event Stockholder shall receive or become aware of any
Acquisition Proposal subsequent to the Agreement Date, Stockholder shall
promptly inform the Bank, and the Bank shall inform Howard as contemplated by
_Section 7.2_ of the Merger Agreement, as to any such matter and the details
thereof to the maximum extent possible without violating his, her or its
duties.

  

  

4.3 _Irrevocable Consent_. Stockholder hereby agrees, except as may be
requested by Howard, not to modify, revoke or rescind the Bank Stockholder
Consent executed by Stockholder or any resolution contained therein and
further agrees not to adopt any resolutions modifying, rescinding or revoking
the Bank Stockholder Consent executed by Stockholder or any resolution
contained therein or otherwise precluding the adoption of the Merger Agreement
or the approval of the principal terms of the Merger, at any time prior to the
Effective Time. Stockholder agrees that he, she or it will not bring,
commence, institute, maintain, prosecute, participate in or voluntarily aid
any Litigation, in law or in equity, in any court or before any Governmental
Entity, that (i) challenges the validity of or seeks to enjoin the operation
of any provision of the Bank Stockholder Consent or this Agreement or the
execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the
Merger and the other Transactions or (ii) alleges that the execution and
delivery of the Bank Stockholder Consent, or this Agreement by Stockholder,
either alone or together with any other voting or stockholder agreements and
proxies to be delivered in connection with the execution of the Merger
Agreement, breaches any duty of the board of directors of the Bank or any
member thereof or of any holder of Bank Capital Stock or other Bank
securities.

  

  

5. _Consent and Waiver; Termination of Existing Agreements_. Stockholder hereby gives, effective upon the execution and delivery by such Stockholder of a Bank Stockholder Consent, any consents or waivers that are reasonably required for the consummation of the Merger under the terms of any agreement or instrument to which Stockholder is a party or subject, or in respect of any rights Stockholder may have in connection with the Merger or the other Transactions (whether such rights exist under the charter or bylaws of the Bank as amended to date, any Contract of the Bank or under statutory or common law or otherwise). Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, Stockholder hereby waives any and all rights to contest or object to the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions, or to the execution and delivery of a Bank Stockholder Consent by Stockholder or any other Bank Stockholder or to seek damages or other legal or equitable relief in connection therewith (except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement). If and to the extent Stockholder is a party to any of the agreements set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto, Stockholder hereby agrees to the termination of such agreements and the waiver of any rights of first refusal, preemptive rights, rights to notice, rights to consent, rights of co-sale, registration rights, information rights or any other similar rights, such termination and waiver to be contingent upon, and effective immediately prior to, the Effective Time.

  

 

5  

  

6. _Dissenters ' Rights_. Stockholder agrees not to exercise any rights of appraisal or any dissenters' rights that Stockholder may have (whether under applicable law or otherwise) or could potentially have or acquire in connection with the Merger.

  

  

7. _Miscellaneous_.

  

  

7.1 _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally or by commercial
delivery service, or mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt

purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used

7.3 _Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief_. The parties hereto acknowledge
that Howard will be irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate
remedy at law for a violation of any of the covenants or agreements of
Stockholder set forth herein. Therefore, it is agreed that, in addition to any
other remedies that may be available to Howard upon any such violation of this
Agreement or the Bank Stockholder Consent, Howard shall have the right to
enforce such covenants and agreements and the Bank Stockholder Consent by
specific performance, injunctive relief or by any other means available to
Howard at law or in equity, and Stockholder hereby waives any and all defenses
which could exist in its favor in connection with such enforcement and waives
any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with
such enforcement.

  

  

7.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto; it being
understood and agreed that all parties hereto need not sign the same
counterpart. The delivery by facsimile or by electronic delivery in PDF format
of this Agreement with all executed signature pages (in counterparts or
otherwise) shall be sufficient to bind the parties hereto to the terms and
conditions set forth herein. All of the counterparts will together constitute
one and the same instrument and each counterpart will constitute an original
of this Agreement.

  

  

7.5 _Entire Agreement; Non-assignability; Parties in Interest; Assignment_.
This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements
specifically referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto (including the
Irrevocable Proxy) (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof and (ii) are not intended to confer,
and shall not be construed as conferring, upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. The provisions of this
Agreement (other than the provisions of _Section 1_ , and _Section 2_ and as
contemplated by _Section 7.12_ ) shall survive the Effective Time and the
closing of the Transactions. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in
whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any of the parties
hereto without the prior written consent of the other party hereto, and any
such assignment or delegation that is not consented to shall be null and void,
except that Howard may assign this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Howard without the prior consent of any other party
hereto. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns (including any Person to whom any
Shares are sold, transferred or assigned).

  

 

7  

  

7.6 _Amendment; Waiver_. Subject to applicable Law, Howard and Stockholder may
amend this Agreement as it applies to Stockholder at any time pursuant to an
instrument in writing signed by or on behalf of each of Howard and
Stockholder. At any time, either Howard or Stockholder may, to the extent
legally allowed, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and/or waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for
the benefit of such party contained herein pursuant to an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. Without limiting the generality or
effect of the preceding sentence, no delay in exercising any right under this
Agreement shall constitute a waiver of such right, and no waiver of any breach
or default shall be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default of the same
or any other provision herein.

  

  

7.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto
further agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to replace such
void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

  

  

7.8 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto shall be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred by this
Agreement, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party
hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy
and nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to
specific performance or injunctive relief.

  

  

7.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, all acts and Transactions pursuant hereto
and all obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland without reference to such
state's principles of conflicts of law that would refer a matter to another
jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably consents to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any court located within the State of Maryland, in
connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the
matters contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that process may be served
upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of Maryland for
such persons and (iii) waives and covenants not to assert or plead any
objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction and such
process.

  

  

7.10 _Additional Documents, Etc_. Each of the parties hereto shall execute and
deliver any additional documents reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose
and intent of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality or effect of the
foregoing or any other obligation of Stockholder hereunder, Stockholder hereby
authorizes Howard to deliver a copy of this Agreement to the Bank and hereby
agrees that each of the Bank and Howard may rely upon such delivery as
conclusively evidencing the consents, waivers and terminations of Stockholder
referred to in _Section 5_ , in each case for purposes of all agreements and
instruments to which such consents, waivers and/or terminations are applicable
or relevant.

  

 

8  

  

7.11 _Rules of Construction_. Each of the parties hereto agree that they have
been (or have had the opportunity to be) represented by counsel during the
negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive
the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document shall be
construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

  

  

7.12 _Termination_. The representations and warranties set forth herein shall
terminate on the Expiration Time, and shall be null and void in all respects
after the Expiration Time. All covenants and agreements contained herein shall
survive the Expiration Time to the fullest extent permitted by law or for such
shorter period explicitly specified therein, except that for such covenants
and agreements that survive for such shorter period, any breach thereof shall
survive to the fullest extent permitted by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall relieve Stockholder from liability in connection with (i)
any breach of Stockholder's representations and warranties contained in
_Section 3.1_ of this Agreement or (ii) any breach of covenants and agreements
contained herein if the Expiration Time occurs pursuant to clause (ii) of the
definition of Expiration Time in _Section 1.1_ of this Agreement.

---|---

---|--- 
  

  

  

    

3.4

  |  

 _Suspension With Pay_. Nothing contained herein will preclude the Employer
from releasing the Executive of the Executive's normal duties and suspending
the Executive, with pay, during the pendency of any investigation or
examination to determine whether or not Cause exists for termination of the
Executive. The application of this Section 3.4 shall not constitute "Good
Reason" in connection with any termination of the Executive's employment by

(b)

  |

continuation of the Agreement is necessary for the continued operation of the
Bank:

applicable to the Employer, the Employer may decline to make such payment or
amend the amount or timing of such payment to comply with such regulatory
requirements, including the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 1828(k) and 12 C.F.R.
part 359.

(e)

  |  

For purposes of this Section 3.7, a Change in Control means either (i) the

and their affiliates from any and all liability in connection with Executive's
employment. Any payments due under Section 3.7 for the first period after
termination and before the Release becomes effective shall be paid with the
first payment after the Release becomes effective. If the period during which
Executive has discretion to execute or revoke the Release straddles two
calendar years, the Employer shall make or commence payments conditioned on
the Release no earlier than January 1st of the second calendar year,
regardless of which year the Release becomes effective. Executive's rights to
the payments described in Section 3.7 are further conditioned on Executive's
material compliance with Sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 of this Agreement. In the
event that Executive materially breaches such obligations, the Company's
obligation to pay Executive any additional payments under Section 3.7 will
cease immediately.

   
---|---

  |  

 _Calculation of Payment Amount ; Certain Adjustments of Payment Amount_. If
it is determined that any payment or distribution by the Employer to or for
the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or
distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise) is subject
to the limitations of section 280G of the Code (a "Parachute Payment"), the
following provisions will apply:

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

If the aggregate present value of Parachute Payments is less than or equal to
the 280G limit, then no adjustment to the amount of such Parachute Payments
shall be made.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

If the aggregate present value of Parachute Payments is greater than the 280G
limit, such Parachute Payments shall be reduced to an amount which is $1.00
less than an amount equal to 2.99 times the Executive\'s "base amount" as
determined in accordance with Section 280G of the Code (the "Threshold
Amount"), unless the after-tax benefit to the Executive if he received the
total Parachute Payments (taking into account all federal, state and local
income taxes based on the highest marginal tax rates, employment-related taxes
(including Social Security and Medicare taxes), and the excise tax imposed by
Section 4999 of the Code on the excess parachute payments) is greater than the
after-tax benefit to the Executive if he received the Threshold Amount (taking
into account all federal, state and local income taxes based on the highest
marginal tax rates, and employment-related taxes (including Social Security
and Medicare taxes) on the Threshold Amount).

   
---|--- 
  

  

 

13  

  

For purposes of this Section 3.9, "present value" shall be determined in
accordance with Code section 280G(d)(4), and the "280G limit" is the amount
that can be paid under this Agreement or otherwise without causing any amount
to be nondeductible under Code Section 280G or subject to excise tax under
Code section 4999. All determinations required to be made under this Section
3.9, including the aggregate present value of Parachute Payments, whether a
reduction is required under Section 3.9(b) and the amount of such reduction,
shall be made in reasonable good faith by the Company's Chief Financial
Officer (or senior executive of the Company having responsibility for the
Company's accounting function) or his or her designee, who shall provide
detailed supporting calculations both to the Employer and the Executive within
10 business days of Executive's termination of employment (or such other
relevant payment triggering date).

entitled to such benefits as may be available from time to time for employees
of the Employer. All such benefits will be awarded and administered in
accordance with the Employer's standard policies and practices and may be
modified or terminated at any time in the Employer's discretion. Such benefits
may include, by way of example only, health, dental, vision, profit-sharing
plans, retirement, and disability insurance benefits and such other benefits
as the Employer deems appropriate. In addition to the benefits described in
this Section 4.4, Employer shall provide, and shall pay the premiums for, a
$500,000 term life insurance policy for Executive.

4.7

 _Merger Payment_. Within 60 days following the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing"), the Employer will pay Executive a cash payment equal to 2.99 times
the Executive's Base Salary and the higher of the annual bonus paid in the two
calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which the Closing
occurs, subject to (a) Executive's continuous employment through the date of
payment, and (b) Executive entering into, and not revoking, a copy of the
Release within the time periods set forth therein, releasing the Bank and the
Company and their affiliates from any and all liability (other than
Executive's ongoing rights under this Agreement). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Closing occurs in 2018, no value of any 2017 annual bonus
that exceeded the greater of Executive's 2015 bonus and 2016 bonus will be
taken into account for purposes of the calculations in this Section 4.7. Such
payment shall be subject to Section 3.9. For avoidance of any doubt, the
references to Base Salary and annual bonuses in this Section 4.7 refer to the
Base Salary and annual bonuses paid to the Executive by Executive's
predecessor employer, First Mariner Bank.

available under patent, copyright, trade secret or trademark law, or any other
similar statutory provision or common law doctrine in the United States or

Confidentiality Obligations of the Executive.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

5.2.1

  |  

Executive understands and acknowledges that during the course of employment by
the Employer, he will have access to and learn about Company Information.
Executive further understands and acknowledges that such Company Information
and the Employer's ability to reserve the Company Information for the
exclusive knowledge and use of the Employer is of great competitive importance
and commercial value to the Employer, and that improper use or disclosure of
the Company Information by Executive shall cause the Employer irreparable
harm, for which remedies at law will not be adequate, and may also cause the
Employer to incur financial costs, loss of business advantage, liability under
confidentiality agreements with third parties, civil damages or criminal
penalties.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

5.2.2

  |  

Executive understands and agrees that Company Information developed by
Executive in the course of Executive's employment by Employer shall be subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as if Employer furnished such
Company Information to Executive in the first instance.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

5.2.3

  |  

Nothing herein shall be construed to grant any right or license to Executive
in or to any Company Information or Employer Materials other than the right to
use such Company Information and Employer Materials on behalf of the Employer
in accordance with the terms hereof. Employer shall not cause or permit any
reverse engineering, decompilation or disassembly of any Company Information
or Employer Materials. Executive shall, during the course of his employment,
adopt and maintain programs and procedures which are reasonably calculated to
protect the confidentiality of the Company Information and Employer Materials
and shall be responsible to the Employer for any disclosure or misuse of the
Company Information and Employer Materials which results from a failure to
comply with this Agreement.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

5.2.4

  |  

Executive understands and agrees that the Employer has or will receive
Confidential Information from third parties that may be subject to additional
limitations or restrictions beyond those set forth herein. Executive agrees to

5.2.5

  |  

The Executive agrees (a) to hold Company Information in strictest confidence
and to use the Company Information solely for the benefit of the Employer, (b)
not to use, duplicate, reproduce, distribute, disclose or otherwise
disseminate Company Information or any physical embodiments thereof, except
under similar obligations of confidentiality as set forth herein and solely to
the extent necessary for the Executive to carry out his authorized duties to
the Employer, (c) not to use the Company Information for Executive's own
benefit without written consent of the Employer, and (d) not to take or fail
to take any action with respect to Company Information that would result in
any Company Information losing its character or ceasing to qualify as Company
Information or a Trade Secret. The Executive may disclose Company Information
to employees or other consultants providing services to the Employer to the
extent such disclosure is reasonably necessary and appropriate in connection
with the Executive's performance of his authorized duties to the Employer, and
provided such disclosure is not inconsistent with any instruction by the
Employer. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent disclosure
of Company Information as may be required by applicable law or regulation, or
pursuant to the valid order of a court of competent jurisdiction or an
authorized government agency, provided that the disclosure does not exceed the
extent of the disclosure required by such law, regulation or order. In the
event that the Executive is required by law, regulation or order to disclose
any Company Information, the Executive will promptly provide written notice of
any such requirement to the Employer's general counsel and, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, regulation and order, sufficiently in advance of
making any disclosure to permit the Employer to contest the requirement to
disclose such Company Information or to seek confidentiality protections, in
the Employer's sole discretion. To the extent permitted by applicable law,
regulation and order, the Executive shall not make such disclosure unless (and
then only to the extent that) the Executive has been advised by the Employer's
legal counsel that such disclosure is required by law. This Section 5.2 will
survive the termination of employment with respect to Confidential Information
for so long as it remains Confidential Information, but for no longer than
three (3) years following termination of employment. This Section 5.2 will
survive termination of employment with respect to Trade Secrets for so long as
is permitted by the then-current Maryland Trade Secrets Act.

in the event of the Executive's termination of employment for any reason,
during the period of three (3) years from and after the effective date of such

others to make, publish, or communicate, to any person or entity or in any
public forum any defamatory or disparaging remarks, comments or statements
concerning the Bank or its Affiliates, any of their respective businesses,
products, services or activities, or any of their respective current or former
officers, directors, managers, employees or agents. This Section 5.3 shall not
prohibit Executive from providing truthful testimony in response to a validly
issued subpoena.

5.4

criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for
any disclosure or trade secret that (a) is made in confidence to a federal,
state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an
attorney, solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected
violation of law; or (b) is made in a complaint or other document that is
filed under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding. Executive is not required
to seek permission of Employer or to notify Employer prior to making such
disclosures or participating in such investigation. If Executive files a
lawsuit for retaliation by the Employer for reporting a suspected violation of
law, Executive may disclose Employer's trade secrets to Executive's attorney
and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the Executive
(x) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (y) does

  |  

 _ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND REMEDIES_.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

9.1

  |  

The Executive agrees that the covenants contained in Sections 5 through 8 of
this Agreement are of the essence of this Agreement; that each of the
covenants is reasonable and necessary to protect the business, interests and
properties of the Employer; and that irreparable loss and damage will be
suffered by the Employer should the Executive breach any of the covenants.
Therefore, the Executive agrees and consents that, in addition to all the
remedies provided by law or in equity, the Employer will be entitled to a
temporary restraining order and temporary and permanent injunctions to prevent
a breach or contemplated breach of any of the covenants. The Employer and the
Executive agree that all remedies available to the Employer or the Executive,
as applicable, will be cumulative. The Executive further acknowledges and
agrees to the reasonableness of the covenants in Sections 5 through 8,
including with respect to the geographic area and duration of time which are a
part of said covenant. It is the express intent of the Parties that the Area
as defined herein is the area where the Executive performs or performed
services on behalf of the Employer under this Agreement as of, or within a
reasonable time prior to, the termination of the Executive's employment
hereunder. The Executive also acknowledges and agrees that this covenant will
not impair the Executive from becoming gainfully employed, or otherwise
earning a livelihood following termination of employment with Employer. The
Executive also acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement is supported by
adequate consideration through Executive's employment or continued employment
with Employer pursuant to this Agreement, and the benefits hereunder. The
Employer would not have entered into this Agreement or agreed to share the
Confidential Information with Executive if Executive did not agree to the
covenants in Sections 5 through 8.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

9.2

  |  

While the parties agree that the covenants in Sections 5 through are 8 are
each reasonable and necessary, if any restriction set forth in any such
section is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable
(for example, because it extends for too long a period of time, over too great
a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area), this Agreement shall
be deemed amended to the extent necessary to render the otherwise
unenforceable restriction, and the rest of the Agreement, valid and
enforceable.

   
---|--- 
  

  

 

19  

  

    

9.3

  |  

Executive's obligations under each of Section 5, Section 6, Section 7 and
Section 8 are independent, separable, and enforceable independent of each
other.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

10.

  |  

 _SEVERABILITY_. The parties agree that each of the provisions included in
this Agreement is separate, distinct and severable from the other provisions
of this Agreement and that the invalidity or unenforceability of any Agreement
provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision of this Agreement. Further, if any provision of this Agreement is
ruled invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction because of
a conflict between the provision and any applicable law or public policy, the
provision will be redrawn to make the provision consistent with and valid and
enforceable under the law or public policy.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

11.

  |  

 _NO SET-OFF BY THE EXECUTIVE_. The existence of any claim, demand, action or
cause of action by the Executive against the Employer, or any Affiliate of the
Employer, whether predicated upon this Agreement or otherwise, will not
constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Employer of any of its rights
hereunder.

occasion.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

15.

  |  

 _ARBITRATION_. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or the breach thereof, will be settled by binding arbitration in
the Area before a single arbitrator in accordance with the Employment
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator
shall have authority to grant any form of appropriate relief, whether legal or

by any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Section 15 shall limit the right of the Employer to seek
equitable relief under Section 9 (Acknowledgements and Remedies).

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

16.

  |  

 _APPLICABLE LAW_. This Agreement will be construed and enforced under and in
accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, excluding any conflicts or
choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or
interpretation of this provision to the substantive law of another
jurisdiction. The parties agree that any appropriate state court located in

arising under or in connection with this Agreement and will be a proper forum
in which to adjudicate such case or controversy. The parties consent to the

 _SECTION 409A_. The parties intend that the provisions of this Agreement
comply with or be exempt from section 409A of the Code and the regulations
thereunder (collectively, "Section 409A") and all provisions of this Agreement
shall be construed in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding
taxes or penalties under Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
in this Agreement shall be interpreted or construed to transfer any liability
for any tax (including a tax or penalty due as a result of a failure to comply
with Section 409A) from Executive to the Company or to any other individual or
entity. A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for
purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any
amounts or benefits subject to Section 409A upon or following a termination of
employment unless such termination also constitutes a "Separation from
Service" within the meaning of Section 409A and, for purposes of any such
provision of this Agreement, references to a "termination," "termination of
employment," "separation from service" or like terms shall mean Separation
from Service. Any taxable reimbursement due under the terms of this Agreement
shall be paid no later than December 31 of the year after the year in which
the expense is incurred and shall comply with Treasury Regulation §
1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv). To the extent necessary to avoid a violation of Section
409A, an event will only constitute a "Change in Control" within the meaning
of this Agreement if such event also qualifies as a change in control event
within the meaning of Section 409A.

terminated and superseded.

 _EFFECTIVENESS_. This Agreement shall become effective only upon the
consummation of the Merger, at which time this Agreement shall supersede any

Agreement shall become null and void in all respects.

21.

  |

from releasing the Executive of the Executive's normal duties and suspending
the Executive, with pay, during the pendency of any investigation or

continuation of the Agreement is necessary for the continued operation of the
Bank:

amend the amount or timing of such payment to comply with such regulatory
requirements, including the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 1828(k) and 12 C.F.R.
part 359.

value of which maximizes the aggregate present value of Parachute Payments
without causing such Parachute Payments to exceed the 280G limit.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

For purposes of this Section 3.9, "present value" shall be determined in
accordance with Code section 280G(d)(4), and the "280G limit" is the amount
that can be paid under this Agreement or otherwise without causing any amount
to be nondeductible under Code Section 280G or subject to excise tax under
Code section 4999. All determinations required to be made under this Section
3.9, including the aggregate present value of Parachute Payments, whether a
reduction is required under Section 3.9(b) and the amount of such reduction,
shall be made in reasonable good faith by the Company's Chief Financial
Officer (or senior executive of the Company having responsibility for the
Company's accounting function) or his or her designee, who shall provide
detailed supporting calculations both to the Employer and the Executive within
10 business days of Executive's termination of employment (or such other
relevant payment triggering date).

5.2.1

  |  

Executive understands and acknowledges that during the course of employment by
the Employer, he will have access to and learn about Company Information.
Executive further understands and acknowledges that such Company Information
and the Employer's ability to reserve the Company Information for the
exclusive knowledge and use of the Employer is of great competitive importance
and commercial value to the Employer, and that improper use or disclosure of
the Company Information by Executive shall cause the Employer irreparable
harm, for which remedies at law will not be adequate, and may also cause the
Employer to incur financial costs, loss of business advantage, liability under
confidentiality agreements with third parties, civil damages or criminal
penalties.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

5.2.2

  |  

Executive understands and agrees that Company Information developed by
Executive in the course of Executive's employment by Employer shall be subject

Company Information to Executive in the first instance.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

5.2.3

  |  

Nothing herein shall be construed to grant any right or license to Executive
in or to any Company Information or Employer Materials other than the right to
use such Company Information and Employer Materials on behalf of the Employer
in accordance with the terms hereof. Employer shall not cause or permit any
reverse engineering, decompilation or disassembly of any Company Information
or Employer Materials. Executive shall, during the course of his employment,
adopt and maintain programs and procedures which are reasonably calculated to
protect the confidentiality of the Company Information and Employer Materials
and shall be responsible to the Employer for any disclosure or misuse of the
Company Information and Employer Materials which results from a failure to
comply with this Agreement.

   
---|---

5.2.4

  |  

Executive understands and agrees that the Employer has or will receive
Confidential Information from third parties that may be subject to additional

5.2.5

  |  

The Executive agrees (a) to hold Company Information in strictest confidence
and to use the Company Information solely for the benefit of the Employer, (b)
not to use, duplicate, reproduce, distribute, disclose or otherwise
disseminate Company Information or any physical embodiments thereof, except
under similar obligations of confidentiality as set forth herein and solely to
the extent necessary for the Executive to carry out his authorized duties to
the Employer, (c) not to use the Company Information for Executive's own
benefit without written consent of the Employer, and (d) not to take or fail
to take any action with respect to Company Information that would result in
any Company Information losing its character or ceasing to qualify as Company
Information or a Trade Secret. The Executive may disclose Company Information
to employees or other consultants providing services to the Employer to the
extent such disclosure is reasonably necessary and appropriate in connection
with the Executive's performance of his authorized duties to the Employer, and
provided such disclosure is not inconsistent with any instruction by the
Employer. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent disclosure
of Company Information as may be required by applicable law or regulation, or
pursuant to the valid order of a court of competent jurisdiction or an
authorized government agency, provided that the disclosure does not exceed the
extent of the disclosure required by such law, regulation or order. In the
event that the Executive is required by law, regulation or order to disclose
any Company Information, the Executive will promptly provide written notice of
any such requirement to the Employer's general counsel and, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, regulation and order, sufficiently in advance of
making any disclosure to permit the Employer to contest the requirement to
disclose such Company Information or to seek confidentiality protections, in
the Employer's sole discretion. To the extent permitted by applicable law,
regulation and order, the Executive shall not make such disclosure unless (and
then only to the extent that) the Executive has been advised by the Employer's
legal counsel that such disclosure is required by law. This Section 5.2 will
survive the termination of employment with respect to Confidential Information
for so long as it remains Confidential Information, but for no longer than
three (3) years following termination of employment. This Section 5.2 will
survive termination of employment with respect to Trade Secrets for so long as
is permitted by the then-current Maryland Trade Secrets Act.

during the period of three (3) years from and after the effective date of such

others to make, publish, or communicate, to any person or entity or in any
public forum any defamatory or disparaging remarks, comments or statements
concerning the Bank or its Affiliates, any of their respective businesses,
products, services or activities, or any of their respective current or former
officers, directors, managers, employees or agents. This Section 5.3 shall not
prohibit Executive from providing truthful testimony in response to a validly
issued subpoena.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

5.4

  |  

 _Notice of Immunity/Defend Trade Secrets Act_. Executive will not be held
criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for
any disclosure or trade secret that (a) is made in confidence to a federal,
state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an
attorney, solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected
violation of law; or (b) is made in a complaint or other document that is
filed under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding. Executive is not required
to seek permission of Employer or to notify Employer prior to making such
disclosures or participating in such investigation. If Executive files a
lawsuit for retaliation by the Employer for reporting a suspected violation of
law, Executive may disclose Employer's trade secrets to Executive's attorney
and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the Executive
(x) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (y) does
not disclose the trade secret except pursuant to court order.

7.

  |

hereunder and, in the event of the Executive's termination of employment for
any reason, during the period of one (1) year from and after the effective

  |  

 _ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND REMEDIES_.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

9.1

  |  

The Executive agrees that the covenants contained in Sections 5 through 8 of
this Agreement are of the essence of this Agreement; that each of the
covenants is reasonable and necessary to protect the business, interests and
properties of the Employer; and that irreparable loss and damage will be
suffered by the Employer should the Executive breach any of the covenants.
Therefore, the Executive agrees and consents that, in addition to all the
remedies provided by law or in equity, the Employer will be entitled to a
temporary restraining order and temporary and permanent injunctions to prevent
a breach or contemplated breach of any of the covenants. The Employer and the
Executive agree that all remedies available to the Employer or the Executive,
as applicable, will be cumulative. The Executive further acknowledges and
agrees to the reasonableness of the covenants in Sections 5 through 8,
including with respect to the geographic area and duration of time which are a
part of said covenant. It is the express intent of the Parties that the Area
as defined herein is the area where the Executive performs or performed
services on behalf of the Employer under this Agreement as of, or within a
reasonable time prior to, the termination of the Executive's employment
hereunder. The Executive also acknowledges and agrees that this covenant will
not impair the Executive from becoming gainfully employed, or otherwise
earning a livelihood following termination of employment with Employer. The
Executive also acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement is supported by
adequate consideration through Executive's employment or continued employment
with Employer pursuant to this Agreement, and the benefits hereunder. The
Employer would not have entered into this Agreement or agreed to share the
Confidential Information with Executive if Executive did not agree to the
covenants in Sections 5 through 8.

   
---|--- 
  

  

 

17  

  

    

9.2

  |  

While the parties agree that the covenants in Sections 5 through are 8 are
each reasonable and necessary, if any restriction set forth in any such
section is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable
(for example, because it extends for too long a period of time, over too great
a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area), this Agreement shall
be deemed amended to the extent necessary to render the otherwise
unenforceable restriction, and the rest of the Agreement, valid and
enforceable.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

9.3

  |  

Executive's obligations under each of Section 5, Section 6, Section 7 and
Section 8 are independent, separable, and enforceable independent of each
other.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

10.

  |  

 _SEVERABILITY_. The parties agree that each of the provisions included in
this Agreement is separate, distinct and severable from the other provisions
of this Agreement and that the invalidity or unenforceability of any Agreement
provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision of this Agreement. Further, if any provision of this Agreement is
ruled invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction because of
a conflict between the provision and any applicable law or public policy, the
provision will be redrawn to make the provision consistent with and valid and
enforceable under the law or public policy.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

11.

  |  

 _NO SET-OFF BY THE EXECUTIVE_. The existence of any claim, demand, action or
cause of action by the Executive against the Employer, or any Affiliate of the
Employer, whether predicated upon this Agreement or otherwise, will not
constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Employer of any of its rights
hereunder.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

12.

  |

or be construed as a waiver of the same or another breach on a subsequent
occasion.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

15.

  |  

 _ARBITRATION_. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or the breach thereof, will be settled by binding arbitration in
the Area before a single arbitrator in accordance with the Employment
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator
shall have authority to grant any form of appropriate relief, whether legal or
equitable in nature. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on the
parties, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
by any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Section 15 shall limit the right of the Employer to seek
equitable relief under Section 9 (Acknowledgements and Remedies).

   
---|--- 
  

  

 

19  

  

    

16.

  |  

 _APPLICABLE LAW_. This Agreement will be construed and enforced under and in
accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, excluding any conflicts or
choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or
interpretation of this provision to the substantive law of another
jurisdiction. The parties agree that any appropriate state court located in
Howard County, Maryland, will have jurisdiction of any case or controversy
arising under or in connection with this Agreement and will be a proper forum
in which to adjudicate such case or controversy. The parties consent to the
jurisdiction of such courts, subject to the requirement to arbitrate set forth
in Section 15.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

17.

  |

Employer and the Executive. The headings in this Agreement are only for

references to paragraphs, subparagraphs, sections or subsections are to those
parts of this Agreement, unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary.

the singular and the singular includes the plural; (ii) "includes" and
"including" are each "without limitation"; (iii) "herein," "hereof,"

subsection; and (vi) all pronouns and any variations thereof shall be deemed
to refer to the masculine, feminine, neuter, singular or plural as the

  |  

 _SECTION 409A_. The parties intend that the provisions of this Agreement
comply with or be exempt from section 409A of the Code and the regulations
thereunder (collectively, "Section 409A") and all provisions of this Agreement
shall be construed in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding
taxes or penalties under Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
in this Agreement shall be interpreted or construed to transfer any liability
for any tax (including a tax or penalty due as a result of a failure to comply
with Section 409A) from Executive to the Company or to any other individual or
entity. A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for
purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any
amounts or benefits subject to Section 409A upon or following a termination of
employment unless such termination also constitutes a "Separation from
Service" within the meaning of Section 409A and, for purposes of any such
provision of this Agreement, references to a "termination," "termination of
employment," "separation from service" or like terms shall mean Separation
from Service. Any taxable reimbursement due under the terms of this Agreement
shall be paid no later than December 31 of the year after the year in which
the expense is incurred and shall comply with Treasury Regulation §
1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv). To the extent necessary to avoid a violation of Section
409A, an event will only constitute a "Change in Control" within the meaning
of this Agreement if such event also qualifies as a change in control event
within the meaning of Section 409A.

consummation of the Merger, at which time this Agreement shall supersede any
