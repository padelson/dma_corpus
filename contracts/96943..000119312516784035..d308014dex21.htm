2 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and in accordance
with Section 302A.611, Subd. 1(d), of the MBCA, the Articles of Incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in their entirety
to read as set forth in _Exhibit_ _ _ _A_ and, as so amended and restated,
shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law;

 

(b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated in their entirety to read as set forth in _Exhibit_ _ _
_B_ and, as so amended and restated, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law; and

 

(c) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and each director
shall serve until such directors successor is elected and has qualified or
until the earlier death, resignation, removal or disqualification of such
director in accordance with the MBCA. The officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving

Section 2.4 _Conversion of Shares_ _; Conversion of Merger Sub Common
Stock_.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any shareholder of
the Company:

(i) any Shares then held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company
shall be converted into one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation;

 

(ii) any Shares then held by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent shall be converted into one (1) fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation;

(iii) except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above and subject to
_Section_ _ _ _2.4(b)_ , each Share then issued and outstanding (including any
Restricted Shares but not including any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive a cash amount equal to $56.00, without interest
thereon (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section_ _ _ _2.8_ ;

 

(iv) each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub
then issued and outstanding shall be converted into one (1) fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, all Shares converted pursuant to _Section_ _ _
_2.4(a)(iii)_ shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any certificates
evidencing such Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor.

 



3 Section 2.5 _Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to which holders of such Shares
shall become entitled pursuant to this Agreement. Prior to the Closing, Parent
shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent sufficient funds
to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares
(other than Shares cancelled or converted pursuant to _Sections_ _2.4(a)(i)_
and _2.4(a)(ii)_ and Dissenting Shares) (the " _Payment Fund_ "). With
respect to any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall only be required to deposit or
cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Dissenting Shares
if the holder thereof fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its
right to dissent under the MBCA. To the extent the Payment Fund diminishes for
any reason below the level required to make prompt payment of the amounts
described in the preceding sentence, Parent and Merger Sub shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the lost
portion of such fund so as to ensure that it is maintained at a level
sufficient to make such payments. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) no such
investment or losses thereon shall relieve Parent from making the payments
required by this  _Article_ _ _ _II_ or affect the amount of Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the Shares and following any losses Parent
shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent in the amount of
any such losses and (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could
prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Any and all
interest or other amounts earned with respect to such funds shall be paid to
Parent or its designee. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying
Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares and the payment of the
Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled
to receive any Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section_ _ _ _2.4(a)(iii)_
(i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon (A) surrender to the
Paying Agent of Certificates, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such
instructions, or (B) receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the applicable Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced
by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, and such
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall then be cancelled. No
interest shall accrue or be paid on the applicable Merger Consideration
payable upon the

 



4  surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the
holder thereof. If the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates
formerly evidencing Shares are registered on the stock transfer books of the
Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder
of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction
of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to
Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered.

(c) At any time following the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the
Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares (including all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent
in respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders
shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and other similar Law) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by
them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for the applicable Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such
share to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not
been surrendered or transferred prior to the date on which the applicable
Merger Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Entity, then any such Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares.

 

(e) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to Shares shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided
herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Paying Agent for surrender or transfer, as applicable, it shall be
cancelled and, subject to compliance with this _Section_ _ _ _2.5_ , exchanged
for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof
is entitled pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _2.5_.

 



5 (f) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon
the making of an effective affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, which includes an agreement to
indemnify and defend and hold harmless Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent from and against any and all costs, claims, losses,
judgments, damages, counsel fees, expenses and liabilities whatsoever which
each may suffer, sustain or incur in connection with (i) the inaccuracy of any
statement or the breach of any representation or warranty set forth in such
affidavit, and (ii) any payment for or transfer, exchange or delivery of such
Certificate and such Persons inability to locate such Certificate, and, if
required by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section_ _ _ _2.8_ ) equal to the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Shares formerly represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate.

Section 2.6 _Dissenters_ __ _Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held of record or
beneficially by a Person who has not voted in favor of approval of the Merger
and adoption of the Plan of Merger and who is entitled to demand and properly
demands dissenters rights with respect to such Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_
") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Sections 302A.471 and
302A.473 of the MBCA (the " _Dissenters_ __ _Rights_ "), shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration for
such Dissenting Shares but instead shall be entitled only to payment of the
fair value (including interest determined in accordance with Section 302A.473
of the MBCA) of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Dissenters
Rights; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to dissent under (or a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to receive fair value pursuant to) the Dissenters Rights, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting
Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable
solely for the right to receive, the Merger Consideration, upon surrender of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with _Section_ _ _ _2.5_ , without
interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law.

(b) The Company shall provide prompt notice to Parent of any demands,

by holders of Shares (other than (a) any wholly owned Subsidiary of the

copy of which opinion has been or will be provided to Parent promptly

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_

 

 _OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_

 

Except as disclosed in the applicable section of the disclosure schedule
delivered by Parent to the Company immediately prior to the execution of this
Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being agreed that
disclosure of any item in any section of the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall
be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section of this Agreement
to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure), Parent and Merger Sub jointly represent and warrant to the
Company as set forth below.

 

Section 4.1 _Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc_. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and,

presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as
a foreign corporation or other entity in each jurisdiction where
the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of
its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
organized, validly existing, qualified or, where relevant, in good standing,
or to have such power and authority, would not have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other
equity interests in, Merger Sub are owned directly or indirectly by Parent.

 

Section 4.2 _Corporate Authority Relative to this Agreement; No
Violation_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub have all requisite corporate power and authority
to enter into this Agreement to consummate the Transactions, including the
Merger. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by Parents board of
directors and, except for the filing of the Articles of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota, no other corporate proceedings
on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the
consummation of the Transactions. Parent, as sole shareholder of Merger Sub,
has duly executed and delivered to Merger Sub a written consent approving the
Merger and adopting the Plan of Merger, such written consent by its terms to
become effective immediately following the execution of this Agreement. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and
Merger Sub and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding
agreement of the Company, constitutes the valid and binding agreement of
Parent and Merger Sub, Enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub.

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent or
Merger Sub nor the performance or consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the
Transactions will (i) result in a violation or breach of or conflict with the
articles of incorporation, bylaws or other

 



26  charter documents of Parent or Merger Sub; (ii) result in a modification,
violation or breach of, increased liability or payment obligations arising
under or conflict with any provisions of, or result in the loss of any
material benefit under or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the
termination or cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase
(including pursuant to any right of first refusal or the like) under, or
accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or
acceleration under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets owned or operated by Parent or Merger Sub under, any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to which Parent or Merger
Sub is a party or by which Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound; or (iii) subject to obtaining or making
the Consents referred to in _Section_ _ _ _4.2(c)_ below, violate any order or
judgment or Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
properties or assets other than any such event or events described in items
(ii) or (iii) that would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) No consent, approval, authorization, filing or registration with,
notice to or permit of any Governmental Entity is necessary to be obtained or
made by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent in connection
with Parents or Merger Subs execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the Transactions, except for (i) the
filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Minnesota and appropriate corresponding documents with the appropriate
authorities of other states in which the Company is qualified as a
foreign corporation to transact business; (ii) the filing with the SEC of any
reports, forms or documents that may be required of Parent by the Exchange Act

Sections 13 or 16 of the Exchange Act as may be required in connection with
this Agreement and the Transactions; (iii) compliance with the rules of
NASDAQ; (iv) such consent, approval, authorization or permit as may be
required under any applicable foreign or state securities, "blue sky" or
takeover law; (v) such consents, approvals, authorizations, filings,
registration, notices or permits as may be required under the HSR Act; and
(vi) such other consents, approvals, authorizations, filings, registrations,
notices or permits which if not obtained or made would not have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(d) Parent has no knowledge of any fact relating to its or any of its
affiliates respective businesses, operations, financial condition or legal
status, including any officers, directors or current employees status, that
might reasonably be expected to impair the ability of the Parties to this
Agreement to obtain, on a timely basis, any consent, approval, authorization
or permit necessary for the consummation of the Transactions.

 

Section 4.3 _Compliance with Law; Permits_. Parent and Merger Sub are in
compliance with and is not in default under or in violation of any Laws,
applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective properties or
assets, except where such noncompliance, default or violation would not have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.4 _Information Supplied_. None of the information with respect
to Parent or Merger Sub supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent
or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will, at the time of the
filing of, at the time of any amendment of or supplement to, and at the time
of any publication, distribution or dissemination of, the Proxy Statement,
and at the time of the Company Shareholder Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of



 



27  a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

Section 4.5 _Sufficiency of Funds_ _; Solvency_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies
of an executed debt financing commitment letter in effect as of the date
hereof, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto, and
each fee letter associated therewith (collectively, the " _Fee Letter_ ," and
together with such debt financing commitment letter, the " _Debt Commitment
Letter_ ") (it being understood that the Fee Letter may be customarily
redacted; provided, however, that no provisions that, or that could reasonably
be expected to, adversely affect the availability of or impose additional
conditions on, the availability of the Debt Financing at the Effective Time
may be redacted) from the Lenders pursuant to which such Lenders have
committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions therein, debt
financing in the amounts set forth therein for the purposes of financing the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and related fees and expenses and
the refinancing of certain outstanding indebtedness of Parent (the " _Debt
Financing_ "). There are no side letters or other agreements, contracts,
understandings or arrangements that could affect the availability of the Debt
Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and
the Fee Letter delivered to the Company pursuant to this _Section 4.5(a)_.

(b) As of the date of this Agreement: (i) the Debt Commitment Letter is in
full force and effect and is the legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, and, to the knowledge
of Parent and Merger Sub, each of the other parties thereto; (ii) the Debt
Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified in any respect and no such
amendment or modification is contemplated or pending (other than amendments or
modifications to the Debt Commitment Letter solely to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents and similar entities); and (iii)
the commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been
withdrawn, terminated, reduced or rescinded in any respect and no such
withdrawal, termination, reduction or rescission is contemplated by Parent or
Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, any of the other
parties thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has paid in full any
and all fees (including commitment fees and other fees) required to be paid
under the Debt Commitment Letter that are payable on or prior to the date of
this Agreement, and Parent is unaware of any fact or occurrence existing on
the date of this Agreement that could reasonably be expected to make any of
the assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter inaccurate or that could reasonably be expected to cause the Debt
Commitment Letter to be ineffective. As of the date of this Agreement, there
are no conditions precedent or other contingencies (including pursuant to any
"flex" provisions in the Fee Letter or otherwise) related to the funding of
the full amount (or any portion) of the Debt Financing except as expressly set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.

 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which (with or
without notice, lapse of time or both) could reasonably be expected to
constitute a failure to satisfy a condition precedent by Parent or Merger Sub
or any of their respective affiliates or, to the knowledge of Parent or Merger
Sub, any other party thereto under the Debt Commitment 

 



28  Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has
any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any
of the conditions that are required to be satisfied by it as a condition to
the obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter prior to the expiration
thereof, or that the full amount of the Debt Financing will not be available
in full to Parent and Merger Sub at the Acceptance Time and the Effective
Time, nor does Parent or Merger Sub have knowledge or reason to believe that
any of the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter will not perform their
respective obligations thereunder.

 

(d) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_
and _Section 7.2_ and that the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with
the Debt Commitment Letter, the net proceeds contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter together with any cash on the balance sheet of Parent, will,
in the aggregate, constitute the funds necessary to consummate the Merger and
the other Transactions, including payment in cash of the aggregate Merger
Consideration and amounts payable to holders of the Company Options in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and to pay all related fees
and expenses required to be paid by Parent and Merger Sub, and to perform
their other respective obligations, under this Agreement.

 

(e) Without limiting _Section_ _ _ _6.7_ , in no event shall the receipt or
availability of any funds or financing by or to Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective affiliates or any other financing transaction, regardless of
the accuracy of the representations or the accuracy or realization of the
assumptions set forth in this  _Section_ _ _ _4.5_ , be a condition to any of
the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder.

 

(f) None of the funds to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this
Agreement will (i) be derived from, or related to, any activity that is
deemed criminal or subject to sanctions under applicable Law or (ii) cause the
Company or any of its shareholders to be in violation of any applicable Law,
including in each case the United States Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, the United
States Money Laundering Control Act of 1986, the United States International
Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorism Financing Act of 2001, or any
sanctions administered by any Governmental Entity.

 

(g) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_
and _Section 7.2_ , the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in _Article III_ , immediately following the Closing, Parent
and Surviving Corporation will be, individually and on a consolidated basis,
Solvent after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or by Parent or any of its affiliates.

Section 4.6 _Investigations; Litigation_. (a) As of the date of this
Agreement, there is no investigation or review pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or any of
its properties, rights or assets, and (b) there are no claims, actions, suits
or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against
Parent or any of its properties, rights or assets before, and there are no
orders, judgments or decrees of, any Governmental Entity, which, in the case
of clause (a) or (b), would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, challenge
the validity or propriety of the Merger or otherwise seek to prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Merger or performance by Parent and
Merger Sub of their obligations under this Agreement.

 



29 Section 4.7 _Finders and Brokers_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has
employed or entered into any Contract with any investment banker, broker or
finder in connection with the Transactions who would be entitled to any fee or
any commission in connection with or upon consummation of the Merger for
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary would be responsible.

Section 4.8 _Stock Ownership_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or Parents
affiliates (other than, with respect to clause (a), the Teleflex Incorporated
Retirement Income Plan) or associates (a) directly or indirectly owns,
beneficially or otherwise, any Shares; (b) is, or has at any time during the
four (4) years preceding the date hereof been, an "interested shareholder"
under Section 302A.011, Subd. 49, of the MBCA; or (c) is party to any
agreement, arrangement, or understanding that would be required to be
disclosed under Item 1005(e) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 4.9 _No Merger Sub Activity_. Merger Sub was formed solely for the
purpose of engaging in the Transactions and, except for obligations or
liabilities incurred in connection with its incorporation or organization and
the Transactions, Merger Sub has not and will not prior to the Closing Date
have incurred, directly or indirectly, through any other Subsidiary or
affiliate of Parent or otherwise, any obligations or liabilities or have
engaged in any business activities or conducted any operations of any type
whatsoever (other than in connection with the Transactions). Parent
owns beneficially and of record all of the outstanding capital stock of
Merger Sub.

Section 4.10 _No Other Representations_. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in Article III, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge
that neither the Company nor any Subsidiary or Representative of the Company
makes, and Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that neither of them has relied
upon or otherwise been induced by, any other express or implied representation
or warranty with respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
with respect to any other information provided or made available to Parent
and Merger Sub in connection with the Transactions, including any information,
documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available to Parent
or to Parents Representatives in connection with the entry into this
Agreement or the Transactions.

33  purposes of this _Section_ _ _ _5.2_ , the term " _Person_ " includes any
Person or "group," as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act,

Subsidiaries and the Companys Representatives may in any event (A) seek to
clarify and understand the terms and conditions of any bona fide, written
Company Competing Proposal (or amended proposal) that did not result from a
material breach of _Section 5.2(a)_ solely to determine whether such Company
Competing Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Company Superior Proposal and (B) inform a Person that has made a Company
Competing Proposal of the provisions of this _Section_ _ _ _5.2_ , in each
case, so long as the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Companys
Representatives otherwise comply with this _Section_ _ _ _5.2_ in connection
therewith. The Company shall not terminate, waive, amend or modify any
provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement to which the Company
is a party, in each case, with respect to the submission of any Company

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section_ _ _ _5.2(a)_ ,
if the Company receives, prior to the time the Required Company Shareholder
Vote is obtained, a bona fide, written Company Competing Proposal from any
Person that did not result from a material breach of _Section 5.2(a)_ , which
the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with the
Companys outside legal and financial advisors (i) constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal or (ii) could reasonably be expected to result, after the
taking of any of the actions referred to in either of clause (x) or (y)
below, in a Company Superior Proposal, then in either event, with respect to
such Company Competing Proposal or Person, prior to the time the Required
Company Shareholder Vote is obtained, the Company may take the
following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the Person making
such Company Competing Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such
information, the Company receives from such Person an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement and any such nonpublic information has previously
been provided to Parent or its Representatives or is provided to Parent prior
to or substantially concurrently with the time such information or data is
provided to such Person and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with
such Person with respect to the Company Competing Proposal.

 

(c) The Company shall notify Parent orally and in writing promptly (but in
any event within two (2) days) (i) after receipt of any Company Competing
Proposal (or any proposal or offer that constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Company Competing Proposal), which notice shall include
the identity of the Person making such proposal or offer and copies of all
proposals, offers and drafts of proposed agreements related thereto, (ii) of
any change to the financial or other material terms and conditions of any
Company Competing Proposal and the Company shall otherwise keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status of any such Company Competing Proposal
(including by providing copies of all proposals, offers and drafts of proposed
agreements related thereto that have not already been provided pursuant to
clause (i) above) and (iii) after receipt of any request for non-public
information relating to it or any Company Subsidiary or for access to its or
any of the Company Subsidiaries properties, books or records by any Person in
connection with a Company Competing Proposal or a proposal or offer that
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Competing Proposal. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall, after the date of this
Agreement, enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement that would
prohibit it from providing such information to Parent.

 



34 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ _ _ _5.2_  to the contrary,
at any time prior to the time the Required Company Shareholder Vote is
obtained, the Company Board may make a Company Change of Recommendation (i) in
response to a Company Intervening Event, or (ii) a Company Superior Proposal,
in each case, if and only if, with respect to each of clauses (i) and (ii),
the Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company Board
under applicable Minnesota Law and the Company first complies with _Section_ _
_ _5.2(e)_.

 

(e) Prior to the Company taking any action permitted (i) under _Section_ _
_ _5.2(d)_ _(i)_ , the Company shall provide Parent with four (4) Business
Days prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to effect a Company
Change of Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons
therefor (including the material facts and circumstances related to the
applicable Company Intervening Event), and during such four (4) Business Day
period, (x) the Company shall negotiate, and cause its Representatives to
negotiate, with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent
Parent wishes to negotiate) to enable Parent to determine whether to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would obviate the need
for the Company Board to make a Company Change of Recommendation, (y) the
Company shall consider in good faith any proposal by Parent to amend the terms
and conditions of this Agreement in a manner that would obviate the need to
effect a Company Change of Recommendation and (z) at the end of the four (4)
Business Day period described above, and taking into account any changes to
this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company, the Company Board has
determined in good faith after consultation with the Companys outside

Minnesota Law even if such changes proposed by Parent were given effect or
(ii) under  _Section_ _ _ _5.2(d)_ _(ii)_ , the Company shall provide Parent
with four (4) Business Days prior written notice (it being understood and
agreed that any change or amendment to the financial or other material

Board intends to take such action and contemporaneously providing to Parent a
copy of the Company Superior Proposal, a copy of any proposed agreements for
such Company Superior Proposal (including any financing commitments related
thereto) (or, in each case, if not provided in writing to the Company or any
of its Representatives, a written summary of the terms thereof), and during
such five (5) Business Day period (or any subsequent two (2) Business Day
period), (x) the Company shall negotiate, and cause its Representatives to
negotiate, with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent
Parent wishes to negotiate) to enable Parent to determine whether to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement related to
the Transactions such that such Company Competing Proposal would no longer
constitute a Company Superior Proposal, (y) the Company shall consider in good
faith any proposal by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of
this Agreement or any other agreement related to the Transactions such that
such Company Competing Proposal would no longer constitute a Company Superior
Proposal and (z) at the end of such five (5) Business Day period, and taking
into account any changes to the terms of this

would continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal even if such changes
proposed by Parent were given effect.

Company Board from (i) disclosing to the Companys shareholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or

Section 6.2 _Access; Confidentiality; Notice of Certain Events_.

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the Company shall, and Company shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all of
their respective properties, offices, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, the Company
shall, and Company shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, furnish
reasonably promptly to Parent and its Representatives all information
(financial or otherwise) concerning its business, properties and personnel as
such other Party may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall not be required by this _Section 6.2_ to provide Parent, Merger
Sub or their Representatives with access to or to disclose information (A)
that such Party or its Representatives is prohibited from providing under the
terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement or entered into after the date of this Agreement
in the ordinary course of business and not otherwise in breach of this
Agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to 

 



37  obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or disclosure
or make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure
not in violation of any such confidentiality agreement), (B) the disclosure
of which would violate any applicable Law or legal duty ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the withholding Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure not in violation of any such Law or duty) or (C) that is subject to
any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum
extent that does not result in a loss of any such attorney-client, attorney
work product or other legal privilege). Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses
of the Company that may result from the requests for access, data and
information hereunder.

 

(b) Parent shall hold, and shall cause its Representatives and affiliates
to hold, any nonpublic information, including any information exchanged
pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ , in confidence to the extent required by and
in accordance with, and shall otherwise comply with, the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such Party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger or other Transactions, or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Merger or the other Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication
or the failure of such Party to obtain such consent could be material to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) of any Legal
Proceeding commenced or, to any Partys knowledge, threatened against, such
Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates or otherwise relating to,
involving or affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, in
each case in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or other Transactions, (iii) any notice or other
communication received by the Company from any Person requesting the convening
of a meeting of the shareholders of the Company and (iv) upon becoming aware
of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or circumstance
relating to it or any of the Company Subsidiaries which would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or which would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay or impede the consummation of the Transactions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section_ _ _ _6.2(c)_ shall not cure any breach of any representation or
warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this
Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to
any Party. The failure to deliver any such notice shall not affect any of the
conditions set forth in _Article_ _ _ _VII_ or give rise to any right to
terminate under _Article_ _ _ _VIII_ , except for any such failure that
constitutes a Willful Breach of this Agreement.

Section 6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party shall
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions as
soon as practicable after the date hereof, including (i) preparing and

 



38  filing, in consultation with the other Party and as promptly as practicable
and advisable after the date hereof, all documentation to effect all necessary
applications, notices, petitions, filings, and other documents and to use its
best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable all waiting period
expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders,
registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable
to be obtained by such Party from any third party or any Governmental Entity
in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other Transactions and (ii)
using its reasonable best efforts to take all steps as may be necessary to
obtain all such waiting period expirations or terminations, consents,
clearances, waivers, licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, orders
and approvals.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ _ _ _6.3(a)_ , as promptly
as practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in no event later than
the tenth (10th) Business Day after the date hereof), each of Parent and the
Company shall file and not withdraw (i) any Notification and Report Forms and
related material required to be filed by it with the Federal Trade Commission
and the United States Department of Justice, as applicable, pursuant to the
HSR Act, together with a request for early termination of the
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, and (ii) the filings set forth
on _Section 6.3(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules that are required to
be made by it with any Governmental Entity under any other applicable Laws
that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or
significant impediments or lessening of competition or creation or
strengthening of a dominant position through merger or acquisition, and shall
promptly make any further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary.

(c) If Parent or the Company (or any of their respective affiliates)
receives a request for additional information from any Governmental Entity
that is related to the Transactions, then such Party shall endeavor in good
faith to make, or cause to be made, and after consultation with the other
Party, an appropriate response to such request. No Party shall participate in
any meeting or engage in any material substantive conversation with any
Governmental Entity relating to the Transactions without giving the other
Party prior notice of the meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by
such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend or participate. Parent
shall advise the Company promptly of any understandings, undertakings or
agreements (oral or written) which Parent proposes to make or enter into with
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to resolve any objections that may be asserted with respect to the
Transactions under any Antitrust Law as promptly as practicable.

 

(d) Parent shall take, and shall cause its affiliates to take (and, with
the prior written consent of Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries and
affiliates shall be permitted to take, without affecting any representation,
warranty, covenant or condition in this Agreement), all action necessary to
avoid the entry or to effect the dissolution of, or vacate or lift, any
judgment or order that would otherwise have the effect of preventing,
impairing or delaying the Closing; provided that nothing in this Agreement
shall require (or be deemed to require) Parent or any of its affiliates to
agree to or take any action with respect to the matters set forth in this
Section 6.3 that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on (x) the financial condition or
result of operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (y) the anticipated economic benefit or value that

 



39  Parent reasonably expects to be realized from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and its affiliates shall
not be required (and Parent shall not require the Company or its Subsidiaries
to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to), take any
action with respect to any order or any applicable Law which is not
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.

 

Section 6.4 _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither
the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective affiliates or
Representatives, shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or
other public announcement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless such Party determines,
after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required by applicable Law
or by any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a national
securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause the publication of
any press release or other public announcement with respect to the Merger,
this Agreement or the other Transactions, in which event such Party shall
endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a
meaningful opportunity to the other Party to review and comment upon such
press release or other announcement as far in advance as practicable and shall
give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that without limiting any of its
obligations under _Section 5.2_, the Company shall not be required by this
_Section 6.4_ to provide any such review or comment to Parent in connection
with the receipt and existence of a Company Competing Proposal or a Company
Change of Recommendation and matters related thereto; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that each Party and their respective affiliates or Representatives may make
statements that are not inconsistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made by Parent or the Company in compliance
with this _Section 6.4_ (so long as such disclosure is still accurate).

Section 6.5 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance
and Indemnification_. For not less than six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and
hold harmless all past and present directors and officers of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
against any costs or expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any actual or threatened
claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted by Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
Indemnified Party agrees in advance to return any such funds to which a court
of competent jurisdiction has determined in a final, nonappealable judgment
such Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any actual or threatened claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding in
respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior
to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection
with the approval of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger or any of
the other Transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, in connection with such persons serving as an officer or
director of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or serving at
the request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another Person, to the fullest extent permitted
by Law or provided pursuant to the Company Governing Documents or the
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or any other agreement, if
any, in existence on the date of this Agreement. The Parties agree that for
six (6) years after the Effective Time all rights to elimination or limitation
of liability, indemnification and

 



 



40  advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the Indemnified
Parties as provided in the Company Governing Documents or the organizational
documents of any Company Subsidiary or any other agreement shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For six (6) years after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide to the Indemnified
Parties the same rights as provided to the Indemnified Parties on the date of
this Agreement under the provisions in the Company Governing Documents and
the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, in each case,
regarding elimination or limitation of liability, indemnification of officers,
directors, employees and agents or other fiduciaries and advancement of
expenses that are in existence on the date of this Agreement, and the
Surviving Corporations organizational documents shall not contain any
provisions contradictory or otherwise adverse to such rights or be amended,
modified or repealed in any manner that would adversely affect the rights or
protections thereunder of any such Indemnified Party in respect of acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval
of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
Transactions) without the consent of such Indemnified Party. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for an aggregate period of not
less than six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Companys current
directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides
coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D
andO Insurance_") that is no less favorable than the Companys existing policy
as of the date of this Agreement or, if insurance coverage that is no less
favorable is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the
last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement or, if less, the
cost of a policy providing coverage on the same terms as the Companys
existing policy as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that, at Parents option, in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, the
Company or Surviving Corporation may at or prior to the Effective Time
substitute therefor a single premium tail coverage with respect to DandO
Insurance with an annual cost not in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of
the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ _ _ _6.5_ to the contrary, if any
Indemnified Party notifies Parent on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person may seek
indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _6.5_ , the provisions of
this  _Section_ _ _ _6.5_ that require the Surviving Corporation to indemnify
and advance expenses shall continue in effect with respect to such matter
until the final disposition of all claims, actions, investigations, suits
and proceedings relating thereto. In the event Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ _ _ _6.5_.
The rights and obligations under this _Section_ _ _ _6.5_ shall survive
consummation of the Merger and, following the Effective Time, shall not be
terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Party
without the written consent of such Indemnified Party. The provisions of
this  _Section_ _ _ _6.5_ are intended to be, following the Effective Time,
for the benefit of, and shall be Enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his
or her heirs and his or her legal representatives.

 



41 Section 6.6 _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, use reasonable best efforts to (a) take all
action necessary so that no Takeover Statute or, in the case of the Company,
any similar provision of the Company Governing Documents, is or becomes
applicable to the Merger or any of the other Transactions and (b) if any such
Takeover Statute or, in the case of the Company, any similar provision of the
Company Governing Documents, is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing,
to take all action necessary so that the Merger and the other Transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such
Takeover Statute on the Merger and the other Transactions.

Section 6.7 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall take all action necessary to cause
each of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to cause Merger Sub to consummate the
Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Section 6.8 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

(a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume,
honor and fulfill all material Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Company Stock Plans and ESPP). Effective as of
the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, to each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries
who continues to be employed by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary thereof (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), from the Effective Time
through December 31, 2017 (i)(x) base salary (or wages) and (y) annual cash
bonus opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable than those
provided by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
employee benefits (excluding equity or equity-based compensation) that, in the
aggregate, are substantially comparable to those provided by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Effective as of the Effective Time
and thereafter, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide, that periods of employment with the Company (including any current
or former affiliate of the Company or any predecessor of the Company to the
extent recognized by the Company) shall be taken into account for all purposes
under all employee benefit plans maintained by Parent or an affiliate of
Parent for the benefit of the Continuing Employees, including vacation or
other paid-time-off plans or arrangements, 401(k), pension or other
retirement plans and any severance or health or welfare plans (other than for
purposes of determining any accrued benefit under any defined benefit pension
plan or as would result in a duplication of benefits).

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) ensure that no eligibility
waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements or pre-existing condition
limitations or exclusions shall apply with respect to the Continuing Employees
under the applicable health and welfare benefits plan of Parent or any
affiliate of Parent (except to the extent applicable under Company Benefit
Plans immediately

 



42  prior to the Effective Time), (ii) waive any and all evidence of
insurability requirements with respect to such Continuing Employees to the
extent such evidence of insurability requirements were not applicable to the
Continuing Employees under the Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (iii) credit each Continuing Employee with all deductible
payments, out-of-pocket or other co-payments paid by such employee under the
Company Benefit Plans prior to the Closing Date during the year in which the
Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such
employee has satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or she has
reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any health benefit plan of Parent or
an affiliate of Parent for such year. The Merger shall not affect any
Continuing Employees accrual of, or right to use, in accordance with Company
policy as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, any personal,
sick, vacation or other paid-time-off accrued but unused by such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) The Company Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt
resolutions and take such corporate action as is necessary to terminate any
401(k) plans maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Company 401(k) Plans_ "), effective as of the day prior
to the Closing Date. The Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such resolutions and any documents
prepared in connection with such corporate actions prior to the adoption of
such resolutions or taking of such actions. Following the Effective Time and
as soon as practicable following the termination of the Company 401(k) Plans,
the assets thereof shall be distributed to the participants. Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall permit the Continuing Employees who are then
actively employed to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code),
including loans, in the form of cash, in an amount equal to the full account
balance (including loans) distributed to such Continuing Employees from the
Company 401(k) Plans to Parents or the Surviving Corporations applicable
401(k) plan.

 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in
any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of
Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate
the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a
written agreement between Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or
any affiliate of Parent and the Continuing Employee or any severance, benefit
or other applicable plan or program covering such Continuing Employee.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this  _Section_ _ _ _6.8_ shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an amendment
or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of
Merger Sub, (ii) create any third party rights in any Person or (iii) alter
or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their
respective affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan
or other employee benefit program, agreement or arrangement at any time
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them.

(e) No later than thirty (30) Business Days following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Parent a list of each "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and (i) the Companys 

 



43  reasonable, good faith estimate of the maximum amount (separately
identifying single and double-trigger amounts and tax gross-up payments, if
any) that could be paid to, or benefits received by, such disqualified
individual as a result of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event), (ii) the "base
amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each such
disqualified individual and (iii) underlying documentation on which such
calculations are based. Such information shall be updated and delivered to
Parent not later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the anticipated
Closing Date.

(f) The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any material written
communications intended for broad-based and general distribution to any
current or former employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
if such communications relate to any of the Transactions, and, to the extent
practicable, shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such communications prior to distribution.

 

Section 6.9 _Security Holder Litigation_. Each Party shall provide the
other Party prompt oral notice (but in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) of any litigation brought or threatened by any shareholder of that
Party against such Party, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors or officers relating to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the
Transactions. Unless, in the case of such litigation with respect to the
Company, the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) has made a
Company Change of Recommendation, the Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate (at Parents expense) in the defense, prosecution
or settlement of any such litigation, and the Company shall not offer to
settle any such litigation, nor shall any such settlement be agreed to without
Parents prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. In the event of, and to the extent of, any
conflict or overlap between the provisions of this _Section 6.9_ and _Section

the expected timing of the Marketing Period, satisfying on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent and its Subsidiaries to obtaining the Debt

remedy under, or replace, the Debt Commitment Letter if such amendment,
modification, waiver, or replacement (x) would (1) add any new material
conditions to the Debt Financing (or modify any existing condition in a
manner adverse to Parent) that would be reasonably expected to adversely
affect (including with respect to timing, taking into account the expected
timing of the Marketing Period) the ability of Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (2) taking into account the
expected timing of the Marketing Period, could be reasonably expected to make
the timely funding of any of the Debt Financing or satisfaction of
the conditions to obtaining any of the Debt Financing materially less likely
to occur, (y) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to an amount
such that the transactions contemplated hereby could not be consummated or (z)

Agreement; provided, that Parent may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add
lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who
had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and provide
such lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
with consent rights with respect to existing conditions to the consummation of
the Debt Financing.

of Parent, the reason therefor and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event and
in any event no later than the last day of the Marketing Period, alternative
financing (in an amount sufficient to enable the Transactions to be
consummated) from the same or other sources.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this _Section 6.13_ shall require, and in no event shall
the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require,
Parent to (i) pay any fees to the Lenders in excess of those contemplated in
the Debt Commitment Letter and related fee letters as of the date hereof,
whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise or
(ii) amend or waive any of the terms or conditions hereof or under the Debt
Commitment Letter.

ARTICLE VIII

(a) at any time prior to the Effective Time, by mutual written consent of
Parent and the Company;

permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger or
making consummation of the Merger illegal; provided that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be
available to a Party whose breach of _Section 6.3_ , _Section_ _ _ _6.12_ or

has authorized the Company to enter into a Superior Proposal Acquisition
Agreement in compliance with _Section 5.2_ ; provided that such termination
shall not be effective and the Company shall not enter into any such
agreement, unless the Company has paid the Company Termination Fee
concurrently with such termination in accordance with _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ ;

_Sections_ _7.2(a)_ or _7.2(b)_ to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, for purposes of this _Section_ _ _ _8.1(f)_ , if such a breach is
curable by the Company by the earlier of the End Date and thirty (30) days
following the date on which Parent gives the Company notice of such breach
and the Company is continuing to use commercially reasonable efforts to cure

upon the earlier of the End Date and the expiration of such thirty (30)-day
period;

 

(g) at any time prior to the Effective Time, by the Company, by written
notice to Parent, if (i) a breach of any representation or warranty on the
part of Parent has had a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (ii) a failure to
perform in any material respect any covenant or obligation contained in this
Agreement on the part of Parent has occurred;  _provided_ , _however_ , that,
for purposes of this _Section_ _ _ _8.1(g)_ , if such a breach is curable by
Parent by the earlier of the End Date and thirty (30) days following the date
on which the Company gives Parent notice of such breach and Parent is
continuing to use commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach, then
the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ _ _ _8.1(g)_
on account of such breach unless such breach remains uncured upon the earlier
of the End Date and the expiration of such thirty (30)-day period; or

 

(h) by either the Company or Parent, by written notice to the other, if the
Required Company Shareholder Vote shall not have been obtained upon a vote
taken thereon at the Company Shareholders Meeting, including any adjournment
or postponement thereof.

 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



50 (a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in 
_Section_ _ _ _8.1_ , the written notice thereof shall be given by the
terminating Party to the other Party or Parties shall specify the provision
hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall
forthwith become null and void and there shall be no liability on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, except that the Confidentiality Agreement,
this _Section_ _ _ _8.2_ and _Article_ _ _ _IX_ shall survive
such termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve
any Party from liability for fraud or a Willful Breach of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such
termination. 

(b) _Termination Fee_.

 

(i) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _8.1(c)_
or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _8.1(e)_ ,
the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent a fee of $35 million in
cash (the " _Termination Fee_ "), in the case of a termination of this
Agreement by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ , prior to or
concurrently with such termination by the Company and in the case of a
termination by this Agreement by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ , within
two (2) Business Days after such termination.

(ii) If (A) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section_ _ _ _8.1(d)_ or _Section 8.1(h)_ or if Parent terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ , (B) a Company Competing Proposal
shall have been publicly disclosed (or any Person shall have
publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a
Company Competing Proposal, or a Company Competing Proposal shall have
otherwise become publicly known) and in each case such Company Competing
Proposal (or such public announcement of an intention to make a Company
Competing Proposal) has not been irrevocably withdrawn prior to the date of
termination, and (C) within twelve (12) months of such termination (1) the
Company consummates any Company Competing Proposal or (2) the Company enters
into a definitive agreement providing for any Company Competing Proposal, then
the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent the Termination Fee within
two (2) Business Days after the earlier of entering into any definitive
agreement providing for a Company Competing Proposal or consummation of any
Company Competing Proposal.

 

(iii) In the event any amount is payable pursuant to this _Section_ _ _
_8.2(b)_ , such amount shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent.

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be
obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one (1) occasion.

 

(c) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section_ _ _ _8.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that the
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is a reasonable amount that shall
compensate Parent and Merger Sub in the circumstances in which such payment is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

doubt, each Party agrees that there is not an adequate remedy at Law for a
breach of this Agreement by any Party.

 _Section 1.02_ _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the shareholders may be held on an annual or other less frequent basis as determined by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that if a regular meeting has not been held during the immediately preceding 15 months, a shareholder or shareholders holding three percent or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote may demand a regular meeting of shareholders by written demand given to the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of the Corporation. At each regular meeting the shareholders shall elect qualified successors for directors who serve for an indefinite term or whose terms have expired or are due to expire within six months after the date of the meeting and may transact any other business, provided, however, that no business with respect to which special notice is required by law shall be transacted unless such notice shall have been given. 

 

 _Section 1.03_ _Special Meetings_. A special meeting of the shareholders may be called for any purpose or purposes at any time by the Chief Executive Officer; by the Chief Financial Officer; by the Board of Directors or any two or more members thereof; or by one or more shareholders holding not less than ten percent of the voting power of all shares of the Corporation entitled to vote (except that a special meeting for the purpose of considering any action to directly or indirectly facilitate or effect a business combination, including any action to change or otherwise affect the composition of the Board for that purpose, must be called by shareholders holding not less than 25 percent of the voting power of all shares of the Corporation entitled to vote), who shall demand such special meeting by written notice given to the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of the Corporation specifying the purposes of such meeting. 

 



Exhibit B-1 _Section 1.04_ _Meetings Held Upon Shareholder Demand_. Within 30 days after receipt of a demand by the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer from any shareholder or shareholders entitled to call a meeting of the shareholders, it shall be the duty of the Board of Directors of the Corporation to cause a special or regular meeting of shareholders, as the case may be, to be duly called and held on notice no later than 90 days after receipt of such demand. If the Board fails to cause such a meeting to be called and held as required by this Section, the shareholder or shareholders making the demand may call the meeting by giving notice as provided in Section 1.06 hereof at the expense of the Corporation. 

 

 _Section 1.05_ _Adjournments_. Any meeting of the shareholders may be adjourned from time to time to another date, time and place. If any meeting of the shareholders is so adjourned, no notice as to such adjourned meeting need be given if the adjourned meeting is to be held not more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting and the date, time and place at which the meeting will be reconvened are announced at the time of adjournment. 

 

 _Section 1.06_ _ _ _Notice of Meetings_. Unless otherwise required by law, written notice of each meeting of the shareholders, stating the date, time, and place and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes, shall be given at least 10 days and not more than 60 days before the meeting to every holder of shares entitled to vote at such meeting except as specified in Section 1.05 or as otherwise permitted by law. Notice may be given to a shareholder by means of electronic communication if the requirements of Minnesota Statutes Section 302A.436, Subdivision 5, as amended from time to time, are met. The business transacted at a special meeting of shareholders is limited to the purposes stated in the notice of the meeting. 

 

 _Section 1.07_ _ _ _Waiver of Notice_. A shareholder may waive notice of the date, time, place, or purpose of a meeting of shareholders. A waiver of notice by a shareholder entitled to notice is effective whether given before, at, or after the meeting, and whether given in writing, orally, by authenticated electronic communication, or by attendance. Attendance by a shareholder at a meeting is a waiver of notice of that meeting, unless the shareholder objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened, or objects before a vote on an item of business because the item may not lawfully be considered at that meeting and does not participate in the consideration of the item at that meeting. 

 

 _Section 1.08_ _Voting Rights_. Subdivision 1. A shareholder shall have one vote for each share held which is entitled to vote. Except as otherwise required by law, a holder of shares entitled to vote may vote any portion of the shares in any way the shareholder chooses. If a shareholder votes without designating the proportion or number of shares voted in a particular way, the shareholder is deemed to have voted all of the shares in that way. 

 

 Subdivision 2. The Board of Directors may fix, or authorize an officer to fix, a date not more than 60 days before the date of a meeting of shareholders as the date for the determination of the holders of shares entitled to notice of and entitled to vote at the meeting. When a date is so fixed, only shareholders on that date are entitled to notice of and permitted to vote at that meeting of shareholders. 

 



Exhibit B-2 _Section 1.09_ _ _ _Proxies_. A shareholder may cast or authorize the casting of a vote by (a) filing a written appointment of a proxy, signed by the shareholder, with an officer of the Corporation at or before the meeting at which the appointment is to be effective, or (b) by telephonic transmission or authenticated electronic communication, whether or not accompanied by written instructions of the shareholder, of an appointment of a proxy with the Corporation or the Corporations duly authorized agent at or before the meeting at which the appointment is to be effective. The telephonic transmission or authenticated electronic communication must set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the appointment was authorized by the shareholder. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication, or other reproduction of the original of either the writing or transmission may be used in lieu of the original, provided that it is a complete and legible reproduction of the entire original. 

 _Section 1.10_ _Quorum_. The holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at a shareholders meeting are a quorum for the transaction of business. If a quorum is present when a duly called or held meeting is convened, the shareholders present may continue to transact business until adjournment, even though the withdrawal of a number of the shareholders originally present leaves less than the proportion or number otherwise required for a quorum. 

 

 _Section 1.11_ _Acts of Shareholders_. Subdivision 1. Except as otherwise required by law or specified in the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, the shareholders shall take action by the affirmative vote of the holders of the greater of (a) a majority of the voting power of the shares present and entitled to vote on that item of business or (b) a majority of the voting power of the minimum number of shares entitled to vote that would constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at a duly held meeting of shareholders. 

 

 Subdivision 2. A shareholder voting by proxy authorized to vote on less than all items of business considered at the meeting shall be considered to be present and entitled to vote only with respect to those items of business for which the proxy has authority to vote. A proxy who is given authority by a shareholder who abstains with respect to an item of business shall be considered to have authority to vote on that item of business. 

 _Section 1.12_ _ _ _Action Without a Meeting_. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation may be taken without a meeting by written action signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by all of the shareholders entitled to vote on that action.

 _Section 2.06_ _Special Meetings_.

The notice need not state the purpose of the meeting. 

 _Section 2.07_ _Waiver of Notice; Previously Scheduled Meetings_. Subdivision 1. A director of the Corporation may waive notice of the date, time and place of a meeting of the Board. A waiver of notice by a director entitled to notice is effective whether given before, at or after the meeting, and whether given in writing, orally or by attendance. Attendance by a director at a meeting is a 

 



Exhibit B-4  waiver of notice of that meeting, unless the director objects at the
beginning of the meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting is
not lawfully called or convened and thereafter does not participate in the
meeting.

 Subdivision 2. If the day or date, time and place of a Board meeting have been provided herein or announced at a previous meeting of the Board, no notice is required. Notice of an adjourned meeting need not be given other than by announcement at the meeting at which adjournment is taken of the date, time and place at which the meeting will be reconvened. 

 _Section 2.08_ _Quorum_. The presence in person of a majority of the directors currently holding office shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.

If a quorum is present when a duly called or held meeting is convened, the directors present may continue to transact business until adjournment, even though the withdrawal of a number of the directors originally present leaves less than the proportion or number otherwise required for a quorum. 

 

 _Section 2.09_ _Acts of Board_.

A director may participate in a Board meeting by conference telephone, or, if authorized by the Board, by any other means of remote communication through which the director, other directors so participating, and all directors physically present at the meeting may participate with each other during the meeting. A director so participating is deemed present at the meeting. 

 _Section 2.11_ _Absent Directors_. A director of the Corporation may give advance written consent or opposition to a proposal to be acted on at a Board meeting. If the director is not present at the meeting, consent or opposition to a proposal does not constitute presence for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum, but consent or opposition shall be counted as the vote of a director present at the meeting in favor of or against the proposal and shall be entered in the minutes or other record of action at the meeting, if the proposal acted on at the meeting is substantially the same or has substantially the same effect as the proposal to which the director has consented or objected. 

 

 _Section 2.12_ _ _ _Action Without a Meeting_. An action required or permitted to be taken at a Board meeting may be taken without a meeting by written action signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by all of the directors. Any action, other than an action requiring shareholder approval, if the Articles of Incorporation so provide, may be taken by written action signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by the number of directors that would be required to

To the extent permitted by law, a vacancy on the committee may be filled by a majority vote of the remaining committee members.

Exhibit B-8 _SHARES_

 Subdivision 2. Each certificate of shares of the Corporation shall bear the corporate seal, if any, and shall be signed by the Chief Executive Officer, or the President or any Vice President, and the Chief Financial Officer, or the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary, but when a certificate is signed by a transfer agent or a registrar, the signature of any such officer and the corporate seal upon such certificate may be facsimiles, engraved or printed. If a person signs or has a facsimile signature placed upon a certificate while an officer, transfer agent or registrar of the Corporation, the certificate may be issued by the Corporation, even if the person has ceased to serve in that capacity before the certificate is issued, with the same effect as if the person had that capacity at the date of its issue. 

 

 Subdivision 3. A certificate representing shares issued by the Corporation shall, if the Corporation is authorized to issue shares of more than one class or series, set forth upon the face or back of the certificate, or shall state that the Corporation will furnish to any shareholder upon request and without charge, a full statement of the designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights of the shares of each class or series authorized to be issued, so far as they have been determined, and the authority of the Board to determine the relative rights and preferences of subsequent classes or series. 

 Subdivision 4. A resolution approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at a duly held meeting of the Board may provide that some or all of any or all classes and series of the shares of the Corporation will be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until the certificate is surrendered to the Corporation. 

 _Section 5.02_ _Declaration of Dividends and Other Distributions_. The Board of Directors shall have the authority to declare dividends and other distributions upon the shares of the Corporation to the extent permitted by law. 

 

 _Section 5.03_ _Transfer of Shares_. Shares of the Corporation may be transferred only on the books of the Corporation by the holder thereof, in person or by such persons attorney. In the case of certificated shares, shares shall be transferred only upon surrender and cancellation of certificates for a like number of shares. The Board of Directors, however, may appoint one or more transfer agents and registrars to maintain the share records of the Corporation and to effect transfers of shares. 

 

 _Section 5.04_ _Record Date_.

the books of the Corporation after any record date so fixed.

 _Section 6.06_ _Exclusive Forum_. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the state or federal courts in Hennepin County, Minnesota shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation to the corporation or the corporations shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, the articles of incorporation, or these By-laws (as either may be amended from time to time), or (iv) any action 

 



Exhibit B-10  asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case
subject to said courts having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable
parties named as defendants therein. If any action the subject matter of
which is within the scope of this Section 12.01 is filed in a court other than
a state or federal court in Hennepin County, Minnesota (a "Foreign Action") by
any shareholder, such shareholder shall be deemed to have consented to: (a)
the personal jurisdiction of the state or federal courts in Hennepin County,
Minnesota in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce
this Section 6.06; and (b) having service of process made upon such
shareholder in any such action by service upon such shareholders counsel in
the Foreign Action as agent for such shareholder. If any provision of this
Section 6.06 shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied
to any person or entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, the validity, legality and enforceability
of such provision in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of
this Section 6.06 (including, without limitation, each portion of any
sentence of this Section 6.06 containing any such provision held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other
persons or entities or circumstances shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby.
