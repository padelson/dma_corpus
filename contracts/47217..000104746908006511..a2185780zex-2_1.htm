AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

  

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as of May 13, 2008, by and among Electronic Data Systems Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), Hewlett-Packard Company, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and Hawk Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _MergerCo_ "). Capitalized terms used herein (including in the immediately preceding sentence) and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in Section 8.01 hereof. 

  

    
RECITALS 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties intend that MergerCo be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving that merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; 

  

 WHEREAS, in the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") will be converted into the right to receive $25.00 per share in cash, without interest; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement with Parent and MergerCo, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (iii) resolved, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to recommend adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company; 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and MergerCo have unanimously approved this Agreement; and 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE I. 
THE MERGER; RELATED MATTERS 

  

 Section 1.01. _ The Merger._ On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, (a) MergerCo will merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), and (b) the separate corporate existence of MergerCo will cease and the Company will continue its corporate existence under the DGCL as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). Parent may at any time on or before the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting change the method of effecting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by providing for the merger of the Company and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent other than MergerCo if and to the extent requested by Parent and consented to by the Company in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement or otherwise alter or change any of the conditions or financial terms set forth in this Agreement, (ii) impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by requiring any additional or alternative filings with any Governmental Entity or other Person, or (iii) relieve Parent of any of its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 Section 1.02. _ Closing._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, as soon as practicable (and, in any event, within three (3) Business Days) after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted      
  

hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VI
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted
hereunder, waiver of all such conditions), unless this Agreement has been
terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is agreed to
in writing by the parties hereto. If the conditions to the Merger set forth
in Article VI are satisfied or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waived
during the ten (10) days immediately prior to the end of a fiscal quarter of
Parent, then Parent may, at its sole discretion and upon written notice to the
Company, postpone the Closing until no later than the last Business Day of the
first week after the end of that fiscal quarter (the " _Other Closing Date_
"), provided that in such event (a) the conditions to the Merger set forth
in Sections 6.02(a) and 6.02(c) (and any right of Parent to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.03(b)(ii)) shall be deemed to be waived by
Parent and MergerCo and (b) if the End Date shall occur prior to the Other
Closing Date, then, at the option of the Company, the End Date shall be
extended until the date that is twenty (20) Business Days after the
Other Closing Date. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Cleary
Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP, One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York 10006,
unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto, and the
actual date of the Closing is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing
Date_."

  

 Section 1.03. _ Effective Time._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Company, Parent and MergerCo will cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger will become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by the Company and Parent in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the effective time of the Merger being hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 Section 1.04. _ Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259, and any other applicable provisions, of the DGCL and this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises, licenses and authority of the Company and MergerCo shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of each of the Company and MergerCo shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 1.05. _ Organizational Documents._ At the Effective Time, (a) the certificate of incorporation of MergerCo as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, which shall be in the form attached hereto as _Annex A_, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof or as provided by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that Article I thereof shall read as follows: "The name of the Corporation is Electronic Data Systems Corporation" and (b) the bylaws of MergerCo as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, which shall be in the form attached hereto as _Annex B_, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or as provided by applicable Law. 

  

 Section 1.06. _ Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation._ The directors and officers of MergerCo, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

       

    
ARTICLE II. 
EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK 

   

 Section 2.01. _ Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, MergerCo or the Company or the holder of any capital stock of Parent, MergerCo or the Company: 

  

  

 (a) _ Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Share_ " and collectively, the " _Shares_ ") that is owned by Parent, MergerCo or the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (b) _ Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares to be cancelled and retired in accordance with Section 2.01(a) and (ii) Dissenting Shares (each, an " _Excluded Share_ " and collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ")) will be converted into the right to receive $25.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). 

   

 (c) _ Cancellation of Shares._ At the Effective Time, all Shares will no longer be outstanding and all Shares will be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and, subject to Section 2.03, each holder of a certificate formerly representing any such Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.02 hereof. 

  

 (d) _ Conversion of MergerCo Capital Stock._ Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of MergerCo issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

  

 Section 2.02. _ Surrender and Payment._ 

  

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint Computershare Trust Company of New York or another institution reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to act as the agent for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) the Certificates or (ii) uncertificated Shares (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "). On and after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Exchange Agent, sufficient funds to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of all of the Shares represented by the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares (the " _Payment Fund_ ") in amounts and at the times necessary for such payments. If for any reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of Shares shall be entitled under Section 2.01(b), Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit in trust additional cash with the Exchange Agent sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for the payment thereof. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder of Shares at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. 

  

 (b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company 

  

      

  
  

Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share upon (i)
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly
completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents
as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent, or (ii) receipt of an
"agent\'s message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any,
of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a
book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares. Until so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, and subject to the terms set forth in
Section 2.03, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share, as applicable,
shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof. No interest
shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of
any Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Upon payment of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, each Certificate
or Certificates so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled.

  

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share, as applicable, is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share, as applicable, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or transfer of Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article II. 

  

 (e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.02 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of Shares for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares two (2) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon demand. 

  

  

 Section 2.03. _ Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, including Section 2.01, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(a)) and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares being referred to collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holder\'s appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such Shares) shall not be 

        

converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall
be entitled to payment of the appraised value of such Shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such
holder\'s right to appraisal, pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Shares shall
be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.01(b),
without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly
representing such Share or transfer of such Uncertificated Share, as the case
may be. The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, any withdrawal of any such
demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company
prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relate to such demand,
and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

   

 Section 2.04. _ Adjustments._ If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur (other than the issuance of additional shares of capital stock of the Company as permitted by this Agreement), including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend paid in stock, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted. 

   

 Section 2.05. _ Withholding Rights._ Each of Parent, MergerCo, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article II such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of any applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Parent, MergerCo, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the applicable Taxing authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which Parent, MergerCo, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. 

  

 Section 2.06. _ Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated under this Article II. 

  

 Section 2.07. _ Treatment of Warrants._ At the Effective Time, and in accordance with the terms of each warrant to purchase Shares that is listed on Section 2.07 of the Company Disclosure Letter (collectively, the " _Warrants_ ") and that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless otherwise elected by the holder of any such Warrant, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to issue a replacement warrant to each holder thereof providing that such replacement warrant shall be exercisable for the amount of cash consideration receivable upon the Closing by a holder of a number of Shares issuable upon exercise of such Warrant immediately prior to the Closing, and from and after the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with all of the terms and conditions set forth in each such replacement warrant, including the obligation to make the payments contemplated thereby upon the exercise thereof. 

        

 Section 2.08. _ Treatment of Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units; ESPP._ 

  

  

 (a) Except as set forth in Section 2.08(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, at the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Company Stock Option that is outstanding under a Company Stock Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be assumed by Parent and converted automatically at the Effective Time into an option to purchase shares of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Stock_ "), and which has other material terms and conditions substantially the same as those of the related Company Stock Option, except that (i) the number of shares of Parent Stock subject to each such Company Stock Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of Shares subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by a fraction (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), the numerator of which is the per share Merger Consideration and the denominator of which is the average closing price of Parent Stock on the New York Stock Exchange as reported by the Wall Street Journal for the five (5) full trading days ending on the date that is two (2) trading days prior to the Closing Date (rounded down to the nearest whole share), (ii) the exercise price per share of Parent Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) shall equal (x) the per share exercise price for the Shares otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio and (iii) any holding periods or other restrictions on sale of Shares acquired upon exercise of Company Stock Options shall no longer apply. The parties acknowledge that, with respect to any option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the foregoing provisions are intended to comply with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. 

  

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in no event later than five (5) Business Days thereafter, Parent shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to (i) the shares of Parent Stock issuable upon exercise of the Company Stock Options that are assumed by Parent hereunder and (ii) the shares of Parent Stock issuable upon the settlement of any Parent Restricted Stock Units that are issued in replacement for the Company Restricted Stock Units in accordance with the terms set forth in Section 2.08(c) hereof, and Parent shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such Company Stock Options or Parent Restricted Stock Units remain outstanding. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not issue any shares of Parent Stock in respect of any Company Stock Award until the S-8 to be filed as herein provided is so filed and becomes effective, unless such S-8 has not been so filed and become effective prior to the date that is fifteen (15) Business Days following the Effective Date, in which case Parent (while still bound by the terms of this provision) shall make such issuances irrespective of whether such S-8 has been filed and become effective. 

  

 (c) Except as set forth in Section 2.08(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, at the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit (including restricted stock awards, phantom restricted stock awards, deferred stock units, whether performance-based, time-based or otherwise) (the " _Company Restricted Stock Units_ ") that is outstanding under any Company Stock Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or earned, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a time-based vesting Parent Restricted Stock Unit (the " _Parent Restricted Stock Unit_ "), which has material terms and conditions substantially the same as those of the related Company Restricted Stock Unit (including (i) no longer being subject to any performance-based vesting criteria, all of which shall be deemed satisfied at the Effective Time at the "target" level specified in the applicable award Contract relating to such Company Restricted Stock Units, and which award amount shall not have been further increased by exercise of any discretion of the Company Board prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) with respect to the time-based vesting schedule 

  

      

  
  

applicable thereto as set forth in any Contract entered into with the holder
thereof that is in effect as of the date hereof or is entered into after the
date hereof in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement), with
respect to the number of shares of Parent Stock that is equal to the number of
Shares subject to the Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest
whole share); _provided_ , _however_ , that any holding periods or other
restrictions on sale of Shares acquired upon the vesting of such Company
Restricted Stock Units shall no longer apply.

  

 (d) The Company shall take such action as may be necessary to (i) establish the end of the purchase period in effect as of the date hereof under the Company\'s 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") no later than the last day of the payroll period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time (but in all events at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time) with respect to any offering (as defined in the ESPP) otherwise then in effect (the " _New Exercise Date_ ") and (ii) terminate the ESPP as of the New Exercise Date, or such earlier date as determined by the Company to be administratively reasonable. Each ESPP participant\'s accumulated payroll contributions as of the New Exercise Date that are not withdrawn as of such date shall be applied toward the purchase of Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESPP, which Shares shall be cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration as set forth in Section 2.01(b), except as otherwise set forth in Section 2.03. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the New Exercise Date, following the application of accumulated payroll contributions toward the purchase of Shares in accordance with the preceding sentence, Parent shall cause or permit the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to return to participants any of their respective accumulated payroll contributions not applied to the purchase of Shares under the ESPP, if any. From and after the date hereof, the Company shall not permit (x) any new offering to commence under the ESPP or (y) any current participant in the ESPP to increase the percentage rate of his or her payroll deductions into his or her account under the ESPP. 

  

 (e) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the obligations and succeed to the rights of the Company under the Company Stock Plans with respect to the Company Equity Awards. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall take all action required to reflect the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.08, including the conversion of the Company Equity Awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (c) above and the substitution of Parent for the Company thereunder to the extent appropriate to effectuate the assumption of such Company Stock Plans by Parent. From and after the Effective Time, all references to the Company (other than any references relating to a "change in control" of the Company) in each Company Stock Plan and in each agreement evidencing any award of Company Equity Awards shall be deemed to refer to Parent.

except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

   

 (c) _ Enforceability._ The Owned Company IP is valid, subsisting and enforceable, except where the failure to be so valid, subsisting and enforceable would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 (e) _ Sufficiency of Company IP._ The Owned Company IP, together with the Licensed Company IP, constitutes all the Intellectual Property that is necessary for the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, except where the failure of the foregoing to be true and correct would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (f) _ No Liens._ The Company and its Subsidiaries collectively own all right, title and interest in the Owned Company IP free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.

 (g) _ Protection of Information._ The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has taken all commercially reasonable steps to protect and preserve the secrecy and confidentiality of the Trade Secrets that comprise any material part of the Company IP, except where the failure to take such actions would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company 

  

      

  
  

Material Adverse Effect. All uses and disclosures by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries of Trade Secrets owned by another Person have been pursuant
to the terms of a written agreement with such Person or were otherwise
lawful, except where the use or disclosure of any Trade Secret owned by
another Person that was not effected in accordance with a written agreement or
was not lawful would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries have a policy requiring
employees, consultants and contractors, and any other person with access to

The Company and its Subsidiaries are not subject to any Order that restricts or impairs the use of any Company IP, except (x) for any such Order that is generally applicable to Persons engaged in the businesses engaged in by the Company and its Subsidiaries or (y) where the entry or existence of any such Order would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (k) _ Parent\'s Intellectual Property._ The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) will not result, after 

  

      

  
  

the consummation of the Merger, in Parent or any of its Subsidiaries being
required, under the terms of any Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, to grant (including by means of a covenant not to
sue or cross-license) to any third party any rights or licenses to any of
Intellectual Property owned by Parent or its Affiliates prior to the Closing
Date or created by Parent or its Affiliates following the Closing Date,
except for customer Contracts under which the customer was granted a non-
exclusive license (which may include the right to sublicense to end users in
the ordinary course of business for the same or more limited scope) to use
existing and after-acquired patents and/or copyrights, including enhancements
to Software and similar derivative works, solely to the extent necessary for
such customer\'s operation of products or applications sold to the customer
under such Contract, or solely to the extent necessary for such customer\'s
receipt of services that parent will continue to provide after closing, and
for no other purpose.

 (n) _ Source Code._ To the Knowledge of Company, no condition has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists, that would be sufficient to entitle the beneficiary under any source code escrow arrangement under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have deposited any material Company Source Code to require release of such material Company Source Code, except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of Company, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) will not constitute a condition sufficient to entitle the beneficiary under any source code escrow arrangement under which the Company or its Subsidiaries have deposited any material Company Source Code to require release of such Company Source Code, except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

use or other contractual obligations relating to privacy or protection of

compliance with any such Law, terms of use or other contractual obligations
or to abide by any such policy would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the
Knowledge of the Company, with respect to personal customer information and
other personally identifiable information, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has reasonable security and data protections in place,

Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that the failure of the Company Board to take any of the following
actions would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company Board, after
compliance with the procedure set forth in the following sentence, may (I)
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (II) cause the Company or
any Subsidiary thereof to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal, but only if the Company shall have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.04(a) hereof substantially
concurrently with entering into such Company Acquisition Agreement. The
Company Board shall not make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
enter into (or permit any Subsidiary to enter into) such Company Acquisition
Agreement, unless (1) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at
least five (5) Business Days (the " _Notice Period_ ") before making a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or entering into (or causing a
Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement, of its intention
to take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall
state expressly that the Company has received a Takeover Proposal that the
Company Board intends to declare a Superior Proposal and that the Company
Board intends to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or the
Company intends to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement, (2) the
Company attaches to such notice the most current version of the proposed
agreement (which version shall be updated on a prompt basis) and the identity
of the third party making such Superior Proposal, (3) the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries\' Representatives to, during the
Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion,
proposes to make such adjustments (it being agreed that in the event that,
after commencement of the Notice Period, there is any material revision to
the terms of a Superior Proposal, including, any revision in price, the Notice
Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least three (3)
Business Days remains in the Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company
notifies Parent of any such material revision (it being understood that there
may be multiple extensions)) and (4) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and a Company Financial
Advisor or another financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that
such Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after
taking into account any adjustments made by Parent during the Notice Period in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  

      

           

   

  

 (c) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 5.04, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours) after it obtains Knowledge of the receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Takeover Proposal, any inquiry, offer or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, or any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any third party, in each case that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal. In such notice, the Company shall identify the third party making, and the terms and conditions of, any such Takeover Proposal, indication, offer, proposal or request. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and material terms of any such Takeover Proposal, indication or request, including any material amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material terms thereof. 

  

 (d) Subject to Parent\'s rights under Article VII hereof, nothing in this Section 5.04 shall prohibit the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Company\'s stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation MA promulgated under the Exchange Act, or other applicable Law, if the Company Board determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to so disclose such position could constitute a violation of applicable Law. In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Section 5.04, a factually accurate public statement by the Company that only describes the Company\'s receipt of a Takeover Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto and contains a "stop-look-and-listen communication" shall not be deemed a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. 

  

  

 Section 5.05. _ Stockholder Meeting; Proxy Materials._ 

  

  

 (a) Subject to the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall take all action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Company Proxy Statement, and, in connection therewith, the Company shall mail the Company Proxy Statement to the holders of Company Common Stock in advance of such meeting. Except to the extent that the Company Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 5.04(b) hereof, the Company Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation. Subject to 5.04 hereof, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) solicit from the holders of Company Common Stock proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and (ii) take all other reasonable actions necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the holders of Company Common Stock required by applicable Law to obtain such approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may extend the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting to the extent (x) necessary in order to obtain a quorum of its stockholders or (y) the Company reasonably determines that such delay is required by applicable Law. At the Company Stockholders Meeting, Parent and its Affiliates will vote all Shares owned by them in favor of adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting if this Agreement is terminated before the meeting is held. 

  

 (b) In connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company will (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution and delivery of this Agreement prepare and, no later than the fifteenth (15th) Business Day following such execution and delivery, file the Company Proxy Statement with the SEC, (ii) respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC with respect to such filing and will provide copies of such comments to Parent and MergerCo promptly following receipt thereof, (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable prepare and file (after Parent and MergerCo have had a reasonable 

  

      

  
  

opportunity to review and comment on) any response, amendments or supplements
necessary to be filed in response to any SEC comments or as required by Law,
(iv) use commercially reasonable efforts to mail to the Company stockholders
as promptly as reasonably practicable the Company Proxy Statement and all
other customary proxy or other materials for meetings such as the

Company stockholders any supplement or amendment to the Company Proxy
Statement if any event shall occur which requires such action at any time
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting and (vi) otherwise use commercially
reasonable efforts to comply with all requirements of Law applicable to the
Company Stockholders Meeting. Parent and MergerCo shall each cooperate with
the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of the Company
Proxy Statement, including furnishing the Company as promptly as reasonably
practicable with any and all information with respect to Parent and MergerCo
as may be required to be set forth in the Company Proxy Statement under the
Exchange Act. The Company will provide Parent and MergerCo a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon the Company Proxy Statement, or any
amendments or supplements thereto, prior to filing the same with the SEC.

  

  

 Section 5.06. _ Notices of Certain Events._ The Company will notify Parent and MergerCo, and Parent and MergerCo will notify the Company, promptly of (i) any material written communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided that the foregoing shall not apply in respect of any immaterial consents, (ii) any material written communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than any such communication from a Governmental Entity in its capacity as a counterparty to any Contract with the Company or any Subsidiary thereof), (iii) any Legal Actions commenced against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, that are related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) any event, change or effect between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time which causes or is reasonably likely to cause the conditions set forth in Sections 6.02(a), 6.02(b) or 6.02(c) of this Agreement (in the case of the Company and its Subsidiaries) or Sections 6.03(a) or 6.03(b) of this Agreement (in the case of Parent and its Subsidiaries). 

  

 Section 5.07. _ Employees; Benefit Plans._ 

  

  

 (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 5.07, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2008 (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or the applicable Subsidiary thereof to maintain, for the benefit of the employees of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof who remain employed by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Company or any Subsidiary thereof) immediately after the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company Continuing Employees_ "), all of the Company Employee Plans that are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Company Employee Plans providing for the grant or issuance of equity-based compensation), and, during the Continuation Period, each Company Continuing Employee shall be eligible to participate in the same Company Employee Plans in which such Company Continuing Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, which participation shall be governed by the same terms and subject to the same conditions that were applicable to the participation by such Company Continuing Employee in such Company Employee Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time. Immediately following the Continuation Period, each Company Continuing Employee shall be eligible to participate in the employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent or an applicable Subsidiary thereof (collectively, the "Parent Benefit Plans") consistent with Parent\'s then-applicable human resources policies. Without limiting the foregoing, as soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each Company Continuing Employee who, as of the Effective Time, participates in the ESPP, 

  

      

  

the opportunity to participate in any employee stock purchase plan of Parent
to the extent consistent with Parent\'s then-applicable policies. In addition,
with respect to a Company Continuing Employee who participates in a long-term
incentive plan of the Company, after the Effective Time such Company
Continuing Employee shall be eligible to participate in a long-term incentive
plan sponsored by Parent or an Affiliate or Subsidiary on terms and conditions
generally then-applicable to similarly-situated employees.

  

 (b) Following the Continuation Period, Parent shall recognize, or shall cause to be recognized full credit to each Company Continuing Employee for his or her service recognized prior to the last day of the Continuation Period (i) for purposes of determining the amount of annual vacation accrual earned under a Parent Benefit Plan that provides for vacation benefits, (ii) for purposes of a participant\'s vested percentage under a Parent Benefit Plan that is a defined contribution pension plan, and (iii) for purposes of any then-applicable Parent Benefit Plan that provides severance benefits. With respect to Parent Benefit Plans not described in the preceding sentence, a Company Continuing Employee\'s prior service credit will be recognized as mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent prior to the Closing Date or as otherwise required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 5.07(b) to the contrary, in no event shall service be credited under any Parent Benefit Plan where such credit would (A) result in duplication of benefits, or (B) otherwise cause Parent or any Subsidiary or any Parent Benefit Plan (or trust relating thereto) to accrue or pay for benefits that relate to any time period prior to the Continuing Employee\'s participation in the Parent Benefit Plan. Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, from and after the Continuation Period, to the extent waived or credited under the analogous Company Employee Plans prior to the last day of the Continuation Period, (i) cause any and all pre-existing conditions, limitations, eligibility waiting periods, active employment requirements and requirements to show evidence of good health under the Parent Benefit Plans to be waived with respect to Company Continuing Employees (and their spouses and eligible dependents) who become participants in the Parent Benefit Plans and (ii) give credit for or otherwise take into account under the Parent Benefit Plans the out-of-pocket expenses and annual expense limitation amounts paid by each Company Continuing Employee under the analogous Parent Benefit Plan for the calendar year within which the Continuation Period ends. 

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, the Company shall freeze its Executive Deferral Plan and its U.K. Executive Deferral Plan, and thereafter distribute to Company Employees all account balances thereunder in accordance with the terms of such plans and in a manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code and shall further have taken all action necessary or appropriate to permit Parent to terminate said plans following liquidation of all accounts. 

  

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall amend its 1998 Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the " _SERP_ ") to provide that after the Closing Date there shall be no further accrual of benefits under the SERP. Subject to this Section 5.07(d), the Company shall maintain, and, following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, the SERP until such time as all Liabilities under the SERP have been satisfied. 

   

 (e) This Section 5.07 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.07, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.07. Nothing contained herein, express or implied (i) shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement or (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, including the Company Stock Plans. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this Section 5.07 shall 

  

      

  
  

not create any right in any Company Employee or any other Person to any
continued employment with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries.

  

 (f) With respect to matters described in this Section 5.07, the Company will not send any written notices or other written communication materials to Company Employees without the prior written consent of Parent. 

  

  

 Section 5.08. _ Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance._ 

  

  

 (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any present or former director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (together, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining in whole or in part to, any action or failure to take action by any such Person in such capacity taken prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, from and after the Effective Time, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted or required by applicable Law and required by the Company Organizational Documents, any indemnity agreements applicable to any such Indemnified Party and/or any Contract between an Indemnified Party and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, in each case, in effect on the date of this Agreement and disclosed in Section 5.08(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter or hereafter entered into in accordance with the terms set forth herein, against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, legal and other expenses (including reimbursement for reasonable legal and other reasonable fees and expenses incurred in advance of the final disposition of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation by each Indemnified Party), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, subject to the Surviving Corporation\'s receipt of an undertaking (without the posting of any bond or other collateral) by such Indemnified Party to repay such legal and other fees and expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation will not be liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving Corporation\'s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

  

 (b) The Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, if available, the current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies, of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries when compared to the insurance maintained by the Company as of the date hereof) or (ii) obtain as of the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ that in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to expend an annual premium for such coverage in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of the last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement, which amount is set forth on Section 5.08(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at an annual premium equal to or less than the Maximum Premium, 

  

      

  
  

the Surviving Corporation will obtain, and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to obtain, that amount of directors\' and officers\' insurance (or
"tail" coverage) obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum
Premium.

  

 (c) The provisions of this Section 5.08 will survive the Closing and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and its successors and representatives after the Effective Time and their rights under this Section 5.08 are in addition to, and will not be deemed to be exclusive of, any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract, the Company Organizational Documents or similar organizational document of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if, at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Party delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under any of the provisions set forth in this Section 5.08, then the claim asserted in such notice (and the related indemnification obligations provided for hereunder) shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. 

  

 (d) Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause them to, include and maintain in effect in their respective certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational document) for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, provisions regarding the elimination of liability of directors (or their equivalent), indemnification of officers and directors thereof and advancement of expenses which are, in the aggregate with respect to each such entity, no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions contained in such organizational documents as of the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Subsidiary thereof or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any such Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.08. 

  

  

 Section 5.09. _ Commercially Reasonable Best Efforts._ 

  

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (including those contained in this Section 5.09), each of the parties hereto shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) use its commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, and to satisfy all conditions to, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entities, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents or waivers from third parties if any such consent or waiver is or would reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or if any such consent or waiver is otherwise necessary to permit the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Parent will take all action necessary to cause MergerCo to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this 

  

      

  

Agreement. The Company and Parent and their respective counsel shall, subject
to applicable Law, promptly (x) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the
taking of the actions contemplated by clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) immediately
above and (y) supply the other with any information that may be reasonably
required in order to effectuate the taking of such actions. Each party hereto
shall promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be,
of any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If the Company or Parent
receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, then it shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to
make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after
consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with
such request, and, if permitted by applicable Law and by any applicable
Governmental Entity, provide the other party\'s counsel with advance notice
and the opportunity to participate in any material meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filing made thereto in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent nor the
Company shall commit to or agree (or permit their respective Subsidiaries to
commit to or agree) with any Governmental Entity to stay, toll or extend any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust
Laws, without the prior written consent of the other (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 5.09, materials provided to the other party or its counsel may
be redacted (A) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements and (C) as necessary to address good faith legal privilege or
confidentiality concerns.

   

 (b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to Section 5.09(a) hereof, the parties hereto shall (i) provide or cause to be provided as promptly as reasonably practicable to Governmental Entities with jurisdiction over the Antitrust Laws (each such Governmental Entity, a " _Governmental Antitrust Authority_ ") information and documents requested by any Governmental Antitrust Authority as necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and filing any notification and report form and related material required under the HSR Act, the EC Merger Regulation and any additional consents and filings under any other Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement (provided that in the case of the filing under the HSR Act, such filing shall be made on or prior to the fifteenth (15th) day (or the immediately following Business Day if such day is not a Business Day) following the date of this Agreement (calculated by excluding the date of this Agreement) unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties hereto) and thereafter to respond as promptly as practicable to any request for additional information or documentary material that may be made under the HSR Act, the EC Merger Regulation or any other applicable Antitrust Laws, (ii) subject to the terms set forth in Section 5.09(c) hereof, use their commercially reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are necessary or advisable to obtain prompt approval of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Entity or expiration of applicable waiting periods, (iii) use their commercially reasonable best efforts to contest on the merits, through litigation in United States District Court (or state court, if applicable) or other applicable courts or through administrative or other applicable procedures in relation to non-U.S. or other applicable Governmental Entities, any objections or opposition raised by any Governmental Entity or other Person in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) use their commercially reasonable best efforts to defend on appeal any favorable Order on the merits in United States District Court (or state court, if applicable) or in other applicable courts or through administrative or other applicable procedures in relation to non-U.S. or other applicable Governmental Entities and (v) use their commercially reasonable best efforts to have overturned or reversed on appeal any Orders issued 

  

      

  
  

by a United States District Court, the European Commission or any other
Governmental Entity prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries will not without Parent\'s prior written consent, agree to any divestiture of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property, or the imposition of any limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock to avoid or eliminate any impediment under Antitrust Laws, provided that the parties shall be required to take or agree to take (or consent to the taking of) such actions unless the result thereof would have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries (assuming for purposes of this determination that Parent and its Subsidiaries are of equivalent size to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole); _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor any Subsidiary thereof shall be required to take any such action prior to the Closing Date. 

  

  

 Section 5.10. _ Public Announcements._ Except with respect to any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any other action taken by the Company or the Company Board pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 5.04 hereof, so long as this Agreement is in effect, Parent, MergerCo and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or making any other public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such other public statement without the consent of the other party(ies), which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except as such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange or association upon which the securities of the Company or Parent, as applicable, are listed, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall consult with the other party(ies) about, and allow the other party(ies) reasonable time (taking into account the circumstances) to comment on, such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, and the party will consider such comments in good faith.

 Section 5.13. _ Rule 16b-3._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may approve, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and in accordance with the Interpretative Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC relating to Rule 16b-3, any dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities with respect to equity securities of the Company) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each officer or director of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to equity securities of the Company.

name and on behalf of the Company or MergerCo, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

  

 Section 5.15. _ Controlled Subsidiaries._ The Company shall, and shall (subject to the terms of this Section 5.15) cause each of its Subsidiaries to, exercise their respective voting rights in their capacities as a stockholder, equityholder and/or contractual authority, in each case, if any, to cause each of the Subsidiaries set forth on Section 5.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Controlled Subsidiaries_ ") to comply with the terms set forth in Section 5.01 hereof, provided that so long as the Company and each Subsidiary thereof shall have complied with their respective obligations under this Section 5.15, if any Controlled Subsidiary shall not comply with the terms set forth in Section 5.01 hereof that are applicable to Subsidiaries of the Company, the Company shall not be in breach of its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and MergerCo acknowledge that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (nor any representatives thereof serving any such Controlled Subsidiary as a director, officer or in any similar capacity) shall be required to take any action or fail to take any action that reasonably would be expected to result in a breach of its (or his or her) fiduciary duties to stockholders of any Controlled Subsidiary under applicable Law, and the taking or failure to take any such action pursuant to this sentence shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.16. _ Capital Expenditures._ The Company shall consult with Parent prior to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Controlled Subsidiaries) contractually committing to incur or incurring any capital expenditure in excess of $50,000,000 individually, other than any such capital expenditure that has been contractually committed in the ordinary course of business prior to the date hereof or is committed or incurred pursuant to or in connection with any Contracts entered into with new or existing customers after the date hereof in the ordinary course of business.
