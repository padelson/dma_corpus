(v) AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of August 4, 2006 (this " _Agreement_
"), among ARROW CAPITAL US INC., a Delaware corporation (" _Arrow_ "), ARROW
SUBSIDIARY CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Arrow (" _Merger Sub_ "), DELEK GROUP LTD., a corporation organized
under the laws of Israel (" _Arrow Parent_ ") (only for purposes of Section
8.8 hereof), and REPUBLIC COMPANIES GROUP, INC., a Delaware corporation ("
_Republic_ ").

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Arrow and Republic have approved, and deem
it advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders
to consummate, a business combination transaction between Merger Sub and
Republic upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, Arrow Parent has agreed, pursuant to Section 8.8 hereof, to guarantee
the prompt and complete payment of amounts due and payable by, and performance
of the obligations of, Arrow and Merger Sub under this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, Arrow and Republic desire to make certain representations, warranties
and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various
conditions to the Merger; and

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Arrow and Merger Sub entering into
this Agreement, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, (i) Arrow and certain holders of shares of Common Stock are
entering into a stockholders agreement (the " _Stockholders Agreement_ "),
pursuant to which, among other things, the stockholders party thereto have
agreed, subject to the terms thereof, to vote their shares of Common Stock in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and (ii) Republic is entering into employment agreements with certain
of its executive officers (the " _Executive Employment Agreements_ "), which
Executive Employment Agreements shall take effect upon the consummation of the
Merger;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Republic
(the " _Merger_ "), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease, and Republic shall continue its corporate existence under Delaware law
as the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to
as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall continue to be governed by the
laws of the State of Delaware.

1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place
at 10:00 a.m. on the date that is the third Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the conditions set forth
in Article VI (excluding conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied
on the Closing Date), unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by
the parties hereto (the actual date and time of the Closing are herein referred to as the
" _Closing Date_ "). The Closing shall be held at the offices of LeBoeuf,
Lamb, Greene and MacRae LLP, in New York, New York, unless another place is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. " _Business Day_ " as used herein
shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which
banking institutions in New York, Delaware or Israel are obligated by law or
executive order to be closed.

1.3 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, on or prior to the Closing Date, Republic shall cause a certificate
of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective when the Certificate of Merger has
been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at
such other subsequent date or time as Arrow and Republic may agree and specify
in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and in Section 259 of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Republic and Merger Sub
shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties
of Republic and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.

1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Surviving Corporation_. At the
Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Republic shall be amended
and restated in the form of the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to Section 5.6(b),
until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware law and such Certificate
of Incorporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that as of the Effective Time such
Certificate of Incorporation shall provide that the name of the Surviving
Corporation is "Republic Companies Group, Inc." The Bylaws of Merger Sub as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation until the next annual meeting (or the earlier of
their resignation or removal) and until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of Republic
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be.

1.7 _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of Republic or Merger Sub acquired or to
be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of either Republic or Merger Sub, all such
deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of each of



 

-2- such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title
and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

ARTICLE II

TREATMENT OF SHARES

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, Republic or
the holder of any of the following securities:

(a) _Conversion of Republic Capital Stock_. Each share of Republic Common
Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of
Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting
Shares) shall be cancelled and extinguished and be converted into the right
to receive $20.40 (the " _Per Share Amount_ ") in cash payable to the holder
thereof, without interest, upon surrender of the certificate representing such
Common Stock. The aggregate amount of cash into which all such shares of
Common Stock are to be exchanged pursuant to this Section 2.1(a) is referred
to herein as the " _Merger Consideration_."

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. Each share of Common Stock held in the
treasury of Republic and each share of Common Stock owned by any direct or
indirect Subsidiary of Republic immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be canceled and extinguished, and no payment or other consideration shall be
made with respect thereto.

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock, no
par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall thereafter represent one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

2.2 _Treatment of Dissenting Shares_.

(a) _Appraisal_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, any shares of Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are owned by Republic stockholders who have
properly perfected their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive cash pursuant to Section 2.1, unless and until such Republic
stockholders fail to perfect their appraisal rights under applicable law, but
instead, such stockholders shall be entitled to payment of the appraised value
of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2.2(a), if any such Republic
stockholder shall fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or lose such
appraisal rights, each share of Common Stock held by such stockholder shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into the right to receive and
become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration with
respect thereto, in the manner provided for in Section 2.1.

(b) _Notice of Appraisal Demand_. Republic shall give Arrow (i) prompt notice
of any written demands for appraisal filed pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL, withdrawals of



 

-3- such demands, and any other instrument served or delivered in connection with
such demands pursuant to the DGCL and received by Republic and (ii) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for appraisal under the DGCL. Republic shall not voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal and shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Arrow, settle or offer to settle any such demands.

2.3 _Surrender of Capital Stock; Stock Transfer Books_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Arrow shall designate a
bank or trust company (reasonably acceptable to Republic) to act as agent for
the holders of Common Stock (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to receive the funds
necessary to make the payments contemplated by Sections 2.1 and 2.4. At the
Effective Time, Arrow shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, in trust with
the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of Common Stock, the aggregate
consideration to which such holders shall be entitled to at the Effective Time
pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 2.4.

(b) _Exchange Period_. Each holder of a certificate or certificates
representing any shares of Common Stock canceled upon the Merger pursuant
to Section 2.1(a) may thereafter surrender such certificate or certificates
to the Exchange Agent as agent for such holder, to effect the surrender of
such certificate or certificates on such holders behalf for a period ending
six months after the Effective Time (the " _Exchange Period_ "). Arrow agrees
that promptly after the Effective Time it shall cause the distribution to
holders of record of shares of Common Stock as of the Effective Time of
appropriate materials to facilitate such surrender. Upon the surrender of
certificates representing the Common Stock, Arrow shall cause the Exchange
Agent to pay the holder of such certificates in exchange therefor cash in an
amount equal to the Per Share Amount multiplied by the number of shares of
Common Stock, plus the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date prior to the Effective Time, if any, remaining unpaid with respect
to the Common Stock, represented by such certificate immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Until so surrendered, each such certificate (other than
certificates representing Dissenting Shares and certificates representing
Common Stock canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b)) shall represent solely the
right to receive the aggregate Per Share Amount relating thereto, subject
however to Arrows obligation (if any) to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have
been declared by Republic on the shares of Common Stock, in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

(c) _Payment to Other Persons_. If payment of cash in respect of canceled
shares of Common Stock is to be made to a person other than the person
in whose name a surrendered certificate or instrument is registered, it shall
be a condition to such payment that the certificate or instrument so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other
than that of the registered holder of the certificate or instrument
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Arrow or the
Exchange Agent that such Tax is not payable.

(d) _Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
Republic shall be closed and there shall not be any further registration or
transfer of any shares



 

-4- of Common Stock thereafter on the records of Republic. If, after the Effective
Time, certificates for shares of Common Stock are presented to the Surviving
Corporation they shall be cancelled and exchanged for cash as provided in
Section 2.1(a). No interest shall accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon
the surrender of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Common Stock.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any certificates
representing Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions as may be required pursuant to this Article II in respect of the
shares of Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificates; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Arrow may, in its discretion and
as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Arrow or the Exchange Agent with respect to the certificates alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(f) _Conclusion of Exchange Period_. Promptly following the end of the
Exchange Period, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to Arrow all cash (including
any interest received with respect thereto), certificates and other documents
in its possession relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and the
Exchange Agents duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a
certificate representing Common Stock (other than certificates representing
Dissenting Shares and certificates representing Common Stock canceled
pursuant to Section 2.1(b)) shall be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar
laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the aggregate Per
Share Amount payable upon due surrender of their certificates, without any
interest or dividends thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Arrow,
the Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
holder of a certificate representing Common Stock for any amount delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. Any portion of the Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by
holders of Common Stock as of a date that is immediately prior to such time
as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(g) _Withholdings_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, Republic, its Subsidiaries and Arrow shall cooperate with each other
and take all reasonably necessary steps between the date hereof and the
Effective Time to determine if any amounts should be withheld or deducted
from any payments made under this Agreement pursuant to the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (including all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of any state, county,
local or foreign tax law. The Per Share Amount paid in the Merger shall be
subject to reduction for any applicable withholding Taxes and, as set forth in
Section 2.3(c), stock transfer taxes payable by such holder. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Arrow, Republic or the Exchange Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the relevant shares.



 

-5- (h) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the

Republic or any Republic Insurer, there is no reason to believe that the
financial condition of any other party to any Republic Reinsurance Agreement
is impaired with the result that a default thereunder may reasonably be
anticipated, whether or not such default may be cured by the operation of any
offset clause in such agreement, and all amounts recoverable under
any Republic Reinsurance Agreement to which any Republic Insurer is a party
(including amounts based on paid and unpaid losses) are fully collectible.

constitute a material breach of any of the representations, warranties or
covenants of such party contained herein and Republic shall promptly advise
Arrow orally and in writing of any material deficiency asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to any Subsequent Republic SAP Statement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any noncompliance with the foregoing shall not

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Republic
shall prepare and file with the SEC proxy materials which shall
constitute the proxy statement relating to the matters to be submitted to the

statement, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_
"), and Republic shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly
as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto and to cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Republic stockholders as promptly as

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to Section 5.4(b),
the Board of Directors of Republic shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain from the Republic stockholders the Required Republic Vote and shall
recommend to the Republic stockholders that they vote to adopt this Agreement
and the plan of merger contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Republic shall not be obligated to make the foregoing recommendation to the
extent that the Board of Directors of Republic determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that such failure to so
recommend is required in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law (subject to the requirements of Section 7.2); _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve
Republic of its obligation to submit this Agreement to its stockholders for a
vote on the approval thereof unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms prior to the Republic Stockholders Meeting.

(c) Nothing contained in this Section 5.1 shall prohibit Republic from taking
and disclosing to the stockholders of Republic a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any

judgment of the Board of Directors of Republic, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary obligations under applicable law.

(a) Upon reasonable notice, Republic shall (and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financial advisors and other representatives of Arrow, access,

organizations and (ii) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Republic or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such
access or disclosure (x) would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege,
work-product doctrine or any other applicable privilege of the institution in
possession or control of such information, (y) would contravene any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment or decree or (z) is restricted or prohibited by
any contract entered into prior to the date hereof.

(b) Arrow shall hold any such information which is nonpublic in confidence to
the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement dated July 18, 2006, between Republic and Arrow (the

respective Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or cause

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) to cooperate in
connection with any financing transaction undertaken by Arrow to fund the

customary due diligence and arranging senior officers, as selected by Arrow,
to meet with prospective lenders and investors in customary presentations
(including "road show" presentations and sessions with rating agencies), the
preparation and filing of any offering document or listing particulars, the
issuance of any comfort letter, the receipt of any auditors consents, the
delivery of consolidated



 

-40- pro forma financial information and the use of commercially reasonable efforts
to cause each independent auditor to so cooperate; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that a party shall not be obligated to take any action pursuant to the
foregoing if the taking of such action or such compliance or the obtaining of
such consent, authorization, order, approval or exemption will result in such
party being required to hold separate or to divest any of its respective
businesses or assets. Each of Republic and Arrow shall promptly cooperate with
and furnish information to the other in connection with any such efforts by,
or requirement imposed upon, any of them or any of their Subsidiaries in
connection with the foregoing.

5.4 _Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) Republic agrees that, prior to the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall
cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, agents and representatives
(including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or
any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate,
solicit, or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries or the making of
any proposal or offer with respect to, or a transaction to effect, (A) a
merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving it
or any of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute more than 15% of the consolidated assets of it and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) any purchase or sale of 15% or more of the
consolidated assets (including stock of its Subsidiaries) of it and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (C) any purchase or sale of, or tender or
exchange offer for, its voting securities that, if consummated, would result
in any person (or the stockholders of such person) beneficially owning
securities representing 15% or more of its total voting power (or of the
surviving parent entity in such transaction) or the voting power of any of its
Subsidiaries or any reinsurance transaction outside the ordinary course of
business (any such proposal, offer or transaction (other than a proposal or
offer made by Arrow or an affiliate thereof) being hereinafter referred to as
an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii) have any discussions with or provide any
confidential information or data to any person relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal,
or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) approve, adopt or recommend, or propose to
approve, adopt or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, asset purchase or share exchange
agreement, reinsurance agreement, option agreement or other agreement related
to any Acquisition Proposal or propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,

through its and Republics advisors, agents and other intermediaries, prior to
the Republic Stockholders Meeting, and subject to compliance with the other
terms of this Section 5.4 and to first entering into a confidentiality
agreement with such initiating person, which confidentiality agreement shall
have provisions that are no less favorable to Republic than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement, to engage in discussions and negotiations
with, and provide nonpublic information or data to, any person that has made a
bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors
of Republic has determined in good faith by majority vote, after
consultation with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel, is, or
is



 

-41- reasonably likely to be, a Superior Proposal; _provided_ that the Board of
Directors of Republic has determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action in connection
therewith would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law;
and _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that Republic shall have delivered
written notice to Arrow at least three Business Days in advance of taking any
action permitted pursuant to this Section 5.4(b). Nothing contained herein
shall prevent the Board of Directors of Republic from complying with Rule
14e-2 or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal to the extent applicable.

(c) Republic shall notify Arrow promptly (but in no event later than 24
hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic
information relating to Republic or any of its Subsidiaries by any person that
informs Republic or any of its Subsidiaries that it is considering making, or
has made, an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry from any person seeking to
have discussions or negotiations with Republic relating to a possible
Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in
writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person making the Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms and conditions of any
inquiries, proposals or offers (including a copy thereof if in writing and
any related documentation or correspondence). Republic shall also promptly,
and in any event within 24 hours, notify Arrow, orally and in writing, if it
enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal
or provides nonpublic information or data to any person in accordance with
this Section 5.4 and keep Arrow informed of the status and terms of any such
proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations on a current basis, including
by providing a copy of all material documentation relating thereto.

(d) Republic agrees that (i) it will and will cause its Subsidiaries, and
its and their officers, directors, agents, representatives and advisors to,
cease immediately and terminate any and all existing activities, discussions
or negotiations with any third parties conducted heretofore with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) subject to the other provisions of this
Section 5.4, it will not release any third party from, or waive any provisions
of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Republic
agrees that it will promptly inform its and its Subsidiaries respective
directors, officers, key employees, agents and representatives of the
obligations undertaken in this Section 5.4. 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal not attributable to a breach of
Section 5.4(a) which the Board of Directors of Republic determines in good
faith by majority vote, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal advisor, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory
and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal
(including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions
to consummation), (i) is more favorable to the stockholders of Republic from
a financial point of view, than the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is fully financed or reasonably
capable of being fully financed, reasonably likely to receive all required
governmental approvals on a timely basis and otherwise reasonably capable of
being completed on the terms proposed; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for
purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," the term Acquisition
Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.4(a),
except that the reference to "15% or more of its total voting power" in the
definition of "Acquisition



 

-42- Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "a majority of its total voting
power" and each reference to "15% or more of the consolidated assets" shall
be deemed to be a reference to " a majority of the consolidated assets."

5.5 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, except
as otherwise provided in Section 7.2 and Section 7.3.

5.6 _Indemnification Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Arrow shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide
advancement of expenses (without security) to, each person who is now, or has
been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of Republic or any of its
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses, claims,
damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in
settlement of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out
of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of
Republic or any Subsidiary of Republic, and pertaining to any matter existing
or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time
(including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) (" _Indemnified Liabilities_ ") to the same extent such
persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of
the date of this Agreement with respect to such Indemnified Liabilities by
Republic pursuant to Republics Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and
indemnification agreements and resolutions, if any, in existence on the date
hereof and previously disclosed to Arrow with any directors, officers and
employees of Republic and its Subsidiaries.

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect (i) in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (or any successor to the
Surviving Corporation), provisions regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to
the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions contained in
the current certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Republic, and (ii) the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by Republic (provided that the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with one or more
reputable unaffiliated third-party insurers of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the
insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred
at or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such
insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 200% of the premiums paid as of
the date hereof by Republic for such insurance (" _Republic s Current
Premium_"), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed
200% of Republics Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall



 

-43- cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving
Corporations good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage
available at an annual premium equal to 200% of Republics Current Premium. In
lieu of such coverage, Arrow may substitute a prepaid "tail" policy for such
coverage, which it may cause Republic to obtain prior to the Closing.

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.6 (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
representatives, (ii) may not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect in any material respect any Indemnified Party without the
consent of such affected Indemnified Party, and (iii) are in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

5.7 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

(a) Arrow agrees that those individuals who are employed by Republic or any
of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date shall continue to be
employees of the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries as of the Closing
Date (each such employee, an " _Affected Employee_ "); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that this Section 5.7 shall not be construed to, and nothing
contained herein shall, limit the ability of the applicable employer to
terminate the employment of any Affected Employee at any time.

(b) Arrow shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, give the
Affected Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting under
any employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained for the benefit of
Affected Employees by the Surviving Corporation in effect as of the Closing
Date for such Affected Employees service with Republic or any Subsidiary of
Republic to the same extent recognized by Republic or such Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Closing Date except to the extent it results in the
duplication of benefits. With respect to any employee benefit plan or
arrangement established by Arrow or the Surviving Corporation after the
Closing Date (the " _Post Closing Plans_ ") for the benefit of Affected
Employees, service shall be credited in accordance with the terms of such Post
Closing Plans. During the one year period following the Effective Time the
Post Closing Plans shall provide benefits to the Affected Employees that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits provided to the
Affected Employees under the Republic Benefit Plans.

(c) Arrow shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Affected
Employees under any welfare benefit plan established to replace any Republic
welfare benefit plans in which such Affected Employees may be eligible to
participate after the Closing Date, other than limitations or waiting periods
that are already in effect with respect to such Affected Employees and that
have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date under any welfare plan
maintained for the Affected Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (ii) provide each Affected Employee with credit for any co-payments
and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans that such
Affected Employees are eligible to participate in after the Closing Date.



 

-44- (d) Arrow shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor
and assume all employment, severance, consulting and retention agreements or
arrangements and all Republic Benefit Plans as in effect as of the date
hereof, all of which agreements and arrangements are as set forth in Section
3.1(j)(ii) of the Republic Disclosure Letter, or that are entered into prior
to the Closing Date in accordance with Section 4.1(a) hereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this Section 5.7 is not intended to prevent Arrow or the
Surviving Corporation from exercising their rights with respect to such
agreements or arrangements and all Republic Benefit Plans in accordance with
their terms, including the right to alter, terminate or otherwise amend all
such agreements and arrangements and Republic Benefit Plans.

contrary, Republic shall not file any Tax Return that Arrow has the right to

not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other

8.8 _Arrow Parent Guarantee_.

surety, to Republic (i) the prompt and complete payment in full as and when
due and payable by Arrow and Merger Sub (and their respective successors and
permitted assigns) of any and all amounts payable by Arrow



 

-54- and Merger Sub pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (such payment
obligations, the " _Guaranteed Payments_ "), and (ii) the prompt and complete
performance in full by Arrow and Merger Sub (and their respective successors
and assigns) of their respective other obligations under the terms of this
Agreement (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). The Guaranteed Payments and
Guaranteed Obligations are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the "
_Obligations_." If for any reason Arrow or Merger Sub shall fail or be unable
promptly and fully to pay any Guaranteed Payment as and when the same shall
be due and payable hereunder or to perform any Guaranteed Obligation, Arrow
Parent shall forthwith pay or cause to be paid such Guaranteed Payment to
Republic or shall forthwith perform or cause to be performed such Guaranteed
Obligation, as the case may be, and Republic shall not be obligated to pursue
remedies against Arrow or Merger Sub as a condition to enforcement of the
Guarantee. Arrow Parent has the full corporate power and authority to provide
the Guarantee, to perform its obligations with respect thereto and to execute
this Agreement for the purposes thereof. The provision of the Guarantee, the
performance of Arrow Parents obligations with respect thereto and
the execution and delivery of this Agreement for purposes of this Section 8.8
have been duly and validly authorized and approved by all requisite corporate
action of Arrow Parent and no other acts or proceedings on its part are
necessary with respect thereto.

(b) _Guarantee Absolute_. Arrow Parent hereby guarantees that the Guaranteed
Payments will be paid and the Guaranteed Obligations will be performed
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The obligations of
Arrow Parent under the Guarantee constitute a present and continuing guarantee
of payment and performance, and not of collectibility. Subject to Section
8.8(g), the liability of Arrow Parent under this Section 8.8 shall be
absolute, unconditional, present, continuing and irrevocable until all of the
Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full or performed, as applicable,
irrespective of:

(i) any assignment or other transfer of this Agreement or any of the
rights hereunder of Arrow or Merger Sub hereunder;

(ii) any amendment, waiver, renewal or extension of, or release or
consent under, this Agreement, in each case other than in respect of this
Section 8.8;

(iii) any acceptance by Republic of partial payment or performance from Arrow
or Merger Sub;

(iv) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, composition,
adjustment, dissolution, liquidation or other like proceeding relating to
Arrow or Merger Sub, or any action taken with respect to this Agreement by any
trustee or receiver, or by any court, in any such proceedings; or

(v) any absence of any notice to, or knowledge of, Arrow Parent, of the
existence or occurrence of any of the matters set forth in the foregoing
subsections (i) through (iv).

Subject to Section 8.8(g), the obligations of Arrow Parent hereunder shall not
be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any
reason, including any claims of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or
compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff,



 

-55- counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise,
_provided_ that nothing contained in this Section 8.8 shall limit the ability
of Arrow, Merger Sub or Arrow Parent to bring any action or claim under this
Agreement.

(c) _Continuing Guarantee._ The Guarantee is a continuing Guarantee and shall
(i) remain in full force and effect until the complete performance of all of
the Guaranteed Obligations and the indefeasible payment in full of all of the
Guaranteed Payments, (ii) be binding upon Arrow Parent, its successors and
permitted assigns and (iii) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
Republic and its successors, transferees and permitted assigns; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding Section 8.10, the obligations of Arrow Parent
in this Section 8.8 may not be assigned, transferred or delegated without the
prior written consent of Republic. Any attempted assignment or transfer in
violation of this Section 8.8(c) shall be void.

(d) _Waiver_. Arrow Parent hereby waives promptness, diligence, all setoffs,
presentments, protests and notice of acceptance and any other notice relating
to any of the Obligations or this Section 8.8. 

(e) _Subrogation Waiver_. Arrow Parent agrees that it shall not have any
rights (direct or indirect) of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement,
indemnification, or other rights of payment or recovery from Republic for any
payments made by Arrow Parent hereunder until all Obligations have been fully
and indefeasibly paid and performed, and Arrow Parent hereby
irrevocably waives and releases, absolutely and unconditionally, any such
rights of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnification and other
rights of payment or recovery it may now have or hereafter acquire against
Arrow or Merger Sub until all Obligations have been fully and indefeasibly
paid and performed.

(f) _Reinstatement_. The obligations of Arrow Parent under this Section 8.8
shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if
at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Payments is rescinded or must
otherwise be returned to Arrow or Merger Sub or any other entity, or any
of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or annulled, upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy, arrangement, adjustment, composition, liquidation or
reorganization of Arrow or Merger Sub, as though such payment had not been
made or performance had not occurred, as applicable.

(g) _Certain Defenses_. Republic agrees that notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, except as provided in the last sentence of
this Section 8.8(g), Arrow Parent shall not be obligated to pay or perform any
Obligation hereunder to the extent that Arrow or Merger Sub, as the case may
be, is not required to pay or perform such Obligation as a result of any
right or offset, counterclaim or other defense available to Arrow or Merger
Sub, as the case may be, with respect to such Obligation in accordance with
the provisions of the this Agreement (collectively, a " _Purchaser Defense_
"). In furtherance thereof, Arrow Parent shall be entitled to assert any
Purchaser Defense to the same extent that any such Purchaser Defense could be
asserted by Arrow or Merger Sub, as the case may be, in any action brought by
Republic to enforce the Obligations against Arrow or Merger Sub, as the case
may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.8(g), in no
event shall any stay or discharge or other impairment of or limitation on the
Obligations as the result of any bankruptcy,



 

-56- insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, composition, adjustment, dissolution,
liquidation or other like proceeding relating to Arrow or Merger Sub, as the
case may be, or any action taken with respect to this Agreement by any trustee
or receiver, or by any court, in any such proceeding, give rise to any defense
to payment or performance by Arrow Parent hereunder.

(h) _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Notwithstanding any other term or condition
hereof, including the cover page and Arrow Parents signature block on the
signature page hereof, Arrow Parent agrees that it is subject to Section 8.7
in addition to this Section 8.8.

8.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and, unless
the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability would prevent the parties
from realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of the Merger that
they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, shall not render invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affect
the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only
so broad as is enforceable.

8.10 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations of the parties hereunder shall be assigned by either of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other party, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void; _provided_ that Arrow
may assign this Agreement to any Subsidiary of Arrow Parent, it being
understood that no such assignment shall relieve Arrow of its
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

8.11 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
court identified in Section 8.7, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.

8.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO,
OR CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
