_Agreement_ "), among Austin HoldCo Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_
"), Austin BidCo Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent (" _Sub_ ") and Virtusa Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ ").

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Sub and the Company have
approved and declared advisable the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Sub with and
into the Company, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, whereby each issued share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") not owned by
Parent, Sub or the Company shall be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration;

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to the Company's willingness to enter into this
Agreement, each of The Baring Asia Private Equity Fund VII, L.P., The Baring
Asia Private Equity Fund VII, L.P.1 and The Baring Asia Private Equity Fund
VII, SCSp (collectively, the " _Investors_ ") is entering into a limited
guarantee in favor of the Company with respect to certain obligations of
Parent and Sub under this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as an inducement to each party's willingness to enter into this Agreement,
each Investor is entering into an equity financing commitment letter in favor
of Parent, pursuant to which such Investor has committed, on the terms and
subject only to the conditions expressly set forth therein, to invest in
Parent the amounts set forth therein;

  



  

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent and certain stockholders of the Company are entering into a Voting
Agreement (the " _Voting Agreement_ " and, together with this Agreement, the
Commitment Letters, and the Guarantees, the " _Transaction Agreements_
") pursuant to which such stockholders will agree to take specified actions
in furtherance of the Merger; and

  



  

WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to
prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

Article I _ 
  
 The Merger_

  



  

Section 1.01. _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall succeed to and assume
all the rights and obligations of Sub in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger,
and the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements are
referred to in this Agreement collectively as the " _Transactions_."

  



  

   

 



    



  

Section 1.02. _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall
take place remotely via the electronic exchange of documents at 10:00 a.m. New
York City time on the second (2nd) business day following the satisfaction
(or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver by all parties) of the
conditions set forth in Article VII; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions at
such time), then, subject to the continued satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII at such time, Parent and Sub shall not be
required to effect the Closing until the earliest of (i) any business day
during the Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent on no less than two
business days' prior written notice to the Company (it being understood that
such date may be conditioned upon the simultaneous completion of Parent's
financing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), (ii) the third
business day following the final day of the Marketing Period or (iii) such
other place, time and date as may be agreed in writing by the Company and
Parent. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement
as the " _Closing Date_."

  



  

Section 1.03. _Effective Time_. Prior to the Closing, the parties shall
prepare, and on the Closing Date the parties shall file with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger or other appropriate
documents (in any such case, the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other
filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such
Secretary of State, or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall
agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes
effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

Section 1.04. _Effects_. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the
effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 1.05. _Organizational Documents_.

  



  

(a)  The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended at the Effective Time to be in the form
of Exhibit A, and, as so amended, such Certificate of Incorporation shall be
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  



  

(b)  The Bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

Section 1.06. _Directors and Officers_.

  



  

(a)  The directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier
of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  



  

(b)  The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors

Article II _ 
  
 Effect on the Capital Stock of the 
 Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_

  



  

Section 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_.

  



  

(a)   _Capital Stock of Sub_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares
of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Sub, each issued and
outstanding share of capital stock of Sub shall be converted into and become
one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b)   _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_.
At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of
capital stock of Sub, each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the
Company as treasury stock, Parent or Sub shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no Parent
common stock or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in
exchange therefor.

  



  

(c)   _Conversion of Company Common Stock_.

  



  

(i)  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common
Stock or any shares of capital stock of Sub, subject to Sections 2.01(b),
2.01(d) and 2.02(e), each issued share of Company Common Stock shall be
converted into the right to receive $51.35 in cash (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").

  



  

(ii)  As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ")
or evidence of shares in book-entry form (" _Uncertificated Shares_ "), in
each case, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive Merger Consideration upon surrender of
such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares in accordance with Section 2.02,
without interest.

  



  

(d)   _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
person who is entitled to demand and properly demands statutory appraisal of
such shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") shall not be
converted into Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but
rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the
fair market value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to receive payment of fair
market value under Section 262 then the right of such holder to be paid the
fair value of such holder's Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into,
and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), without interest thereon, upon
surrender of the certificate formerly representing such shares. The Company
shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do
any of the foregoing.

Section 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a)   _Paying Agent_. _Prior_ to the Effective Time, Parent
shall select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of Merger Consideration upon
surrender of Certificates and Uncertificated Shares. Parent shall take all
steps necessary to enable and cause the Surviving Corporation to, immediately
prior to or at the Effective Time, provide to the Paying Agent all the cash
necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the
right to receive cash pursuant to Section 2.01 (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

  



  

(b)   _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to (i)
each holder of record of a Certificate, (A) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (B) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Merger
Consideration and (ii) each holder of Uncertificated Shares (A) materials
advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the conversion of
its Uncertificated Shares into the right to receive Merger Consideration and
(B) a check in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration
to which such holder is entitled. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of Company Common
Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted
pursuant to Section 2.01, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender Merger Consideration
as contemplated by this Section 2.02. No interest shall be paid or accrue on
any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

  



  

   

-4-

 



    



  

(c)   _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The
Merger Consideration issued (and paid) in accordance with the terms of this
Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock (including
any dividends or other distributions paid pursuant to this Section 2.02(c))
shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, subject, however,
to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or make any
other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may
have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of
this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and after the
Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, any certificates formerly representing shares of
Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II.

  



  

(d)   _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of a Certificate or
Uncertificated Share who has not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent common
stock as contemplated by this Article II.

  



  

(e)   _No Liability_. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate or Uncertificated Share has not been surrendered prior to five (5)
years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
U.S. federal, state, local or foreign government or any court of competent
jurisdiction, administrative agency or commission or other governmental
authority or instrumentality, domestic or foreign, or any mediator,
arbitrator or arbitral body (a " _Governmental Entity_ ")), any such shares,
cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f)   _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a
daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be the property of and shall be paid to Parent. To the extent that
there are investment losses that reduce the Exchange Fund below the level
required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment under Section
2.02(b), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly
replace or restore the cash lost in respect of such investments in the
Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is maintained at a level
sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments under Section 2.02(b).

(g)   _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate representing Company Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms
as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.02(h)) equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate by (ii) the
Merger Consideration.

  



  

(h)   _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and each other applicable withholding agent will be
entitled to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to,
or for the benefit of, any Person in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement such amounts as such withholding agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax law;
_provided_  that absent a change of Tax law or, in respect of clause (iii)
below, a change in facts (in each case only if such change is agreed in
writing by the Company), the parties hereto agree that (i) there shall be no
backup withholding under Section 3406 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") to the extent complete, accurate and valid
IRS Forms W-9 or W-8 and any successor form have been timely provided and
such forms establish that no backup withholding applies in connection with
the payments hereunder, (ii) there shall be no withholding under Section 897
of the Code, to the extent the certificates described in _Section 5.01(d)_
have been timely and duly provided; and (iii) no withholding under applicable
Indian Tax law is required to be made from the Merger Consideration or the
amounts payable in respect of Company Stock Awards or from any payment of the
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.02(b) (the " _Intended Indian Tax
Treatment_ "). All deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made. Any amounts so deducted or
withheld shall be remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity by the
applicable withholding agent in accordance with applicable law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any amounts
payable pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement that are subject to
compensatory withholdings, including, without limitation, in respect of the
Company Stock Awards, shall be remitted to the applicable payor (or its third-
party payroll agent, as applicable) for payment to the applicable Person
through the applicable payroll procedures and after applicable withholding is
applied. The parties hereto shall report all transactions contemplated by
this Agreement consistent with the Tax treatment described in this Section
2.02(h), including the Intended Indian Tax Treatment. No party shall take any
action that could reasonably adversely affect, and the Company shall use its
best effort to achieve, such Tax treatment, except as otherwise required
pursuant to any final determination (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the
Code or comparable provisions of state or non-U.S. law).

sections of such letter to the extent to which its relevance is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosed information), dated as of the date of
this Agreement, from the Company to each of Parent and Sub (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ ") and (ii) the Company SEC Documents (excluding any
disclosures contained or referenced therein under the captions "Risk
Factors," "Forward-Looking Statements," "Quantitative and

contained or referenced therein of information, factors or risks, in each
case, that are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature, other than

governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and
approvals necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its

to execute and deliver the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party and
to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance by the

consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, subject, in the
case of the Merger, if required by Law, to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval. The Company has duly executed and delivered each
Transaction Agreement to which it is a party, and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery of such Transaction Agreements on
behalf of the other parties thereto, each Transaction Agreement to which it
is a party constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable

Section 3.05. _No Conflicts; Consents_. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the Merger
will not: (a)(i) cause a violation of any of the provisions of the Company
Certificate of Incorporation or the Company Bylaws or (ii) cause a violation
of any of the provisions of the Organizational Documents of any Company
Subsidiary; (b) cause a violation of any Law applicable to the business of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary; (c) violate or conflict with, or result in
a breach of any provision of, or require any consent, waiver or approval with
respect to, or result in a default (or an event that, with the giving of
notice, the passage of time or otherwise, would constitute a default or give
rise to any such right) or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation, modification or acceleration under, any Material Contract; or
(d) result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties, rights or
assets of the Company, other than Permitted Liens, except in the case of
clauses (a)(ii), (b), (c) and (d), for any such violation, conflict, breach,
consent, waiver, approval, default, right, termination, cancellation,
modification, acceleration or Lien that has not had, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Except as may be required by the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), the DGCL, the listing
requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (" _NASDAQ_ "), the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ ") or
other applicable Antitrust Laws, and the CFIUS Clearance, the Company is not
required to make any filing with or to obtain any consent from any Person in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company
or the consummation by the Company of the Merger, except for such consents or
filings that, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 3.06. _SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

  



  

(a)  The Company has filed all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents (including exhibits and other
information incorporated by reference therein) required to be filed by the
Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") on or
after January 1, 2019 (such documents, together with any documents filed
during such period by the Company with the SEC on a voluntary basis on Form
8-K or otherwise, the " _Company SEC Documents_ ").

  



  

(b)  As of their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the
Reference Date, as finally amended prior to the Reference Date), the Company
SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC
Documents, each as in effect on the date so filed (or amended), and did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Except to the extent that information contained in any Company
SEC Document has been revised or superseded by a later Company SEC Document,
none of the Company SEC Documents contains any untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The consolidated
financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents
comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto) and fairly present the consolidated financial position of
the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments).

(c)  Except (i) as set forth in the Filed Company SEC Documents,
(ii) as incurred by or on behalf of the Company under, or otherwise permitted
by, this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the Transactions, (iii) as
incurred in connection with performance of the Company's obligations under
its Contracts to the extent such liabilities and obligations do not arise out
of any breach or default under such Contract on the part of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary and (iv) as has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise), whether or not required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries or in the notes
thereto.

  



  

(d)  None of the Company Subsidiaries is, or has at any time
been, subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of
the Exchange Act.

  



  

(e)  Each of the principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer of the Company has made all certifications required by Rule
13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (" _SOX_ ") and the rules and regulations of the
SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the
statements contained in such certifications are true and correct. For
purposes of the preceding sentence hereof, "principal executive officer" and
"principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in
SOX. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has outstanding,
or has arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or
executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.

  



  

(f)  The Company has not received any oral or written
notification of any (i) "significant deficiency", (ii) "material weakness" in
the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' internal controls, or (iii) fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees of the
Company who have a significant role in the internal controls over
financial reporting, and, to the knowledge of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, there is no set of circumstances that could reasonably be

2017.

Article IV _ 
  
 Representations and Warranties of Parent and Sub_

  



  

Parent and Sub represent and warrant to the Company that, except as set forth
in the letter (with specific reference to the particular Section or subsection
of this Agreement to which the information set forth in such letter relates;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any matter disclosed in one section of such
letter shall be deemed to be disclosed in such other sections of such letter
to which its relevance is readily apparent on the face of such information
and without the need to examine underlying documentation), dated as of the
date of this Agreement, from the Parent to the Company (the " _Parent
Disclosure Letter_ "):

  



  

Section 4.01. _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Parent and Sub is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized and has full corporate power and
authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits,
authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to own, lease or
otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as
presently conducted, other than such franchises, licenses, permits,
authorizations and approvals the lack of which, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

Sub has not carried on any business or conducted any operations other than the

Parent and Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver the Transaction Agreements and, subject to the adoption of this
Agreement by Parent as sole stockholder of Sub, to consummate the
Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance by each of Parent and
Sub of each Transaction Agreement and the consummation by it of the
Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of Parent and Sub, subject to the adoption of this Agreement by
Parent as sole stockholder of Sub. Promptly after the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, Parent, as sole stockholder of Sub, shall adopt this
Agreement. Each of Parent and Sub has duly executed and delivered each
Transaction Agreement, and each Transaction Agreement constitutes its legal,
valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

  



  

Section 4.04. _No Conflicts; Consents_. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent and Sub and the consummation by Parent and Sub of the
Merger will not: (a) cause a violation of any of the provisions of the
Organizational Documents of Parent or Sub; (b) cause a violation of any Law
applicable to the business of Parent or Sub; (c) violate or conflict with, or
result in a breach of any provision of, or require any consent, waiver or
approval with respect to, or result in a default (or an event that, with the
giving of notice, the passage of time or otherwise, would constitute a
default or give rise to any such right) or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration under, any material
Contract to which Parent or Sub is a party; or (d) result in the creation of
any Lien upon any of the properties, rights or assets of Parent or Sub, other
than Permitted Liens, except in the case of clauses (b), (c) and (d), for any
such violation, conflict, breach, consent, waiver, approval, default, right,
termination, cancellation, modification, acceleration or Lien that has not

CFIUS Clearance or as set forth on Section 4.04 of the Parent Disclosure
Letter, neither Parent nor Sub, nor any of Parent's other Affiliates is
required to make any filing with or to obtain any consent from any Person in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent or Sub
or the consummation by the Parent or Sub of the Merger, except for such
consents or filings that, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably be

stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any

required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, except that no representation is made by Parent or
Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based

Section 4.06. _Brokers_. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other person, other than Bank of America, the fees and expenses of which will
be paid by Parent, is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's
or other similar fee or commission in connection with the Merger and the
other Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or
Sub.

  



  

Section 4.07. _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct
and complete fully executed copies of (i) a debt commitment letter dated the
date hereof and addressed to Sub from Bank of America, N.A. and BofA
Securities, Inc. pursuant to which Bank of America, N.A. has committed to
provide, upon the terms and subject only to the conditions expressly set
forth therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth therein for the
purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (being
collectively referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ ") and each fee letter
entered into by Parent or Sub or any of their respective Affiliates in
connection therewith (such debt commitment letter and fee letters, together
with all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto, collectively, the " _Debt
Commitment Letters_ "); _provided_ that fee amounts and other commercially
sensitive terms, none of which could affect the conditionality, availability,
amount, timing or termination of the Debt Financing, may have been redacted
and (ii) executed equity commitment letters (the " _Equity Commitment Letters
"_ and with the Debt Commitment Letters, the "Commitment Letters") dated the
date hereof and addressed to Parent, pursuant to which each Investor has
committed, upon the terms and subject only to the conditions expressly set
forth therein, to provide the equity financing described therein in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (being
collectively referred to as the " _Equity Financing_ " and together with the
Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). As of the date hereof, the Commitment
Letters have not been amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, and no
terms or commitments or other obligations thereunder have been
waived, withdrawn, terminated, rescinded, repudiated, amended, supplemented
or otherwise modified, and no such waiver, withdrawal,
termination, rescission, repudiation, amendment, supplement or modification
is contemplated (and the Company has been designated as a third party
beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letters as provided therein). Sub has
fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees incurred or payable in
connection with the Financing and required to be paid on or prior to the date
hereof. The proceeds of the Financing (both before and after giving effect to
any "flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters), will in the
aggregate be sufficient for Sub and the Surviving Corporation to, pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration and pay all other amounts required to be paid
by Parent or Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Commitment Letters (including, without limitation, the
repayment of indebtedness of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
contemplated by this Agreement and the payment of all fees, costs and
expenses required to be paid by Parent or Sub at Closing in connection with
the Transactions or the Commitment Letters) (the amount sufficient to make
such payments, the " _Required Amount_ "). The Commitment Letters are in full
force and effect as of the date hereof, and the Commitment Letters constitute
valid and binding obligations of Parent and Sub, the other parties thereto,
enforceable against Parent and Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent and Sub,
each other party thereto, in accordance with their terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. As of the date hereof, Parent has no
knowledge that any event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default
or breach under any of the Commitment Letters. Neither Parent nor Sub has any
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be
satisfied on a timely basis or that the full amount of the Financing
necessary to fund the Required Amount will not be made available to Sub on a
timely basis in order to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. There are no conditions precedent or contingencies to the
obligations of the parties under the Commitment Letters (including pursuant
to any "flex" provisions or otherwise) to make the full amount of the
Financing available to Parent on the Closing Date upon the terms set forth
therein except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters. As of the
date hereof, there are no side letters or other agreements, Contracts or
arrangements to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party related
(directly or indirectly) to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the
full amount of the Financing that could affect the conditionality,
availability, amount, timing or termination of the Debt Financing other than
expressly as set forth in the Commitment Letters. Parent and Sub acknowledge
and agree that the obtaining of the Financing, or any Alternative
Financing, is not a condition to Closing.

  



  

   

-35-

 



    



  

Section 4.08. _Limited Guarantees_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the duly executed limited
guarantees of the Investors (the " _Guarantees_ "). The Guarantees are valid
and in full force and effect, and, as of the date hereof, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default on the part of any Investor under its applicable
Guarantee.

  



  

Section 4.09. _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time, assuming (i)
satisfaction of the conditions to Parent's obligation to consummate the
Merger, or waiver of such conditions, (ii) the accuracy, in all material
respects, of the representations and warranties of the Company in this
Agreement (without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or
"Company Material Adverse Effect" or similar materiality qualifiers set forth
therein) and the compliance, in all material respects, by the Company with the
covenants contained in this Agreement and (iii) the most recent financial
forecasts of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries delivered to Parent have
been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were and continue to
be reasonable, immediately after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, payment of all amounts to be
paid on the Closing Date, including the aggregate Merger
Consideration, repayment or refinancing of any indebtedness in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Debt
Commitment Letters and payment of all related fees and expenses, the
Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis,
will be Solvent. For the purposes of this Section 4.09, the term " _Solvent_
," when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of
determination, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" (determined on a
going concern basis) of the assets of such Person will, as of such date,
exceed the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent and
other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally
determined in accordance with applicable federal laws governing
determinations of the insolvency of debtors (including a reasonable estimate
of the amount of contingent liabilities); (b) such Person will not have, as
of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of
the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such
date; and (c) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature (including a reasonable
estimate of the amount of contingent liabilities). For purposes of this
definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged"
and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities,
as they mature" means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash
from operations, asset dispositions or lines of credit, or a combination
thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.

person has been authorized by the Company to make any representation or
warranty relating to the Company or its business, or otherwise in connection
with the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and, if made, such
representation or warranty may not be relied upon as having been authorized by
the Company.

and its Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that, except for the

or warranty, express or implied; (ii) any estimate, projection, prediction,
data, financial information, memorandum, presentation or other materials or
information provided or addressed to Parent, Sub or any of their respective

Affiliates are and have been conducted at all times in compliance with the
Anti-Money Laundering Laws, and no Action involving Parent or its Affiliates
with respect to the Anti-Money Laundering Laws is pending or, to the knowledge
of Parent and its Affiliates, threatened.

satisfy the reporting obligations under Section 6043A of the Code.

  



  

(e)   _Other Actions_. The Company shall comply with the
obligations set forth in Section 5.01(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  



  

Section 5.02. _No Solicitation_. (a) The Company shall not, and shall cause
its subsidiaries not to, and shall cause any officer, director or employee of,
or any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or
representative (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") of, the Company or any of
its subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate or
encourage the submission of, any Acquisition Proposal, or take any other
action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) enter into any Acquisition Agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into, participate in or continue any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with or

resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Representatives to, (1) cease immediately all discussions and
negotiations regarding any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (2) immediately after the date
hereof shall request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished to such Person(s) within the last twelve
months for the purpose of evaluating a possible Acquisition Proposal and (3)
terminate access to any physical or electronic data rooms relating to a
possible Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company Board
receives a written bona fide Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof that
was not solicited by the Company or its Representatives and did not otherwise
result from a breach or deemed breach of this Section 5.02(a) and that (I) the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,
and (II) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to take the actions specified in the
following clauses (x) and/or (y) of this sentence with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of the Company under Delaware Law, then subject to providing
prior written notice (before taking the actions in the following clauses (x)
or (y) hereof) of its decision to take such action to Parent as promptly as
practicable after such determination was reached (and in any event, no later
than 24 hours thereafter) and compliance with Section 5.02(c), the Company
Board may (x) furnish information with respect to the Company to the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement not materially less restrictive in the aggregate of
the other party than the Confidentiality Agreement provided that, a Person
who within the last twelve months that has entered into a confidentiality
agreement with the Company relating to a purchase of, or business combination
with, the Company shall not be required to enter into a new or revised
confidentiality agreement if such confidentiality agreement remains in effect
with a term of at least twelve (12) months and does not prohibit the Company
from complying with this Section 5.02, and such existing confidentiality
agreement shall be deemed to be an acceptable confidentiality agreement
hereunder ( _provided_ , that any information provided to such Person shall
have previously been made available to Parent or shall be made available to
Parent prior to or at the same time as it is provided to such Person, and
_provided further_ that such confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit or
purport to prohibit the Company in any way from complying with this Section
5.02 or this Agreement or include any provision calling for an exclusive right
to negotiate with the Company, the Company Board or their Representatives)
and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person and its
Representatives regarding any Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any breach of the restrictions set forth in the
preceding sentence by any Representative or affiliate of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be
a breach of this Section 5.02(a) by the Company.

(b)  Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall
(i) (A) withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, or
propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent
or Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, or resolve or agree to take any
such action, (B) adopt, endorse, approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
adopt, endorse, approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, or resolve or
agree to take any such action, (C) following the date any Acquisition
Proposal or any material modification thereto, or any Intervening Event, is
first made public or sent or given to the stockholders of the Company, fail
to issue a press release publicly reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation
within five (5) business days (or, if earlier, by the second (2nd) business
day prior to the Outside Date) after a written request by Parent to do
so, which request shall only be made once per Acquisition Proposal or once
per each material modification thereto, (D) fail to publicly recommend
against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 within ten business
days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer or (E) fail to include
the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement when disseminated to
the Company's stockholders (any action described in this clause (i) being
referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii)
approve, authorize, cause or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
enter into, any letter of intent, term sheet, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, option agreement, merger
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement
relating to any Acquisition Proposal, other than a confidentiality agreement
entered into in compliance with Section 5.02(a)(II)(x) (an " _Acquisition
Agreement_ "), or resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any such action.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and only at a time prior to the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may (x) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change under clause (A) of the definition thereof in
response to an Intervening Event, (y) make an Adverse Recommendation Change
under clause (A) of the definition thereof in response to a Superior Proposal
or (z) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) in response to a
Superior Proposal in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for
such Superior Proposal, but in each case only if: (1) the Company Board has
received a Superior Proposal that did not result, directly or indirectly,
from a breach of Section 5.02 (in the case of the preceding clause (y) or
clause (z)), or an Intervening Event has occurred (in the case of the
preceding clause (x)); (2) in light of such Superior Proposal (in the case of
the preceding clause (y) or clause (z)) or such Intervening Event (in the case
of the preceding clause (x)), as the case may be, the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change under
clause (A) of the definition thereof (in the case of the preceding clause (y))
or to terminate this Agreement (in the case of the preceding clause (z)) or
to make an Adverse Recommendation Change under clause (A) of the definition
thereof (in the case of the preceding clause (x)) would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under Delaware Law (any such determination, a " _Withdrawal
Determination_ "); (3) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it has
made a Withdrawal Determination (any such notice, a " _Triggering Notice_ ")
and provided Parent unredacted copies of the documents and/or agreements
providing for the Superior Proposal (including any other documents or
agreements referred to in or to be entered into in connection with the
Superior Proposal) or described the Intervening Event in writing in
reasonable detail, as the case may be; (4) during the five (5) business days
commencing on the date of receipt by Parent of the Triggering Notice (such
time period, the " _Notice Period_ "), if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent to permit Parent to
make a proposal to amend the terms of the Transactions or the Transaction
Agreements; (5) at the end of the Notice Period, and taking into account any
irrevocable written proposals (including any proposal to amend the terms of
the Transactions or the Transaction Agreements) made by Parent since receipt
of the Triggering Notice (a " _Parent Proposal_ "), such Superior Proposal
remains a Superior Proposal and the Company Board has again made a Withdrawal
Determination in response to such Superior Proposal or such Intervening Event
is continuing and the Company Board has again made a Withdrawal Determination
in response to such Intervening Event (it being understood and agreed that if,
in light of any Parent Proposal, the Company Board is no longer able to make
a Withdrawal Determination with respect to such Superior Proposal or
Intervening Event, then the Company shall immediately enter into amendments to
the Transaction Agreements with Parent and Sub that embodies the terms of
such Parent Proposal); (6) the Company is in compliance in all material
respects with Section 5.02 and Parent is not at such time entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c) or Section 8.01(d)(ii);
and (7) the Company (i) has paid prior to or concurrently pays the
Termination Fee to Parent pursuant to Section 8.02 and immediately after such
termination enters into a definitive agreement providing for such Superior
Proposal, in the case of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to the
preceding clause (z) or (ii) has set aside for immediate payment, the funds
for the fee due under Section 8.02 in the case of an Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to the preceding clause (x) or (y). The Company acknowledges
and agrees that each successive modification to the financial terms or other
material terms of an Acquisition Proposal that is determined to be a Superior
Proposal, and any material change to the Intervening Event, shall require a
new Triggering Notice and a new Notice Period (except that the five (5)
business day notice period referred to in the Notice Period shall instead be
equal to the longer of (I) three (3) business days and (II) the period
remaining under the Notice Period immediately prior to the delivery of
such additional notice under this sentence).

  



  

   

-45-

 



    



  

(c)  The Company shall promptly (but in no event more than 24
hours after receipt thereof) advise Parent in writing of any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or that is reasonably
likely to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person making
any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall thereafter (i) keep Parent informed in
all material respects of the inquiry or Acquisition Proposal including any
change to the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and
(ii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery
thereof with un-redacted copies of all offers, proposals, drafts and final
versions (and any material amendments thereto) of agreements and financing
documents, including schedules, exhibits and side letters thereto, and other
material correspondence sent or provided to the Company from any third party
in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or sent or provided by the Company
to any third party in connection with any Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(d)  Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit the
Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
Rule 14d 9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange
Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and the Company Board may not
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, except to the extent permitted by
Section 5.02(b). Subject to compliance with Section 5.02(b), a "stop, look
and listen" disclosure in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act
shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 5.02(d) or the penultimate sentence of Section
5.02(b), but subject to the termination right in Section 8.01(f), the
Company, the Company Board or any committee thereof may not take, agree or
resolve to take any action that would result in the Company's stockholders no
longer being legally capable under the DGCL of validly adopting this
Agreement.

  



  

(e)  For purposes of this Agreement:

  



  

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal, or indication of
interest or offer by an unaffiliated third party or the securityholders of
such party relating to, or reasonably expected to lead to, in a single

of, 15% or more of any class of the equity interests in the Company (by vote
or by value), (ii) any merger, consolidation, business combination,
reorganization, share exchange, dual listed company structure, sale of
assets, recapitalization, equity investment, joint venture, exclusive license,
liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries, (iii) the acquisition (whether by
merger, consolidation, equity investment, share exchange, joint venture or
otherwise) by any such third party or the securityholders of such third
parties, directly or indirectly, of assets that represent, or of any class of
equity interest in any entity that holds assets representing, directly or
indirectly, 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iv) any tender offer or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any such third party or
by the securityholders of any such third parties beneficially owning 15% or
more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or any other voting
securities of the Company (or instruments convertible to or exchangeable for
15% or more of such outstanding shares or securities) or (v) any combination
of the foregoing.

determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, would result in a
transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to the
holders of Company Common Stock than the Transactions, taking into account,
among other things, all the terms and conditions of such proposal, the
identity of the Person making the proposal and all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and the Transaction Agreements
(including any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of the Transactions or
the Transaction Agreements made in writing prior to the time of determination
pursuant to Section 5.02(b)), (ii) that is not subject to any "due diligence"
contingency or financing contingency and (iii) that is reasonably capable of
being completed on a timely basis.

  



  

" _Intervening Event_ " means a material fact, event, change, development or
circumstance related to the Company (A) that first occurs after the date of
this Agreement which (i) is unknown to, nor reasonably foreseeable by, the
Company Board as of or prior to the date of this Agreement and (ii) becomes
known to or by the Company Board prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval or (B) that occurred prior to the date of this Agreement
which (i) was known or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the
date of this Agreement, but the consequences of which were not known or
reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement
and (ii) which consequences became known to or by the Company Board prior to
the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal or Superior

trading volume of the shares of Company Common Stock, the matter set forth in
Section 5.02(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter, any increase in value of
any assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary engaging a new client or entering into a new Contract, any changes
in Laws, any COVID-19 related developments ( _e.g._ , a vaccine) or the fact
in and of itself that the Company exceeds internal or published projections,
in any such case, constitute or be taken into account in determining an
Intervening Event .

business day subsequent to such calendar day), prepare and file with the SEC
the Proxy Statement in preliminary form, and each of the Company and Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable
to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or responding to any questions or comments of the SEC
(including any oral response to comments), the Company (x) shall provide
Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response (including any proposed oral response to comments), (y)
shall consider in good faith inclusion in such document or response all
comments reasonably proposed by Parent and (z) shall not file or mail such

and filing of the Proxy Statement, including promptly furnishing to the
Company in writing upon request any and all information relating to Parent,
Sub and their respective Affiliates as may be required to be set forth in
the Proxy Statement under applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Company assumes no responsibility with respect to
information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Sub for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement; _provided_ that, the
Company shall be responsible if Parent notifies the Company in writing of a
correction to any such information and the Company fails to promptly
incorporate such correction into the Proxy Statement. In connection with the
foregoing, the Company shall (i) as reasonably promptly as practicable after
the later of (1) the 10-day waiting period under Rule 14a-6(a) under the

vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection
therewith), which meeting the Company shall cause to occur no later than the
40th calendar day (or, if such calendar day is not a business day, on the
first business day subsequent to such calendar day) immediately after the
date that the mailing of the Proxy Statement has been substantially completed.
Once the Company has established the Record Date, the Company shall not
change the Record Date or establish a different record date for the Company
Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Proxy Statement mailed to
the holders of Company Common Stock shall include the notice of appraisal
rights required to be delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the

(c)  The Company shall, as reasonably promptly as practicable
after the Clearance Date, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ that notwithstanding anything else to the contrary
herein, the Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting
(A) with the consent of Parent, (B) for the absence of a quorum, (C) if the
Company reasonably determines after consultation with outside legal
counsel that the failure to adjourn, postpone or delay the Company
Stockholder Meeting would be reasonably likely not to allow sufficient time
under applicable Laws for the distribution of any appropriate supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement or (D) to allow additional solicitation of
votes in order to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , that
the maximum amount of all such adjournments shall not exceed more than thirty
(30) days in the aggregate. Unless the Company Board or any committee thereof
has made an Adverse Recommendation Change in compliance with Section 5.02(b),
the Company shall, through the Company Board, make the Company Board
Recommendation to the stockholders of the Company, and shall include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in
favor of adopting this Agreement and shall take all other action reasonably
necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with Article VII, the Company agrees that its obligations
pursuant to this Section 6.01 shall not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or any
other person of any Acquisition Proposal or the making of any Adverse
Recommendation Change. The Company shall provide updates to Parent with
respect to the proxy solicitation for the Company Stockholders Meeting
(including interim results) as reasonably requested by Parent. Parent shall

(d)  If prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, any event
occurs with respect to the Company or Parent any of its subsidiaries, or any
change occurs with respect to other information supplied by the Company or
Parent for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, which is required to be
described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, the
Company shall promptly notify the other party of such event, and the Company
and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement and, as required by Law, in
disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to
the Company's stockholders.

afford to Parent and to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other representatives of Parent, reasonable access
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to
all its and its subsidiaries' properties, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel and records and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent (a) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it
during such period pursuant to the U.S. federal or state securities laws and
(b) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel
as such other party may reasonably request. By executing this Agreement, each
of Parent and Sub agree to be bound by, and to cause their Representatives to
be bound by, the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement as if
they were parties thereto. No investigation under this Section 6.02 shall have
any effect on any of the representations, warranties, conditions, covenants
or agreements of the parties hereto. All information exchanged pursuant to
this Agreement shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement dated August
16, 2020 between the Company and Baring Private Equity Asia Limited (the  "

Section 6.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_.

  



  

(a)  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions,
including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental
Entities, if any) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain
an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals
or waivers from third parties ( _provided_ , that neither the Company nor any
of the Company Subsidiaries will make or agree to make any payment of a
consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other consideration
(including increased or accelerated payments) or concede anything of monetary
or economic value, for the purposes of obtaining any such third party
consents without the prior consent of Parent), (iii) the defending of any
lawsuits or other Legal Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions, including seeking to
have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed and (iv) the execution and delivery
of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to
fully carry out the purposes of the Transaction Agreements. In furtherance and
not in limitation of the foregoing, if an HSR Filing is required by Law, each
of Parent and the Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof (but in any event not later than ten (10) business days after the date
hereof) file with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of
Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") and the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act (the " _HSR Filing_ "),
and at the same time as making such HSR Filing shall request that the DOJ and
the FTC grant "early termination" of the waiting period related to such HSR
Filing and this Agreement and the Transactions. Parent shall pay all filing
fees required to be paid in conjunction with such HSR Filing or any other
Antitrust Laws, and the Company shall not be required to pay any fees or
other payments to any Governmental Entity in connection with any filings
under, the HSR Act or such other filings as may be required under applicable
Antitrust Laws in connection with the Merger or the other
Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
Parent and the Company (A) shall use its reasonable best efforts to
promptly provide all information requested by any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other Transactions and (B) shall use its
reasonable best efforts to promptly take all actions and steps necessary to
obtain and secure the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act or other applicable compliance with any mandatory
pre-merger notification and approval requirements under any foreign (non-US)
investment control, antitrust or competition laws (" _Foreign Antitrust Laws_
") and obtain any clearance or approval required to be obtained from the FTC,
the DOJ, any state attorney general, any foreign competition authority or any
other Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other
Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph or
Agreement shall require Parent or Sub to withdraw and resubmit the CFIUS
Filing, whether in response to a request by CFIUS or any CFIUS member agency
or otherwise.

  



  

   

-50-

 



    



  

(b)  The parties shall cooperate to submit a draft joint
voluntary notice to CFIUS with respect to the Transactions (the "
_Draft CFIUS Filing_ ") as soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement. After receipt of confirmation that CFIUS has no further comments
or inquiries related to the Draft CFIUS Filing, the parties shall promptly
submit a formal joint voluntary notice to CFIUS with respect to the
Transactions (the " _CFIUS Filing_ "). The parties shall use their
reasonable best efforts to comply at the earliest practicable time required
by CFIUS or any CFIUS member agency with any request for
additional information, documents or other materials, and will use their
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in connection with both
the Draft CFIUS Filing and the CFIUS Filing and in connection with resolving
any investigation or other inquiry of CFIUS or any CFIUS member agency. The
parties shall each use their best efforts to promptly inform the other party
of any oral communication with, and provide copies of written communications
with, CFIUS or any CFIUS member agency regarding any such filings;
provided, that no party shall be required to share communications containing
its confidential business information if such confidential information is
unrelated to the Transactions. The parties shall undertake reasonable best
efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all action, and do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary or advisable to obtain CFIUS Approval as soon
as practicable, and in any event prior to the Outside Date, including, but
not limited to, using reasonable best efforts, if required, to execute a
reasonable letter of assurance or entering into another reasonable form of
mitigation agreement with CFIUS or CFIUS member agencies on
terms, conditions, or measures sought by CFIUS, _provided_ , _however_ , that
no party shall be required to take or agree to take any undertaking that is
not conditioned on the consummation of the Transactions. Parent shall pay all
filing fees required in connection with the CFIUS Filing and the Company
shall not be required to pay any fees or other payments to any Governmental
Entity in connection with any filings under CFIUS.

  



  

(c)  Without limiting the generality of anything contained in
Section 6.03(a), subject to applicable Law, each party hereto shall: (i) give
the other parties prompt written notice of the making or commencement of any
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding by or before any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions;
(ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or legal Proceeding; and (iii) promptly
inform the other parties of any communication to or from the FTC, the DOJ or
any other Governmental Entity regarding the Merger and the other
Transactions. Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other
parties and will consider in good faith the views of the other parties in
connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding. In addition,
except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in
connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding, each party hereto will permit authorized representatives of the
other parties to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding and to have access
to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made
or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding; provided that
documents that contain confidential or sensitive information with respect to
any Investor may be provided on an outside counsel-only basis. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6.03, Parent shall be responsible
for determining all aspects of strategy associated with obtaining any
approvals, consents or waivers necessary to consummate the Merger as required
under Antitrust Law.

(d)  Neither Parent nor Sub shall, nor shall they permit their
respective Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets,
business, Person or division thereof (through acquisition, license, joint
venture, collaboration or otherwise), if such acquisition would reasonably be
expected to materially increase the risk of not obtaining any applicable
clearance, consent, approval or waiver under the HSR Act or Foreign Antitrust
Laws with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions.

  



  

(e)  Nothing in this Section 6.03 shall require any Investor or
any Affiliate of Parent or Sub to dispose of any of its assets or to limit
its freedom of action with respect to any of their businesses or to commit or
agree to any of the foregoing to obtain any consents, approvals, permits or
authorizations or to remove any impediments to the Merger relating to the HSR
Act, Foreign Antitrust Laws or other antitrust, competition or premerger
notification, or trade regulation law, regulation or order ("
_Antitrust Laws_ ") or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding relating to Antitrust Laws.

  



  

Section 6.04. _Employee Matters; Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a)  For a period of not less than twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide the employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of
immediately prior to the Closing who remain in the employment of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries or who become employees of Parent
or one of its Subsidiaries (the  " _Continuing Employees_ ") with (i) (A)
base salary or base hourly wage rate (as applicable) and (B) any target cash
incentive compensation opportunity (including bonuses and commissions, but
excluding long-term incentive, equity or equity-based, change in control,
retention or similar compensation or benefits), in each case in an amount at
least equal to the level that was provided to each such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) employee benefits (other than any
defined benefits, long-term incentive, equity or equity-based, change in
control, retention or similar compensation or benefits) on
substantially similar terms in the aggregate to those provided to each such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.04 will limit or
restrict Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries) from modifying any employee's terms and conditions
of employment, including such employee's compensation or benefits, in respect
to any adverse effect experienced by Parent or its applicable Affiliate as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as determined by Parent or its applicable
Affiliate in good faith.

  



  

(b)  Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring,
and the Company shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific plans or to
guarantee or continue the employment of any specific person for any period of
time, or to preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any
Continuing Employee or any other person for any reason. Furthermore, no
provision of this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to maintain or
continue any Company Benefit Plan (subject to the limitations and requirements
specifically set forth in this Section 6.04) or prohibiting or limiting the
ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend, modify or terminate
any plans, programs, policies, arrangements, agreements or understandings
sponsored by the Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation and
nothing therein shall be construed as an amendment to any such plan, program,
policy, arrangement, agreement or understanding for any purpose. Nothing in
this Section 6.04 shall confer any third party beneficiary rights or other
rights or remedies of any kind or description upon any Continuing Employee or
any other person other than Parent, the Company and their respective
successors and assigns, or shall be treated as an amendment of, or
undertaking to amend, any Company Benefit Plan.

Section 6.05. _Company Stock Awards_.

  



  

(a)  At the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Closing Company Stock
Award shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, be cancelled and
extinguished and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such
Closing Company Stock Award shall have the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Closing Company Stock Award (it being agreed that for
each Closing Company Stock Award subject to performance-based vesting
conditions, the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such award will be deemed to be the target number of shares set forth in the
applicable award agreement) immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y)
the Merger Consideration, less any per share exercise or purchase price of
such Closing Company Stock Award immediately prior to such cancellation, net
of applicable withholding taxes and without interest (such amounts payable
hereunder being referred to as the " _Closing Stock Award Payments_ "). From
and after the Effective Time, any such Closing Company Stock Award shall no
longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof or settleable in Company
Common Stock, but shall entitle such holder only to the payment of the
Closing Stock Award Payment; provided that any Closing Company Stock Award
that is a Company Stock Option that has an exercise price equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled without any consideration
therefor. The Closing Stock Award Payments shall be paid no later than the
Company's next regular payday following the Effective Time, net of applicable
withholding taxes and without interest.

  



  

(b)  At the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Assumed Company Stock
Award shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, be cancelled and
replaced with a conditional right (each, a " _Cash Replacement Award_ ") to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Company Stock Award
(it being agreed that for each Assumed Company Stock Award subject
to performance-based vesting conditions, the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such award will be deemed to be the target
number of shares set forth in the applicable award agreement and such awards
will no longer be subject to any performance-based vesting conditions)
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Merger Consideration, less
any per share exercise or purchase price of such Assumed Company Stock Award
immediately prior to such cancellation, net of applicable withholding taxes
and without interest (such amounts, the " _Cash Replacement Award Payments_
"). Each Cash Replacement Award will be subject to the same terms and
conditions (including time-based vesting terms) that apply to the Assumed
Company Stock Award that it has replaced (other than terms that are no longer
applicable by virtue of the Merger, as determined by Parent in its
reasonable judgment); _provided_ , _however_ , that any outstanding Cash
Replacement Award will accelerate and vest in full (and the corresponding
Cash Replacement Award Payment will become payable) upon the earliest of (i)
the original applicable time-based vesting date, (ii) the date that is twelve
(12) months following the Closing Date (the " _Retention Date_ "), subject
to the holder's continued employment with the Company or the applicable
Company Subsidiary through the Retention Date and (iii) the date that the
holder's employment is terminated by the Company or the applicable Company
Subsidiary without Cause or by the holder for Good Reason, if applicable, in
either case prior to the Retention Date (in either case, a "
_Qualifying Termination_ "), and provided that the holder provides a timely
and effective release of claims in the form provided by the Company within
sixty (60) days following the date of such Qualifying Termination. The Cash
Replacement Award Payments shall be paid no later than the Company's next
regular payday following (A) the applicable vesting date, if payable pursuant
to achievement of a time-based vesting condition prior to the Retention Date
pursuant to the foregoing clause (i), (B) the Retention Date, if payable
pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii) or (C) the date that is sixty (60) days
after the date of the applicable holder's Qualifying Termination, if payable
pursuant to the foregoing clause (iii), in each case net of applicable
withholding taxes and without interest. In the event that a holder's
employment with the Company or its applicable Company Subsidiary terminates
for any reason prior to the original time-based vesting date or the Retention
Date, as applicable, and such termination does not constitute a Qualifying
Termination, any then-outstanding portion of such holder's Cash Replacement
Award will be automatically forfeited for no consideration.

(c)  As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement
and in all events prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the
treatment of the Company Stock Awards set forth in Section 6.05(a) and 6.05(b)
above and to ensure that the conversion of Company Stock Awards pursuant to
Section 6.05(a) and 6.05(b) and of Company Capital Stock pursuant to
Section 2.01, in each case held by any director or officer of the Company,
will be eligible for exemption under Rule 16b-3(e). For the avoidance of
doubt, the treatment of the Company Stock Awards set forth in Sections 6.05(a)
and 6.05(b) is permitted under the Company Plans, the award agreements issued
thereunder, and any other agreements by and between a holder of a Company
Stock Award and the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and does not require
the consent of any such holder.

  



  

(d)  In this Agreement:

  



  

" _Applicable Percentage_ " means the lesser of (i) seventy percent (70%) and
(ii) the percentage of the aggregate number of Company Stock Awards that
are unvested (after taking into the effect of the Merger) and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that results in an aggregate value of
at least $13,000,000 for the Cash Replacement Award Payments (assuming all
applicable vesting conditions are met) in respect of the Cash Replacement
Awards issued pursuant to Section 6.05(b) (rounded up to the nearest whole
share for each holder).

  



  

" _Assumed Company Stock Award_ " means each Company Stock Award that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is not a

ascribed to such term in any employment agreement by and between such holder
and the Company or any Company Subsidiary, as in effect as of the date hereof
or (ii) if no such agreement exists or has such a term, means the occurrence
of any of the following, as determined by Parent: (A) such holder's material
failure to perform, or substantial negligence in the performance of, such
holder's duties and responsibilities to Parent and its Affiliates, (B) such
holder's breach of any confidentiality, non-competition or other restrictive
covenants set forth in any written agreement by and between such holder and
Parent or any of its Affiliates, (C) such holder's material breach of any
other provision of any such written agreement or of any material policy of
Parent or any of its Affiliates, (D) such holder's fraud, theft or
embezzlement with respect to Parent or any of its Affiliates or (E) other
misconduct by such holder that causes, or would reasonably be expected to
cause, material harm to Parent or any of its Affiliates.

  



  

" _Closing Company Stock Award_ " means (i) each Company Stock Award, whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding and held by a non-employee member of
the Company Board immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) each Company
Stock Award that is vested (after taking into account the effect of the
Merger) and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) the
Applicable Percentage of each Company Stock Award that is unvested (after
taking into account the effect of the Merger) and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, with the Applicable Percentage for any holder to
be applied by the Company pro-rata across all of such holder's unvested and
outstanding Company Stock Awards, by grant date and award type.

  



  

" _Company Stock Award_ " has the meaning set forth in Section 3.03.

  



  

" _Company Stock Plans_ " means the Company's 2007 Stock Option and Incentive
Plan and 2015 Stock Option and Incentive Plan.

  



  

" _Good Reason_ " as to any holder of a Company Stock Award has the meaning

between such holder and the Company or any Company Subsidiary, as in effect
as of the date hereof and shall otherwise not apply to any holder of a
Company Stock Award.

  



  

Section 6.06. _Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board shall (i)
take all action necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law is or becomes
applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement or any other Transaction
Agreement and (ii) if any Takeover Law becomes applicable to any Transaction
or this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement, take all action

Section 6.07. _Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company to: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior
to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of the Company or of a
Subsidiary of the Company (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") for any and all
costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel,
which shall be advanced as they are incurred, on a current basis but no later
than thirty (30) days after a written request by the Indemnified Party to
Parent or the Company for such advancement; _provided_ that the Indemnified
Party shall have made an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is
ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party was not entitled
to indemnification under this Section 6.07, such undertaking to be unsecured
and made without reference to the Indemnified Party's ability to repay such
advancements or ultimate entitlement to indemnification hereunder, judgments,
fines, penalties or liabilities (including amounts paid in settlement or
compromise) imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with or arising out of any demand, action, suit or other Legal
Proceeding (whether civil or criminal) in which such Indemnified Party may be
involved or with which he or she may be threatened (regardless of whether as a
named party or as a participant other than as a named party, including as a
witness) (an " _Indemnified Party Proceeding_ ") (A) by reason of such
Indemnified Party's being or having been such director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise in connection with any action
taken or not taken at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
(B) arising out of such Indemnified Party's service in connection with any
other corporation or organization for which he or she serves or has served as
a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary at the request of
the Company (including in any capacity with respect to any employee benefit
plan), in each of (A) or (B), whether or not the Indemnified Party continues
in such position at the time such Indemnified Party Proceeding is brought or
threatened and at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any
Indemnified Party Proceeding relating in whole or in part to the transactions
contemplated hereby or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any
other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party), to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; and (ii) fulfill and honor in
all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to: (x) each
indemnification agreement in effect as of the date hereof between the Company
and any Indemnified Party; and (y) any indemnification provision (including
advancement of expenses) and any exculpation provision set forth in the
Company's certificate of incorporation or bylaws as in effect on the date
hereof. With respect to any determination of whether any Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification by Parent or the Company under this Section 6.07,
such Indemnified Party shall have the right, as contemplated by the DGCL, to
require that such determination be promptly made by special, independent
legal counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, the fees and expenses of
such legal counsel to be borne by Parent or the Company. Parent shall pay all
expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel, that may
be incurred by Indemnified Parties in connection with their enforcement of
their rights provided under this Section 6.07, including the advancement of
such fees and expenses, which shall be advanced as they are incurred, on a
current basis but no later than thirty (30) days after a written request by
the Indemnified Party to Parent for such advancement upon receipt by Parent
of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party to repay such
amount if it shall be determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled
to be indemnified under this Section 6.07 (such undertaking to be unsecured
and made without reference to the Indemnified Party's ability to repay such
advancements or ultimate entitlement to indemnification hereunder).
Parent's and the Company's obligations under the foregoing clauses (i) and
(ii) shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years
from the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses in respect of any
claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such claim. If an Indemnified Party commences a suit alleging
that Parent or the Company failed to comply with its obligations under this
Section 6.07, Parent shall pay such Indemnified Party's costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses which, with respect to an
Indemnified Party, shall be advanced as they are incurred, on a current basis
but no later than thirty (30) days after a written request by the Indemnified
Party to Parent for such advancement upon receipt by Parent of an undertaking
by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party to repay such amount if it shall be
determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified
under this Section 6.07) in connection with such suit, together with interest
thereon at the "prime rate" as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern
Edition, in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through
the date of payment (calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and
the actual number of days elapsed, without compounding).

(b)  For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Company to, maintain officers' and directors' liability
insurance with respect to claims arising from acts, errors or omissions that
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, including in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby, covering each such Person currently covered
by the Company's officers' and directors' liability insurance policies on
terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of
such policies in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that in
satisfying its obligation under this _Section 6.07(b)_ , neither Parent nor
the Company shall be obligated to pay an aggregate amount for such insurance
policies in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its
last full fiscal year prior to the date hereof (the " _Current Premium_
") and if such aggregate amount for such insurance policies would at any time
exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then the Company shall cause to be
maintained policies of insurance that, in the Company's good faith judgment,
provide the maximum coverage available at an aggregate amount for such
insurance policies equal to 300% of the Current Premium. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been obtained by the Company (and
Parent hereby consents to the Company obtaining such policies) prior to the
Effective Time, which policies provide such Persons currently covered by such
policies with coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years with
respect to claims arising from acts, errors or omissions that occurred at or

transactions contemplated; _provided_ , _however_ , that the amount paid for

effect for their full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, or if Parent dissolves the Company, then,

termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Parties shall be Third Party beneficiaries of this Section 6.07). Nothing in

Indemnified Party and an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
to repay such amount if it shall be determined that such Indemnified Party is
not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 6.07 (such undertaking to be
unsecured and made without reference to the Indemnified Party's ability to
repay such advancements or ultimate entitlement to
indemnification hereunder), all costs, fees and expenses, including

the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before issuing,
and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press

conditioned). Without otherwise limiting the Indemnified Parties' rights with

Section 6.11. _Financing._

  



  

(a)  Each of Parent and Sub shall use, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and each of its and their respective Representatives to
use, their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the Debt Financing upon the terms
and subject only to the conditions (including, to the extent required, the
full exercise of any "flex" provisions) expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters, including using reasonable best efforts (i) to maintain
in full force and effect the Debt Commitment Letters in accordance with the
terms thereof until the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
(ii) to promptly negotiate, enter into and deliver definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing (collectively, the " _Debt Financing Agreements_
") upon the terms and subject only to the conditions expressly set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letters (including any applicable  "flex" provisions) and
further subject to any amendments, modifications or supplements thereto, or
replacements or waivers thereof, in each case, not prohibited by this

prior to Closing) all conditions to the funding of the full amount of the
Debt Financing that are within Parent's or Sub's control, and (iv) to enforce

Financing Agreements.

  



  

(b)  Neither Parent nor Sub shall permit any amendment,
supplement or other modification to, or grant any waiver of any terms under,
the Debt Commitment Letters, in each case without the prior written consent of
the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), if
such amendment, supplement, or other modification or waiver would or would
reasonably be expected to (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount) to an amount that, when taken together with the proceeds of
the Equity Financing (including any increases to the Equity Financing), would
be less than the Required Amount, (B) impose new or additional conditions to
the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date (or
otherwise expand or modify any existing condition to the funding of the Debt
Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters) in a manner that could
prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Debt Financing on the
Closing Date, or (C) (i) prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Debt
Financing on the Closing Date, or (ii) adversely impact the ability of Parent
to enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters or the Debt Financing
Agreements; provided that Parent and Sub may amend, supplement, replace,
substitute or modify the Debt Commitment Letters to the extent not
prohibited by this Section 6.11(b) (including to add additional agents, co-
agents, lenders, lead arrangers, joint bookrunners, syndication agents,
managers or similar entities that have not executed such Debt Commitment
Letters as of the date hereof, together with any conforming or ministerial
changes related thereto). Parent shall deliver to the Company copies of any
amendment, supplement or other modification, or waiver of any terms under, to
the Debt Commitment Letters, promptly (and in any event within two
business days) following receipt.

(c)  Upon reasonable request of the Company, Parent shall keep
the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of
the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing; provided, however,
that nothing in this sentence shall require Parent to disclose any
information that is legally privileged or the disclosure of which would result
in the breach of any of Parent or Sub's, as applicable, confidentiality
obligations set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters (as in effect on the date
hereof). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Sub
shall give the Company prompt written notice (and in any event within three
business days following becoming aware thereof) (w) of any actual or alleged
breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach
or default) by Parent or Sub, or to the knowledge of Parent or Sub, any other
person party to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or the Debt
Financing Agreements, (x) of the receipt of any written notice or other
written communication from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any
actual or alleged breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to
any of the Debt Commitment Letters or any Debt Financing Agreement or any
provisions of the Debt Commitment Letters or any Debt Financing Agreements
(including any actual withdrawal, termination or any material change in the
terms of (including the amount of) the Debt Financing), (y) of any
material dispute or disagreement between or among the parties to any of the
Debt Commitment Letters or the Debt Financing Agreements with respect to the
obligation to fund the Debt Financing or the amount of the Financing to be
funded at Closing, or (z) if any time for any reason either Parent or Sub
believes in good faith that it will not be able to (or is not reasonably
likely to be able to) obtain, all or any portion of the Debt Financing upon
the terms and subject only to the conditions expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of
the Debt Commitment Letters or the Debt Financing Agreements. As soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any event within two (2) business day of the
date the Company delivers to Parent or Sub a written request therefor, Parent
and Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company
relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (w), (x), (y) or (z) of
the immediately preceding sentence or the status of the Debt Financing.

  



  

(d)  If any portion of the Debt Financing otherwise becomes
unavailable, and such portion is required to fund the Required Amount on the
Closing Date, Parent and Sub shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, use
their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
arrange, obtain and consummate, at its sole expense, in replacement thereof
alternative financing from the same or alternative sources in an amount that,
when taken together with the proceeds of the Equity Financing (including any
increases to the Equity Financing), is sufficient to fund the Required Amount
on terms and conditions not less favorable, taken as a whole, to the Company
or Parent (in the reasonable judgment of Parent) than the terms set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letters (including the flex provisions thereof) as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event
(the " _Alternative Financing_ "). Any reference in this Agreement to (1) the
"Debt Financing" shall include any such Alternative Financing, (2) the "Debt
Commitment Letters" shall include the commitment letters and the
corresponding fee letter with respect to any such Alternative Financing, (3)
the "Debt Financing Agreements" shall include the definitive agreements with
respect to any such Alternative Financing and (4) the  "Debt Financing
Sources" shall include the financing institutions contemplated to provide any
such Alternative Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 6.11 (d) shall
require, and in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Sub
be deemed or construed to require, either Parent or Sub to pay any fees or
any interest rates applicable to the Debt Financing in excess of those
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (including the flex provisions),
but other than de minimis amounts, or agree to terms (including the flex
provisions) that are less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent, Sub or the
Surviving Corporation than the terms contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters (determined after giving effect to all amendments and
other modifications permitted pursuant to the "market flex" provisions of the
Debt Commitment Letters as if such amendments and other modifications had been
implemented to the maximum extent permitted thereunder) (in either case,
whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise).
Parent shall deliver to the Company true, correct and complete copies of all
agreements related to such Alternative Financing (including
commitment letters, engagement letters, side letters and fee letters (subject
to customary redaction of fee amounts and other commercially sensitive
economic terms, so long as such redactions do not extend to any terms that
could affect the conditionality, availability, amount, timing or termination
of the Financing)) promptly (and in any event within two business days)
following execution thereof. Parent and Sub acknowledge and agree that the
obtaining of the Financing, or any Alternative Financing, is not a condition
to Closing.

in connection with the Debt Financing, including direct contact between

Subsidiaries and Parent's Debt Financing Sources and other potential lenders
in the Debt Financing (all such meetings, presentations or sessions may be

independent auditors to cooperate with Parent's reasonable best efforts to
obtain customary accountant's comfort letters (including "negative
assurance") and consents from the Company's independent auditors; (v)

any ratings agencies contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters; (vi) assist
in the preparation, registration or execution of, definitive financing

extent required by, or necessary to satisfy conditions precedent under,
the Debt Commitment Letters), instruments, filings, security agreements and
other documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent and other matters
ancillary to, or required in connection with the Debt Financing to the extent
required on the Closing Date by the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters (but
in no event shall Company be required to execute documents or arrangements
that would be effective prior to Closing); (vii) assist with requesting from
the Company's existing lenders the Payoff Letter (including the lien releases
referenced therein); and (viii) furnish to Parent at least four (4) business

anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the Company and the Company

this Section 6.11 (e) to the extent it would unreasonably interfere with the
business or ongoing operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) the

the party entitled to the benefit of such condition) (other than delivery of

conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
Closing, which deliveries and conditions are capable at the time of

sentence only), Section 6.08, Section 6.11(f) and Article IX and the
applicable definitions elsewhere in this Agreement, which provisions

(b)  The Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $54,330,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ ") if: (i) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(d); (ii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to

Acquisition Proposal and thereafter (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 8.01(b)(i), Section 8.01(b)(iii) or Section 8.01(c) and (B) within
12 months of such termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters
into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any
Acquisition Proposal is consummated (solely for purposes of this
Section 8.02(b)(iii)(B), the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the
meaning set forth in the definition of Acquisition Proposal contained in
Section 5.02(e) except that all references to 15% shall be deemed references
to 50%). Any fee due under this Section 8.02(b) shall be paid by wire
transfer of same-day funds on the date of termination of this Agreement
(except that in the case of termination pursuant to clause (iii) above such
payment shall be made on the date of execution of such definitive
agreement or, if earlier, consummation of such transactions or the making of
such recommendation). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Section 8.02(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement, in the event this
Agreement is terminated by the Company for any reason at a time when Parent
would have had the right to terminate this Agreement, Parent shall be entitled
to receipt of any Termination Fee that would have been (or would have
subsequently become) payable had Parent terminated this Agreement at such
time. In no event shall the Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee
on more than one occasion.

  



  

(c)  If this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the
Company as provided in Section 8.01(b)(iii) or by Parent as provided in
Section 8.01(c), then the Company shall pay to Parent, forthwith upon demand
by Parent, the Expenses incurred by Parent, up to $3,500,000 in the
aggregate. " _Expenses_ " means all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and
expenses payable to all banks, investment banking firms, other financial
institutions, and other persons and their respective agents and counsel, for
arranging or structuring the Transactions, including all costs and expenses
related to the Financing, and all fees of counsel, accountants, experts and
consultants to Parent, and all printing and advertising expenses) incurred or
accrued by banks, investment banking firms, other financial institutions and
other persons, and assumed by Parent in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement, the structuring of
the Transactions, including the Financing, and any agreements
relating thereto. If at the same time or after the Company has paid Expenses
pursuant to this Section 8.02(c) the Company is obligated to pay the
Termination Fee, the payment of Expenses shall reduce on a dollar for dollar
basis the payment by the Company of the Termination Fee. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 8.02(c) or elsewhere in
this Agreement, in the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company for
any reason at a time when Parent would have had the right to terminate this
Agreement, Parent shall be entitled to receipt of any Expense reimbursement
that would have been (or would have subsequently become) payable had Parent
terminated this Agreement at such time.

  



  

(d)  In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 8.01(e) (with respect to a breach or failure to perform
by Parent that is the primary reason for the failure of the Closing to be
consummated) or Section 8.01(g), Parent shall pay the Company a termination
fee of $108,660,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "). Any Parent Termination
Fee due shall be paid to the Company by wire transfer of same-day funds
within two (2) business days after the date of termination of this Agreement.
In no event shall Parent be obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee on
more than one occasion.

(e)  Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements
contained in Section 8.02(b), Section 8.02(c) and Section 8.02(d) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement and
the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances
where a Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee and other amounts payable
under Section 8.02(b), Section 8.02(c) and Section 8.02(d) are payable are
uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and, therefore, the amounts
payable pursuant to Section 8.02(b), Section 8.02(c) and Section 8.02(d) are
not a penalty but rather constitute amounts akin to liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities forgone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions. Accordingly, if a party
fails to promptly pay the amount due by it pursuant to Section 8.02(b),
Section 8.02(c) or Section 8.02(d) and, in order to obtain such payment
another party or the other parties commences a proceeding that results in a
judgment against the defaulting party for the fee set forth in Section
8.02(b), Section 8.02(c) and Section 8.02(d), or any portion of such fee, the
defaulting party shall pay to the other parties their costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees) in connection with such proceeding, together with
interest on the Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee at the "prime rate"
as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment
(calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of
days elapsed, without compounding) (collectively, " _Collection Costs_ ").

  



  

(f)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, but subject to Section 9.10, each of the parties hereto expressly
acknowledges and agrees that the Company's right to terminate this Agreement
and receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee to the extent it is payable
pursuant to Section 8.02(d) and to obtain monetary damages under Section
8.02(a), together with any Collection Costs and any Financing Expenses, in
each case pursuant to the Guarantees shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates and any of their respective former, current or future
general or limited partners, stockholders, equityholders, members, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates (collectively, the "
_Company Related Parties_ ") against Parent, the Investors' and Parent's and
the Investors' respective Affiliates, the Debt Financing Sources, any other
potential debt or equity financing source and any of their respective former,
current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, equityholders,
members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates or
any former, current or future general or limited partner,
stockholder, equityholder, member, manager, director, officer, employee,
agent or Affiliate of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "
_Parent Related Parties_ ") for all losses and damages in respect of this
Agreement (or the termination thereof) or the Transactions (or the failure of
such Transactions to occur for any reason or for no reason) or any breach or
threatened or alleged breach of (whether willful, intentional, unilateral or
otherwise), or failure or threatened or alleged failure to perform under, any
covenant or agreement or otherwise in respect of this Agreement or any oral
representation made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, and,
subject to Parent's obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee to the
Company to the extent it is payable pursuant to Section 8.02(d), to pay
monetary damages under Section 8.02(a) together with any Collection Costs and
any Financing Expenses, and, in each case pursuant to the Guarantees and
Section 9.10, none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any liability or
obligation to any of the Company Related Parties relating to or arising out
of this Agreement, the Guarantees, the Commitment Letters or the Transactions
and none of the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any other Company Related Party
shall seek to recover any other damages or seek any other remedy, whether
based on a claim at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, with
respect to any losses or damages suffered in connection with this Agreement
or the Transactions or any oral representation made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith. In no event shall Parent or the Parent Related Parties be
subject to (nor shall any Company Related Party seek to recover) monetary
damages other than the Parent Termination Fee to the extent it is payable
pursuant to Section 8.02(d), or monetary damages under Section 8.02(a),
together with any Collections Costs and any Financing Expenses, in each case
pursuant to the Guarantees for any losses or other liabilities arising out of
or in connection with breaches by Parent of its representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or arising from any claim
or cause of action that any Company Related Party may have, including for a
breach of Section 1.02 as a result of the Debt Financing not being available
to be drawn down or otherwise arising from the Commitment Letters or in
respect of any oral representation made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith or therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
in no event shall the Company be entitled to receive both the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.02(d) and monetary damages under Section
8.02(a).

(g)  While each of the Company and Parent may pursue both a
grant of specific performance or other equitable relief under Section 9.10
and, following termination of this Agreement, the payment of monetary damage
or the Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee under Section 8.02(b) or
Section 8.02(d), respectively, as applicable, under no circumstances shall the
Company or Parent be entitled to receive both (i) a grant of specific
performance or other equitable relief that results in the Equity Financing
being funded or the Closing occurring and (ii) monetary damages or the
payment of the Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable,
in connection with this Agreement or any termination of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.03. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at
any time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by law requires further
approval by the stockholders of the Company without the further approval of
such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, Sections 9.07, 9.08 and 9.10 and
this Section 8.03 may not be modified or amended in a manner that is adverse
in any material respect to a Debt Financing Source without the prior written
consent of such Debt Financing Source.

of Section 8.03, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to
deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by raising the defense of
inconvenient forum, (d) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
any Transaction Agreement or any Transaction in any other court and (e)
WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION RELATED TO OR

(b)  Notwithstanding Section 9.10(a) or anything else to the
contrary in this Agreement, it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall be
entitled to enforce specifically the obligations of Parent and Sub to cause
the Equity Financing to be funded and/or to consummate the Closing only in
the event that (i) all conditions set forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02
have been satisfied or waived (by the party entitled to the benefit thereof)
(other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other than
satisfaction of those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing) at the time Section 1.02 contemplated the Closing to occur, (ii)
the Debt Financing has been funded or the Debt Financing Sources have
confirmed in writing that the Debt Financing will be funded at the Closing if
the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (iii) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is granted and the Equity
Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then it would take such actions
required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur.

  



  

(c)  If a court has declined to specifically enforce the
obligations of Parent and Sub (in a final, binding determination where all
available appeals have been exhausted) to take all actions under this
Agreement up to and including the consummation of the Closing pursuant to a
claim for specific performance brought against Parent and Sub pursuant to this
Section 9.10, then the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company Related
Parties will be payment of the Parent Termination Fee in accordance with the
terms and conditions of Section 8.02(d) together with any Collection Costs
and any Financing Expenses. In addition, the Company agrees to, and to cause
the Company Related Parties to, cause any action or claim pending in
connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including any action or claim related to the Equity Commitment Letters, the
Debt Commitment Letters and the Guarantees) by the Company or any Company
Related Party against Parent, Sub or any of their respective Affiliates to be
dismissed with prejudice promptly, and in any event on or prior to the time
Parent and Sub consummate the Merger pursuant to this Section 9.10. For the
avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled
to receive both a grant of specific performance to draw down the proceeds of
the Equity Commitment Letters and consummate the Closing, on the one hand,
and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee, on the other hand.
