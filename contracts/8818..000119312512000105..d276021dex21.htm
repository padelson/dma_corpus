shall use the currency exchange rates as further described on _Schedule
1.5(d)_.

 

1.6 _Final Cash, Indebtedness and Net Intercompany Payables of the Purchased
Entities and Net Working Capital Calculations_. 

(a) _Determination_. As promptly as possible, but in any event within ninety
(90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will deliver to Parent a calculation
of the Cash on Hand, Indebtedness Payoff Amount, Net Intercompany Payables
Amount and the Net Working Capital Amount, which except as set forth on
_Schedule 1.6_ shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently
with the Business Accounting Practices and Procedures ( _provided_ that in the
event of a conflict between GAAP and the Business Accounting Practices and
Procedures, the Business Accounting Practices and Procedures shall control),
together with reasonably detailed supporting information (the " _Closing
Statement_ "). After delivery of the Closing Statement, Parent and its
accountants and Representatives shall be permitted reasonable access
to review the books and records and work papers of Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the work papers of Buyers and any of its Affiliates accountants)
related to the preparation of the Closing Statement. Parent and its
accountants and Representatives may make inquiries of Buyer and any of its
Affiliates and their respective accountants and employees regarding questions
concerning or disagreements with the Closing Statement arising in the course

Affiliates to use their, reasonable best efforts to cause any such accountants
and employees to cooperate with and respond to such inquiries. If Parent has
any objections to the Closing Statement, Parent shall deliver to Buyer a
statement setting forth its objections thereto (an " _Objections Statement_
"). If an Objections Statement is not delivered to Buyer within thirty (30)
days after delivery of the Closing Statement, the Closing Statement shall be
final, binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto. Parent and Buyer
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any objections set forth in the
Objections Statement (and all such discussions related thereto shall,
unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Parent, be governed by Rule 408 of the
Federal Rules of Evidence (and any applicable similar state rule)), but if
they do not reach a final resolution within thirty (30) days after the
delivery of the Objections Statement, Parent and Buyer shall submit such
dispute to KPMG LLP (subject to appropriate conflicts

 



9  checks by such firm) or such other independent accounting firm as Parent and
Buyer Parent may jointly select (the " _Independent Auditor_ "). If any
dispute is submitted to the Independent Auditor, each party will furnish to
the Independent Auditor such work papers and other documents and information
relating to the disputed issues as the Independent Auditor may request and are
available to that party or its independent accountants (including information
of the Purchased Entities and their Affiliates), and each party shall be
afforded the opportunity to present the Independent Auditor material relating
to the determination and to discuss the determination with the Independent
Auditor. The Independent Auditor shall act as an auditor and not as an
arbitrator and shall resolve matters in dispute and adjust and establish any
disputed adjustment of the Purchase Price amount to reflect such resolution.
It is the intent of Buyer and Sellers that the process set forth in this
_Section 1.6_ and the activities of the Independent Auditor in connection
herewith are not intended to be and, in fact, are not arbitration and that no
formal arbitration rules shall be followed (including rules with respect to
procedures and discovery). Parent and Buyer shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Auditor to resolve all such
disagreements as soon as practicable. The resolution of the dispute by the
Independent Auditor shall be final, binding and non-appealable on the parties
hereto. The Closing Statement shall be modified if necessary to reflect such
determination. The fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall
be allocated to be paid by Buyer, on the one hand, and/or Parent, on the
other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested
amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by
such party, as determined by the Independent Auditor.

(c) _Final Adjustment Amount_. Without duplication, all amounts owed pursuant
to _Sections 1.6(b)(i)_ , _(ii)_ ,  _(iii)_ and _(iv)_ shall be aggregated,
and the net amount (if any) owed by Buyer Parent to Parent, on the one hand,
or Parent to Buyer Parent, on the other hand, is referred to as the " _Final
Adjustment Amount_ "; it being understood and agreed that if the net effect
pursuant to this _Section 1.6(c)_ is an increase in the Purchase Price, then
Buyer Parent shall make or cause to be made a cash payment to Parent, on
behalf of the Sellers, in an amount equal to the Final Adjustment Amount, and

work in good faith to resolve any disputes relating to the Final Allocation.
If Parent and Buyer Parent are unable to resolve any such dispute regarding

any capitalized interest and the parties agree that, for the purposes of EW32
of the Income Tax Act 2007 (New Zealand), this purchase price is the lowest
price that the applicable parties would have agreed on at the time this
Agreement was entered into, if payment had been required in full at the time
the first right in the shares of New Zealand Entity was or is to be

Agreements to which Buyer Parent and each Buyer are a party have been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by

 



30  Buyer Parent and such Buyer, and (assuming this Agreement is a valid and
binding obligation of each of the other parties thereto) constitute the legal,
valid, and binding obligations of Buyer Parent and such Buyer, enforceable

interfere with any of the Transactions pursuant to (i) any provision of Buyer
Parents or Buyers Organizational Documents, (ii) any law, statute or

other amounts to be paid by it hereunder and under any of the Ancillary
Agreements.

4.6 _Investment Representation_. Buyer is purchasing the Purchased Stock for
its own account with the present intention of holding such securities for
investment purposes and not with a view to or for sale in

defined in Regulation D promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "). Buyer

ownership of the Purchased Stock. Buyer acknowledges that the Purchased Stock
has not been registered under the Securities Act or any state or foreign

and any applicable state or foreign securities Laws.

the business, management, operations and finances of the Business with each of
the Sellers, the Purchased Entities and the Subsidiaries of the Purchased
Entities and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
Representatives and Affiliates, and has had an opportunity to inspect the
facilities of the Business. Buyer has conducted its own independent
investigation of the Business and has been furnished by the Sellers, the
Purchased Entities or the Subsidiaries of the Purchased Entities, or their
Representatives, with all information, documents and other materials relating
to the Business that Buyer believes is necessary to enter into this Agreement.

Governmental Entity in connection with such request or Legal Proceeding.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give Buyer, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the operations of the Business prior to the
Closing. Prior to the Closing, Sellers and the Purchased Entities shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over the operations of the Business.

 



36 5.4 _Third Party Consents_.

 

(a) The parties hereto shall give, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give, any notices to third parties, and use, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts to obtain
any third party Consents (including with respect to any Contracts) (i)
necessary to consummate the Transactions or (ii) required to be disclosed on 
_Schedule 3.2(b)_ or pursuant to _Section 4.2(b)_; _provided_ , that no
Seller shall be required to make any payments, commence litigation or suffer
any material burden in connection with obtaining any such third party
Consents;  _provided_ , _further_ , that no Seller shall be required to
obtain any third party Consent for any Contract to the extent that the
services or products provided by such Contract are being provided by Sellers
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Contract, lease or Permit
related to the Business or any claim or right or any benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom if an attempted assignment thereof, without
the consent of a third-party thereto, would constitute a default thereof or
in any way adversely affect the rights of any Seller or Buyer thereunder.
Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.4(b)_ , if such consent is not obtained, or
if an attempted assignment thereof would be ineffective or would affect the
rights thereunder so that Buyer would not receive all such rights, each
applicable Seller will use its reasonable best efforts to enter into a
mutually acceptable arrangement with Buyer, solely to the extent such an
arrangement can replicate the rights under such Contract, lease or Permit, to
provide to Buyer the benefits under any such Contract, lease, Permit or any
claim or right, including enforcement for the benefit of Buyer of any and all
rights of such Seller or its Subsidiaries against a third-party thereto
arising out of the default or cancellation by such third-party or otherwise,
and Buyer shall assume all the burdens and obligations thereunder.

 

5.5 _Notification_.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article 10_ , each party hereto
will give prompt written notice to the other parties of any inaccuracy or
breach of such partys representation or warranties (in each case, as if such
representation or warranty was being made by such party as of the date of such
inaccuracy or breach) or covenants contained herein, in each case, which
would cause a condition to a partys obligations to consummate the
Transactions as set forth in _Article 6_ not to be satisfied. Such disclosures
shall not affect the rights of any party under this Agreement, including with
respect to indemnification.

(b) Without limiting _Section 5.5(a)_, prior to the Closing, each of the
Sellers, Purchased Entities and the Subsidiaries of the Purchased Entities
shall promptly notify Buyer Parent and Buyer of any fact or development of
which it becomes aware that indicates that any of the Laws referenced in
_Section 3.10(c)_ has been, or is reasonably likely to have been, violated
in any material respect with respect to the Business.

 



37 5.6 _Intercompany Arrangements_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.6_ , at
or prior to the Closing, (a) the Sellers shall cause all Intercompany
Arrangements to be terminated or otherwise cancelled and have no further force
and effect as of the Closing and (b) the Sellers shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause all Intercompany Payables and Intercompany Receivables to be
settled or otherwise canceled.

5.7 _Bulk Sales_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Sellers will not
comply with the provisions of any bulk transfer Laws of any jurisdiction in
connection with the Transactions and hereby waives, subject to _Section
7.2(a)_, all claims related to non-compliance therewith.

5.8 _Additional Buyer Entities_. As soon as reasonably practicable following
the date hereof, such as would not reasonably be expected to delay the
expected Closing hereunder, Buyer Parent will, in consultation with Parent and
taking into account the reasonable comments of Parent, designate one or more
Subsidiaries of Buyer Parent that will be deemed a Buyer hereunder. Buyer
Parent will cause each such Subsidiary (a) to duly execute and deliver all
documents, agreements, and instruments required to be executed and delivered
by such Subsidiary as a Buyer under  _Section 2.2_ or otherwise under this
Agreement and (b) if requested by Parent or any Governmental Entity, to
execute a joinder to this Agreement. Each Subsidiary so designated as a Buyer
pursuant to this _Section 5.8_ will be deemed a Buyer for all purposes
hereunder.

_INDEMNIFICATION; REMEDIES_

7.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties, and the covenants and agreements of the parties to be performed
prior to the Closing Date, set forth in this Agreement and in any certificates
delivered at the Closing in connection with this Agreement shall survive the
Closing until the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "
_Survival Date_ ") and shall thereafter be of no further force or effect;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) with respect to any Losses resulting from
the breach of any representations or warranties contained in _Section 3.8_
(Taxes), the Survival Date shall be the date of the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations, (ii) with respect to any Losses resulting
from the breach of any representations and warranties contained in _Section
3.9_ (Employees and Employee Benefits) and _Section 3.13_ (Environmental

_Section 3.18_ (Brokers or Finders), _Section 4.1_ (Organization of Buyer),
_Section 4.2(a)_ (Authority) and _Section 4.4_ (Brokers or Finders), the

indemnification made hereunder before the Survival Date of such claim will
not terminate before final determination and satisfaction of such claim, and
(b) no claim for indemnification hereunder may be made after the expiration of
the applicable Survival Date.

 

7.2 _Indemnification by Sellers_.

(a) Subject to provisions of this _Article 7_ , from and after the Closing,
each Seller, jointly and severally, shall indemnify Buyer Parent, Buyer, their
respective Affiliates and their respective current and former officers,
directors, partners, members, employees, successors and permitted assigns
(collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") against any losses, out-
of-pocket costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and costs),
liabilities or other damages (collectively, " _Losses_ "), which the Buyer
Indemnified Parties suffer as a result of (i) any breach by Parent of any
representation and warranty contained in  _Article 3_ or any certificate
delivered by or on behalf of the Sellers hereunder at or prior to the Closing,
(ii) any

 



40  breach of any covenant or agreement of a Seller contained in this Agreement,
(iii) any Retained Liability, (iv) Sellers noncompliance with any Bulk Sales
Legislation to the extent relating to Retained Liabilities, or (v) (A) any
Taxes of any Purchased Entity or any Subsidiary of a Purchased Entity with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and (B) the Taxes of any Person (other
than a Purchased Entity or a Subsidiary of a Purchased Entity) with respect
to which any Purchased Entity or any Subsidiary of a Purchased Entity is
liable under Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign Law), as a transferee or successor, by contract (excluding
customary Tax indemnification provisions in commercial contracts not primarily
relating to Taxes), or otherwise.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Seller shall have any liability under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ above, unless the
aggregate of all Losses relating thereto for which Sellers would be liable,
but for this _Section 7.2(b)_, exceeds on a cumulative basis five million,
five hundred thousand dollars ($5,500,000) (the " _Deductible_ "), and then
only to the extent such Losses exceed the Deductible; _provided_ that
Sellers aggregate liability under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ shall in no event
exceed sixty-eight million, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars
($68,750,000) (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Cap and the
Deductible shall not apply to any Losses resulting from breaches of any
Fundamental Representation. In no event shall the aggregate liability of the
Sellers for all Losses claimed by Buyer Indemnified Parties against the
Sellers exceed the Purchase Price, except that the aggregate liability of the
Sellers for all Losses which the Buyer Indemnified Parties suffer as a result
of any breach of the covenants set forth in _Section 9.4_ shall not
be subject to any limitation.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Seller shall be liable to, or indemnify, any Buyer Indemnified Party for any
Losses (i) to the extent that such Losses result from or arise out of actions
taken by a Buyer Indemnified Party or any Purchased Entity or any of their
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates from and after the Closing
Date, (ii) that are punitive, special, consequential, incidental, exemplary,
in the nature of lost profits, or any diminution in value of property or
equity (except, in any such case, to the extent that such damages are awarded
to a third party in a Third Party Claim), or (iii) to the extent that such
matter was taken into account in the final determination of the Net Working
Capital adjustment pursuant to  _Section 1.6(b)(ii)_ hereof. The Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall not use "multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash
flow" or any similar valuation methodology in calculating the amount of any
Losses.

 

(d) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall take, and shall cause the Purchased
Entities and their Subsidiaries to use all commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate all Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to Losses.

(e) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover any Losses
relating to any matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the
extent that the Buyer Indemnified Parties have already recovered Losses with
respect to such matter pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement.

 



41 (f) The representations made in _Section 3.8_ of this Agreement are not
intended to serve as representations to, or a guarantee of, nor can they be
relied upon with respect to, Taxes attributable to any Post-Closing Tax
Periods, or Tax positions taken after the Closing Date.

 

7.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer Parent and Buyer, jointly and
severally, shall indemnify Sellers, their respective Affiliates and their
respective current and former officers, directors, partners, members,
employees, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Seller
Indemnified Parties_ ") against any Losses which the Seller Indemnified
Parties suffer as a result of: (i) any breach of any representation or
warranty of Buyer Parent or Buyer under this Agreement or any certificate
delivered by or on behalf of Buyer Parent or Buyer hereunder, (ii) any non-
fulfillment or breach of any covenant, agreement or other provision of Buyer
Parent or Buyer set forth in this Agreement, (iii) any Assumed Liabilities
and (iv) any claim or suit brought against any of the Seller Indemnified
Parties at any time on or after the Closing Date to the extent relating to
acts or omissions of Buyer Parent, Buyer or a Purchased Entity or any of
their Subsidiaries whether before, on or after the Closing Date other than any
claim or action by Buyer pursuant to _Section 7.2_ relating to any breach by
any of the Seller Indemnified Parties.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Buyer Parent nor Buyer shall have any liability under _Section
7.3(a)(i)_ above, unless the aggregate of all Losses relating thereto for
which Buyer Parent and Buyer would be liable, but for this _Section 7.3(b)_,
exceeds the Deductible, and then only to the extent such Losses exceed the
Deductible; _provided_ that Buyer Parents and Buyers aggregate liability
under _Section 7.3(a)(i)_ shall in no event exceed the Cap; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Cap and the Deductible shall not apply to any Losses
resulting from breaches of any Fundamental Representation.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Buyer Parent nor any Buyer shall be liable to, or indemnify, any
Seller Indemnified Party for any Losses (i) to the extent that such Losses
result from or arise out of actions taken by a Seller Indemnified Party or
any Purchased Entity or any of their Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates from and after the Closing Date, or (ii) that are punitive,
special, consequential, incidental, exemplary, in the nature of lost profits,
or any diminution in value of property or equity (except, in any such case, to
the extent that such damages are awarded to a third party in a Third Party
Claim). The Seller Indemnified Parties shall not use "multiple of profits" or
"multiple of cash flow" or any similar valuation methodology in calculating
the amount of any Losses.

(d) The Seller Indemnified Parties shall take all commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate all Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event
which could reasonably be expected to give rise to Losses.

 



42 (e) The Seller Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover any Losses
relating to any matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the
extent that the Seller Indemnified Parties have already recovered Losses with
respect to such matter pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement.

 

7.4 _Manner of Payment_. Any indemnification payment pursuant to this _Article
7_ shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the
applicable indemnifying party to an account designated by each applicable
indemnified party within twenty (20) days after the determination thereof.

 

7.5 _Defense of Claims_.

(a) _Third Party Claims._ Any Person making a claim for indemnification under
_Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_ (an " _Indemnitee_ ") shall notify the
indemnifying party (an " _Indemnitor_ ") of the claim in writing promptly
after receiving notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or
demand against the Indemnitee by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "),
describing the Third Party Claim, the amount thereof (if known and
quantifiable) and the basis thereof in reasonable detail; _provided_ that the
failure to so notify an Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its
obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnitor has been
damaged by such failure. Any Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in
the defense of such Third Party Claim giving rise to an Indemnitees claim for
indemnification at such Indemnitors expense, and at its option shall be
entitled to assume the defense thereof by appointing a reputable counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to be the lead counsel in connection
with such defense; _provided_ that the Indemnitee shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of
its choice for such purpose; _provided_ , _however_ , that the fees and
expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitee and shall
not be recoverable from such Indemnitor under this _Article 7_ unless the
Third Party Claim involves, upon advice of counsel of the Indemnitee, a
conflict of interest between the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee in which case
the reasonable costs of a single counsel (plus local counsel) for all
Indemnitees may be recoverable from the Indemnitor. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Indemnitor shall be entitled to assume the conduct and control
of the defense or settlement of a Third Party Claim if (a) in the reasonable
judgment of the Indemnitee the aggregate amount of the potential obligations
of the Indemnitee regarding such Third Party Claim exceeds twice the amount of
the remaining portion of the Cap or (b) such Third Party Claim seeks criminal
penalties or non-monetary relief. If the Indemnitor shall control the defense
of any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle such
Third Party Claim; _provided_ that the Indemnitor shall obtain the prior
written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) before entering into any settlement of a Third Party Claim if,
pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or
other equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee, if such
settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnitee from
all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim or if
such settlement involves payment of money in

 



43  excess of the remaining portion of the Cap. If the Indemnitor assumes such
defense, the Indemnitor shall not be liable for any amount required to be paid
by the Indemnitee that exceeds, where the Indemnitee has unreasonably
withheld or delayed consent in connection with the proposed compromise or
settlement of a Third Party Claim, the amount for which that Third Party Claim
could have been settled pursuant to that proposed compromise or settlement.
In all cases, the Indemnitee shall provide its reasonable cooperation with the
Indemnitor in defense of Third Party Claims, including by making employees,
information and documentation reasonably available. If the Indemnitor shall
not assume the defense of any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee may
defend against such Third Party Claim as it deems appropriate; _provided_ that
the Indemnitee may not settle any such matter without the written consent of
the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) if the
Indemnitee is seeking or will seek indemnification hereunder with respect to
such matter.

(b) _Other Claims_. Any Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnitor of any claim
other than a Third Party Claim in writing promptly after receiving knowledge
of the basis for such claim, describing the claim, the amount thereof (if
known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof in reasonable detail; _provided_
that the failure to so notify an Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor
of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnitor has
been damaged by such failure.

7.6 _Determination of Loss Amount_. The amount of any Loss subject
to indemnification under _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_ shall be calculated
taking into account (i) any Tax Benefit actually realized in cash by the
Indemnitee on account of such Loss, (ii) any reserves or liabilities
set forth in the Financial Statements and/or Closing Statement relating to
such Loss and (iii) any insurance proceeds or other amounts under
indemnification agreements received by the Indemnitee on account of such Loss.
If the Indemnitee receives a Tax Benefit (net of any tax detriment) on
account of such Loss after an indemnification payment is made to it, the
Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the Person or Persons that made such
indemnification payment the amount of such Tax Benefit at such time or times
as and to the extent that such Tax Benefit is realized by the Indemnitee. For
purposes hereof, " _Tax Benefit_ " shall mean any refund of Taxes actually
received or reduction in the amount of Taxes which otherwise would be paid by
the Indemnitee, in each case computed at the highest marginal tax rates
applicable to the recipient of such benefit. The Indemnitee shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under all insurance
policies and/or indemnification agreements covering any Loss to the same
extent as they would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification
hereunder. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is received by any
Indemnitee with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been
indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the lesser of (a) the aggregate
amount of the recovery (net of any reasonable third-party costs actually
incurred pursuing or obtaining such recovery, including increased insurance
premiums (if any) directly resulting from such recovery) or (b) the amount of
indemnification payments previously made by the Indemnitors shall be made
promptly to the Indemnitors that provided such indemnity payments to such
Indemnitee. For Tax purposes, the parties hereto agree to treat all payments
made under this _Article 7_ as adjustments to the final Purchase Price.

 



44 7.7 _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless a party hereto in respect of a breach of representation, warranty or
covenant hereunder shall terminate when the applicable representation or
warranty or covenant terminates pursuant to _Section 7.1_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not
terminate with respect to any item as to which the party to be indemnified
shall have, prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period,
previously made a claim by delivering a written notice (stating in reasonable
detail the nature of, and factual and legal basis for, any such claim for
indemnification, and the provisions of this Agreement upon which such claim
for indemnification is made) to the indemnifying party. 

7.8 _Limitation on Recourse_. No claim shall be brought or maintained by any
Buyer Indemnified Party or Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective successors or permitted assigns against any current or former
officer, director, employee or Affiliate of any party (which is not otherwise
expressly identified as a party hereto), and no recourse shall be brought or
granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants of any party hereto set forth or contained in this
Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto or any certificate delivered
hereunder.

7.9 _Exclusivity_. Except as provided in _Sections 11.12_ and _11.13_ or
otherwise set forth in this Agreement, the indemnification provided in this
_Article 7_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for money damages (but not
for injunctive or other non-monetary equitable relief) of any Seller
Indemnified Party and any Buyer Indemnified Party in respect of matters
addressed in _Sections 7.2_ and _7.3_ , respectively, except with respect to
breaches of representations or warranties by any party hereto that
constitute fraud or intentional misrepresentation in connection with the
Transactions, as to which the parties shall have, in addition to the
indemnification provisions of this _Article 7_ , all of their rights and
remedies at law.

 

ARTICLE 8.

 

 _CERTAIN TAX MATTERS_

8.1 _Books and Records; Cooperation_. Buyer, on one hand, and the Sellers, on
the other hand, agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to the other, upon
request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance related
to the Purchased Entities, the Purchased Assets, and the Parent IP Assets,
including access to Books and Records in its possession, as is reasonably
necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns by Buyer or Sellers, the making
of any election related to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Tax
authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding
related to any Taxes. Each of Buyer, on one hand, and the Sellers, on the
other hand, shall retain all Books and Records with respect to Taxes
pertaining to the Purchased Entities, the Purchased

 



45  Assets and the Parent IP Assets (other than Books and Records related solely
to Excluded Assets or Retained Liabilities) for a period of at least six (6)
years following the Closing Date. Buyer, on one hand, and the Sellers, on the
other hand, shall cooperate fully with the other in the conduct of any audit,
litigation or other Legal Proceeding related to Taxes involving the Purchased
Entities, any Subsidiary of a Purchased Entity, the Purchased Assets and the
Parent IP Assets (other than Taxes related solely to Excluded Assets or
Retained Liabilities). Buyer, on one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand,
further agree, upon request from one party and provided that it does not
create (and might not potentially create) any significant burden to the other
party and at the expense of the requesting party, to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to
the Transactions).

8.2 _Transfer Taxes and VAT_.

(a) Buyer, on the one hand, and Parent (on behalf of Sellers), on the other
hand, shall be equally liable for all sales, use, transfer, land value,
documentary, stamp, registration, conveyance, goods and services, harmonized
sales or other similar Taxes imposed by any Tax jurisdiction domestic or
foreign (excluding VAT), and all recording or filing, notarial fees and other
similar costs incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
(collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "). The Purchase Price shall not include
any Transfer Taxes, and such Transfer Taxes shall be paid by Buyer and Parent
in accordance with the terms of this _Section 8.2_.

(b) All Tax Returns or other documentation related to such Taxes (" _Transfer
Tax Returns_ ") shall be filed by the party required to file each such
Transfer Tax Return under applicable Law. The party required to file a
Transfer Tax Return shall submit such Transfer Tax Return (with copies of any
relevant schedules, work papers and other documentation) to the non-filing
party for such partys review, comment, and approval not less than twenty
(20) days before the due date (including extensions) for the filing of such
Transfer Tax Return. If one party is required to file a Transfer Tax Return or
otherwise pay a Transfer Tax bill, the other party (Buyer or Parent, as
the case may be) shall pay half of the Transfer Taxes owing with respect to
such Transfer Tax Return to such party no later than the earlier of five (5)
days prior to the due date of such Transfer Tax Return.

 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 8.10_ and _Section 8.11_, with
respect to assets transferred by a Seller resident in the European Union or
in a jurisdiction which has adopted a VAT regime similar to the provisions of
the VAT Directive, unless stated otherwise in the Preliminary Allocation, the
parties hereto assume that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement do
constitute a supply of goods and that Article 19 of the VAT Directive or
similar applicable local Law provisions do not apply. Based on this
assumption, the Preliminary Allocation sets forth the assets in respect
of which VAT is owed by Buyer to the relevant Sellers together with the
Purchase Price allocated to such assets. Where any VAT set forth in the
Preliminary Allocation is recoverable by Buyer, the relevant Sellers shall
issue valid 

 



46  invoices meeting the requirements of the applicable VAT Law and on a basis
consistent with the Preliminary Allocation and Buyer shall pay to Parent such
VAT in addition to the Purchase Price allocated to such assets on the later
of Closing or receipt of a valid VAT invoice. Where any VAT set forth in the
Preliminary Allocation is irrecoverable by Buyer, the relevant Sellers shall
issue valid invoices meeting the requirements of the applicable VAT Law and
on a basis consistent with the Preliminary Allocation and Buyer shall pay to
Parent fifty percent of such VAT in addition to the Purchase Price on the
later of Closing and receipt of a valid VAT invoice. If and to the extent the
Final Allocation reflects values of the Purchased Assets deviating from the
amounts listed in the Preliminary Allocation, the relevant Sellers shall issue
adjusted valid invoices meeting the requirements of the applicable VAT Law,
and (i) where the purchase price for the assets is increased and (x) VAT is
recoverable by Buyer, Buyer shall pay to Parent an amount equal to any
additional VAT that becomes due as a result of such increase, with payment to
be made by Buyer on receipt of an appropriate VAT invoice, or (y) VAT is
irrecoverable by Buyer, Buyer shall pay to Parent an amount equal to fifty per
cent. of any additional VAT that becomes due as a result of such increase,
with payment to be made by Buyer on receipt of an appropriate VAT invoice, or
(ii) where the purchase price for any assets is decreased, Parent or the
appropriate Seller shall issue a VAT credit note or equivalent to Buyer and
shall, to the extent the Excess VAT is actually recovered and retained by it
or is creditable by Parent or such appropriate Seller against any VAT
liability of Parent or such appropriate Seller, (x) if VAT is recoverable by
Buyer, pay such Excess VAT to Buyer, or (y) if VAT is irrecoverable by Buyer,
pay fifty per cent. of such Excess VAT to Buyer, and for the purposes of this
_Section 8.2(c)(ii) _"Excess VAT" means the VAT actually paid (after
deducting any previous refund under this  _Section 8.2(c)(ii)_) by Buyer
that would not have been payable had the purchase price for the assets at all
times reflected the relevant adjustment or amendment in allocation provided
that no payment shall be due under this  _Section 8.2(c)(ii)_ from Parent or
such appropriate Seller where any part of the consideration (inclusive of VAT)
payable pursuant to this Agreement which is subject to adjustment under this
_Section 8.2(c)(ii)_ remains outstanding. The adjusted invoices shall be
delivered within ten (10) Business Days after the Final Allocation has been
determined pursuant to _Section 1.7(a)_, and the respective VAT amount shall
be repaid or paid, as the case may be, within ten (10) Business Days after
delivery of the respective invoice. If a relevant Tax authority decides that
contrary to the assumptions made in the Preliminary Allocation one or more of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement do not constitute a supply of
goods pursuant to Article 19 of the VAT Directive or similar applicable local
Law provisions, then the relevant Seller shall issue within ten (10) Business
Days after a binding decision of the relevant Tax authority is available,
adjusted valid invoices meeting the requirements of the applicable VAT Law,
and the Buyer shall make a corresponding VAT payment to the relevant Sellers
within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the adjusted invoice by the

(10) days after delivery of such statement. In the event that Buyer or any
Seller makes any payment for which it is entitled to reimbursement under this
_Section 8.3_, the applicable party shall make such reimbursement promptly

credits or similar items generated by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer in any
Tax period or by a Purchased Entity or a Subsidiary of a Purchased Entity
after the Closing Date in any Post-Closing Tax Period, which such losses,
credits or similar items may not be carried forward under applicable Tax Law
(but only to the extent such carryback does not adversely affect Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary Seller, such adverse effect to exclude the actual
reimbursement to Buyer of any such credits or refunds), or (iii) is
attributable to Taxes that are taken into account in determining the Net
Working Capital adjustment pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)(ii))_ shall be for
the account of the Sellers, and Buyer shall pay over to the Sellers any such

under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or any Subsidiary of
such a Purchased Entity relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Periods is increased
and such increase does not result in an actual Tax payment of such Purchased
Entity or Subsidiary due to the fact that (i) Taxes are assessed directly
against the Seller or a Sellers Affiliate due to the existence of a fiscal
unity for corporate income Tax or trade Tax purposes or similar Tax
consolidation schemes or (ii) the increase of the taxable income of the
relevant Purchased Entity or Subsidiary is neutralized through current Tax
losses generated or Tax loss carry forwards used within a fiscal unity for
corporate income Tax, trade Tax or similar Tax consolidation schemes between
such Purchased Entity or Subsidiary and the applicable Seller or Sellers
Affiliate, Buyer shall pay to the Sellers any Tax benefit of Buyer, its
Affiliate, any Purchased Entity or any Subsidiary of a Purchased Entity

the Closing Date (" _Fiscal Unity Tax Benefit_ ") to the extent such decrease
results from an increase in Taxes of Seller or its Affiliates under this 
_Section 8.8(b)_. This _Section 8.8(b)_ applies, in particular, to any Tax
benefit resulting from the lengthening of amortization or depreciation
periods, higher depreciation allowances, a step-up in the Tax basis of assets,
the non-recognition of liabilities or provisions, higher deductions or losses
carried forward. The Fiscal Unity Tax Benefit is calculated in accordance with
the principles set out in _Section 7.6_ above. Any amount to be paid by Buyer

Tax Benefit has become non-appealable.

GST/HST and/or QST shall, unless already collected from Buyer, forthwith be
paid by Buyer to Avery Dennison Canada, and Buyer shall save Avery
Dennison Canada and any other Sellers harmless with respect to any such
GST/HST or Quebec sales tax liability arising herein, as well as any interest

Canadian Transfer Taxes not covered by this _Section 8.9(a)_, Buyer shall
promptly pay directly to the appropriate Tax authority all applicable Canadian
Transfer Taxes that may be imposed or payable or collectible or incurred in
connection with this Agreement, provided that if any Canadian Transfer Taxes

receivables and an amount equal to the portion of the Purchase Price allocated
to such assets in accordance with _Section 1.7_, as the consideration paid
by Buyer therefor. Avery Dennison Canada shall file two copies of such
election with the Canada Revenue Agency forthwith after execution thereof,
and, in any event, with its Tax Return for the year of sale to make such
election.

such Non-Purchased Entity Employees return from such leave of absence), (II)
provide for continuing employment in a substantially equivalent position and
with compensation and benefits coverage that (X) with respect to a Mexican
Non-Purchased Entity Employee, are at least equivalent to the compensation
and benefits coverage provided to such Mexican Non-Purchased Entity Employee
immediately prior to the Closing and (Y) with respect to any other Non-
Purchased Entity Employee, in the aggregate, are at least substantially
equivalent to the compensation and benefits coverage provided to such Non-
Purchased Entity Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (III) require
that such Non-Purchased Entity Employee acknowledge and agree that, as of the
Closing Date, he or she will have resigned from, or voluntarily ceased,
employment with each Seller employing such Non-Purchased Entity Employee. In
addition, all Offers shall be made in accordance with all applicable
Laws. Sellers and Buyer shall take all reasonable actions necessary or
appropriate to cause the Non-Purchased Entity Employees to accept Buyers
Offers or to otherwise become employed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in a
jurisdiction where the Transfer of Undertakings applies (including making
application for (and using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain) any work
permit or visa, employment pass, or other legal or regulatory approval for
employment). Neither Sellers nor any of their Affiliates will seek to induce
any Non-Purchased Entity Employee to reject any Offer from Buyer or any of its
Affiliates made in accordance with the terms hereof, and such Non-Purchased
Entity Employees who accept Offers shall become employees of Buyer or
Affiliates immediately following the Closing (or, in the case of any Offer to
a Non-Purchased Entity Employee on a leave of absence, upon such Non-Purchased
Entity Employees return from such leave of absence) and shall then cease to
be employees of any Seller or Affiliates. All Purchased Entity Employees, Non-
Purchased Entity Employees who accept Offers, and Non-Purchased Entity
Employees whose employment automatically transfers pursuant to a Transfer of
Undertakings are referred to herein as the " _Transferring Employees_."

(v) Buyer Parent and Buyer, jointly and severally, shall indemnify each of
the Sellers and their respective Affiliates against any Liabilities which the
Sellers and their respective Affiliates incur arising from Sellers
termination of any Business Employee who is entitled to object to transfer to
employment with Buyer and who does not become a Transferring Employee (" _Non-
Transferring Employee_ ") for (A) severance pay and benefits and (B) notice
pay, in each case that is required to be paid by Sellers to such Business
Employee under any applicable Employee Plan or Law, provided that

 



57  Sellers give written notice to Buyer of their intent to terminate such Non-
Transferring Employee within thirty (30) days following such Non-Transferring
Employees objection to transfer, but in no event shall such indemnification
by Buyer be more than an aggregate amount equal to $1,000,000.

(vi) The Sellers shall provide to Buyer and its Affiliates all employment
records for each Transferring Employee that are required to be provided to
Buyer and its Affiliates under and subject to applicable Law. Buyer and its
Affiliates shall ensure that all such records are used, processed and stored
in accordance with applicable Law. Buyer and its Affiliates shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Sellers and their Affiliates from and against any
statutory, common law or other claims that arise from the use of such
employment records by Buyer or its Affiliates other than in compliance with
applicable Law. To the extent permitted by Law, the Sellers and their
Affiliates shall be permitted to retain a copy of any employment records
provided to Buyer and its Affiliates pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)(vi)_ or
otherwise.

(vii) Except as otherwise set forth herein (and in no way limiting any other
provisions of this Agreement), Buyer shall bear all of the Liabilities,
obligations and costs relating to, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Sellers and their Affiliates from and against, (A) any claims made by any
Business Employee for any statutory or common law severance or other
separation benefits, any contractual or other severance or separation
benefits, and any other legally mandated payment obligations (including any
compensation payable during (or in lieu of) a mandatory termination notice
period, any payments pursuant to an Order of a court having jurisdiction over
the parties and any payments in connection with accrued annual leave, long
service leave or similar accrued rights) and for any other claim, cost,
Liability or obligation (whether related to compensation, benefits or
otherwise), in each case, arising out of or in connection with the failure of
Buyer or its Affiliates to make an Offer to any Non-Purchased Entity Employee
or to continue the employment of any Transferring Employee, in each case, in
accordance with this Agreement and applicable Law, (B) any claims relating to
the employment of any Purchased Entity Employee or ARD Business Employee
incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date, and (C) any claims relating
to the employment by Buyer or its Affiliates of any Non-Purchased Entity
Employee (excluding any ARD Business Employee) incurred on or after the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such indemnification shall be
limited and reduced to the extent that such Liabilities, obligations and costs
arise solely from or in connection with the failure of Sellers to comply with
any Sellers obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; and
(D) any claims relating to any severance pay liabilities arising under
Transaction Bonus Agreements that are payable solely as a result of any
Buyers termination of employment of any Transferring Employee (" _Transaction
Bonus Severance Liabilities"_ ).

 

(viii) Sellers shall bear all of the Liabilities, obligations and costs
relating to, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates
from and against, (A) any claim by any Non-Purchased Entity Employee
(excluding any ARD Business Employee) against Buyer and/or its Affiliates
arising from or originating during 

 



58  employment by or on behalf of Sellers or their Affiliates prior to the
Closing Date (or, in the case of any Non-Purchased Entity Employee on a leave
of absence on the Closing Date, prior to the effective date of such Non-
Purchased Entity Employees employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates),
and (B) any claim in connection with the Transaction Bonus Agreements other
than claims related to Transaction Bonus Severance Liabilities.

(ix) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall be interpreted to
require Buyer to continue the employment of any Transferring Employee, or
confer on any Transferring Employee any right to continued employment with the
Buyer, for any period of time following the Closing Date.

 

(c) _Post-Closing Benefits_.

(i) For a period of twelve (12) months from the Closing Date (or such longer
period as is required by Law), Buyer agrees that it will, and will cause its
Affiliates to, provide to each Transferring Employee compensation and
benefits coverage that (A) with respect to each Mexican Non-Purchased Entity
Employee, are at least equivalent to the compensation and benefits coverage
provided to such Mexican Non-Purchased Entity Employee immediately prior to
the Closing and (B) with respect to each other Transferring Employee, in the
aggregate, are at least substantially equivalent to the compensation and
benefits coverage provided to such Transferring Employee immediately prior to
the Closing.

(ii) Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall (or shall cause its Affiliates
to), pursuant to employee benefit plans, policies, programs and arrangements
established or maintained by Buyer and its Affiliates (the " _Buyer Plans_ ")
(A) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to Transferring Employees under Buyer Plans, other than limitations
or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees
and that have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date under the
corresponding Employee Plan (subject to Buyers ability to obtain any required
consent of any insurer with respect to any Buyer Plan without unreasonable
effort or expense), (B) provide each Transferring Employee with credit under
Buyer Plans for any co-payments and deductibles paid under the corresponding
Employee Plans prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements for the year in which the Closing
Date occurs (subject to the receipt by the applicable vendors of any
information which is reasonably necessary regarding such co-payments and
deductibles previously paid), and (C) (x) to the extent the Sellers or
their Affiliates are required by Law to pay or otherwise compensate
Transferring Employees for accrued, unused vacation, personal or sick days,
pay the Sellers an amount equal to the aggregate amount of such payment or
compensation by the Sellers and their Affiliates to such Transferring
Employees and (y) to the extent the Sellers and their Affiliates are not
required by Law to pay or otherwise compensate Transferring Employees for
accrued, unused vacation, personal or sick days, honor all vacation, personal
and sick days accrued by such Transferring Employees under the applicable
Employee Plan immediately prior to the Closing. To the extent not inconsistent
with applicable Laws, for purposes of 

 



59  determining eligibility to participate, vesting and determination of the
level of benefits (but not accrual or entitlement to benefits under any
defined benefit pension plan or the level of company matching contributions
under any defined contribution pension plan) for Transferring Employees under
all Buyer Plans, Buyer shall or shall cause its Affiliates to recognize
service with the Sellers and their Affiliates to the same extent recognized
under the corresponding Employee Plans as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

(d) _WARN Act_. On or before the Closing Date, the Sellers shall deliver to
Buyer a list of layoffs of employees of the Business providing services in the
United States, by location, implemented by the Sellers in the ninety (90) day
period preceding the Closing Date. Buyer shall be responsible for providing
or discharging any and all notifications, benefits and liabilities to
employees and governmental entities under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or any similar
state or local Law relating to plant closings, employee separations or
severance pay that are first required to be provided or discharged on or after
the Closing Date (including as to employees identified on the pre-Closing
layoff list provided to Buyer pursuant to this _Section 9.1(d)_) if actions
by Buyer on or after the Closing Date result in such a notice requirement.

 

(e) _Defined Contribution Plans_. As soon as practicable following the Closing
Date, Buyer (or one of its Affiliates) shall take all action necessary or
appropriate to establish one or more defined contribution plans intended to be
tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code for the benefit of the
Transferring Employees (collectively, the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ ").
Transferring Employees shall have their continuous service as defined in the
Avery Dennison Corporation Employee Savings Plan (the " _Seller 401(k) Plan_
") credited under the Buyer 401(k) Plan solely for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting. As soon as reasonably practicable after such date as
the Sellers have been provided (i) evidence that Buyer has established a trust
to hold the assets of the corresponding Buyer 401(k) Plan, and (ii) that the
Buyer 401(k) Plan is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and that the
trust holding the assets of the Buyer 401(k) Plan is exempt under Section
501(a) of the Code (the " _Transfer Date_ "), the Sellers shall cause the
accounts under the Seller 401(k) Plan of each participant who is a
Transferring Employee to be transferred to the Buyer 401(k) Plan. Such
transfer shall include a transfer of the applicable assets from the trust
pursuant to the Seller 401(k) Plan to the trust pursuant to the Buyer 401(k)
Plan in accordance with Section 414(l) of the Code. Such transfer of assets
shall be in cash but shall include any promissory notes or other evidences of
indebtedness with respect to outstanding plan loans to Transferring Employees
who are participants in the Seller 401(k) Plan. On or prior to the Transfer
Date, the Seller shall cause all unvested accrued benefits to become fully
vested for the Transferring Employees for the period up to and including the
Closing Date. No later than thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, the
Sellers will prepare and deliver to Buyer a schedule setting forth (i) the
names of the Transferring Employees who participate under the Seller 401(k)
Plan, (ii) details of any outstanding plan loans from the Seller 401(k) Plan
to the Transferring Employees, and (iii) the account balances of such
Transferring Employees under the Seller 401(k) Plan as of the Closing Date.

 



60 (f) _Other Pension Plans_.

 

(i) On and after the Closing Date, the Purchased Entities, Buyer and its
Affiliates shall be responsible for, and assume all Liabilities related to,
the Transferring Pension Plans and none of the Sellers or their Affiliates
will have any Liability or obligations on or after the Closing Date with
respect to the Transferring Pension Plans (subject to the receipt by Buyer
and its Affiliates of all information reasonably necessary to administer and
operate such Transferring Pension Plans following the Closing Date).

(ii) If a Seller or any of its Affiliates retains employees who are
participants in a Transferring Pension Plan, then such Seller or Affiliate
thereof will use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) ensure that each such
employee ceases to participate in the Transferring Pension Plan prior to the
Closing Date, and (B) cause each such employees accrued benefits under such
plan to be transferred from the Transferring Pension Plan to another employee
benefit plan of the Seller or an Affiliate thereof (the " _Retained Pension
Plan_ "). If the transfer described in _Section 9.1(f)(ii)(B)_ does not occur
prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate to ensure
the transfer to the Retained Pension Plan is made as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing Date.

(iii) Buyer and the Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) ensure that each Business
Employee who is a participant in the Swiss pension plan sponsored by a Seller
(the " _Retained Swiss Plan_ ") ceases to participate in the Retained Swiss
Plan as of the Closing Date, (B) cause each such Business Employees vested
credit benefits under the Retained Swiss Plan to be transferred to the
applicable employee benefit plan of Buyer or Affiliate thereof in accordance
with Swiss Law and regulations governing such plan, and (C) ensure that a
transfer of assets equal in value to the amount of vested credit benefits
described in _Section 9.1(f)(iii)(B)_ is made from the Retained Swiss Plan to
the applicable employee benefit plan of Buyer or Affiliate thereof.

 

(iv) Buyer and the Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) ensure that each Business
Employee who is a participant in the Mexican pension plan sponsored by a
Seller (the " _Retained Mexican Plan_ ") ceases to participate in the Retained
Mexican Plan as of the Closing Date, (B) cause each such Business Employees
benefits under the Retained Mexican Plan to be transferred to the applicable
employee benefit plan of Buyer or Affiliate thereof in accordance with Mexican
Law and regulations governing such plan, and (C) ensure that a transfer of
assets equal in value to the amount of benefits described in _Section
9.1(f)(iv)(B)_ is made from the Retained Mexican Plan to the applicable
employee benefit plan of Buyer or Affiliate thereof. 

(v) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Buyer (or one of its
Affiliates) shall take all action necessary to establish one or more Buyer
Plans that shall qualify as a successor pension plan under the provisions of
the _Pension Benefits Act_

 



61  (R.S.O. 1990, CHAPTER P.8) (Ontario) or similar Law of all Canadian
jurisdictions in which each Transferring Employee is employed (" _Canadian
Successor Pension Plan_ ") for each Employee Plan that qualifies as a pension
plan under the _Pension Benefits Act_ (R.S.O. 1990, CHAPTER P.8) (Ontario) or
similar Law of each Canadian jurisdiction in which a Transferring Employee is
employed (" _Canadian Predecessor Pension Plan_ "). All Transferring
Employees shall be credited with service for the purposes of eligibility and
vesting under each Canadian Successor Pension Plan for all periods of
employment credited under each Canadian Predecessor Pension Plan.

(g) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this _Section 9.1_ shall
create any third party beneficiary right in any Person other than the parties
to this Agreement, including any current or former Business Employee, any
participant in any Employee Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or
any right to continued employment with the Business, the Sellers, Buyer or
any of their respective Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section 9.1_ shall
constitute an amendment to any Employee Plan or any other plan or arrangement
covering Business Employees.

 

9.2 _Post-Closing Access_. Subject to the Transition Services Agreement, the
Supply Agreement and the Trademark Coexistence Agreement and without limiting
the obligations set forth in _Section 8.1_, from and after the Closing, each
party hereto agrees that it will cooperate with and make available to the
other party, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, (i) all
Books and Records and other documents related to the Business, (ii)
information related to the Business and (iii) employees (without substantial
disruption of employment), in each case which are necessary or useful in
connection with any audit, investigation or dispute, any litigation or
investigation or any other matter requiring any such Books and Records,
information or employees for any reasonable business purpose. Unless otherwise
consented to in writing by Parent, Buyer Parent shall and shall cause Buyer,
the Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries not to, for a period of six (6)
years after the Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any Books
and Records or information or portions thereof related to the Business and
relating to periods prior to the Closing Date. Except in connection with uses
contemplated by this Agreement, all information received pursuant to this
_Section 9.2_ (the " _Section 9.2 Information_") shall be kept confidential
by the party obtaining such information (the " _Receiving Party_ "), subject
to any disclosure that is required to be made by such party in order to comply
with applicable Laws or the rules or regulations of any securities exchange
upon which its securities are traded. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
_Section 9.2_ Information shall not include information that (a) is or
becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a
disclosure by the Receiving Party, (b) was within the Receiving Partys
possession prior to it being furnished to such Receiving Party by Buyer (in
the case of any Seller) or any Seller (in the case of Buyer), (c) becomes
available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source
other than Buyer (in the case of any Seller) or any Seller (in the case of
Buyer) or (d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without
violating the Receiving Partys obligations hereunder.

 



62 9.3 _Publicity_. Except as required by applicable Laws or applicable rules
or regulations of any securities exchange upon which its securities are
traded, without prior written approval of Buyer and Parent, none of Buyer, the
Sellers, the Purchased Entities or their respective Affiliates shall issue any
press release or make any public statement regarding this Agreement and the
Transactions.

9.4 _Non-Competition_.

 

(a) In consideration of Buyer entering into this Agreement and in order for
Buyer to enjoy the full benefits of the Purchased Assets and Purchased
Entities, from the Closing Date until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the
Closing Date, Parent shall not, directly or indirectly, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates (each, a " _Restricted Party_ ") not to, directly
or indirectly (including, in all cases, as an owner, investor, partner,
licensor, joint venture or otherwise), develop, manufacture, market, convert,
distribute or sell Printable Media Products or Other Products, in each case
for distribution or sale through the OCP Channels to end-users (such
products, the " _Restricted Products_ ", and the business of developing,
manufacturing, marketing, converting, distributing or selling the Restricted
Products, the " _Restricted Business_ "). The "Restricted Products" do not
include industrial adhesive products (including commercial and industrial
products incorporating adhesives such as pressure-sensitive laminates,
industrial adhesives, or labels other than labels sold or distributed to the
OCP Channels) or the Sticky Note Products, Label Pad Products or NoteTabs
Products which Restricted Parties sold in connection with the Business prior
to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Restricted Products shall
include any products for sale or distribution in the OCP Channels that are
named, identified or designated as labels or label pads.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing _Section 9.4(a)_, Restricted Parties shall
not be prohibited or in any way restricted from engaging in the following
activities to the extent such activities were or are not undertaken with the
intention or principal purpose of avoiding the limitations set forth in
_Section 9.4(a)_:

(i) developing, manufacturing, marketing, distributing or selling any products
or services directed to business-to-business customers serving industrial,
commercial and manufacturing customers, distributors and retailers engaged in
use of labels for identifying, tracking or tracing assets or inventory or in
the process of manufacturing, labeling, packaging, or selling such customers
products or providing services;

 

(ii) developing, manufacturing, marketing, distributing or selling products
and solutions to the extent such products or solutions are (A) the labels
business conducted in Europe under the brand name "JAC" and "Fasson" by
Parents and its Subsidiaries graphics business as of the date of this
Agreement, (B) printers, (C) scanners, readers and/or products and solutions
incorporating acousto-magnetic, radio-frequency or electronic article
surveillance technology or (D) button and other non-adhesive attachment
devices;

 



63 (iii) developing, manufacturing, marketing, distributing or selling warning,
usage or other labels for industrial, manufacturing and commercial
applications, but only to the extent such warning or usage labels are not
Purchased Assets or the assets of the Purchased Entities and the Subsidiaries
of the Purchased Entities; or

(iv) developing, manufacturing, marketing, distributing or selling materials,
products and services to customers, including competitors of the Restricted
Business, for use in end-products developed, manufactured, marketed,
distributed and/or sold by such customers to consumer end users where such
materials or products are Existing Exclusive Products (including Replacement
Products for those Existing Exclusive Products), Exclusive Components
(including Replacement Components for those Exclusive Components), New
Products (including Replacement Products for those New Products), Other
Existing Products (including any subsequent Replacement Products for those
Other Existing Products), or other pressure sensitive constructions
convertible into labels, in each case as defined in the Supply Agreement, but
only to the extent, in each case, that such materials or products are no
longer subject to the exclusivity provisions of _Section 2.2_ or _Section
2.5_ of the Supply Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing _Section 9.4(a)_, Restricted Parties shall
not be prohibited or in any way restricted from:

 

(i) engaging in the Restricted Business to the extent necessary to perform its
duties under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements;

(ii) owning for a period not to exceed 180 days from the date of acquisition
an equity interest of less than five percent (5%) of any other Person engaged
in the Restricted Business acquired as a creditor in bankruptcy and not by a
voluntary investment decision, provided that such interest does not give any
Restricted Party the right to appoint directors or management of such Person
or to otherwise exercise control over the management of such Person; or

(iii) acquiring the assets or capital stock or other equity interests of any
other Person engaged in the Restricted Business, _provided that_ (A) the net
sales attributable to the Restricted Business conducted by such Person
accounts for less than ten percent (10%) of the net sales of such Person for
its most recently completed fiscal year, (B) the Restricted Party uses
commercially reasonable efforts to divest such Restricted Business as soon as
reasonably practicable following completion of such acquisition, and (C) such
acquisition was not undertaken with the intention or principal purpose of
avoiding the limitations set forth in this _Section 9.4_. 

(d) The restrictions in _Section 9.4(a)_ shall apply worldwide.

 

(e) Parent agrees that the terms of _Section 9.4(a)_ are fair and reasonable
and are necessary to accomplish the full transfer of the goodwill and other
intangible assets hereby. In the event that any of the covenants contained in
this _Section 9.4_ (including any component of the definition of Restricted
Business) shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction

 



64  to be unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, then any such provisions
shall not be deemed void, and the parties hereto agree that said limits may be
modified by the court and that said covenant contained in _Section 9.4(a)_
shall be amended in accordance with said modification, it being specifically
agreed by the parties that it is their continuing desire that this covenant be
enforced to the full extent of its terms and conditions, and if a court finds
the full scope of the covenant to be unenforceable, the court should redefine
the covenant so as to provide the fullest extent of its terms and conditions
permitted under applicable Law.

 

(f) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law
for any breach, or threatened breach, of any of the provisions of _Section
9.4_ will be inadequate and, accordingly, Parent covenants and agrees that
Buyer shall, in addition to any other rights and remedies which such party may
have at Law, be entitled (i) to equitable relief, including preliminary and
permanent injunctive relief, and the remedy of specific performance with
respect to any breach or threatened breach of any such provision, as may be
available from any court of competent jurisdiction and (ii) in any action to
enforce such provisions to recover its reasonable attorneys fees incurred in
connection with any such enforcement activities if Buyer is the prevailing
party. Parent hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of a
bond in connection with seeking any such equitable relief.

9.5 _Non-Solicitation_.

 

(a) For a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date, no Seller shall, and
each Seller shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, whether for their own
account or for the account of any Person, solicit, offer employment to or hire
any individual that is a Transferring Employee; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Sellers and their Subsidiaries shall not be prohibited from (i)
initiating searches for employees through the use of general advertisement or
through the engagement of firms to conduct searches that are not targeted or
focused on the Transferring Employees (and the hiring of employees that
respond to any such searches) or (ii) hiring any such employee not employed
by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer, including any Purchased Entity or
Subsidiary of a Purchased Entity, at the time of solicitation.

 

(b) For a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries, the Purchased Entities and the Subsidiaries of
the Purchased Entities, not to, whether for their own account or for the
account of any Person, solicit, offer employment to or hire any individual set
forth on _Schedule 9.5(b)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer, its
Subsidiaries, the Purchased Entities and the Subsidiaries of the Purchased
Entities shall not be prohibited from (i) initiating searches for employees
through the use of general advertisement or through the engagement of firms
to conduct searches that are not targeted or focused on the employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries (and the hiring of employees that respond to any
such searches) or (ii) hiring any such employee not employed by Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, at the time of solicitation.

(c) If any provision of this _Section 9.5_ is deemed invalid, illegal, or
incapable of being enforced by reason of any rule of Law or of any public
policy, all other provisions of

 



65  this _Section 9.5_ shall, nevertheless, remain in full force and effect and
no provision shall be deemed dependent upon any other provision unless so
expressed herein. A court of competent jurisdiction may so modify the
objectionable provision as to make it valid, reasonable, and enforceable. The
parties intend that the restrictions imposed by this Agreement be given the
construction that renders their provisions valid and enforceable to the
maximum extent, not exceeding their express terms, possible under applicable
Law.

9.6 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

(a) For a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date, Buyer and the
Purchased Entities shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to, indemnify and
hold harmless all past and present directors, officers and employees of Avery
Dennison Office Products Company (" _ADOPC_ "), the Purchased Entities
and their Subsidiaries to the same extent such persons are indemnified as of
the date of this Agreement pursuant to applicable Law, the Organizational
Documents of any of Parent, ADOPC, the Purchased Entities and/or their
Subsidiaries, and indemnification agreements or arrangements in existence on
the date of this Agreement with any current or former directors, officers and
employees of ADOPC, the Purchased Entities or their Subsidiaries, arising out
of acts or omissions in their capacity as directors, officers or employees of
ADOPC, the Purchased Entities or any of their Subsidiaries occurring at or
prior to the Closing. Buyer and the Purchased Entities shall advance expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation with respect to the matters
subject to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 9.6(a)_ in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the Organizational Documents of any of
Parent, ADOPC, the Purchased Entities and/or their Subsidiaries and the
indemnification agreements or arrangements in existence on the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the current or former
director, officer or employee to whom expenses are advanced undertakes to
repay such advanced expenses to Buyer or the Purchased Entities if it is
ultimately determined that such current or former director, officer or
employee is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Section
9.6(a)_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation is made against such persons with
respect to matters subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date, the provisions of this _Section
9.6(a)_ shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the
Organizational Documents of the Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries to
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses of current and former directors,
officers and employees of the Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries
for periods at or prior to the Closing than are currently set forth in the
Organizational Documents of the Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries. The
indemnification agreements and arrangements in existence on the date of this
Agreement with any of the current or former directors, officers or employees
of the Purchased Entities or their Subsidiaries shall be assumed by Buyer,
without any further action, and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms following the Closing.

 



66 (c) For a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date, Buyer shall maintain,
or cause to be maintained, for the benefit of the current and former
directors and officers of ADOPC, the Purchased Entities and their
Subsidiaries, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing, an
insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring prior to the Closing (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially
equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the
existing policy or policies providing coverage to ADOPC, the Purchased
Entities and their Subsidiaries (true and complete copies of which have been
previously provided to Buyer) or, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that Buyer shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO
Insurance in excess of three-hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium
paid prior to the date of this Agreement, but in such case shall purchase as
much coverage as is available for such amount. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid policies consistent with the requirements set forth above have been
obtained prior to the Closing, which policies provide such current and former
directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before
the Closing, including in respect of the Transactions. If such prepaid
policies have been obtained prior to the Closing, Buyer shall maintain, or
cause to be maintained, such policies in full force and effect, and continue
to honor the obligations thereunder.

 

(d) In the event Buyer, any Purchased Entity or any Subsidiary of a Purchased
Entity (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or
surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may

not the Transactions are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses.

 

11.15 _Representation by Counsel_. Each party hereto represents and agrees
with each other that it has been represented by or had the opportunity to be
represented by, independent counsel of its own choosing, and that it has had
the full right and opportunity to consult with its respective attorney(s),
that to the extent, if any, that it desired, it availed itself of this right
and opportunity, that each is fully aware of the contents thereof and its
meaning, intent and legal effect, and that it or its authorized officer (as
the case may be) is competent to execute this Agreement and has executed this
Agreement free from coercion, duress or undue influence. Buyer agrees and
acknowledges that the law firm of Latham and Watkins LLP has represented and is
representing the Sellers with respect to the negotiation of this Agreement and
the Transactions, and Buyer irrevocably waives any conflict in connection
therewith, including with respect to any dispute, litigation or proceeding
that may arise out of or in connection with the Transactions or this
Agreement. Buyer, for itself, the Purchased Entities and the Subsidiaries of
the Purchased Entities and for Buyers, each Purchased Entitys and each
Subsidiary of a Purchased Entitys respective successors and assigns, hereby
irrevocably waives and consents to any such representation in any such matter
and the communication by such counsel to the Sellers in connection with any
such representation of any fact known to such counsel arising by reason of
such counsels prior representation of the Sellers or the Purchased Entities
or the Subsidiaries of the Purchased Entities. Buyer, for itself, the
Purchased Entities and the Subsidiaries of the Purchased Entities and for
Buyers, each Purchased Entitys and each Subsidiary of a Purchased
Entitys respective successors and assigns, irrevocably acknowledges and
agrees that all communications between the Sellers and/or the Purchased
Entities and/or the Subsidiaries of the Purchased Entities and its or their
counsel, including Latham and Watkins LLP, made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or any
dispute or proceeding arising under or in connection with, this Agreement
which, immediately prior to the Closing, would be deemed to be privileged
communications of the Sellers and their counsel and would not be subject to
disclosure to Buyer or any Purchased Entity or any Subsidiary of a Purchased
Entity in connection with any process relating to a dispute, litigation or
proceeding arising under or in connection with, this Agreement or otherwise,
shall continue after the Closing to be privileged communications between the
Sellers and such counsel and none of Buyer, any Purchased Entity or any
Subsidiary of a Purchased Entity or any Person acting or purporting to act on
behalf of or through Buyer or any Purchased Entity or any Subsidiary of a
Purchased Entity shall seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds
that the privilege attaching to such communications belongs to Buyer or any
Purchased Entity or any Subsidiary of a Purchased

 



89  Entity and not the Sellers. Buyer acknowledges that its consent and waiver
under this _Section 11.15_ is voluntary and informed and that Buyer has
obtained independent legal advice with respect to this consent and waiver.
Without limiting anything set forth in this Agreement, Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that the Sellers are relying on the foregoing consent and waiver set
forth in this _Section 11.15_.

 

11.16 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile, . _pdf_ or email), each of which when
executed shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

Annex A  Exhibit E

FORM OF TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

This TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (the " _Agreement_ ") is dated as of
, 2012, by and between Avery Dennison Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("
_Seller_ "), and 3M Company, a Delaware corporation (" _Buyer_ "). Seller, on
the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, are each hereinafter referred to
individually as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_." As used
herein, " _Agreement_ " shall include the Exhibits and Schedules hereto.

 

WHEREAS, Seller and Buyer are parties to a Purchase Agreement, dated as of 
, 2011 (as may be amended from time to time, the " _Purchase Agreement_ "),
which provides for the sale of the Business (as defined in the Purchase
Agreement) to Buyer and certain of its Affiliates;

WHEREAS, as of the effective date of the Purchase Agreement, Seller and
certain of its Affiliates or service providers provide certain administrative
and support services to the Business, and the Business provides certain
administrative and support services to Seller and certain of its Affiliates;

WHEREAS, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Purchase
Agreement, and in order to accomplish an orderly transition of the Business
from Seller to Buyer, Buyer desires that Seller or certain of its Affiliates
or service providers provide certain administrative and support services to
Buyer Receiving Party (as defined below) for a limited period of time
beginning as of the date hereof;

WHEREAS, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement, and in order to accomplish an orderly transition of the
Business from Seller to Buyer, Seller desires that Buyer cause the Business to
provide certain administrative and support services to Seller Receiving Party
(as defined below) for a limited period of time beginning as of the date
hereof; and

WHEREAS, Seller and Buyer are each willing to perform such services described
in the foregoing recitals on and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the covenants and
agreements contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereto,
intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

1\. _Definitions_. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have
the respective meanings ascribed thereto in the Purchase Agreement. A summary
of cross-references to other capitalized terms defined herein is set forth in
Section 16 hereof.

2\. _Transition Services_.

(a) _Transition Services Provided By Seller_. During the Term of this
Agreement, Seller shall provide, or in its sole discretion shall cause or
arrange for one or more of its Affiliates or service providers to provide, to
Buyer and/or, if applicable, an Affiliate of Buyer that owns or operates the
Business (collectively with Buyer, " _Buyer Receiving Party_ "), the services
provided by Seller, its Affiliates and its service providers with respect to
the Business described in Exhibit A-1 (collectively, the " _Seller s
Transition Services_"), _provided_ that Seller shall have no obligation to
provide the Sellers Transition Services to or in respect of any Buyer
Receiving Party that ceases to be an Affiliate of Buyer. Unless otherwise
agreed by Seller, the Sellers Transition Services shall be provided during
normal business hours. In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between
the body of this Agreement and the attached Exhibits, such Exhibits shall be
controlling.

 



E-1  (b) _Transition Services Provided By Buyer_. To the extent still required by
Seller as of the date of and during the Term of this Agreement, Buyer shall
provide, or in its sole discretion shall cause or arrange for the Business or
one or more of its Affiliates or service providers to provide, to Seller
and/or, if applicable, an Affiliate of Seller set forth in the attached
Exhibits (collectively with Seller, " _Seller Receiving Party_ "), the
services provided by the Business with respect to Seller Receiving Party
described in Exhibit A-2 (collectively, the " _Buyer s Transition
Services_"), _provided_ that Buyer shall have no obligation to provide the
Buyers Transition Services to or in respect of any Seller Receiving Party
that ceases to be an Affiliate of Seller. Unless otherwise agreed by Buyer,
the Buyers Transition Services shall be provided during normal business
hours. In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between the body of this
Agreement and the attached Exhibits, such Exhibits shall be controlling.

(c) _Additional Definitions_. As used herein, and as the context may require,
(i) the Buyers Transition Services and the Sellers Transition Services
shall each be the " _Transition Services_ ", (ii) Affiliates of Buyer or
Seller who receive the benefit of the Transition Services shall each be a "
_Receiving Affiliate_ ", (iii) Seller Receiving Party and Buyer Receiving
Party shall each be a " _Receiving Party_ ", and (iv) the " _Providing Party_
" shall be the provider of the Transition Services, whether it be Buyer, an
Affiliate of Buyer, Seller, an Affiliate of Seller, or a service provider of
either Party.

(d) _Missing Transition Services_. Seller agrees that, if any transition
service is identified after the Closing that is not contained in Exhibit A-1
but is necessary to allow Buyer to conduct its business after the Closing in
substantially the same manner as it was conducted immediately prior to the
Closing (any such service a " _Missing Transition Service_ "), Seller shall
discuss with Buyer in good faith the provision of such Missing Transition
Service on terms and conditions to be mutually agreed upon by the Parties in
writing and the Parties shall amend this Agreement to provide for such Missing
Transition Service.

(e) _Level of Services_.

(i) The Providing Party shall provide the Transition Services at the same
location and in a reasonably similar manner in which such Transition Services
were provided immediately prior to the Closing. Unless otherwise mutually
agreed by the Parties in writing, with respect to any Transition Service, the
Providing Party shall not be required to provide a level of service which is
higher than (including as to volume, quantity, level, complexity or frequency,
as applicable) the level of service provided by the Providing
Party immediately prior to the Closing, or to make changes to any Transition
Service, including the location where the services are to be provided;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Project Managers for a Transition Service
may mutually agree to any such increase or change in such Transition Service,
including any cost or fee adjustments associated with such increase or change.
Except as set forth in _Sections 13_ and _14_ of this Agreement, no Providing
Party shall be liable for any error or omission in rendering such services,
or any defect in the services rendered.

(ii) The Providing Partys obligation to provide the Transition Services with
respect to the Receiving Party in a reasonably similar manner as provided
immediately prior to the Closing shall be subject to the Receiving Party
ensuring that the physical and technical environment and level of trained
personnel at the facilities of the Receiving Party during the Term of this
Agreement are reasonably similar to those which were present immediately prior
to the Closing.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, after written notice to the Providing
Party, the Receiving Party may make changes to the physical or technical

 



E-2   environment or level of trained personnel at the facilities of the Receiving
Party to the extent such changes do not, in the Providing Partys reasonable
determination, adversely impact the ability of the Providing Party to deliver
the Transition Services _._ In the event that the Providing Party reasonably
determines that its ability to deliver the Transition Services is adversely
impacted as a result of any such changes, then, upon written notice to the
Receiving Party, the Providing Party shall be entitled to charge the Receiving
Party for the Providing Partys costs attributable to remedy the effect of
such changes in accordance with _Section 5(c)(iii)_. If the Receiving Party
provides notice in accordance with _Section 5(c)(iii)_ that it does not wish
to incur such additional costs, the Providing Party may terminate the
provisions of this Agreement relating to such Transition Services (and any
Transition Services related thereto or dependent thereon).

(f) _Third Party Providers_. Seller or Buyer may, in each Partys sole
discretion, arrange for a third party service provider to provide any of the
Transition Services; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller or Buyer, as
applicable, will use any and all reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that
any such Transition Services provided by such third party shall be provided in
substantially the same manner in which such Transition Services were provided
to or by the Business immediately prior to the Closing, and _provided_ , 
_further_ , that Seller or Buyer, as applicable, shall continue to be
responsible for the performance of any Transition Services provided by any
such third party. The Receiving Party may not request any change to or
increase in any Transition Service provided by a third party without
simultaneously providing a copy of such request to the Party that arranged for
such third party to provide such Transition Service, and no such change to or
increase in such Transition Service may be made without the arranging Partys
approval of such request.

(g) _Project Managers_. The Parties have each designated in the Exhibits
hereto, for each type of Transition Service provided, one of their employees
(or an employee of an Affiliate) as their respective " _Project Manager_ " for
the designated Transition Service. The Project Managers shall be the
principal point of contact for the Parties for all matters relating to such
Transition Services. Each Project Manager shall have appropriate decision-
making authority for its respective Party and shall be responsible for such
Partys monitoring of the status of the designated Transition Services. A
Project Manager may be replaced at any time and for any reason by the Party
employing the Project Manager and such replacement shall be effective upon
written notice to the other Party of such replacement.

(h) _Transition Services Managers_. Each Party has designated the employee of
such Party (or its Affiliate) set forth below its name on _Schedule 1_ hereto
as its " _Transition Services Manager_ " for this Agreement. Each Transition
Services Manager shall have appropriate decision-making authority from its
respective Party, and shall be responsible for such Partys general oversight
and monitoring of the activities contemplated by this Agreement, including
supervision of its respective Project Managers. Any disputes or disagreements
that are unresolved by any applicable Project Managers shall be escalated to
the Transition Services Managers for attempted resolution in the first
instance. A Party may replace its Transition Services Manager at any time and
for any reason, and such replacement shall be effective upon written notice
to the other Party of such replacement.

(i) _Cooperation; Reports_. Subject to  _Section 9_, each Party shall cause
its employees and, as appropriate, its Affiliates and the employees of its
Affiliates, to cooperate in good faith and in a professional and workmanlike
manner with employees of the other Party or its Affiliates to the extent
necessary for the effective delivery of Transition Services. Upon request, the
Receiving Party shall promptly provide the Providing Party with data and
reports that are reasonably necessary for the Providing Party to provide the
Transition Services to the Receiving Party. All such data provided shall be
considered Proprietary Information (as defined in _Section 7_ below) of the
Receiving Party subject to the provisions of _Section 7_ of this Agreement.

 



E-3  (j) _Receiving Affiliate_. Buyer and Seller shall each use its best efforts
to (i) cause each of its respective Receiving Affiliates at all times to
promptly comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including,
without limitation, all payment, use restrictions and confidentiality
obligations, and to promptly and fully perform such Receiving Affiliates
obligations hereunder, in each case as if such Receiving Affiliate was a Party
to this Agreement, and (ii) not permit a default hereunder by or through any
of its respective Receiving Affiliates to occur or be continuing hereunder.

3\. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts to Replace Transition Services_. The
Parties acknowledge the transitional nature of the Transition Services.
Accordingly, the Receiving Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to replace, and cease the use of, the Transition Services to be provided
hereunder as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof so that the
Transition Services are terminated by the end of their designated term
pursuant to _Section 12_. If the Receiving Party does not replace and cease
the use of the Transition Services provided to it, then the Providing Party
shall have no obligation to continue to provide the Transition Services after
the expiration of such Transition Services designated terms pursuant to
_Section 12_; provided, however, that the Receiving Party may elect to
extend the terms for such Transition Services by an additional three (3)
months, subject to a fifteen percent (15%) increase in the amounts payable in
respect of such Transition Services pursuant to _Section 5_ during such
three (3) month period. Such election must be made in writing to the Providing
Party not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the term for
such Transition Services.

 

4\. _Software and Licenses_. If the performance of a Transition Service
requires licenses, consents, permits or approvals from third parties not
obtained prior to the date of this Agreement, the Providing Party shall have
no obligation to perform or arrange for the performance of such Transition
Service until such license, consent, or approval is obtained. The Parties
hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at no out-
of-pocket cost to the Providing Party and at the Receiving Partys sole
expense, any such required licenses, consents and approvals, and shall discuss
the need for any modifications to the Transition Services necessary in order
to permit the Transition Services to continue to be performed pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement pending the receipt of such licenses, consents and
approvals. In arranging for such licensing, the Providing Party will
cooperate with the Receiving Partys efforts to reduce such licensing costs
including, but not limited to, leveraging and utilizing existing agreements
with such third party licensors or services providers. If obtaining any such
required license, consent or approval will require the payment of
consideration or the incurrence of additional out-of-pocket costs, the
Receiving Party shall pay such consideration or costs and the Providing Party
shall have no responsibility therefor. In addition, the Receiving Party shall
be solely responsible for the cost of all licenses for intellectual property
acquired from a third party required to be purchased by the Receiving Party in
order to operate its business, and the Providing Party shall have no
responsibility therefor. These obligations shall be in addition to any
obligations of the Seller contained in the Purchase Agreement to deliver
software licenses, consents or approvals to Buyer, and to the extent such
obligations are specified, such obligations shall be in addition to the
obligations stated herein.

5.  _Payments, Fees and Costs_.

(a) _Transition Services_. In consideration of the performance by the
Providing Party of its respective Transition Services, the respective
Receiving Party shall pay monthly, in accordance with _Section 5(e)_:

(i) to the Providing Party, in respect of each Transition Service so
performed, the amounts that are specified as payable to the Providing Party in
this Agreement (including the applicable Exhibit(s)); plus

 



E-4  (ii) to the Providing Party, subject to the prior written approval of
the Receiving Party, any and all reasonable travel, lodging, meals, mileage
and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Providing Party, its
consultants or Representatives in connection with the provision of Transition
Services (but without duplication to the extent the Receiving Party has
already paid such expenses through charges hereunder), except to the extent
such expenses are already charged to the Receiving Party through the fee (as
indicated in the invoices from the Providing Party). The Receiving Party
acknowledges and agrees that if it does not approve such reasonable expenses
in connection with the provision of Transition Services, the Providing Party
shall be able to terminate the provision of the relevant Transition Services
upon ten (10) Business Days prior written notice; _provided that_ the
Receiving Party shall have an opportunity to cure during such ten (10)
Business Day period.

 

(b) _Taxes_. The Receiving Party shall pay all applicable sales, use or other
Taxes incurred with respect to the sale, performance, provision or delivery
of Transition Services. Such Taxes shall be in addition to the other payments
or charges provided for in this Agreement. If the Providing Party pays or
incurs any Tax in respect of the performance, provision or delivery of
any Transition Service, the Providing Party may include such amount in an
invoice to the Receiving Party (but without duplication to the extent any
other Receiving Party has already paid such expenses through charges
hereunder) in respect of such Transition Service.

(c) _Incremental Costs_.

 

(i) If there is an increase in the fees and costs imposed by third parties for
materials the Providing Party reasonably uses or plans to use in providing
the Transition Services, the fees payable by the Receiving Party hereunder
shall be increased proportionately to reflect such increase in third party
fees and costs. Any such increase will be incorporated into the Transition
Service Expenses (as defined in Section 5(e)(i) below) and invoiced and paid
pursuant to _Section 5(e)_. The Providing Party will use reasonable
commercial efforts to avoid any increases in fees and costs, and will
provide prompt written notice of any potential increases to the Receiving
Party.

(ii) If there is an increase or change in the volume or quantity of any
Transition Services pursuant to _Section 2(e)(i)_, the fees and costs
associated with such increase or change, if any, shall be payable by the
Receiving Party. Any such increase will be incorporated into the Transition
Service Expenses (as defined in Section 5(e)(i) below) and invoiced and paid
pursuant to _Section 5(e)_. The Providing Party will use reasonable
commercial efforts to avoid any increases in fees and costs, and will provide
prompt written notice of any potential increases to the Receiving Party.

(iii) In addition, in the event that the Providing Party reasonably
anticipates that it will incur direct or indirect costs (including time spent
on the provision of Transition Services) as a result of (A) modifications to
the systems or processes that the Providing Party uses or plans to use to
provide the Transition Services, or (B) changes to the physical or technical
environment or level of trained personnel at the relevant facilities of the
Receiving Party, in each case occurring as the result of any act or failure
to act of the Receiving Party, the Providing Party shall provide the Receiving
Party with written notice (the " _Incremental Cost Notice_ ") of the nature
and amount of any such incremental costs and the Transition Services

 



E-5   to which they relate as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event less
than ten (10) Business Days prior to incurring such costs; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the case of a change described in clause (B) above, such
notice shall only be required if the Receiving Party has complied with the
requirements of _Section 2(e)(iii)_ in respect of such change. The Receiving
Party shall respond by written notice to the Providing Party within ten (10)
Business Days after receiving the Incremental Cost Notice if the Receiving
Party determines that it does not wish to incur such costs, in which case,
unless the Parties otherwise agree, the Providing Party may terminate the
provision of the Transition Service(s) to which the incremental costs relate
(and any other Transition Services related thereto or dependent thereon) on
ten (10) Business Days prior written notice to the Providing Party. If the
Receiving Party does not provide such notice to the Providing Party within
such ten (10) Business Day period or if the Receiving Party has not complied
with the requirements of _Section 2(e)(iii)_ before making a change
described in clause (B) above, then the Providing Party shall be entitled to
incur the costs specified in the Incremental Cost Notice and invoice the
Receiving Party for the same in accordance with _Section 5(e)_.

 

(d) _Other Incidental Transition Costs_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Receiving Party shall bear any additional costs
resulting from: (i) the retention of any consultants necessary for the
migration approved by the Receiving Party of any software or other
applications to an existing or new platform, or any improvement or
modification to such applications made to accommodate the Receiving Party,
_provided_ that any such improvements or modifications shall be owned by the
Receiving Party and _provided_ _further_ that the Receiving Party shall have
previously consented in writing to the terms of retention of any such
consultant; (ii) the decision by the Receiving Party to outsource any of its
management information system functions to third party application service
providers; and (iii) any requirement for additional disk space or increased
processing capability in excess of that utilized by or on behalf of the
Receiving Party as of the Closing.

(e) _Invoicing and Payments_.

(i) The Providing Party shall invoice the Receiving Party as follows for
Transition Services fees, costs, expenses, liabilities, Losses, and other
amounts paid, owed, or required to be paid by the Receiving Party under this
Agreement (collectively the " _Transition Service Expenses_ "): an invoice
shall be rendered on the 15th day of the month that immediately follows the
month in which the applicable Transition Services are to be provided, setting
forth in reasonable detail the Transition Service Expenses to be paid,
subject to the provisions of Section 5(a) of this Agreement; provided,
however, that if the Receiving Party elects to extend the Term pursuant to
Section 12(b), the fees for all Transition Services shall be equal to 115% of
the applicable fees for such Transition Services set forth in the attached
Exhibits.

(ii) The Receiving Party shall pay all such invoices no later than thirty
(30) days after receipt. For the avoidance of doubt, any Transition Service
Expenses invoiced to Buyer or Seller hereunder shall be deemed invoiced to and
received by their respective Receiving Parties.

(iii) Outstanding amounts not paid in full in accordance with this _Section
5_ shall bear interest from the date such payment was due under this
Agreement at the rate of the lesser of 0.75% per month or the highest amount
permitted to be charged under applicable Law. Any collection of interest with
respect to overdue payments shall be in addition to, and not in limitation
of, the remedies at law or equity or otherwise available to the Party to whom
such payment is owed.

 



E-6  (iv) For avoidance of doubt, the Transition Service Expenses shall
not include any of the Receiving Partys accounts payable or be net of any of
the Receiving Partys accounts receivable, that in either case the Providing
Party may process on behalf of the Receiving Party pursuant to a provided
Transition Service. For clarity:

(1) If, pursuant to the provision of a Transition Service, the Providing
Party processes any accounts payable on behalf of the Receiving Party, the
Providing Party shall provide the Receiving Party with the invoice(s) for such
accounts payable, and the Receiving Party (x) shall verify the amount(s)
stated on such invoice(s), and (y) transfer such amount(s) to the Providing
Party by wire transfer of immediately available funds or electronic
transmission of immediately available funds, in each case within a
commercially reasonable period following receipt of such invoice(s).

(2) If, pursuant to the provision of a Transition Service, the Providing Party
receives payment of any accounts receivable on behalf of the Receiving Party,
the Providing Party shall (x) advise the Receiving Party of its receipt of
such amount(s), and (y) transfer such amount(s) to the Receiving Party by wire
transfer of immediately available funds or electronic transmission of
immediately available funds, in each case within a commercially reasonable
period following receipt of such amount(s).

 

(f) _Payments to be Electronically Transmitted; Currency_. All payments
required to be made by the Receiving Party hereunder shall be made by
electronic transmission of immediately available funds within the required
time to one or more accounts specified by the Providing Party. The Receiving
Party agrees to pay each invoice in United States dollars.

 

(g) _Prior Notice_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Providing Party shall provide the Receiving Party with prior written notice
of any additional fees or costs not listed in the attached Exhibits that it
may incur in connection with the provision of the Transition Services
hereunder.

 

(h) _Invoice Dispute Resolution Procedure_.

 

(i) In the event that the Receiving Party believes that an invoice amount is
incorrect, the Receiving Party must notify the Providing Party in writing
(the " _Dispute Notice_ ") on or before the later of (A) ten (10) Business
Days after the Receiving Partys receipt of the disputed invoice and (B) the
date on which the disputed invoice is due. The Dispute Notice must set forth
in reasonable detail the basis for the dispute and the amount in dispute (the
" _Disputed Amount_ "). If the Receiving Party does not deliver a Dispute
Notice within the time period set forth in the first sentence of this
_Section 5(h)(i)_, then the invoice shall be deemed to be correct in all
respects (subject to the Receiving Partys rights under _Section 5(i)(ii)_).
The Receiving Party shall be permitted to submit only one Dispute Notice per
invoice, and shall timely pay any undisputed portion of such invoice in the
manner set forth in this Agreement.

(ii) The Parties shall in good faith use commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve their dispute over the Disputed Amount pursuant to this _Section
5(h)5(g)_ as soon as reasonably possible after delivery of a Dispute Notice.
Notwithstanding any such dispute resolution efforts, if the Disputed Amount is
not paid to the Providing Party within thirty (30) days after the date
originally due under _Section 5(e)(ii)_, the Providing Party may, upon at
least three (3) Business Days prior written notice, suspend the provision of
such Transition Service(s) until payment by the Receiving Party or any of its
Affiliates of such Disputed Amount(s); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that:

(1) the Providing Party will resume the provision of such suspended Transition
Services upon the payment of the Disputed Amount(s), and

 



E-7  (2) upon the Parties written agreement on the proper resolution of the
dispute specified by the Dispute Notice and the correct amount due to the
Providing Party, the Receiving Party shall promptly pay such amount or, if the
Disputed Amount was previously paid to the Providing Party and the correct
amount is less than the Disputed Amount, the Providing Party shall apply the
difference between the correct amount and the Disputed Amount towards the next
invoice.

(iii) If the aggregate Disputed Amounts exceed $500,000, the Providing Party
may immediately suspend the provision of all of its Transition Services
hereunder until the earlier of (A) resolution of the disputes and payment by
the Receiving Party or any of its Affiliates of all Disputed Amounts agreed by
the Parties, and (B) the payment by the Receiving Party or any of its
Affiliates of an amount equal to the portion of the Disputed Amount in excess
of $500,000.

(i) _Records and Audits_.

 

(i) _Records._ The Providing Party will maintain (and, as applicable, cause
its Affiliates and use commercially reasonable efforts (but no lesser efforts
than it used immediately prior to the Closing) to cause its independent
contractors to maintain) accurate and complete records regarding its
activities relating to this Agreement and the means of calculating the
amounts billed to the Receiving Party hereunder. Such books and records will,
at all times, be kept in a manner consistent with the Providing Partys past
practices prior to the Closing and, in any event, in accordance with
good administrative and secretarial practice and generally accepted
accounting principles. The Providing Party will retain (and, as applicable,
cause its Affiliates to retain) all such records until two (2) years after any
termination or expiration of this Agreement, unless otherwise directed by the
Receiving Party.

(ii) _Audits._ Upon fifteen (15) Business Days notice to the Providing Party,
the Receiving Party and its designees will have the right to inspect and audit
all the relevant records and books of account of the Providing Party and its
Affiliates to verify the accuracy of all payments made or to be made by the
Receiving Party pursuant to _Section 5_. Any audit by the Receiving Party or
its designees will be conducted during regular business hours at the
facilities of the Providing Party or its Affiliates, and in a manner that
does not unreasonably interfere with the normal business activities of the
Providing Party or its Affiliates. If any audit reveals an overpayment by the
Receiving Party, the Providing Party will promptly refund any overpayment. In
addition, if any audit reveals an overpayment by the Receiving Party exceeding
ten percent (10%) during the audited period, the Providing Party will
reimburse the Receiving Party for the costs of conducting the audit. For
avoidance of doubt, the audit rights of this _Section 5(i)(ii)_ are solely to
verify the arithmetic computation of invoiced amounts and for no other
purpose. When visiting the Providing Partys facilities pursuant to this
_Section 5(i)(ii)_ , the Receiving Party and its designees shall comply with
the Providing Partys (a) safety, security and other rules applicable to those
working at the Providing Partys facilities and (b) policies concerning access
to and security of any premises or computer system to which such Person may
have access, in each case, to the extent made known by or as would be
reasonably evident to such Person.

 



E-8  6\. _Access; Information Technology_.

 

(a) The Receiving Party acknowledges that certain of the Transition Services
include access to certain computer networks of the Providing Party (the "
_Providing Party Computer Network_ "), and that such access is conditioned
upon the Receiving Partys agreement to the terms set forth in _Schedule 2_
hereto. The Providing Party shall use reasonable commercial efforts to create
and maintain the Receiving Partys access to the Providing Party Computer
Network for as long as such access is required to receive and use the
Transition Services. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the provision of
the Transition Services hereunder may be subject to (i) the installation,
configuration, or re-configuration of a firewall and/or one or more network
security devices at each of the sites operated by the Receiving Party to
protect the Providing Party Computer Network, and (ii) the Providing Party
installing, configuring, and re-configuring such firewall or network security
device and managing and maintaining the resulting network configuration. The
Receiving Party agrees that such installation, configuration and/or re-
configuration shall be carried out in accordance with and shall comply with
all of the Providing Partys written requirements and guidelines provided such
requirements and guidelines are commercially reasonable and necessary to
protect the Providing Party Computer Network and are provided to the Receiving
Party in advance. All reasonable costs of installation of such firewalls and
network security devices, and all reasonable ongoing costs and expenses of
maintaining the firewalls and other network security devices shall be borne by
the Receiving Party provided that the Providing Party shall not charge for
accessing or utilizing Providing Party Computer Network and shall otherwise
only charge the Receiving Party for any actual expense incurred by the
Providing Party for third party materials purchased by the Providing Party
solely for the benefit of the Receiving Party in accessing the Providing Party
Computer Network.

(b) _Right to Terminate_. The Providing Party reserves the right to terminate
those Transition Services relating to the Providing Party Computer Network
(and any Transition Service related thereto or dependent thereon) and to
terminate the Receiving Partys access to the Providing Party Computer Network
(and any Transition Service related thereto or dependent thereon) in the
event the Receiving Party fails to cure any material breach of this _Section
6_ (including the terms set forth in _Schedule 2_ hereto) within ten (10)
Business Days after written notification to the Receiving Party of such
material breach; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Providing Party may
temporarily suspend the Receiving Partys access to the Providing Party
Computer Network without such notice in the event such material breach
damages, injures or poses an imminent risk to the integrity or operations of
the Providing Party Computer Network. The Providing Party shall be under no
obligation to reinstate either the Receiving Partys Transition Services
related to the Providing Party Computer Network or the Receiving Partys
access to the Providing Party Computer Network following any such material
breach and failure to cure until such material breach has been cured in a
manner reasonably expected to prevent a recurrence of such material breach.

7\. _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Each Party agrees and acknowledges that, during the Term of this
Agreement, the other Party hereto may have access to, or a Party (the "
_Discloser_ ") may be required to disclose to the other Party (the "
_Recipient_ "), certain confidential information, data, records, files,
archives and other proprietary information, whether oral or
written, concerning, among other things, third party materials or the
Disclosers inventions, know-how, customer lists, suppler lists, pricing,
patent and trade secrets, software, distribution and other general business
information (collectively, the " _Proprietary Information_ "). Each Party
further agrees and acknowledges that all Proprietary Information of the
Discloser or its Affiliates, customers, suppliers or independent contractors
generated, produced or stored by a Party or any third party in connection
with the provision of Transition Services or the performance of this Agreement
shall be the Proprietary Information of the Discloser, and that all
information relating to 

 



E-9   the same and other information related to the historical and current
operations of the Discloser is the Proprietary Information of the Discloser.
Proprietary Information shall remain the sole property of the Discloser and
the other Party shall have no interest in or rights with respect to such
Proprietary Information.

(b) _Protection_. During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of three
(3) years after the termination or expiration hereof, and, in respect of
Proprietary Information that constitutes computer source code, for an
indefinite period, each Party agrees, and shall cause its respective
Affiliates, service providers, independent contractors and Representatives, to
protect the confidentiality of the other Partys Proprietary Information with
the same degree of care that it utilizes with respect to its own similar
confidential and proprietary information, but in any event, no less than
reasonable care, including:

 

(i) not to disclose or copy, display, loan, publish, transfer (whether by
sale, operation of law or otherwise) or otherwise disseminate or allow access
to the Proprietary Information, in whole or in part, in any form whatsoever,
to or by any third party without the prior written consent of the Discloser,
except that such disclosure or access shall be permitted with respect to an
employee or independent contractor requiring access to the Proprietary
Information in the course of his or her employment or provision of Transition
Services to the Recipient, _provided_ , _however_ , that such employee
or independent contractor is subject to confidentiality obligations
substantially similar and in no event less restrictive than as set forth in
this Section 7;

 

(ii) to notify the Discloser promptly and in writing of the circumstances
surrounding any suspected possession, use, disclosure or knowledge of the
Proprietary Information or any part thereof at any location or by any person
or entity other than those authorized by this Agreement and to take further
steps as may reasonably be requested by the Discloser to remedy any such
possession, use or disclosure; and

(iii) upon the Disclosers request, to promptly return to Discloser or
destroy all documents and materials in tangible form, and permanently erase
all data in electronic form, containing any Proprietary Information, and
certify in writing signed by an officer of Recipient that Recipient has fully
complied with this obligation (except that the Recipients legal counsel may
retain one copy of such information in their offices for record-keeping
purposes only).

(c) _Use_. A Party shall not use, nor permit the use of, a Disclosers
Proprietary Information for any purpose other than in connection with the
performance of its obligations hereunder or as otherwise expressly permitted
herein.

(d) _Exceptions_. Nothing in this _Section 7_ shall restrict the Parties
with respect to confidential information, data, records, files, archives or
other proprietary information, whether or not identical or similar to that
contained in the Proprietary Information, if such confidential information,
data, records, files, archives or other proprietary information: (i) is
independently developed by the Recipient without reference to the Disclosers
Proprietary Information (and Recipient shall provide the Discloser with
reasonably satisfactory evidence of such independent development); (ii) is or
becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of any act or
default of, or disclosure by, the Recipient; (iii) becomes available to the
Recipient on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Discloser
or its Affiliates, Representatives or independent contractors, _provided_ such
source is entitled to disclose such information to the Recipient on a non-
confidential basis; (iv) was known by the Recipient on a non-confidential
basis prior to the disclosure thereof to the Recipient by the Discloser; or
(v) is

 



E-10   required by Law to be disclosed; _provided_ , _however_ , that as soon as is
reasonably practicable after receiving notice of any such required disclosure
and to the extent that it may legally do so, the Recipient advises the
Discloser of the same, and prior to making any such disclosure, takes
commercially reasonable actions to assure the confidential handling of the
Proprietary Information, including, to the extent permissible and
practicable, affording the Discloser a reasonable period of time to seek a
protective order prohibiting the disclosure of the Proprietary Information, if
allowed by applicable Law and cooperates with the Discloser, at the
Disclosers reasonable request and expense, in any lawful action to contest
or limit the scope of such required disclosure.

(e)  _Injunctive Relief_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other
Party may suffer irreparable harm for which monetary damages may be an
inadequate remedy if there were a breach by such party of obligations under
this  _Section 7_. Each Party further acknowledges and agrees that equitable
relief, including injunctive relief, may be appropriate to protect the non-
breaching Partys rights and interests if such a breach were to arise, be
threatened, or be asserted, and the non-breaching Party will be entitled to
seek the entry of an order for immediate injunctive relief.

(f)  _Trade Secrets_. The Parties agree that notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, neither Party shall disclose to the other Party
any of its trade secrets or have any rights in or to any of the other Partys
trade secrets. To the extent a Providing Party determines that it is
necessary to disclose any trade secrets to the Receiving Party in order for
the Providing Party to perform or the Receiving Party to receive any
Transition Services (such Transition Services, the " _Dependent Transition
Services_ ") as set forth in this Agreement, the Parties shall mutually agree
in writing on the reasonable terms and conditions of such disclosure and the
Receiving Partys obligations with respect to such trade secrets. Until the
Parties are able to mutually agree on such reasonable terms and conditions,
the Providing Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
Dependent Transition Services without disclosing such trade secrets, but
shall not be liable for any failure by it to perform or any failure by the
Receiving Party to receive the Dependent Transition Services in accordance
with this Agreement (or Losses that result therefrom) that results from the
non-disclosure of such trade secrets.

8\. _Compliance With Third Party Agreements_. In the event that Buyer or
Seller or any of its respective Affiliates arranges for a Transition Service
to be provided to the Receiving Party by an Affiliate or a third party service
provider, the Receiving Party shall at all times comply with the material
terms of the Providing Partys (or any of its Affiliates) agreements with
such Affiliate or third party service provider (each, a " _Third Party
Agreement_ "), to the extent such Third Party Agreements are applicable to the
Transition Services, as if the Receiving Party was party thereto, including
without limitation all use restrictions and confidentiality obligations;
_provided_ _that_ the Receiving Party shall be provided with a reasonably
detailed summary of all material terms of such Third Party Agreement with
which such Receiving Party is required to comply. In the event that the
Receiving Party fails to meet its obligations under the preceding sentence of
this _Section 8_ as to the terms of a Third Party Agreement, the Providing
Party may provide the Receiving Party with written notice of its intention to
terminate all Transition Services that are provided to the Receiving Party
under such Third Party Agreement. In the event that such Third Party
Agreement provides for a cure period and the Receiving Party does not cure
its or any of its applicable Affiliates failure to meet its obligations under
such Third Party Agreement within the cure period provided for in such Third
Party Agreement, the Providing Party shall be entitled to terminate all
Transition Services that are provided to the Receiving Party under such Third
Party Agreement, and any Transition Services related thereto or dependent
thereon.

 

9\. _Disclaimer of Warranties_. EXCEPT FOR ANY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
THAT ARE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, THE TRANSITION SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO
EACH RECEIVING PARTY "AS-IS." NEITHER BUYER NOR SELLER, NOR

 



E-11   ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING THE TRANSITION
SERVICES IT PROVIDES. THE PROVIDING PARTY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS THE
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ANY AND
ALL WARRANTIES AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW.

 

10\. _Access to Facilities to Provide Services and Remove Equipment_. In
connection with the provision of Transition Services, the Receiving Party
shall permit, and shall cause its Affiliates to permit, the Providing Party,
and their respective employees, vendors and independent contractors, to have
reasonable access to the facilities of the Receiving Party to the
extent required to provide the Transition Services in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. In further connection with the provision of the
Transition Services, Receiving Party shall permit, and shall cause its
Affiliates to permit, Seller, its Affiliates and any service providers, and
their respective employees, vendors and independent contractors, to remove the
property of Providing Party, its Affiliates and any service providers from
Receiving Partys facilities. When visiting the Receiving Partys facilities
pursuant to this Agreement, the Providing Party shall cause its respective
employees, vendors and independent contractors to comply with the Receiving
Partys (a) safety, security and other rules applicable to those working at
the Receiving Partys facilities and (b) policies concerning access to and
security of any premises or computer system to which such Person may have
access, in each case, to the extent made known by or as would be reasonably
evident to such employee, vendor or independent contractor.

11\. _Insurance_. Each Party shall, to the extent commercially reasonable,
maintain insurance covering all risks for which insurance applicable to the
Transition Services is customarily maintained for businesses similar to the
businesses of each Party, including, without limitation, all risks to and
from the property and employees of such Party and its Affiliates.

12\. _Term; Termination_. __ 

(a) Unless terminated earlier or extended in accordance with this _Section
12_, the term of this Agreement (the " _Term_ ") shall commence as of the
Closing Date and shall expire twelve (12) months after the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if an earlier termination date for a
Transition Service is set forth in an Exhibit or another Section of this
Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement with respect to such Transition
Service shall terminate on such earlier termination date, and (ii) this
Agreement is not otherwise earlier terminated pursuant to its terms.

(b) Subject to _Sections 3 and 5(e)_ , the Receiving Party may elect to extend
the term of any Transition Services or the Term of this Agreement by an
additional three (3) months, subject to a fifteen percent (15%) increase in
the amounts payable in respect of such Transition Services pursuant to Section
5 during such three (3) month period. Such election must be made in writing
to the Providing Party not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration
of the term for such Transition Services or the Term of this Agreement, as
applicable.

 

(c) This Agreement, or specific Transition Services provided hereunder, may be
terminated before the completion of the Term:

 

(i) by mutual agreement of the Parties;

 

(ii) by the Providing Party as expressly set forth in this Agreement;

 



E-12  (iii) by the Providing Party, on the one hand, or the Receiving Party, on the
other hand, for material breach by the other of any of the terms hereof if
such material breach is not cured within forty-five (45) days after written
notice of such breach is delivered to the breaching Party (and if the
Providing Party is an Affiliate of Seller or service provider of Seller, such
written notice will be delivered to Seller by the applicable Buyer Receiving
Party);

(iv) by the Providing Party, on the one hand, or the Receiving Party, on the
other hand, in the event of the filing by or against the other Party of a
petition in bankruptcy, or the appointment of a receiver of such other Party
or any substantial portion of such other Partys assets, or any proceeding or
reorganization for the benefit of the other Partys creditors, or upon the
other Party becoming insolvent; or

 

(v) with respect to any or all Transition Service(s) and except as may
otherwise be noted in the attached Exhibits, by the Receiving Party for any
reason in its sole and absolute discretion. Such termination will be effective
upon the later of (i) thirty (30) days after written notice of such
termination is received by the Providing Party, or (ii) if such written
notice is given later than the first day of any calendar month, the end of the
second full calendar month after such notice is given (for illustrative
purposes only, a termination notice delivered under this Section 12(c)(v)
on June 15, 2011, shall be effective on August 31, 2011).

(d) Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or particular
Transition Services hereunder, the Parties shall have no further obligations
hereunder or with respect to such particular Transition Services; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
obligation of a Party accruing hereunder prior to such expiration or
termination shall be terminated or otherwise relieved and the rights and
obligations of the Parties under _Sections 5_ (except for the audit rights
under  _Section 5(i)(ii)_, which shall only survive the termination or
expiration of this Agreement for six (6) months), _7_ , _9_ , _10_ (but solely
with respect to the removal of property), _11_ , _12_ , _13_ ,  _14_ , _15_ ,
_16_ and _17_ and all of the Receiving Partys payment obligations with
respect to any accrued but unpaid amounts owed hereunder subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement shall survive any expiration or termination
hereof.

(e) In addition, in the event that the Providing Party terminates this
Agreement or any of the Transition Services provided hereunder as set forth
in clauses _(c)(ii)_ , _(c)(iii)_ , or _(c)(iv)_ of this _Section 12_, or if
the Receiving Party terminates this Agreement or any of the Transition
Services provided hereunder as set forth in _(c)(v)_ of this _Section 12_,
then the Receiving Party shall pay any and all costs, expenses, penalties,
interest and the like imposed on or incurred by the Providing Party by third
parties in connection with such termination.

(f) (i) The Parties acknowledge and agree that certain Transition Services are
reliant on other Transition Services, such that the extension, suspension,
termination or expiration of one such Transition Service (any such event, a "
_Trigger Event_ ") would affect a Providing Partys ability to provide the
related Transition Services. Each group of related Transition Services is
identified on the Exhibits attached hereto by a particular "bucket".
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and unless the
Parties otherwise mutually agree in writing after evaluating the totality of
the Transition Services included in a particular bucket at the time of a
Trigger Event, the occurrence of such a Trigger Event with respect to a
particular Transition Service as provided herein shall also result in the
automatic and concurrent extension, suspension, termination or expiration, as
applicable, of all other Transition Services included in the same bucket (the
" _Triggered Transition Services_ ").

 



E-13  (ii) If the Parties mutually agree in writing that the effect of a
Trigger Event described in _Section 12(f)(i)_ on the Triggered Transition
Services can be limited to one or more specific regions, countries, or
locations, then the Parties may mutually agree in writing to limit the effect
of such Trigger Event on the Triggered Transition Services to such specific
regions, countries, or locations.

13\. _Limitation of Liability_. 

(a) NEITHER THE PROVIDING PARTY, ITS AFFILIATES OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES ON THE
ONE HAND, NOR THE RECEIVING PARTY, ITS AFFILIATES, OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES,
ON THE OTHER HAND, SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR FOR ANY INDIRECT,
COMPENSATORY, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY PERFORMANCE OF THE TRANSITION SERVICES HEREUNDER
OR THE PERFORMANCE OR BREACH OF ANY OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR OTHERWISE, EVEN
IF THE APPLICABLE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 

(b) IN NO EVENT SHALL THE PROVIDING PARTY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE FOR
ANY DIRECT DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PERFORMANCE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY BREACH OF ANY OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, OR OTHERWISE THAT EXCEED THE SUM OF
THE AMOUNT PAID AND THE AMOUNT PAYABLE FOR THE TRANSITION SERVICES UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT. THE RECEIVING PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE CHARGES FOR
THE TRANSITION SERVICES IT RECEIVES AND THE RESOURCES PROVIDED HEREUNDER HAVE
BEEN ESTABLISHED IN CONTEMPLATION OF THE FOREGOING ALLOCATION OF RISK.

(c) THE WAIVER OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES AND THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET
FORTH IN CLAUSES (a) AND (b) ABOVE EXPRESSLY EXCLUDE ALL LIABILITY ARISING
FROM (1) BREACHES OF THE NON-USE AND NON-DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS OF _SECTION
7_ ABOVE, OR (2) A PARTYS FRAUD, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

14\. _Indemnification_.

(a) _Indemnification by the Receiving Party_. The Receiving Party shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Providing Party, and its
Representatives, successors and assigns (the " _Providing Party Indemnitees_
"), from and against and in respect of any and all Losses, which
the Providing Party Indemnitees suffer as a result of third party claims
relating to or arising out of: (i) the performance by the Providing Party of
any Transition Services pursuant to this Agreement, other than to the extent
such Losses are the result of (A) the fraud, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Providing Party or its Representatives or independent
contractor in the performance of, or failure to perform under, this Agreement,
or (B) a material breach of this Agreement by the Providing Party or its
Affiliates, Representatives or independent contractors; (ii) any material
breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or its Affiliates,
Representatives or independent contractors, it being acknowledged and agreed
that the failure to pay any amounts due hereunder within the time required
hereunder for such payment shall be deemed to be a material breach; or (iii)
fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Receiving Party or any
of its Affiliates.

(b) _Indemnification by the Providing Party_. The Providing Party shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Receiving Party, and its respective
Representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Receiving Party
Indemnitees_ "), from and against and in respect of any and 

 



E-14   all Losses, which the Receiving Party Indemnitees suffer as a result of
third party claims relating to or arising out of: (i) fraud, gross negligence
or willful misconduct of the Providing Party in the performance of, or
failure to perform under, this Agreement; or (ii) any material breach of this
Agreement by the Providing Party or its Affiliates, Representatives or
independent contractors. Except as provided in the first sentence of this
_Section 14(b) above_, the Providing Party shall have no liability whatsoever
to any Receiving Party Indemnitees for any error, act or omission in
connection with the Transition Services to be rendered hereunder, and
the Providing Partys sole responsibility to the Receiving Party Indemnitees
with respect to any error, act or omission in connection with the Transition
Services shall be as follows: (A) in the event of the Providing Partys
error or omission in connection with the Transition Services, to furnish
correct information and to provide any necessary adjustment in the Transition
Services at no additional cost or expense to the Receiving Party or its
Affiliates; and (B) in the event of the Providing Partys failure to deliver
any Transition Service because of a force majeure, to use reasonable efforts
to make the Transition Services available and/or to resume performing the
Transition Services as promptly as reasonably practicable.

(c) _Indemnification Process_. The Party seeking indemnification under this 
_Section 14_ (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall provide prompt written
notice of such claim to other Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), describing
the claim, the amount thereof (if known) and the alleged basis thereof. For
the avoidance of doubt, the failure of the Indemnified Party to provide such
notice shall not affect the indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying
Party, unless and to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced
by such failure. Subject to the remaining provisions of this _Section
14(c)_, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the
defense and/or settlement of any such claim. The Indemnifying Party
acknowledges and agrees that the Indemnified Party has the right to
participate, at its own expense, in the defense of any claim for which the
Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification under this _Section 14_. The
Indemnifying Party may not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any such claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent: (i) includes
an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such commenced or threatened claim; and (ii) does not include a
statement as to, or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or
on behalf of, the Indemnified Party.

 

(d) _Indemnification Payment_. Any indemnification payment pursuant to this
_Section 14_ shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available
funds from the Indemnifying Party to an account designated by each applicable
Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days after the determination thereof.

 

(e) _General_. No right of indemnification shall exist under this Agreement
with respect to matters for which indemnification may reasonably be claimed
under the Purchase Agreement, it being the intent of the Parties that claims
that are addressed under the Purchase Agreement shall be governed solely by
the Purchase Agreement. No right of indemnification shall exist under
the Purchase Agreement for claims arising out of the performance of this
Agreement, it being the intent of the Parties that such claims shall be solely
governed by the provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no claim for indemnification made under this Agreement shall be denied solely
based on the preceding two sentences if such claim was initially brought under
the Purchase Agreement and denied because the subject matter of such claim was
reasonably believed to be covered under the indemnification provisions of
this Agreement.

15\. _Force Majeure_. Neither Party shall have any liability for Losses under
this Agreement relating to, arising from or in connection with a delay in
performance or a failure to perform caused by force majeure, that is due to
circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the Party affected thereby,
including, without limitation, acts of God, acts of civil or military
authority, fires, floods,

 



E-15   inclement weather, epidemics, accidents, quarantine restrictions, war,
terrorist acts, riots, demonstrations, strikes, lock-outs, labor disputes,
labor shortages, sabotage, disruption of Internet access or the Providing
Party Computer Network beyond the reasonable control of the Party providing
such performance, whether as a result of any virus, worm, Trojan Horse,
malware or other malicious or unauthorized code, accidents with respect
to machinery or equipment, governmental action or inaction, order or
restraints of governmental or other competent authorities, unavoidable delay
in obtaining necessary materials, facilities or equipment in the open market
caused by third parties, and delays in transportation caused by third
parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Party affected by such force
majeure event uses diligent efforts, under the circumstances, to notify the
other Party in writing of the circumstances causing the delay or non-
performance and resumes performance as soon as reasonably possible, and
_provided_ _further_ that the other Party shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement on 30 days prior written notice to the affected Party if the
force majeure event continues unabated for a period of 90 days.

desirable to carry out any purpose of this Agreement, then each Party hereto
will take such further action (including the execution and delivery of further
documents) as the other Party hereto reasonably requests to carry out such
purpose. The foregoing will be at the expense of such requesting
Party, except to the extent such requesting Party is entitled to
indemnification therefor or to the extent this Agreement otherwise allocates
such expense to any other Party.

(b) _No Solicitation; No Hire_. During the Term of this Agreement and for a
period of one (1) year thereafter, neither Party shall solicit, offer
employment to or hire any employee of the other Party or its Affiliates who
has or had been involved in the provision of Transition Services or
performance of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Party
shall be prohibited from (i) initiating searches for employees through the
use of general advertisement or through the engagement of firms to conduct
searches that are not targeted or focused on the employees of the other Party
(and the hiring of employees that respond to any such searches) or (ii)
hiring any such employee not employed by the other Party at the time of
solicitation.

(c) _Independent Contractor Status_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to constitute a single employer, joint employer, co-employer,
alter-ego, agency, partnership, joint venture or similar relationship between
the Providing Party or any of the Providing Partys Affiliates, on the one
hand, and the Receiving Party or any of the Receiving Partys Affiliates, on
the other hand. Each Providing Party is acting pursuant to this Agreement
solely as an independent contractor.

 

(d) _No Right of Set-off_. All payments to be made by any Party under this
Agreement shall be made free of any set-off and shall be promptly remitted to
the Party entitled to receive payments hereunder.

(e) _No Implied Assignments or Licenses_. Nothing in this Agreement is to be
construed as an assignment or grant of any right, title or interest in any
Intellectual Property.

(f) _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise, by either Party without the prior
written consent of the other Party, and any such assignment without such prior
written consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
assignment shall limit the assignors obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns.

 

(g) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as expressly provided in _Sections 2_
, _8_ , and _14_ , nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to or shall confer upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns any rights, remedies or liabilities under or
by reason of this Agreement.

 

(h) _Limitation on Actions_. Any action, claim, suit, litigation or other
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement must be commenced

including any extensions thereof, or (ii) the termination of this Agreement.

 



E-17  (i) _No Waiver by Conduct; Waiver_. Except where a specific period for action
or inaction is provided herein, neither the failure nor any delay on the part
of any Party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege under this
Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part
of any Party hereto of any such right, power or privilege, nor any single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or
privilege. The failure of a Party hereto to exercise any right conferred
herein within the time required shall cause such right to terminate with
respect to the transaction or circumstances giving rise to such right, but not
to any such right arising as a result of any other transactions or
circumstances.

(j) _Cumulative Remedies_. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this
Agreement, all rights and remedies of either party hereto are cumulative of
each other and of every other right or remedy such party may otherwise have at
law or in equity, and the exercise of one or more rights or remedies shall not
prejudice or impair the concurrent or subsequent exercise of other rights or
remedies.

(k) _Governing Law_. This Agreement (and any claim or controversy arising out
of or relating to this Agreement) shall be governed by the laws of the State
of Delaware without regard to conflict of law principles that would result in
the application of any Law other than the laws of the State of Delaware.

(l) _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY

OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 17(l)_.

 

(m) _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each Party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware),
in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each
Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any
such action or proceeding except in such courts; (ii) agrees that any claim in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or any state appellate court
therefrom; (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively
do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware Chancery or state
appellate court;

 



E-18   and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such
Delaware Chancery or state appellate court. Each Party agrees that (i) this
Agreement involves at least $100,000.00 and (ii) this Agreement has been
entered into by the parties hereto in express reliance upon 6 Del. C. § 2708\.
Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in this
Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party hereto
to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

(n) _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and
this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction
as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any
provision had never been contained herein.

(o) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts
(including by facsimile, . _pdf_ or email), each of which when executed shall
be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.

(p) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Purchase Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) constitute
the entire agreement between the Parties hereto and supersede all other prior
covenants, agreements, undertakings, obligations, promises, arrangements,
communications, representations and warranties, whether oral or written, by
any Party hereto or by any director, officer, employee, agent, Affiliate or
Representative of any Party hereto.

(q) _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties hereto. No amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless
executed in writing by the Party to be bound thereby.

be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have
been duly given when received if personally delivered; when transmitted if

given such terms in _Section 1_ below.

 

BACKGROUND

the pressure sensitive label stock products subject to this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, Customer has acquired the office and consumer products business from
Affiliates of Supplier (the "Acquired Business") pursuant to a Purchase
Agreement, dated December 21, 2011 (the "Purchase Agreement"), and desires to
purchase from Supplier, and Supplier is willing to manufacture and sell to
Customer, the Products; and

WHEREAS, the Parties deem it desirable to establish the terms and conditions
that shall govern the sale by Supplier and the purchase by Customer of such
Products.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises

end-users; provided, that for the avoidance of doubt, the "OCP Field" shall
exclude the conduct by Avery Dennison Corporation through certain of its
Subsidiaries and divisions of the development, manufacture, supply,
distribution, marketing and sales of industrial adhesive products (commercial
and industrial products incorporating adhesives such as pressure-sensitive
laminates, industrial adhesives, or labels other than labels sold or

   2. | PRODUCTS 
---|--- 

2.1 Purchase and Sale of Products. From time to time during the term of this
Agreement, Customer shall purchase from Supplier and Supplier shall supply to
Customer the Products pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
The scope of this 

 



F-4   Agreement is limited to pressure sensitive label stock Products that
Customer uses to produce products for the Acquired Business. For the avoidance
of doubt, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing on a Product by
Product basis, this Agreement does not apply to pressure sensitive label stock
products (i) that are used to produce other products of Customer or its
Affiliates (including labels and other printable media sold under Customers
or its Affiliates trademarks or names that were not part of the Acquired
Business) and (ii) that use or incorporate Customers or its Affiliates
intellectual property that was not part of the Acquired Business
(collectively, "Excluded Products"); provided that nothing in this sentence
limits _Section 2.2(f)_ or Customers rights thereunder. The Existing
Products constitute all of the pressure sensitive label stock products sold
by Supplier to the Avery Dennison Office and Consumer Products Group as of the
date of the Purchase Agreement and as of the Effective Date, and the Parties
will update _Exhibit A_ by mutual agreement as necessary to reflect
any changes to the Existing Products and Exclusive Components that occur
prior to or after the Effective Date. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event
will _Exhibit A_ be updated or modified so that the status of an Existing
Exclusive Product, Other Existing Product or Exclusive Component is changed
without the prior written consent of Customer.

(a) Subject to  _Section 3.2_, during the Initial Term, Customer shall
purchase from Supplier not less than the following amounts of Products,
cumulatively and in any assortment, for each of the indicated Contract Years:
(i) sixty million dollars ($60,000,000) for the first Contract Year; (ii) one
hundred and twenty million dollars ($120,000,000), cumulative with purchases
in the first Contract Year, for the second Contract Year; and (iii) one
hundred and eighty million dollars ($180,000,000), cumulative with purchases
in the first and second Contract Years, for the third Contract Year (each such
cumulative amount during the Initial Term, the "Minimum Purchase Amount"). If
Customer does not purchase at least the applicable Minimum Purchase Amount by
the last day of each applicable Contract Year, Customer shall pay to Supplier
not later than thirty (30) days after the end of the applicable Contract Year
the amount equal to (A) (1) the Minimum Purchase Amount applicable to such
Contract Year minus (2) the amount of Products purchased by Customer from
Supplier for the applicable Contract Year(s) included in calculating such
Minimum Purchase Amount, multiplied by (B) 0.25 (such amount, the "Minimum
Payment"); provided that, if Customer makes a Minimum Payment, Customer shall
be deemed to have purchased Products in the amount of the Minimum Purchase
Amount applicable to such Contract Year for the purpose of calculating future
Minimum Purchase Amounts. A "purchase" shall be deemed to occur on the
shipment date for the applicable Products. Any purchases of Substitute
Products made from third parties as permitted by this Agreement in _Section
3.2_ only may be applied by Customer against the Minimum Purchase Amount upon
reasonable written proof submitted by Customer to Supplier. There shall be no
Minimum Purchase Amount for the Renewal Terms.

(b) Supplier shall not, without Customers prior written consent, modify any
Product, whether Existing Product or Replacement Product, to contain any
intellectual property owned by Supplier or any Affiliate thereof not
previously contained in that Product as originally supplied to Customer;
provided, however, that Customer shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or
condition its consent in the event that such a modification is necessary or
commercially reasonable in order to comply with applicable law, resolve a
Product defect or cause a Product that is infringing intellectual
property rights to no longer be infringing.

 



F-5  2.2 Exclusivity for Products Sold to Customer.

 

(a) Provided that Customer has purchased the Minimum Purchase Amount or timely
paid any difference owing as provided in  _Section 2.1(a)_, during the
Initial Term, (i) the Existing Exclusive Products and any subsequent
Replacement Products for those Products, and any Exclusive Components and any
subsequent Replacement Components, shall be supplied exclusively to Customer,
(ii) the Other Existing Products and any subsequent Replacement Products for
those Products shall be supplied exclusively to Customer for the OCP Field,
and (iii) other pressure sensitive constructions, sold by Supplier or its
Affiliates, convertible into labels (other than the Existing Exclusive
Products and any subsequent Replacement Products for those Products and the
Other Existing Products and any subsequent Replacement Products for those
Products), if sold into the OCP Field, shall be sold exclusively to Customer.
For the avoidance of doubt, Supplier may supply the Other Existing Products
and any subsequent Replacement Products for those Products and other pressure
sensitive constructions convertible into labels (other than the Existing
Exclusive Products and any subsequent Replacement Products for those Products)
to anyone other than Customer, for use outside the OCP Field, subject to
_Section 2.2(f)_.

 

(b) During each Renewal Term, (i) the Existing Exclusive Products and any
subsequent Replacement Products for those Products, and any Exclusive
Components and subsequent Replacement Components, shall be supplied
exclusively to Customer for the OCP Field, and (ii) other pressure sensitive
constructions, sold by Supplier or its Affiliates, convertible into labels
(other than the Existing Exclusive Products and any subsequent Replacement
Products for those Products and the Other Existing Products and any subsequent
Replacement Products for those Products), if sold into the OCP Field, shall be
sold exclusively to Customer. The exclusivity during the Renewal Term shall
be limited to the OCP Field and Supplier may supply Existing Exclusive
Products and any subsequent Replacement Products for those Products or any
Exclusive Components and subsequent Replacement Components and other pressure
sensitive constructions convertible into labels to anyone other than Customer
for use outside the OCP Field, subject to _Section 2.2(f)_.

 

(c) After the Initial Term, the Other Existing Products and any subsequent
Replacement Products for those Products shall be supplied on a non-exclusive
basis to Customer.

(d) Suppliers exclusivity obligations shall apply worldwide. For the
avoidance of doubt, the exclusivity applies to the pressure sensitive laminate
construction as a whole, and not the individual components such as the
adhesive, face stock and liner other than the components expressly designated
as Exclusive Components on _Exhibit A_.

(e) In the event that Customer fails to purchase the Minimum Purchase Amount
for any Contract Year during the Initial Term or pay Supplier the Minimum
Payment within the time specified in Section 2.1(a), Supplier shall have the
right to terminate Customers exclusivity with respect to the Exclusive
Products and other pressure sensitive

 



F-6   constructions convertible into labels upon not less than thirty (30) days
written notice to Customer after Customer has failed to purchase the Minimum
Purchase Amount or pay Supplier the Minimum Payment within the periods
specified in this sentence; provided that Customer may cure the failure to pay
Supplier the Minimum Payment during such thirty (30) day period.

 

(f) Should Supplier become aware of any sales of Products or Exclusive
Components made by an Affiliate, converter or customer for sale or
distribution in the OCP Channels, it shall immediately cease the sale of such
Product or Exclusive Components to that Affiliate, converter or other
customer, and immediately (except to the extent that applicable law requires a
period of notice prior to termination) inform such Affiliate, converter or
other customer that it must immediately cease the manufacture, conversion,
distribution, marketing and sale of such Products or Exclusive Components for
sale or distribution in the OCP Channels. Also, should Supplier become aware
of any sales of New Products or other pressure sensitive constructions, sold
by Supplier or its Affiliates, convertible into labels (other than the
Existing Exclusive Products and any subsequent Replacement Products for those
Products) made by an Affiliate, converter or customer for sale or distribution
into the OCP Field, it shall immediately cease the sale of such New Products
and such other pressure sensitive constructions convertible into labels
(other than the Existing Exclusive Products and any subsequent Replacement
Products for those Products) to that Affiliate, converter or other customer,
and immediately (except to the extent that applicable law requires a period of
notice prior to termination) inform such Affiliate, converter or other
customer that it must immediately cease the manufacture, conversion,
distribution, marketing and sale of such New Products and such other pressure
sensitive constructions convertible into labels (other than the Existing
Exclusive Products and any subsequent Replacement Products for those Products)
for sale or distribution into the OCP Field. Supplier shall also immediately
advise Customer of any such sales described in this  _Section 2.2(f)_ and
take such other commercially reasonable steps as Customer may request or
require to implement the intent of this Agreement. If this Agreement
terminates at the end of the Initial Term, and provided that Customer
has purchased the Minimum Purchase Amount or timely paid any difference owing
as provided in _Section 2.1(a)_, Sellers obligation in _Section 2.2(f)_ of
this Agreement continues for a period of two (2) years after the Initial
Term, but only for Existing Exclusive Products (including Replacement Products
for Existing Exclusive Products), Exclusive Components (including Replacement
Components for Exclusive Components), New Products (including Replacement
Products for New Products) and other pressure sensitive constructions
convertible into labels. If this Agreement terminates at the end of the first
Renewal Term, and provided that Customer has purchased the Minimum Purchase
Amount or timely paid any difference owing as provided in _Section 2.1(a)_,
Sellers obligation in _Section 2.2(f)_ of this Agreement continues for a
period of one (1) year after the first Renewal Term, but only for Existing
Exclusive Products (including Replacement Products for Existing Exclusive
Products), Exclusive Components (including Replacement Components for
Exclusive Components), New Products (including Replacement Products for New
Products) and other pressure sensitive constructions convertible into labels.

 



F-7  2.3 Grant of Intellectual Property Rights. During the Term of this
Agreement, Customer hereby grants to Supplier and its Affiliates a non-
exclusive, world wide, royalty free right and license under any intellectual
property owned by Customer that was part of the Acquired Business solely for
the purposes of manufacturing and selling the Products to Customer and its
Affiliates under this Agreement. Customer also covenants, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, not to bring any action or other proceeding for
infringement or other violation of any intellectual property owned by
Customer with respect to any Products manufactured and sold by Supplier or its
Affiliates to Customer or its Affiliates during the Term of this Agreement.
For an abundance of clarity, the foregoing sentence does not apply to
manufacture or sale by Supplier of any Products for or to any third party.

2.4 Engineering Change. "Engineering Change" is a material or process change
that affects a Products safety, performance, cost, reliability or appearance.
Unless the Product Specifications for a Product provide a more stringent
communication process, either Party may request an Engineering Change, but it
will occur only if the Parties agree in writing as to any resulting Product
Specification changes, cost savings or other outcomes, such agreement not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. 

2.5 New Products. New Products shall not be "Products" for the purposes of
this Agreement. In the event that Supplier desires to supply a New Product to
Customer, and Customer desires to purchase a New Product from Supplier, then
the Parties shall enter into a separate agreement with respect to the
development and/or purchase and sale of such New Products. Neither Party has
any obligation to bring a New Product to the other Party for its
consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the Term, provided that
Customer has purchased the Minimum Purchase Amount or timely paid any
difference owing as provided in _Section 2.1(a)_, Supplier agrees that it
will not sell or distribute any New Products (including Replacement Products
for New Products) into the OCP Field to anyone other than Customer.

 



   3. | FORECASTS AND PURCHASE ORDERS 
---|--- 

3.1 Forecasts. An initial twelve (12) month forecast ("Forecast") of the
amount of each Product that Customer will require in each month of such
12-month period is attached hereto as _Exhibit D-1_. The Forecast shall be by
region (e.g. North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America), as specified by
Supplier (each a "Region"). The Forecast shall be updated by Customer on a
rolling quarterly basis, not less than 30 days prior to the commencement of
each calendar quarter. Customer will use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide accurate and consistent updated Forecasts for each Product per Region.
The Parties agree that Forecasts for Products other than the Exclusive
Products are provided for convenience and planning purposes only, and shall
not be binding upon either Party. With respect to the Exclusive Products,
Customer shall be required to purchase at least the quantity of Products for
each month specified in the Forecast that was delivered in the quarter
immediately preceding such month. Attached as _Exhibit D-1_ is a listing of
the amount of Products produced by Supplier for the Acquired Business in 2010
and 2011 (year to date). During the Initial Term, Supplier agrees to provide
Customer with monthly written reports on the inventory of materials on-hand
related to Exclusive Products.

 



F-8  3.2 Capacity Commitment; Service Level Agreement; Failure to Supply.
Supplier covenants and warrants that during the Initial Term it will have the
capacity to deliver to Customer at least the quantity of Products indicated in
_Exhibit D-2_ during each calendar year of the Initial Term (the
"Capacity Commitment"). Supplier agrees that during the Term it will meet the
service levels set forth in _Exhibit D-3_ during each calendar year of the
Term (the "Service Level Commitment"). If Supplier fails to meet the Capacity
Commitment or the Service Level Commitment, fails to supply for a Force
Majeure Event, or refuses to supply Products (including a Willful Refusal to
Supply), and does not cure such failure within thirty (30) days for a
Capacity Commitment or Service Level Commitment failure, or within ten (10)
business days for a Force Majeure Event or refusal to supply Products
(including a Willful Refusal to Supply), Customer shall have the right, in
addition to any other remedies permitted by this Agreement, to purchase
substitute products that are substantially similar to the Products from third
parties on a commercially reasonable basis ("Substitute Products"), but for
not longer than one hundred and twenty (120) days after such failure, Force
Majeure Event or refusal to supply (other than a Willful Refusal to Supply) is
cured or for such shorter period as termination is permitted in any
commercially reasonable contract for Substitute Products entered into by
Customer during such failure, Force Majeure Event or refusal to supply (other
than a Willful Refusal to Supply); provided that in the event of a Willful
Refusal of Supply, in addition to any other remedies Customer may have under
this Agreement, Customer has no obligation to purchase the Products subject to
such Willful Refusal to Supply from Supplier after such refusal is cured.

3.3 Purchase Orders. All Purchase Orders must be in writing and in the form
mutually agreed to from time to time by Supplier and Customer. Purchase Orders
shall be sent by facsimile or by email designated by Region from time to time
by written notice from Supplier to Customer. Each Purchase Order shall include
(i) a description of each type of Product ordered (Product Specification,
width and length), (ii) the quantity ordered, (iii) the applicable unit price
for such Products, (iv) the delivery date, and (v) point of delivery.

3.4 Acceptance. All Purchase Orders are subject to acceptance by Supplier.
Supplier is deemed to have accepted any: (a) Purchase Order within the
Capacity Commitment or current Forecast; and (b) other Purchase Order in
excess of the Capacity Commitment or Forecast, unless Supplier cannot meet
that Purchase Orders terms and Supplier rightfully rejects that Purchase
Order in writing within three (3) business days after the receipt of the
Purchase Order. Supplier shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet
all Purchase Orders that are in excess of the Forecast and Capacity
Commitment, but if Supplier cannot meet such Purchase Orders under clause (b)
of this Section, Customer may purchase Substitute Products from third parties
with respect to such Purchase Orders. The purchase of Substitute Products
under this _Section 3.4_ shall not be deducted or otherwise applied against
the Minimum Purchase Amount. If Customer submits a Purchase Order for a
quantity of Products that substantially exceeds the greater of the Capacity
Commitment or Forecast and Customer does not purchase Substitute Products from
third parties, the Parties will mutually agree to a reasonable delivery date
for such excess Products.

3.5 Cancellation. Purchase Orders, once accepted by Supplier, cannot be
cancelled except as expressly provided in this _Section 3.5_. Stock orders
can be cancelled at

 



F-9   any time prior to slitting. Custom orders can be cancelled before coating at
Suppliers reasonable discretion. Supplier will generally agree to
cancellation in situations where Seller has not incurred costs for materials
purchased, or performed any value added work and/or reserved any capacity or
if Customer agrees to terms that will fully compensate Supplier for costs
incurred prior to the cancellation.

 

3.6 Conflicting Terms. If any Purchase Order, acknowledgement, quotation or
other purchasing document issued by either Party includes terms or conditions
that are inconsistent with or conflict with any terms or conditions set forth
in this Agreement (including the Exhibits to this Agreement) or the applicable
Product Description Form, the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement and the applicable Product Description Form shall control, unless an
authorized officer of each Party has expressly agreed in a separate writing to
such inconsistent and/or conflicting terms.

 



   4. | DELIVERY 
---|--- 

4.1 Shipment. Supplier reserves the right to specify the routing of
shipments. Supplier shall ship within the time specified on the Purchase
Order, if within the Lead Times indicated in _Exhibit D-3_ , and if not,
within a reasonable period of time. Unless specified in the Purchase Order,
freight charges shall be prepaid and billed. If Customer specifies a carrier
that is not a Supplier-approved carrier, the shipment will be made on a
"Freight Collect" basis.

 

4.2 Title and Risk of Loss. Title and risk of loss for all Products shall pass
to Customer upon delivery by Supplier to a common carrier at Suppliers
shipping dock, regardless of freight terms or method of payment for
transportation charges. Customer is responsible for filing all loss or damage
claims with the carrier. Supplier is not responsible for any damage
or shortage on collect shipment.

4.3 Claims. All claims relating to delivery shall be sent to Suppliers
designated claim representative and must be accompanied by: (i) a copy of
freight bill with notation of damage or shortage, the date and time of
receipt, and the name of receiver, (ii) a photograph of the damaged goods and
(iii) a copy of the inspection report. Customer should retain a copy of the
claim for its files.

4.4 Returns. All Products are returnable only in accordance with the warranty
provisions in _Section 6.1_. Before returning any Product, Customer must
obtain prior written approval and instructions from Supplier. Suppliers
approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned.

4.5 Imports to United States. If any Products will be shipped from another
country into the United States, Supplier must secure its facilities and all
of its shipments made to Customer and Customer designated sites in accordance
with then-current U.S. Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism ("C-TPAT")
security guidelines. If Customer is the importer of record for specific
shipments, Supplier must provide Customer and must ensure that its logistics
providers also provide Customer all necessary shipping data to satisfy
security, notification and other regulatory requirements applicable at the
time of delivery,

 



F-10   including the U.S. Importer Security Filing ("ISF") requirements. This
shipping data must be provided to Customer in sufficient time before Products
are delivered to the carrier to complete the applicable requirements and in
the case of ocean freight no less than three business days prior to delivery
of Products to the carrier. Current C-TPAT and ISF requirements can be found
on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website ( _www.cbp.gov_ ).



   5. | PRICES AND PAYMENT 
---|--- 
 

5.1 Prices. The initial prices for Existing Products shall be as set forth in
_Exhibit A_, as such Exhibit is updated on the Effective Date to reflect the
prices in effect on the Effective Date (such prices to be adjusted between the
signing of the Purchase Agreement and the Effective Date in accordance with
_Section 5.3_). Subject to  _Section 5.4_, the initial prices for
Replacement Products shall be as specified in the applicable Product
Description Form. Prices in the U.S. are F.O.B. Suppliers plant or
distribution center of origin, no freight allowed, and FCA (Incoterms 2010)
Suppliers plant or distribution center of origin for international orders.
Freight rates are based on actual incurred freight costs or Customers
specific schedule. Prices shall be those in effect on the "Ship Date" noted
on the face of the Purchase Order. Purchase Orders calling for future delivery
shall be billed at prices in effect on the shipping date. Stock and custom
orders can be combined to achieve lower freight rates when possible.
Unless stated otherwise on Suppliers price list or the applicable Product
Description Forms, different Products on an order may not be combined to
obtain quantity pricing.

5.2 Invoices. Supplier shall include an invoice with each shipment of Products
delivered to Customer hereunder. Each invoice will include: (i) the applicable
order number; (ii) a description of the delivered Products; (iii) unit prices
for each delivered Product; and (iv) total invoice price. Invoices will be
denominated in the currency designated by Suppliers selling entity providing
the Product.

 

5.3 Adjustment of Prices. Prices for Products will be firm for six (6) months
from the Effective Date. Thereafter, prices for all Products will be
adjusted, up or down, in an amount equal to changes to Suppliers costs for
materials; provided, however (i) prices will only be adjusted if the change to
materials costs is greater than two and one-half percent (2.5%) and (ii) only
one such adjustment may be made in any six (6) month period. Price adjustments
will take effect thirty (30) days after written notice to Customer of such
adjustments. Supplier shall provide Customer with reasonably detailed
information supporting any price adjustment. If Customer is not satisfied with
the information provided by Supplier, Customer shall have the right to have an
independent third party public accounting firm selected by Customer audit the
proposed price adjustment. The price adjustment will be modified as determined
by the independent third party public accounting firm retroactive to the date
such price adjustment took effect. Customer or Supplier, as applicable, will
pay to the other Party the difference between the original price adjustment
and the modified price adjustment for all purchases of Products made between
the date the price adjustment first became effective and the date the price
adjustment is modified, within ten (10) business days after the date the
price adjustment is modified. The audit will be

 



F-11   conducted at Customers sole expense, except that if the price adjustment is
modified by ten percent (10%) or more after such audit, Supplier shall pay the
costs of such audit within ten (10) business days after such price adjustment
is made. The modification to any price adjustment will be calculated as
follows: (a) (i) the percentage price adjustment proposed by Supplier, minus
(ii) the amount of the percentage price adjustment calculated after the audit
is completed, divided by (b) the percentage price adjustment proposed by
Supplier. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will price adjustments be
greater than the average price change to Suppliers other customers for
similar products. Prices for Products delivered in the United States or
Eurozone will be set in U.S. Dollars and Euros, respectively. Prices for
Products delivered in South America and Australia will be set in U.S. Dollars
and will be adjusted quarterly for currency fluctuations. Disputes regarding
price changes will be resolved through binding arbitration as provided in
_Section 10.2_ below.

 

5.4 Prices for Replacement Products. Replacement Products shall be priced the
same as the price for the Existing Product being replaced unless an increase
(a) can be reasonably justified by Supplier based on material differences in
component raw material costs, (b) is substantiated by Supplier in writing and
(c) is mutually agreed to in writing by the Parties. Disputes regarding
Replacement Product pricing will be resolved through binding arbitration as
provided in _Section 10.2_.

5.5 Payment Terms. Customer shall pay all invoices within thirty (30) days
after acceptance of the applicable Products by Customer. Invoices paid within
ten (10) days of invoice are subject to a one percent (1%) discount. Amounts
shall be paid in full, without deduction or offset, other than for credits or
adjustments in favor of Customer that are expressly stated in writing on
Suppliers invoice or credit memo. All payments for Products shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account as specified by
Supplier in writing from time to time.

5.6 Taxes. The amount of any present or future federal, state, local or other
tax applicable to the sale of Products hereunder shall be added to the price
and paid by Customer unless Customer provides Supplier with a valid exemption
certificate acceptable to Supplier and the appropriate taxing authority.

5.7 Invoice Disputes. If Customer reasonably and in good faith disputes any
amount due under an invoice provided by Supplier, Customer shall notify
Supplier in writing of the basis of such dispute and shall pay any amount not
in dispute. Pending resolution of the dispute between the Parties, the time
for payment of the disputed amount shall be extended, and Supplier shall
continue performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

 



   6. | WARRANTIES 
---|--- 

6.1 Product Warranty. Supplier expressly warrants to Customer that the
Products supplied under this Agreement will: (a) be free from any encumbrance;
(b) be free from any defect in materials, manufacture and workmanship; (c)
conform to the Product Specifications including any intended use expressly
stated in any Product Specifications; (d) not infringe any intellectual
property rights of any third party; and (e) be fit for use as consumer label
products in the OCP Field. In addition to any other remedies expressly

 



F-12   available to Customer under this Agreement, Customer may return any Product
not meeting Suppliers warranties. Supplier will, at Customers option, either
replace the affected Product without charge, or reimburse Customer the
applicable price for that Product plus any materials provided by Customer to
Supplier at the delivered cost. Customers acceptance of delivery, inspection,
or payment for any Product does not waive any right to bring a claim under
the Supplier warranties. Supplier will reasonably assist Customer in
investigation of, and corrective action for, Product complaints by Customers
customers. No representative or agent of Supplier is authorized to give any
guarantee or warranty or make any representation contrary to the warranties
above. No waiver, alteration, addition or modification of the foregoing
warranties or conditions shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by
an officer of Supplier.

6.2 No Conflict. Each Party warrants that it has no third party obligations
that will conflict in any way with its obligations under this Agreement.

6.3 Disclaimer. THE WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH ABOVE ARE IN LIEU OF
ANY OTHER WARRANTIES OF SUPPLIER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND/OR FITNESS FOR ANY
PARTICULAR USE. SUPPLIER SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS AND EXCLUDES ALL OTHER SUCH
WARRANTIES.

 



   7. | INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 
---|--- 

7.1 Indemnification by Supplier. Supplier shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Customer and its Affiliates and each of their respective directors,
officers, employees and agents from and against any and all third party
Damages arising out of or relating to: (i) any damage to property, injury to
person, or death resulting from a defect in materials, manufacture and
workmanship of a Product, from a Products failure to conform to the Product
Specifications, including any intended use expressly stated in any Product
Specifications, or from a Products failure to be fit for use as a consumer
label product in the OCP Field, in each case with respect to
Products supplied under this Agreement; (ii) any intentional misconduct,
fraud or gross negligence committed by Supplier or its employees or agents in
the course of performing its obligations under this Agreement; (iii) any
violation of applicable laws or regulations by Supplier after the Effective
Date; (iv) any breach by Supplier of _Section 2.2_: (v) any refusal to supply
(other than any refusal to supply for or as a result of a Force Majeure Event,
pursuant to  _Section 3.4(b)_ with respect to the amount of any Purchase
Orders that is in excess of the applicable Capacity Commitment or Forecast or
Suppliers inability to supply due to applicable law after Supplier shall have
made commercially reasonable attempts to comply with such law); or (vi) any
breach of its representations, warranties or covenants provided in this
Agreement. Supplier shall also indemnify, defend and hold harmless Customer
and its Affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents from and against any and all third party Damages arising
out of or relating to the fact that the manufacture, use, sale, offer to sell
or importation of Products supplied under this Agreement infringes on any
patent, copyright or other intellectual property right of a third party;
provided, however, this indemnity shall not apply to the extent such
infringement is caused by any changes or modifications made to the 

 



F-13   Product by Customer after it has been supplied by Supplier or the
combination by Customer of the Product after it has been supplied by Supplier
with other components where the Product alone would not be infringing. In the
event that a Product by virtue of its manufacture, use or sale is determined
to be infringing, Suppliers sole responsibility to Customer, in addition to
any indemnification obligation and obligations under  _Section 6.1_, and at
Suppliers option, shall be to (1) obtain for Customer the right to use the
infringing Product, (2) replace the infringing Product with a non-infringing
alternative, or (3) modify the infringing Product so that it becomes non-
infringing. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 7.1_ is
intended to limit any claims that may be made by Customer against Supplier
other than with respect to third party claims, actions or proceedings.

7.2 Indemnification by Customer. Customer shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Supplier and its Affiliates and each of their respective directors,
officers, employees and agents from and against any and all third party
Damages arising out of or relating to: (i) any damage to property, injury to
person, or death resulting from a defect in the conversion of a Product
supplied under this Agreement; (ii) any intentional misconduct, fraud or gross
negligence committed by Customer or its employees or agents in the course of
performing its obligations under this Agreement; (iii) any violation of
applicable laws or regulations by Customer after the Effective Date; or (iv)
any breach by Customer of any of its representations, warranties, or covenants
provided in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
_Section 7.2_ is intended to limit any claims that may be made by Supplier
against Customer other than with respect to third party claims, actions or
proceedings.

 

7.3 Indemnification Process. The Party seeking indemnification under this
_Section 7_ (the "Indemnified Party") shall provide prompt written notice of
such claim to the other Party (the "Indemnifying Party"), describing the
claim, the amount thereof (if known) and the alleged basis thereof. For the
avoidance of doubt, the failure of the Indemnified Party to provide such
notice shall not affect the indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying
Party, unless and to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced
by such failure. Subject to the remaining provisions of this _Section 7.3_,
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense
and/or settlement of any such claim and shall be obligated to pay the
reasonable costs of defense of any such claim (such costs, the "Defense
Costs"). The Indemnifying Party acknowledges and agrees that the Indemnified
Party has the right to participate, at its own expense, in the defense of any
claim for which the Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification under this
_Section 7_. The Indemnifying Party may not settle, compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment in any such claim without the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent: (i)
includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability

8.1 Term. The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective
Date and continue for a period of three (3) years (the "Initial Term"),
unless sooner terminated as provided in this _Section 8_. Thereafter,
provided that Customer is not then in breach of this Agreement and has
purchased the Minimum Purchase Amount or timely paid any difference owing as
provided in _Section 2.1(a)_, the Agreement will be extended for successive
periods of one (1) Contract Year (each a "Renewal Term") for two (2) Contract
Years after the Initial Term, unless Customer provides written notice to
Supplier that it desires to terminate the Agreement no later than ninety (90)
days prior to the end of the Initial Term or the then-current Renewal Term.
The Initial Term together with all Renewal Terms are referred to herein as
the "Term".

8.2 Termination by Mutual Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated by the
mutual written agreement of the Parties.

8.3 Termination for Cause. Either Party may terminate this Agreement
effective immediately upon providing written notice of termination to the
other Party, if such other Party fails to cure any material breach of this
Agreement within ninety (90) days after receiving written notice of such
breach. In addition, Supplier may terminate this Agreement effective
immediately upon providing written notice of termination to Customer, if
Customer fails to pay any amount when due that is not being disputed in good
faith and that is not cured within twenty-one (21) days after receiving
written notice of such breach

8.4 Effect Upon Termination. Upon the expiration or termination of this
Agreement for any reason: (i) during the Initial Term, Customer shall purchase
sufficient Products to consume all raw materials used exclusively to
manufacture the Exclusive Products then held in inventory by Supplier or that
are subject to non-cancellable Purchase Orders, consistent with the Forecast
and with commercially reasonable ordering practices; (ii) Supplier shall
continue production and delivery of all Products in accordance with
all Purchase Orders accepted by Supplier prior to the effective date of such

Orders in whole or in part; and (iii) each Party shall return all Confidential
Information of the other Party as provided in _Section 9.4_ below. Any

reasonably should survive any termination of this Agreement shall be deemed
to survive, including _Sections 1_ , _6_ , _7_ , _8.4_ , _9_ , and _10_.



   9. | CONFIDENTIALITY 
---|--- 

9.1 Confidentiality Obligations. The Parties expect to exchange Confidential
Information in the course of performing their respective obligations under
this Agreement. All Confidential Information shall remain the property of the
applicable Disclosing Party.

 



F-16   The Receiving Party shall hold all Confidential Information of the
Disclosing Party in strict trust and confidence, and shall not disclose such
Confidential Information other than to its employees and agents who need to
know such Confidential Information solely for the purpose of performing the
Receiving Partys obligations under this Agreement and who are bound by
confidentiality agreements with respect to such Confidential Information that
are no less restrictive than the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement.
The Receiving Party shall not use the Confidential Information in any manner
or for any purpose, other than in connection with the performance of
its obligations under this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Receiving Party shall protect the Confidential Information of the Disclosing
Party from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner as the
Receiving Party protects its own Confidential Information of a similar
nature, and in any event, with no less than reasonable care taking into
account the nature of the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall
notify the Disclosing Party in writing promptly upon becoming aware of any
unauthorized use or disclosure of any Confidential Information of the
Disclosing Party.

9.2 Exceptions. The confidentiality obligations set forth in _Section 9.1_
above shall not apply to any information that: (i) is lawfully in the
possession of the Receiving Party without restriction on disclosure at the
time of the Disclosing Partys first disclosure to the Receiving Party (as
evidenced by written records); provided that this clause (i) shall not limit
(A) Suppliers obligations with respect to Confidential Information of
Customer that was in Suppliers possession or known to Suppliers employees
or contractors prior to the Effective Date that relates exclusively to the
Acquired Business or (B) Customers obligations with respect to Confidential
Information of Supplier and its Affiliates that was in Customers possession
or known to Customers employees or contractors prior to the Effective Date
that relates exclusively to businesses of Supplier and its Affiliates other
than the Acquired Business; (ii) is disclosed to the Receiving Party by a
third party who had the right to make such disclosure to the Receiving Party
free of any confidentiality obligations; (iii) is independently developed by
the Receiving Party without reference to or use of the Disclosing Partys
Confidential Information (as evidenced by written records); or (iv) is, or
through no fault of the Receiving Party has become, generally available to the
public. In addition, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential
Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent that such disclosure is
required by law, a court order, or a governmental agency with jurisdiction,
provided that before making such a required disclosure the Receiving Party
notifies the Disclosing Party in writing of such required disclosure as soon
as is reasonably practicable after receiving notice of any such required
disclosure, takes commercially reasonable actions to assure the
confidential handling of the Disclosing Partys Confidential Information,
including, to the extent permissible and practicable, affording the Disclosing
Party a reasonable period of time to seek a protective order prohibiting the
disclosure of the Disclosing Partys Confidential Information, if allowed by
applicable law and cooperates with the Disclosing Party, at the Disclosing
Partys reasonable request and expense, in any lawful action to contest or
limit the scope of such required disclosure.

9.3 Disclosure Requirements. Prior to disclosing to the Receiving Party any
Confidential Information and/or providing any intellectual property owned by
the Disclosing Party or its Affiliates that could be used to develop or
improve any Products or any other

 



F-17   products or services, the Disclosing Party shall notify the Receiving Party
in writing of the nature of the information or intellectual property being
provided and that the Disclosing Party considers such information or
intellectual property to be confidential and proprietary. The Receiving Party
shall have the right to decline to receive any such information or
intellectual property.

 

9.4 Return of Confidential Information. Upon the expiration or termination of
this Agreement for any reason, or at any time upon the Disclosing Partys
request, the Receiving Party shall return to the Disclosing Party or destroy
all tangible copies of Confidential Information in the Receiving Partys
possession or control and will erase from its computer systems all electronic
copies thereof, except that the Receiving Partys legal counsel may retain one
copy of such Confidential Information for record purposes only.

9.5 Confidentiality of the Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, but not the existence of this
Agreement, are the Confidential Information of both Parties. Neither Party
shall disclose any terms or conditions of this Agreement to any third party
without the prior written consent of the other Party, except: (i) as required
by law or regulations; and (ii) to its attorneys, accountants, and other
professional advisors under a duty of confidentiality.



   10. | GENERAL 
---|--- 

10.1 Governing Law. This Agreement (and any claim or controversy arising out
of or relating to this Agreement) shall be governed by the laws of the State
of Delaware without regard to conflict of law principles that would result in
the application of any law other than the laws of the State of Delaware.

10.2 Dispute Resolution.

 

(a) In the event of a dispute, each Party will designate an officer to discuss
potential reconciliation of any disputes arising under this Agreement. Should
such discussion not resolve the disputes, either party may terminate such
discussion and the dispute will be resolved in accordance with this _Section
10.2_. All claims, grievances, demands, controversies, causes of action or
disputes of any nature whatsoever (including tort and contract claims, and
claims upon any law, statute, order, or regulation) arising out of, in
connection with, or in relation to (i) this Agreement, or (ii) questions of
arbitrability under this Agreement shall be exclusively resolved by binding
arbitration before a mutually agreeable independent third party arbitrator
(the "Arbitrator"). The arbitration shall be held in accordance with
the Expedited Procedures of the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA") then in effect (the "Rules"), except as
modified herein. If the Parties fail to agree on an Arbitrator within fifteen
(15) business days of receipt by either Party of a demand for arbitration, at
the request of either Party, the Arbitrator shall be appointed by the AAA as
provided in the Rules. Any time period contained herein or in the Rules may
be extended by mutual agreement of the Parties or by the Arbitrator for good
cause shown. Within forty five (45) days after his or her appointment, the
Arbitrator shall make a final written determination and award, upon such
remaining disputed items, and such determination and award shall be final,
conclusive and binding upon the Parties hereto, and may be entered and
enforced in any court having jurisdiction. All fees and disbursements of the
Arbitrator shall be paid one-half by each Party.

 



F-18  (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude a party from seeking injunctive
relief to prevent immediate and irreparable harm to that party.

(c) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law
for any breach, or threatened breach, of any of the provisions of this
Agreement, including _Section 2.2_, will be inadequate and, accordingly,
Supplier covenants and agrees that Customer shall, in addition to any
other rights and remedies which such party may have at law, be entitled to
equitable relief, including preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, and
to the remedy of specific performance with respect to any breach or threatened
breach of any such provision of this Agreement, as may be available from any
court of competent jurisdiction. Supplier hereby waives any requirement for
the securing or posting of a bond in connection with seeking any such
equitable relief. In addition, Supplier agrees that the terms of this
Agreement are fair and reasonable. In the event that any of the obligations
contained in this Agreement shall be determined by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, then any such
provisions shall not be deemed void, and the parties hereto agree that said
limits may be modified by the court and that said obligations contained in
this Agreement shall be amended in accordance with said modification, it being
specifically agreed by the Parties that it is their continuing desire that
the obligations be enforced to the fullest extent or if a court finds the
obligation unenforceable, the court should redefine the obligations so as to
provide the fullest extent of the obligations permitted under applicable law.

10.3 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES
AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS
LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS,
(B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C)
IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 10.3_.

 

10.4 Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be deemed to have defaulted under or
breached this Agreement for failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any
term of the Agreement (other than the payment of money) when such failure or
delay is caused by or

 



F-19   results from causes beyond the reasonable control of the affected Party,
including fire, storms, floods, earthquakes, natural disasters, embargoes,
war, acts of war (whether war be declared or not), acts of terrorism,
insurrections, riots, lockouts or other labor disturbances of third parties or
any regional or national labor disturbances, accidents, inability to obtain
transportation facilities, acts of God or unreasonable omissions or delays in
acting by any governmental authority (each a "Force Majeure Event"), provided,
however, that the Party affected by such Force Majeure Event uses diligent
efforts, under the circumstances, to notify the other Party in writing of the
circumstances causing the delay or non-performance and resumes performance as
soon as reasonably possible, and further provided, Customer shall have the
right to obtain Products from an alternative supplier pursuant to  _Section
3.2_, but only for so long after such Force Majeure Event is cured as is
specified in any commercially reasonable contract for such Products entered
into by Customer during such Force Majeure Event. A Force Majeure Event will
not include: (a) labor disputes of Supplier and its Affiliates, (b) non-
performance by Suppliers supplier, unless the goods or services were
unobtainable from another Customer-approved source at a reasonable cost, on
reasonable terms and in a reasonable time or (c) any delay preventable by
Supplier moving the affected Products to an alternate Supplier facility.
Supplier will use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Force
Majeure Event or any lockouts or other labor disturbances limited to Supplier
and its Affiliates as soon as is reasonably practicable.

10.5 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise, by either Party without the prior
written consent of the other Party, and any such assignment without such
prior written consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
assignment shall limit the assignors obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns.

 

10.6 Waiver. Except where a specific period for action or inaction is provided
herein, neither the failure nor any delay on the part of any Party hereto in
exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as
a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any Party hereto of any
such right, power or privilege, nor any single or partial exercise of any
such right, power or privilege, preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege. The failure of a
Party hereto to exercise any right conferred herein within the time
required shall cause such right to terminate with respect to the transaction
or circumstances giving rise to such right, but not to any such right arising
as a result of any other transactions or circumstances.

 

10.7 Independent Contractors. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to constitute a single employer, joint employer, co-employer, alter-
ego, agency, partnership, joint venture or similar relationship between either
Party or any of such Partys Affiliates, on the one hand, and the other Party
or any of the other Partys Affiliates, on the other hand. Each Party is
acting pursuant to this Agreement solely as an independent contractor.

 



F-20  10.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile, . _pdf_ or email), each of which when
executed shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

10.9 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and
this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction
as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any
provision had never been contained herein.

10.10 Notice. All notices and other communications which are required or may
be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have
been duly given when received if personally delivered; when transmitted if
transmitted by telecopy; the day after it is sent, if sent for next day
delivery to a domestic address by recognized overnight delivery service
(e.g., Federal Express); and five (5) business days after the date mailed by

provided by Supplier, and the Purchase Order provided by Customer (excluding

all other prior covenants, agreements, undertakings, obligations, promises,
arrangements, communications, representations and warranties, whether oral or
written, with respect to the subject matter hereof by any Party hereto or by
any director, officer, employee, agent, Affiliate or Representative of any
Party hereto. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement will amend
or modify the terms set forth in the non-competition provisions in _Section
9.4_ of the Purchase Agreement. Further for the avoidance of doubt, except
as expressly provided in _Section 2.3_, nothing in this Agreement grants to
Supplier or any of its Affiliates any license at any time to manufacture, use
or sell any products under any patents or patent applications assigned to
Customer under the Purchase Agreement or exclusively licensed to Customer
under the Cross-License Agreement between Customer and Supplier. This

10.12 No Presumption Against Drafting Party. Each of the Parties hereto
acknowledges that each Party to this Agreement has been represented by counsel
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would
require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against
the drafting Party has no application and is expressly waived. 

10.13 Interpretation. The titles, captions or headings of the Sections herein
are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a
part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Any
capitalized terms used in any Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein shall
have the meaning as defined in this Agreement. All 

 



F-22   Exhibits annexed hereto or referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and
made a part of this Agreement as if set forth herein. All references to
dollars in this Agreement shall be deemed to refer to such amounts in United
States Dollars and all references to days or months shall be deemed references
to calendar days or months. Unless the context otherwise requires, any
reference to a "Section," "Exhibit," or "Schedule" shall be deemed to refer
to a section of this Agreement, exhibit to this Agreement or a schedule to
this Agreement, as applicable. Any reference to any federal, state,
provincial, county, local or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. For all purposes of and under this Agreement, (i) the word
"including" shall be deemed to be immediately followed by the words "without
limitation"; (ii) words (including defined terms) in the singular shall be
deemed to include the plural and vice versa; (iii) words of one gender shall
be deemed to include the other gender as the context requires; (iv) "or" is

otherwise specified.

10.14 Supply Chain Requirements. Customer is subject to U.S. and international
laws and participates in government programs that affect its supply chains.
The supply chain requirements resulting from those laws and programs are
described in _Exhibit E_. Supplier will comply with _Exhibit E_. During the
Term, Customer or its agents may enter all Supplier facilities manufacturing
Products to audit Suppliers compliance with this Agreement including
_Exhibit E_ , provided that Customers representatives and agents enter into
confidentiality agreements reasonably acceptable to Supplier and strictly
limit the scope of their inspection to those matters necessary to confirm
compliance. Supplier exercises its own independent judgment about matters
referenced in _Exhibit E_ regardless of any Customer audits or information
provided by Customer or its agents.

 

10.15 Further Assurances. If any further action is necessary, proper or
desirable to carry out any purpose of this Agreement, then each Party hereto
will take such further action (including the execution and delivery of further
documents) as the other Party hereto reasonably requests to carry out such
purpose. The foregoing will be at the expense of such requesting
Party, except to the extent such requesting Party is entitled to
indemnification therefor or to the extent this Agreement otherwise allocates
such expense to any other Party.

10.16 No Solicitation; No Hire. During the Term of this Agreement and for a
period of one (1) year thereafter, neither Party shall solicit, offer
employment to or hire any employee of the other Party or its Affiliates who
has or had been involved in the performance of this Agreement; provided,
however, that neither Party shall be prohibited from (i) initiating searches
for employees through the use of general advertisement or through the
engagement of firms to conduct searches that are not targeted or focused on
the employees of the other Party (and the hiring of employees that respond to
any such searches) or (ii) hiring any such employee not employed by the
other Party at the time of solicitation.

").

 

RECITALS

 

A. ADC and Buyer are parties to a Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 21,

which provides for the sale to Buyer of an office and consumer products
business that includes certain trademark rights and products sold under or in
connection with those trademarks (the " _Acquired Business_ "). Under the
terms of the Purchase Agreement, ADC shall retain businesses, outside the

and products sold under or in connection with those trademarks (the "
_Retained Business_ ").

B. Buyer and its affiliates are the owners of the name and mark "Avery"
and the Avery tilted "triangle logo" (the " _Avery Logo_ "), each as
exemplified in _Exhibit A_, and all common law rights and all registrations
and applications for registration, if any, pertaining thereto (together with
derivatives thereof or any marks, logos or other identifiers in the future
that include AVERY or the Avery Logo (other than AVERY DENNISON or the ADC
Logo), the " _Acquired Marks_ ").

 

C. ADC and its affiliates are the owners of the name and mark "Avery Dennison"
and the Avery Dennison non-tilted "triangle logo" (the " _ADC Logo_ "), each
as exemplified in _Exhibit B_ , and all common law rights and all
registrations and applications for registration, if any, pertaining thereto
(together with derivatives thereof or any marks, logos or other identifiers
in the future that include AVERY DENNISON or the ADC Logo (other than AVERY or
the Avery Logo), the " _Retained Marks_ ").

D. The Acquired Marks and the Retained Marks (the " _Marks_ ") both contain
the term AVERY and/or the "triangle logo."

 

E. The Parties desire to avoid any confusion, mistake, or deception as to the
source or sponsorship of their respective goods and services sold under or in
connection with the Retained Marks and the Acquired Marks.

F. The Parties desire that in the event any consumer confusion arises, they
will cooperate and find ways to eliminate or minimize the confusion, without
the obligation for either Party to cease or further restrict its respective
uses of the Marks.

 

G. As of the closing of the Purchase Agreement, the Parties desire to co-exist
on the terms and under the conditions set forth in this Agreement, with ADC
owning and using the Retained Marks in connection with the Retained Business,
and Buyer owning and using the Acquired Marks in the Acquired Business.

 



G-1  AGREEMENT

between Buyer and its affiliates, on one side, and ADC and ADCs affiliates,
on the other side, Buyer and its affiliates are the sole and exclusive owner

---|---|--- 
 



G-2  ---|---|--- 



     | (a) | Buyer and its affiliates shall have no right hereunder to
use the Retained Marks or any trademarks confusingly similar to the Retained
Marks, except Buyer and its affiliates shall have the right to exhaust any
inventory or works-in-process bearing the Retained Marks, and may continue to
use shipping materials, packaging, sales literature, promotional literature,
display units or other similar materials that display AVERY DENNISON or any
other Retained Mark or company names or trade names of ADC or its affiliates,
for up to twelve (12) months after the Effective Date. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Buyer agrees that it shall not use, and shall cause its
affiliates to not use, the Acquired Marks or any trademarks confusingly
similar to the Acquired Marks in connection with the making, selling,
promoting or distributing of any products or services or for any other purpose

padded paper products and related products, (B) removable
adhesive translucent plastic tabbed padded products, books, dispensers and

     | (c) | Except as set forth in Section 1.2(a), Buyer agrees that it
shall (and shall cause its affiliates to) always use the "triangle logo" in a
tilted orientation and in association with the mark AVERY, so as to reduce
the likelihood of confusion with the ADC Logo. For clarity, Buyer has no
obligation to use the Avery Logo and may use a different logo or design (other
than the ADC Logo or any logo confusingly similar thereto) or no logo or
design in association with the mark AVERY. 
---|---|--- 



     | 1.3 | _Acknowledgement of Rights_. To the extent that Buyer and
its affiliates comply with Sections 1.1 and 1.2, ADC and its affiliates shall
not object to Buyers and its affiliates use, registration of, application
to register, licensing, enforcement or authorization to others to use the
Acquired Marks in connection with the OCP Field as provided in this
Agreement.  
---|---|--- 



   2. | _ADC s Rights and Obligations_. 
---|--- 



     | 2.1. |

_Rights_. Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that, as between Buyer and its
affiliates, on the one side, and ADC and its affiliates on the other side,
ADC and its affiliates are the sole and exclusive owners of the Retained Marks
in 

---|---|--- 
 



G-3  terms of this Agreement, have the worldwide right to use, register, apply to
register, license, enforce and authorize others to use the Retained Marks on
or in connection with goods and/or services in the Retained Business. For
purposes of this Agreement, the " _Retained Business_ " shall mean any
businesses, products or services that are outside of the OCP Field, whether
now conducted or hereafter entered into by ADC or its affiliates. 
---|--- 



     | 2.2. | _Obligations_. 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) | ADC and its affiliates shall have no right hereunder to use
the Acquired Marks or any trademarks confusingly similar to the Acquired
Marks, except to the extent necessary to perform its duties under the
Purchase Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements (as defined in the
Purchase Agreement) and except that (i) ADC and its affiliates shall have the
right to exhaust any existing inventory or works-in-process bearing the
Acquired Marks for up to six (6) months after the Effective Date and (ii)
Avery Dennison Japan K.K. and the ADC Graphics Division (A) will continue to
manufacture and sell products using the AVERY brands and Avery Logo
(including the specific Graphics Division logo set forth on _Exhibit C_ ) for
twelve (12) months after the Effective Date, and (B) will be permitted to sell
any products containing such brands and logo remaining in its inventory for
up to six (6) months. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | ADC agrees that it shall not use, and shall cause its
affiliates to not use, the Retained Marks or any trademarks confusingly
similar to the Retained Marks in connection with the making, selling,
promoting or distributing of any products or services or for any other purpose
in the OCP Field, except to the extent necessary to perform its duties under
the Purchase Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements (as defined in the
Purchase Agreement). 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | ADC agrees that it shall not use, and shall cause its
affiliates to not use, the Retained Marks or any trademarks confusingly
similar to the Retained Marks in connection with the making, selling,
promoting or distributing of any products or services or for any other purpose
through the OCP Channels to end consumers, except that ADC may use the
Retained Marks to make, sell, promote and distribute products and services of
the Retained Business (i) through the on-line channel and/or (ii) to
businesses operating in the OCP Channels for internal use in operating their
businesses (e.g., ADC and its affiliates may use the Retained Marks to
sell, promote or distribute RFID tags to a retailer for tracking its
inventory or for theft prevention, but ADC may not use the Retained Marks to
sell, promote or distribute RFID tags to end consumers through a retailer or
other business in the OCP Channels). 
---|---|--- 
 



G-4  it shall (and shall cause its affiliates to) always use the "triangle logo"
oriented so that the top of the triangle is pointed directly up (not in a
tilted orientation) and in association with the mark AVERY DENNISON, so as to
reduce the likelihood of confusion with the Avery Logo. For clarity, ADC has
no obligation to use the ADC Logo and may use a different logo or design
(other than the Avery Logo or any logo confusingly similar thereto) or no logo
or design in association with the mark AVERY DENNISON. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | For the avoidance of doubt, ADC and its affiliates shall
retain, and the Retained Marks include, all rights to use "Avery Dennison" as
its company name, as a brand name, service mark and trademark, and all marks
incorporating "Avery Dennison" and /or related logos (other than, for clarity,
the Avery Logo and any names or marks assigned to Buyer under the Purchase
Agreement), a sampling of which is set forth on _Exhibit B_ , provided that
such use is outside of the OCP Field. ADC agrees that it shall not use, and
shall cause its affiliates to not use, the Retained Marks in a manner that is
intended to emphasize the AVERY portion over the DENNISON portion of such
name and mark or in any manner confusingly similar to the Acquired Marks. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | ADC agrees that it shall not (and shall cause its affiliates
to not) (i) use the terms "label" or "labels" in connection with the
promotion, advertising, packaging, selling or distributing of any label pad
products sold in the OCP Channels or (ii) use any of the Retained Marks on or
in connection with the promotion, advertising, packaging, selling or
distributing of any (A) label pads and label pad books consisting of
removable adhesive linerless padded paper products, and related products
identified as "Label Pad" products, (B) removable adhesive translucent plastic
tabbed padded products, books, dispensers, and related products identified as
"NoteTabs" products, and (C) sticky note products and flag products consisting
of removable adhesive linerless padded paper and film products, and related
products identified as "Sticky Notes" products. 
---|---|--- 



     | (g) | The Parties acknowledge that there are certain trademarks
owned by ADC that contain elements of both the Retained Marks and the Acquired
Marks. Two examples of these marks are listed in the fourth category on
Exhibit B. These marks are being retained by ADC and ADC will discontinue all
use globally of such marks, including withdrawal or abandonment of any
registration or application for registration.  
---|---|--- 



     | 2.3. | _Acknowledgement of Rights_. To the extent that ADC and
its affiliates comply with Sections 2.1 and 2.2, Buyer and its affiliates
shall not object to ADCs and its affiliates use, registration of,
application to register, licensing, enforcement or authorization to others to
use the Retained Marks in connection with the Retained Business as provided in
this Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
 



G-5  ---|--- 



     | 3.1. | _Licensing by Buyer_. Buyer and its affiliates may license
or permit sublicensing of any or all of its rights hereunder to another party
in the OCP Field, provided that the license terms are at least as restrictive
as those set forth in this Agreement as it concerns the use of the Acquired
Marks, and that such licensing party takes reasonable actions to cause the
licensee to comply with such terms and conditions of this Agreement. Buyer
shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any such licensee. 
---|---|--- 



     | 3.2. | _Permitted Transfers by Buyer_. Buyer and its affiliates
may assign or otherwise transfer each of the Acquired Marks, provided that any
such assignment or transfer shall be made expressly subject to all terms and
conditions of this Agreement in a written Trademark Use Agreement signed by
all parties to the assignment or transfer and stating that the assignee or
transferee shall comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Buyer shall give ADC prompt written notice of any such assignment or transfer
of an Acquired Mark and shall furnish ADC with a fully-executed copy of the
Trademark Use Agreement. ADC shall be expressly identified in the Trademark
Use Agreement as a third party beneficiary of the agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | 3.3 | _Licensing by ADC_. ADC and its affiliates may license or
permit sublicensing of any or all of its rights hereunder to another party
outside the OCP Field, provided that the license terms are at least as
restrictive as those set forth in this Agreement as it concerns the use of the
Retained Marks, and that such licensing party takes reasonable actions to
cause the licensee to comply with such terms and conditions of this
Agreement. ADC shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any
such licensee. 
---|---|--- 



     | 3.4. | _Permitted Transfers by ADC. ADC_ and its affiliates may
assign or otherwise transfer each of the Retained Marks, provided that any
such assignment or transfer shall be made expressly subject to all terms and
conditions of this Agreement in a written Trademark Use Agreement signed by
all parties to the assignment or transfer and stating that the assignee or
transferee shall comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. ADC
shall give Buyer prompt written notice of any such assignment or transfer of a
Retained Mark and shall furnish Buyer with a fully-executed copy of the
Trademark Use Agreement. Buyer shall be expressly identified in the Trademark
Use Agreement as a third party beneficiary of the agreement. 
---|---|--- 



   4. | _Ownership, Registration and Maintenance of Marks_. 
---|--- 



     | 4.1. |

_ADC s Ownership of Retained Marks and Goodwill_. Buyer acknowledges the sole
ownership by ADC and its affiliates of the Retained Marks and all related
goodwill. Buyer covenants that it will not, and shall cause its affiliates to
not, at any time do or cause to be done any act or thing impairing or tending
to impair the right, title or interest of ADC or its affiliates in the
Retained Marks. Buyer 

---|---|--- 
 



G-6  not, at any time during the term of this Agreement, challenge (a) the validity
of the Retained Marks, (b) ownership of the Retained Marks by ADC or its
affiliates, (c) any registration or application for registration of any
Retained Marks existing as of the Effective Date, or (d) any application for
registration of any Retained Marks after the Effective Date, provided that
application for registration is outside of the OCP Field. Buyer shall not
attempt to register, and shall cause its affiliates to not register, the
Retained Marks alone or as part of its own trademarks (other than the mark
AVERY and the Avery Logo, as permitted hereunder) or attempt to register any
marks confusingly similar to the Retained Marks. 
---|--- 



     | 4.2 | _Buyer s Ownership of Acquired Marks and Goodwill_. ADC
acknowledges the sole ownership by Buyer and its affiliates of the Acquired
Marks and all related goodwill. ADC covenants that it will not, and shall
cause its affiliates to not, at any time do or cause to be done any act or
thing impairing or tending to impair the right, title or interest of Buyer or
its affiliates in the Acquired Marks. ADC agrees that it will not, and shall
cause its affiliates to not, at any time during the term of this Agreement,
challenge (a) the validity of the Acquired Marks, (b) ownership of the
Acquired Marks by Buyer or its affiliates, (c) any registration or
application for registration of any Acquired Marks existing as of the
Effective Date, or (d) any application for registration of any Acquired Marks
within the OCP Field filed after the Effective Date. ADC shall not attempt
to register, and shall cause its affiliates to not register, the Acquired
Marks alone or as part of its own trademarks (other than the mark AVERY
DENNISON and the ADC Logo, as permitted hereunder) or attempt to register any
marks confusingly similar to the Acquired Marks. 
---|---|--- 



   5. | _Confusion Not Likely_. The Parties mutually believe that the
continued use and registration of the Acquired Marks and the Retained Marks on
and in connection with the goods and/or services relating to their respective
businesses in accordance with the terms of this Agreement is not likely to
cause confusion, mistake or deception as to the source or sponsorship of their
respective goods and services because of, among other reasons, distinctions
in those respective goods and services, distinctions in the respective
channels of trade, distinctions in the targeted consumers and the respective
uses of the marks hereunder. The Parties agree to continue to take reasonable
action, and to cause their affiliates to take reasonable action, to reduce the
likelihood of confusion due to the co-existence and registration of their
respective marks hereunder, to notify one another of any actual confusion
that is brought to their attention in connection with their respective names
and marks hereunder, and to mutually cooperate, as is reasonable under the
circumstances, to rectify any actual or potential confusion resulting
therefrom.  
---|--- 



   6. | _Further Assurances_. 
---|--- 



     | 6.1 | _General Assistance_. At any time and from time to time,
promptly upon reasonable request and at the expense of the requesting Party,
each Party shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, sign and deliver to the
requesting Party any and all further instruments and consents, and shall take
further reasonable action, at the requesting Partys cost for reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses, in order to give the requesting Party the full benefit of
this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



G-7  Section 6.1, at the request of a Party, at the requesting Partys cost for
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, the other Party will (i) execute
coexistence agreements or consents consistent with this Agreement and in a
form suitable for filing in a local trademark office to permit registration,
recordation or assignment of such Partys Marks as permitted hereunder, (ii)
amend its applications or registrations for the Acquired Marks to exclude
products or services outside of the OCP Field or for the Retained Marks to
exclude products or services in the OCP Field, and (iii) otherwise cooperate
to determine and implement the best manner to effect such registration,
recordation or assignment so as to provide each Party and its affiliates the
full ownership and use of the Retained Marks (with respect to ADC and its
affiliates) and the Acquired Marks (with respect to Buyer and its affiliates)
as provided hereunder. 
---|---|--- 



     | 6.3 | _Licenses_. In the event and to the extent that,
notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 6, a Party or its affiliate is
not permitted to register, record, or assign a Retained Mark (in the case of
ADC) or an Acquired Mark (in the case of Buyer) in a particular jurisdiction,
upon the request of such Party the other Party hereby grants to such Party a
royalty-free, fully paid-up, sublicenseable license to use the Retained Mark
or Acquired Mark, as applicable, in such jurisdiction in a manner consistent
with this Agreement until such time as such assignment and recordal occurs. At
the requesting Partys request and expense, the other Party shall use
reasonable efforts to file, prosecute, and maintain applications or
registrations for such licensed Mark(s) in such jurisdiction(s) until such
assignment and recordal occurs. If requested by either Party, the Parties
shall cooperate to execute a separate short-form license agreement
documenting the foregoing license and containing any other provisions to the
extent required under applicable law. 
---|---|--- 

7\. _Limitation of Liability_. NEITHER PARTY NOR ITS AFFILIATES SHALL UNDER
ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, EVEN IF NOTIFIED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF, BE LIABLE TO
THE OTHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES HEREUNDER FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LIABILITY FOR ANY LOST
SALES, PROFITS OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES ARISING SOLELY FROM BREACH OF THIS
AGREEMENT.

 



   8. | _Term; Termination_. 
---|--- 



     | 8.1 | _Term_. Subject to Section 8.2, the term of this Agreement
(the " _Term_ ") shall be perpetual. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 8.2 |

_Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated only by mutual written
agreement of the Parties at any time. For clarity, this Agreement may not be
terminated by any Party for breach of this Agreement by any other Party, it
being understood and agreed that the non-breaching Party may seek injunctive
relief, specific performance, and/or damages (subject to Section 7) against
the breaching 

---|---|--- 
 



G-8  affiliates and licensees abandon all use of all of its respective Marks (by
discontinuing all use for a period of three consecutive years worldwide), the
other Party and its affiliates shall be released from all obligations under
this Agreement. 
---|--- 



   9. | _Miscellaneous_. 
---|--- 



     | 9.1. | _Waiver_. Except where a specific period for action or
inaction is provided herein, neither the failure nor any delay on the part of
any Party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege under this
Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part
of any Party hereto of any such right, power or privilege, nor any single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or
privilege. The failure of a Party hereto to exercise any right conferred
herein within the time required shall cause such right to terminate with
respect to the transaction or circumstances giving rise to such right, but not
to any such right arising as a result of any other transactions or
circumstances. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 9.2. | _Assignment_. Subject to Sections 3.2 and 3.4, this
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties hereto
and their respective permitted successors and assigns. 
---|---|--- 



     | 9.3. | _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Exhibits
hereto, the Purchase Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined
in the Purchase Agreement) constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
and supersede all other prior covenants, agreements, undertakings,
obligations, promises, arrangements, communications, representations and
warranties, whether oral or written, by any Party or by any director,
officer, employee, agent, affiliate or representative of any Party. 
---|---|--- 



     | 9.4. | _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto
may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which shall together constitute one and the same
instrument. 
---|---|--- 



     | 9.5. | _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands, claims and
other communications which are required or may be given under this Agreement

will affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other manner
permitted by law. 
---|--- 



     | 9.8. | _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS
DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR

THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS
OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN

     | 9.10. |

_Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the
other Parties would be irreparably damaged in the event that any of the terms
or provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached. Therefore, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each of the Parties hereby agrees
that the 

---|---|--- 
 



G-11  injunctions to prevent breaches of any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement, and to enforce specifically the performance by such first Party,
and each Party hereby agrees to waive the defense in any such suit that the
other parties to this Agreement have an adequate remedy at law, and hereby
agrees to waive any requirement to post any bond in connection with obtaining
such relief. The equitable remedies described in this Section 9.10 shall be
in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies at law or in equity
that the parties hereto may elect to pursue. 
---|--- 
 



     | 9.11. | _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or
portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner
as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or
portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision
or portion of any provision had never been contained herein. 
---|---|--- 



     | 9.12 | _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to an Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or
Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words
"hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in
this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive.
The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of such terms. Unless otherwise specified, any
agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any
agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes, and
including all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.
References to a person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. An
"affiliate" of a Party means any person or entity which controls, is
controlled by, or is under common control with, such Party, where "control"
means ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding voting
securities or other interests having voting rights with respect to the
election of the board of directors or similar governing authority (but only as
long as such person or entity meets these requirements).  
---|---|---

writing to be bound by the confidentiality and non-use obligations contained
in this Agreement.

4.3 _Compelled Disclosure_. If a Party is required by judicial or
administrative process to disclose Confidential Information of the other
Party, such Party shall promptly inform the other Party of the disclosure
that is being sought in order to provide the other Party an opportunity to
challenge or limit the disclosure obligations. Confidential Information that
is disclosed by judicial or administrative process shall remain otherwise
subject to the confidentiality and non-use provisions of this _Section 4.3_,
and the Party disclosing Confidential Information pursuant to Law or court
order shall take all steps reasonably necessary, including seeking an order of
confidentiality, to ensure the continued confidential treatment of such
Confidential Information. Each Party agrees that it shall cooperate fully and

Agreement has been entered into by the parties hereto in express reliance
upon 6 Del. C. § 2708\. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided
for notices in _Section 7.16_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the
right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS
LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY

JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS,
(B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C)
IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 7.12_.

 

7.13 _Remedies_. Nothing contained herein shall prevent or limit either
partys right or power to seek and/or obtain money damages, specific
performance or temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief with
respect to any breach of this Agreement by the other party pursuant to the
procedures set forth in _Section 7.11_ above except that the Parties agree
to waive any right to receive punitive, consequential, special or indirect
damages relating in any way to this Agreement.

 

7.14 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that
the other Parties would be irreparably damaged in the event that any of the
terms or provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or otherwise are breached. Therefore, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each of the
Parties hereby agrees that the other Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement, and to enforce specifically the performance by
such first Party, and each Party hereby agrees to waive the defense in any
such suit that the other parties to this Agreement have an adequate remedy at
law and to interpose no opposition, legal or otherwise, as to the propriety of
injunction or specific performance as a remedy, and hereby agrees to waive
any requirement to post any bond in connection with obtaining such relief. The
equitable remedies described in this _Section 7.14_ shall be in addition to,
and not in lieu of, any other remedies at law or in equity that the parties
hereto may elect to pursue.
