such  manner that the value of such Rights shall be preserved and shall inure to
the  benefit of Purchaser, and that the collection of any moneys due and payable
or  to  become  due  and  payable  to Purchaser in and under the Rights shall be
received  by  Purchaser; and the applicable Seller Corporation will promptly pay
over  to  Purchaser  all  moneys  collected  by or paid to the applicable Seller
Corporation  in  respect  of  every  such  Right.  In  addition, if transfers of
Conveyed  Companies or aggregate Purchased Assets in a particular country (each,
a  "Business  Unit")  cannot  be  obtained  as  of  Closing  because of required
    --------------
third-party  consents  (whether  in  respect  of Rights, Competition Laws or any
   -----
other  basis) that have not been obtained, Pfizer and Purchaser shall enter into
   -
management  agreements  reasonably acceptable to each party (each, a "Management
                                                                      ----------
Agreement")  pursuant  to which Pfizer shall operate such Business Units for the
 --------
benefit  of  Purchaser  and (to the extent permitted by law) at the direction of
Purchaser,  consistent  with  the  letter agreement attached as Exhibit H hereto
until  the  transfer  of  such  Business  Unit or the Delayed Transfer Deadline,
whichever  is  earlier.  Upon  the  occurrence of the Delayed Transfer Deadline,
Purchaser  and Pfizer shall negotiate in good faith to arrive at a valuation for
any  and  all  Rights  and  Business Units that have not been transferred, which
valuation  shall  take into account the significance of the Business Unit to the
overall  Business,  as conducted immediately prior to Closing.  If after 30 days
the  parties  have been unable to agree, each party shall nominate an investment
bank  and  the  two  investment  banks  shall,  within  15  days, select a third
investment  bank,  which  third  investment bank shall, within 45 days after its
selection, make a binding determination of the value of such Rights and Business
Units,  which  amount Pfizer shall promptly pay to Purchaser as an adjustment to
the  Purchase  Price.
(c)     Purchaser  acknowledges  that  certain  consents  to  the  transactions
contemplated  by  this  Agreement may be required from parties to the Rights and
that  such consents have not been and may not be obtained.  Provided that Pfizer
is  in  full compliance with the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) above and
has  satisfied  any  disclosure obligations under this Agreement with respect to
such  consents,  Purchaser  agrees  that no representation or warranty of Pfizer
contained  herein shall be breached or deemed breached, and, except as set forth
in  Section  4.2  of  this Agreement, no condition to Purchaser's obligations to
close  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement  shall be deemed not
satisfied  as  a  result  of  the  failure  to  obtain  any  such  consent.
Section  2.4     Excluded  Assets  of  the  Business.   (a)  Notwithstanding any
                 -----------------------------------
provision  in  this  Agreement, Purchaser is not purchasing any of the following
(the  "Excluded  Assets"):
       ----------------
(i)     Cash  Equivalents  (except  to  the extent that Cash Equivalents are not
transferred  pursuant  to  Section  2.4(b)  or  7.21  and  are  reflected in the
calculation  of  the  Working  Capital of the Business pursuant to Section 2.8);
(ii)     All  Intercompany  Receivables,  other than amounts due and owing among
the  Conveyed  Companies  and  the  Asset Selling Corporations in respect of the
Business;
(iii)     With respect to the Asset Selling Corporations, all Tax losses and Tax

forwards  with  respect  to  any  and all Taxes, to the extent attributable to a
taxable  period  (or  portion  thereof)  ending on or prior to the Closing Date,
including  interest  thereon,  whether  or not the foregoing is derived from the
Business;
(iv)     the  corporate  books  and  records  of the Asset Selling Corporations;

interest  or  assets  not  related  primarily  to  the  Business;  and
(ix)     any  legal  or  beneficial  interest  in  the assets listed on Schedule
                                                                        --------

     -----
the  Business.
(b)     Pfizer  may  take  (or cause one or more of its Affiliates to take) such
action as is necessary or advisable to transfer effective as of the Closing Date
     the  Excluded  Assets  from  the  Conveyed  Companies and each of the Asset
Selling  Corporations  to  Pfizer  or  one  or  more  of its Affiliates for such
consideration  or  for  no  consideration,  as  may  be determined by the Seller
Corporations  in their sole discretion.  After the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
take  all actions (or shall cause its Affiliates to take all actions) reasonably
requested  by  the  Seller Corporations to effect the provisions of this Section
2.4,  including the return of any Excluded Assets.  Any action taken pursuant to
this  Section  2.4(b) after the Closing Date shall be deemed for the purposes of
Section  2.8  to have occurred on the Closing Date and shall be reflected in the
calculation of the Working Capital of the Business pursuant to Section 2.8 where
the  relevant  Excluded  Asset falls within the Working Capital of the Business.
Section  2.5     Assumption  of  Certain  Obligations of the Business.  Upon the
                 ----------------------------------------------------
terms  and  subject  to  the  conditions  of  this  Agreement, Purchaser agrees,
effective at the Closing, to assume and to satisfy and discharge all Liabilities

their respective Liabilities, whether arising prior to or after the Closing, and
whether  accrued  or fixed, known or unknown, absolute or contingent, matured or
unmatured  or  determined or determinable as of the Closing Date, other than the
Retained  Liabilities  (all  of  the foregoing liabilities and obligations being
herein  collectively  called  the  "Assumed  Liabilities").  Assumed Liabilities
                                    --------------------
shall  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  the  following:
(a)     all  lawsuits  commenced and claims made after the Closing to the extent

Section  2.6     Retained  Liabilities  of  the  Business.  Notwithstanding  any
                 ----------------------------------------
provision  in  this  Agreement,  the  Seller  Corporations  shall  retain and be

(d)     Liabilities  exclusively  associated  with  the  Excluded  Assets;

(i)     any  and  all Liabilities, excluding Products Liabilities claims, of the

Section  2.7     Purchase Price.  (a)  In consideration of the sale and transfer
                 --------------
of  the  Shares,  Purchaser agrees to purchase from Pfizer and the Stock Selling
Corporations  the Shares  and to assume the Assumed Liabilities for an aggregate
purchase  price  of  $582,162,000,  allocated  among  the Shares as described in
Schedule  2.9  (the  "Share  Purchase  Price").
     --------         ----------------------
(b)     In  consideration  of  the  sale  and  transfer of the Purchased Assets,
Purchaser  agrees  to purchase from each Asset Selling Corporation the Purchased
Assets  and  to  assume  and satisfy the Assumed Liabilities owned by such Asset
Selling  Corporation  for an aggregate purchase price of $347,838,000, allocated
among  the  Asset  Selling Corporations as described in Schedule 2.9 (the "Asset
                                                        ------------       -----
Purchase  Price"  and,  together  with  the Share Purchase Price, the "Aggregate
  -------------                                                        ---------
Purchase  Price").
  -------------
(c)     The Aggregate Purchase Price ($930,000,000) shall be paid in immediately
available  funds, by wire transfer in accordance with written instructions given
by  Pfizer to Purchaser not less than 2 Business Days prior to the Closing.  The
Aggregate  Purchase  Price  shall  be  subject  to  the adjustment provisions of
Section  2.8  and  shall  be  allocated  as  described  in  Section  2.9.
Section  2.8     Purchase  Price  Adjustment.  (a)  Within  90  days  after  the
                 ---------------------------
Closing  Date,  Pfizer  shall  deliver  to  Purchaser a statement of the Working
Capital  of  the  Business  as  of  the  Closing  Date  (the  "Working  Capital
                                                               ----------------
Statement").  The  Working  Capital Statement shall be unaudited and shall state
the  Working Capital of the Business excluding Cash Equivalents to the extent it
is  an  Excluded Asset as of the Closing Date, taking into account any transfers
made  pursuant  to Section 2.4(b) and the settlement of any Liabilities referred
to  in  Section  2.6(e)  after  the  Closing Date, which for the purposes of the
Working  Capital  Statement  shall be deemed to have been settled on the Closing
Date  at  the amount settled.  Purchaser shall provide Pfizer with access to the
books, records, and personnel of the Business to the extent reasonably necessary
     for  Pfizer  to  prepare  the Working Capital Statement.  Pfizer shall also
consult with Purchaser in connection with the preparation of the Working Capital
Statement  to  the  extent  reasonably  necessary to prepare the Working Capital
Statement.
(b)     During  the  period of 60 days following the receipt by Purchaser of the
Working  Capital  Statement,  Purchaser and its independent accountants shall be
permitted  to  review  the  supporting  workpapers  used  to prepare the Working
Capital  Statement  and  shall  have  access  to  personnel  of Pfizer as may be
reasonably  necessary  to  permit it to review in detail the manner in which the
relevant  statements  were  prepared.
(c)     Purchaser  may  dispute  the  amounts reflected on the line items of the
Working Capital Statement (a "Disputed Item"), but only (i) on the basis that an
                              -------------
entry  contained  on  such  Working  Capital  Statement  is  based  on  facts or
occurrences  arising solely between the date of the Financial Statements and the
date  of  the  Working Capital Statement; (ii) on the basis that a Disputed Item
does  not  reflect,  or  has  not  been  made  in  a manner consistent with, the
provisions  of  this Agreement; and (iii) to the extent the amount disputed with
respect  to  any one Disputed Item exceeds $50,000 with respect to an individual
item  or  series  of  related items and all such allowable Disputed Items exceed
$1,000,000 in the aggregate; provided, however, Purchaser shall notify Pfizer in
                             --------  -------
writing of each Disputed Item, and specify the amount thereof in dispute and the
basis  therefor,  within 60 days after receipt of the Working Capital Statement.
The  failure by Purchaser to provide a notice of Disputed Items to Pfizer within
such  60  day  period will constitute Purchaser's acceptance of all the items in
the  Working  Capital  Statement.
(d)     If  a  notice  of  Disputed  Items shall be timely delivered pursuant to
subclause  (b)  above,  Pfizer  and Purchaser shall, during the 30 Business Days
following the date of such delivery (the "Resolution Period"), negotiate in good
                                          -----------------
faith  to  resolve  the  Disputed  Items.  If, during such Resolution Period the
parties  are  unable  to  reach  agreement, Pfizer and Purchaser shall refer all
unresolved  Disputed  Items  to  Deloitte & Touche LLP, or any other independent
accounting  firm  as  Pfizer  and  Purchaser  shall  mutually  agree  upon  (the
"Independent  Accountant").  The  Independent  Accountant  shall  make  a
         ---------------
determination with respect to each unresolved Disputed Item within 15 days after
         ---
its  engagement  by  Pfizer  and Purchaser to resolve such Disputed Items, which
determination  shall  be  made  in  accordance  with the rules set forth in this
Section  2.8.  The Independent Accountant shall deliver to Pfizer and Purchaser,
within  such  15  day period, a report setting forth its adjustments, if any, to
the  Working Capital Statement and the calculations supporting such adjustments.
Such  report  shall be final, binding on the parties and conclusive.  Pfizer and
Purchaser  shall  each pay one-half of all the costs incurred in connection with
the  engagement  of  the Independent Accountant.  As used herein, "Final Working
                                                                   -------------
Capital" shall mean (i) if no notice of Disputed Items is delivered by Purchaser
  -----
within  the  period  provided  in  subclause  (b)  above, Working Capital of the
Business  as  shown  in  the Working Capital Statement as prepared by Pfizer; or
(ii)  if  such  a notice of Disputed Items is delivered by Purchaser, either (x)
Working Capital of the Business as agreed to in writing by Pfizer and Purchaser;
or  (y) Working Capital of the Business as shown in the Independent Accountant's
calculation  delivered  pursuant to this subclause (c).  The parties acknowledge
that  they  have  discussed  their  past  contacts, if any, with the Independent
Accountant,  and  that  neither  party  shall  have  the  right to object to the
Independent  Accountant's  service  in  such role by reason of non-disclosure of
past  contacts,  conflicts  of  interest,  or  any  other  reason.
(e)     If the Final Working Capital excluding Cash Equivalents to the extent it
is  an  Excluded  Asset is less than $132,500,000, then Pfizer, on behalf of the
Seller  Corporations, shall, within 10 days after the determination of the Final
Working  Capital,  pay  to  Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds  in accordance with written instructions given to Pfizer by Purchaser, the
amount of such shortfall, together with interest on such amount from the Closing
Date  to the date of such payment at a rate equal to the 90-day London Interbank
Offered Rate prevailing at the Closing Date minus 1/8%, as determined by Pfizer.
If  the Final Working Capital is greater than $132,500,000 then Purchaser shall,
within  10  days  after  the  determination of the Final Working Capital, pay to
Pfizer,  by  wire  transfer  of  immediately  available funds in accordance with
written  instructions  given  by Pfizer to Purchaser, the amount of such excess,
together  with interest on such amount from the Closing Date to the date of such
payment  at  an  annual  rate  equal to the 90-day London Interbank Offered Rate
prevailing  at  the  Closing  Date  plus  0.2%,  as  determined  by  Pfizer.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  Pfizer  agrees to make one or more installment
payments toward the payment provided for in this Section 2.8(d) at such times as
amounts  reflected  in  the  calculation  of the Working Capital of the Business
become fixed and are not Disputed Items and the non-Disputed Items are such that
a  payment would be due and owing to Purchaser pursuant to the first sentence of
this  subsection  (d).  Similarly,  Purchaser  agrees  to  make  one  or  more
installment  payments  toward the payment provided for in this Section 2.8(d) at
such times as amounts reflected in the calculation of the Working Capital of the
Business  become fixed and are not Disputed Items and the non-Disputed Items are
such  that  a  payment  would  be due and owing to Pfizer pursuant to the second
sentence of this subsection (d).  The final installment payment to be made after
the  determination  of  Final  Working  Capital  shall  take  into  account  all
previously-made  installment  payments.
Section  2.9     Allocation  of the Aggregate Purchase Price.  Pfizer, on behalf
                 -------------------------------------------
of  itself  and  the  Seller  Corporations, and Purchaser (i) have agreed to the
allocation  of  the Aggregate Purchase Price among the Conveyed Subsidiaries and
the Asset Selling Corporations as set forth in Schedule 2.9 (the "Section 2.9(i)
                                               ------------       --------------
     Allocation")  and  (ii)  shall  agree  as set forth below on the allocation
     ----------
among  the  Purchased Assets sold by each Asset Selling Corporation of the Asset
Purchase  Price  allocable  to  such  Asset  Selling Corporation as set forth in
Schedule  2.9  (the  "Section 2.9(ii) Allocation" and, together with the Section
     --------         --------------------------
2.9(i)  Allocation,  the  "Allocation").  Each of the Seller Corporations on the
                           ----------
one  hand  and  Purchaser  on the other shall (i) be bound by the Allocation for
purposes  of  determining  any  Taxes;  (ii)  prepare  and  file,  and cause its
Affiliates  to  prepare and file, its Tax Returns on a basis consistent with the
Allocation;  and  (iii)  take  no  position, and cause its Affiliates to take no
position,  inconsistent  with  the Allocation on any applicable Tax Return or in
any  proceeding before any taxing authority or otherwise.  In the event that the
Allocation  is  disputed  by any taxing authority, the party receiving notice of
the  dispute  shall  promptly notify the other party hereto, and both Pfizer and
Purchaser agree to use their best efforts to defend such Allocation in any audit
or  similar proceeding, and the matter shall be handled as a Tax Claim described
in Section 7.4(i)(B).  Each of the Seller Corporations and Purchaser acknowledge
that  the  Section  2.9(i) Allocation was done at arm's length based upon a good
faith estimate of fair market values.  Pfizer and Purchaser agree that Purchaser
shall  choose  an  independent appraisal firm to perform an appraisal to support
the  Section 2.9(ii) Allocation.  The cost of such appraisal firm shall be borne
by Purchaser.  Pfizer shall be provided with a copy of the appraiser's report at
least 15 working days prior to Closing and, provided that Pfizer consents to the
report  (which  consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), the Section 2.9(ii)
Allocation shall be made as specified in the report.  If Pfizer does not consent
to  the appraiser's report, Pfizer and Purchaser shall use their best efforts to
mutually agree prior to Closing (or, if they fail to reach an agreement prior to
Closing,  the  parties  shall mutually agree after Closing) on any changes to be
made to the report and the Section 2.9(ii) Allocation shall be made as specified
in  the  report so changed.  Working capital adjustments pursuant to Section 2.8
and  other  post-Closing  adjustments,  if  any, to the Aggregate Purchase Price
shall  be  allocated to the Conveyed Company or to the Asset Selling Corporation
to which the adjustment relates, and shall be further allocated (if relevant for
purposes  of  any applicable Law) to the assets to which the adjustment relates.
The  Aggregate  Purchase  Price  allocation  to  such  Conveyed Company or Asset
Selling Corporation shall be correspondingly increased or decreased.  Pfizer and
Purchaser  acknowledge  that,  in accordance with GAAP, the fair market value of
the Purchased Assets is not less than the net book value of the Purchased Assets
and  that,  in  accordance  therewith,  if  after  all  other adjustments to the
Allocation  are  made,  the  Allocation  with  respect  to  any  Asset  Selling
Corporation,  when  expressed  in  the  relevant  local  currency at the rate of
exchange  used  to  determine  Final  Working  Capital,  is  less than the local
currency  net  book  value, determined in accordance with GAAP, of the Purchased
Assets  of  such  Asset  Selling  Corporation  as  of the Closing Date, then the
Allocation  with  respect to such Asset Selling Corporation shall be adjusted so
that  it is equal to such local currency net book value converted at the rate of
exchange  used to determine Final Working Capital and a corresponding adjustment
will  be  made to the Allocation pro rata with respect to Warner-Lambert Company
and  Warner  Lambert Trading Co. Ltd. based on their relative Aggregate Purchase
Price  allocation.

consultants  are unable to reach such joint agreement, the provisions of Section
8.10  (d)(iii)  shall  apply.
(d)     Subject  to  appropriate  confidentiality  protections, and except where
prohibited  by  Law,  each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other party

reasonably  request  in connection with the foregoing and will provide the other
party  with  copies  of  all  filings  made  by such party with any Governmental
Authority  and,  upon request, any other information supplied by such party to a
Governmental  Authority  in  connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated  hereby.

case  with  respect  to  the foregoing clauses (A), (B) or (C) if such action is
necessary  or  reasonably  advisable  to  obtain approval or consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement by any Governmental Antitrust Entity;
and  (iv)  Purchaser  shall  take  promptly,  in the event that any permanent or
preliminary  injunction  or  other  order  is  entered  or  becomes  reasonably
foreseeable  to be entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of the
acquisition  of  the  Shares  and  the  Purchased  Assets  and  the transactions
contemplated  hereby  in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or
that  would  prevent  or delay consummation of the acquisition of the Shares and
the  Purchased  Assets or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

Payment  and  Aggregate Purchase Price), subject to the terms of this Agreement,
with  respect to all Shares, Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities outside of
the jurisdiction of any such Governmental Authority; provided, however, that the

action,  the  parties  hereto  shall  effect  transfer  of  the effected Shares,
Purchased  Assets  and  Assumed  Liabilities  in  accordance  with  the  Foreign
Implementing  Agreements  for  the jurisdiction relating thereto, subject to the

be retroactive to and be deemed to have occurred on the Closing Date.  As of the
Closing  Date, Pfizer and Purchaser shall, subject to applicable Law, enter into
mutually  agreeable  alternative business arrangements consistent with the terms
of  this  Agreement  or  other arrangements which provide Purchaser with the net

obtained.
Section  7.4     Tax  Matters.
                 ------------
(a)     (i)  Preparation  and  Filing  of Tax Returns.  Pfizer shall prepare and
             ----------------------------------------
timely  file  or shall cause to be prepared and timely filed all federal, state,
local and foreign Tax Returns in respect of the Conveyed Companies and the Asset
     Selling  Corporations, their assets and activities that (i) are required to
be filed (taking into account extensions) on or before the Closing Date; or (ii)
are required to be filed (taking into account extensions) after the Closing Date
and  (A) are Consolidated Tax Returns of Pfizer and its Affiliates; (B) are with
respect  to  Income  Taxes and are required to be filed on a separate Tax Return
basis  for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date; or (C) are to be
filed  by  an Asset Selling Corporation.  Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be
prepared  and  shall file or cause to be filed all other Tax Returns required of
the  Conveyed Companies, or in respect of their assets or activities or required
to  be  filed after the Closing Date with respect to the Purchased Assets or the
Business.  Any  such  Tax  Returns  that include periods ending on or before the
Closing  Date  or  that  include  the activities of the Conveyed Companies or an
Asset  Selling  Corporation  (with respect to the Business) prior to the Closing
Date shall, insofar as they relate to the Conveyed Companies or an Asset Selling
Corporation  (with  respect  to the Business) prior to the Closing Date, be on a
basis consistent with the last previous such Tax Returns filed in respect of the
Conveyed  Companies  or  such  Asset  Selling  Corporation  (with respect to the
Business),  unless Pfizer or Purchaser, as the case may be, concludes that there
is  no  reasonable  basis  for  such  position.  With  respect to any Tax Return
required  to  be filed by Purchaser for a taxable period that includes (but does
not  end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), Purchaser shall deliver, at
                                  ---------------
least  30  days  prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return (taking
into  account extensions), to Pfizer a statement setting forth the amount of Tax
for  which  Pfizer is responsible pursuant to Sections 7.4(g) and a copy of such
Tax Return.  Pfizer shall have the right to review such Tax Return and statement
prior  to  the filing of such Tax Return.  Pfizer and Purchaser agree to consult
and  resolve  in  good faith any issue arising as a result of Pfizer's review of
such  Tax Return and statement and mutually to consent to the filing of such Tax
Return  as  promptly  as  possible.  Unless otherwise required by an appropriate
Governmental  Authority,  neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall file
any  amended  Tax  Returns  for  any  periods  for or in respect of the Conveyed
Companies  with  respect to which Purchaser is not obligated to prepare or cause
to  be prepared the original such Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 7.4(a)(i)
without  the  prior  written  consent  of  Pfizer  which  consent  shall  not be
unreasonably  withheld.  Neither Pfizer nor any of its Affiliates shall file any
amended Tax Returns for or in respect of the Conveyed Companies for such periods
without  the  prior  written  consent  of  Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably  withheld.  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  this  Agreement,
Purchaser  may, at its option, make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code
with  respect  to  its  purchase  or  deemed  purchase  of  any  of the Conveyed
Companies,  in  which  event Purchaser shall be solely responsible for preparing
the separate return for any U.S. corporation reflecting the consequences of such
election,  and  shall  be  responsible  for  and  shall  pay,  any and all Taxes
resulting from such election, including any additional Taxes arising as a result
of  a  reduction in the amount of foreign tax credits and other Tax credits that
are  available  to Pfizer (computed as if Pfizer did not utilize any foreign tax
credits  or  any other Tax credits, net operating losses or other Tax attributes
to  reduce  the  additional  Taxes),  and  shall indemnify Pfizer (in the manner
provided  herein)  with respect to such Taxes.  If Pfizer determines that any of
the  Conveyed  Companies  is entitled to file or make a formal or informal claim
for  refund or file an amended Tax Return providing for a refund with respect to
a  period  for  which  it  is  obligated  to prepare or cause to be prepared the
original  such  Tax  Return  pursuant to this Section 7.4(a)(i), Pfizer shall be
entitled  to  file  or  make  such claim or amended Tax Return on behalf of such
Conveyed  Company and will be entitled to control the prosecution of such refund
claims.  In  the  event that Pfizer fails to prepare and timely file or cause to
be  prepared  and  timely filed any Tax Return or pay Taxes shown to be due with
respect  to  a Tax Return which Pfizer is obligated to prepare and file or cause
to  be  prepared  and filed pursuant to Section 7.4(a), Purchaser shall have the
right  to  prepare and file such Tax Return and pay the Taxes shown to be due on
such Tax Return notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.4(g)(i) and 7.4(b) to
the  contrary,  provided  such Tax Return shall be prepared and filed on a basis
consistent  with  the  principles  set  forth  in  this  Section  7.4(g)(i).
(ii)     Internal  Restructurings.  Pfizer  shall  have  the  right  to cause an
----     ------------------------
election  pursuant  to  Treasury  Regulations  Section  301.7701-3  to be filed,
----
effective from a date on or prior to the Closing Date, for those of the Conveyed
----
     Companies that are not United States entities to be treated as a branch for
U.S.  federal  Income  Tax purposes.  Prior to the Closing, Pfizer shall provide
Purchaser  with a list of all Conveyed Companies for which elections pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3 have been filed, together with copies of
such  elections.
(b)     Payment of Taxes.  Except for Taxes that are accrued or reserved against
---     ----------------
     in  the Working Capital Statement, Pfizer shall pay or cause to be paid (A)
all  Taxes  due with respect to Tax Returns which Pfizer is obligated to prepare
and  file  or cause to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 7.4(a); and (B)
all  Taxes due with respect to Tax Returns for Straddle Periods for which Pfizer
is  responsible  pursuant to Section 7.4(g)(i).  Purchaser shall pay or cause to
be  paid  (A)  all  Taxes  due  with  respect  to Tax Returns which Purchaser is
obligated  to  prepare  and  file  or cause to be prepared and filed pursuant to
Section  7.4(a)  other  than Taxes which Pfizer shall pay or cause to be paid in
accordance  with  the preceding sentence; and (B) all Taxes owed by the Conveyed
Companies  other  than  Taxes  which  Pfizer  shall  pay  or cause to be paid in
accordance  with  the  preceding  sentence.
(c)     Tax Sharing Agreements.  On the Closing Date, all Tax sharing agreements
---     ----------------------
and  arrangements,  including  profit  pooling  or  similar  arrangements  under
non-United  States law, between (i) the Conveyed Companies, on the one hand; and
(ii)  Pfizer  or  any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (other than the Conveyed
Companies),  on the other hand, shall be terminated effective as of the close of
the  Closing  Date  and  have  no  further effect for any taxable year or period
(whether  a  past, present or future year or period), and no additional payments
shall  be  made  thereunder with respect to any period after the Closing Date in
respect  of  a  redetermination  of  Tax  liabilities  or  otherwise.
(d)     Carryforwards  and  Carrybacks.  Purchaser  shall  cause  the  Conveyed
---     ------------------------------
Companies  to  elect,  when permitted by law, to carry forward any net operating
---
loss,  charitable  contribution  credit  or other item arising after the Closing
--
Date  that  could,  in  the  absence  of  such an election, be carried back to a
--
taxable period of the Conveyed Companies ending on or before the Closing Date in
--
which  the  Conveyed  Companies  were  included  in a Consolidated Tax Return of
Pfizer  and  its  Affiliates.  Purchaser, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates,  hereby  waives  any  right  to use or apply any net operating loss,
charitable  contribution  credit  or other item (including any net capital loss,
foreign tax credit or research and development credit) of the Conveyed Companies
for  any tax year ending on any date following the Closing Date to any period of
the Conveyed Companies ending on or before the Closing Date.  If any net capital
loss,  foreign  tax  credit  or research and development credit shall be carried
back  to  any  such  period, Purchaser shall indemnify Pfizer and its Affiliates
(other  than  the  Conveyed  Companies)  for  all  reasonable costs and expenses
incurred  by  Pfizer  or  any  of  such  Affiliates  in filing such claims or in
connection  with  any  audit  of  such  claims.
(e)     Refunds.  Pfizer  shall be entitled to retain, or receive prompt payment
---     -------
from  Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the Conveyed
Companies) of, any refund or credit with respect to Taxes (including refunds and
credits arising by reason of amended Tax Returns filed after the Closing Date or
otherwise)  with  respect  to  any Tax period or portion thereof that ends on or
before  the Closing Date relating to the Conveyed Companies or any Asset Selling
Corporation;  provided,  however,  that (i) Purchaser and the Conveyed Companies
              --------   -------
shall  be entitled to retain, or receive prompt payment from Pfizer of, any such
refund  or credit to the extent that such refund or credit arises as a result of
the  use or application (as provided in Section 7.4(d)) of any net capital loss,
foreign  tax credit or research and development credit of the Conveyed Companies
for  any tax year ending on any date following the Closing Date to any period of
the  Conveyed  Companies  ending  on or before the Closing Date; and (ii) to the
extent  that Pfizer or any of its Affiliates (other than the Conveyed Companies)
would,  but  for the carryback by the Conveyed Companies of any such net capital
loss,  foreign  tax  credit or research and development credit, be entitled to a
refund  or  credit  in  respect  of  any net capital loss, foreign tax credit or
research  and  development credit of Pfizer or any of Pfizer's Affiliates (other
than the Conveyed Companies), Pfizer shall be entitled to receive prompt payment
from  Purchaser  of  any  such  amount  to  the  extent Purchaser has previously
received  a refund or credit from a carryback to Pfizer's return.  Purchaser and
the  Conveyed  Companies  shall be entitled to retain, or receive prompt payment
from  Pfizer  of, any refund or credit with respect to Taxes with respect to any
taxable  period beginning after the Closing Date relating to any of the Conveyed
Companies.  Purchaser  and Pfizer shall equitably apportion any refund or credit
with  respect  to Taxes with respect to a Straddle Period in a manner consistent
with  the  principles set forth in Section 7.4(g)(iii).  If a refund for which a
payment  has  been  made  to  a  party hereto (the recipient) by the other party
hereto  (the  payor)  pursuant to this Section 7.4(e) is subsequently reduced or
disallowed, the recipient shall indemnify the payor for any Tax assessed against
the  Payor  by  reason  of  such  reduction  or  disallowance.
(f)     Tax  Cooperation.  Each of Purchaser and Pfizer shall provide each other
---     ----------------
with  such  information  and  records  and make such of its officers, directors,
employees  and  agents  available  as  may reasonably be requested by such other
party in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return or any audit or other
proceeding  that  relates  to  the  Conveyed  Companies  or  the  Asset  Selling
Corporations.  Purchaser  shall, within 120 days after the Closing Date, prepare
or  cause  the  Conveyed  Companies  to prepare, in a manner consistent with the
Conveyed  Companies'  past  practice,  the tax work paper preparation package or
packages  necessary  to enable Pfizer to prepare Tax Returns Pfizer is obligated
to  prepare  or  cause  to  be  prepared.
(g)     Tax  Indemnification.
---     --------------------
(i)     Pfizer  shall  indemnify,  defend  and hold Purchaser and its Affiliates
harmless  from  and  against  all  liability  for U.S. and non-U.S. Taxes of the
Conveyed  Companies  for  any  taxable period that ends on or before the Closing
Date  and  the  portion  of  any  Straddle  Period  ending  on the Closing Date,
including  (A)  all  liability  for  any  breach of Pfizer's representations and
warranties  contained  in  Article  V or covenants contained in this Article VII
with  respect  to  the  Conveyed  Companies;  (B)  all liability (as a result of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) or otherwise) for Taxes of Pfizer or any
     other  Person (other than the Conveyed Companies) which is or has ever been
affiliated  with  the  Conveyed  Companies,  or with whom the Conveyed Companies
otherwise  join  or have ever joined (or are or have ever been required to join)
in  filing  any  consolidated,  combined  or  unitary  Tax  Return, prior to the
Closing;  (C)  all  liability  for  Taxes  of  the  Business which constitutes a
Retained  Liability  pursuant  to  Section  2.6  of  this Agreement; and (D) all
liability  for  reasonable legal, accounting and appraisal fees and expense with
respect  to  any  item  described in clause (A) or (B) above; provided, however,
                                                              --------  -------
that  Pfizer's indemnity obligation for Taxes pursuant to this Section 7.4(g)(i)
shall  be  reduced  by  refunds of Taxes (excluding carrybacks from post-Closing
Date  years  to  the  extent  permitted  hereunder) with respect to such periods
received  after  the  Closing Date by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and not
previously  remitted  to Pfizer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pfizer shall not
indemnify,  defend  or hold harmless Purchaser or any of its Affiliates from any
liability  for Taxes (a) attributable to (i) any election under any provision of
the  Code (including Section 338(g)) or any other action taken, (ii) any failure
to  comply  with  Law  or (iii) any other failure to act which constitutes gross
negligence  or  willful  misconduct  on  the  part  of  Purchaser  or any of its
Affiliates that (A) would otherwise give rise to a Pfizer Tax indemnity payment,
(B) is made after the Closing by Purchaser, any of its Affiliates (including the
Conveyed  Companies) or any transferee of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and
(C)  is  not  expressly  required  or  otherwise  expressly contemplated by this
Agreement  and  has  not  been  approved  in writing by Pfizer (a "Purchaser Tax
                                                                   -------------
Act");  or  (b) to the extent accrued or reserved against in the Working Capital
Statement.  Purchaser  shall pay to Pfizer the amount of Tax savings realized by
Purchaser  or  any  of  its  Affiliates  as  a  result  of  any  loss  or credit
carryforwards of the Conveyed Companies existing as of the Closing Date, as soon
as practicable after such savings may be realized.  Further, Pfizer's obligation
to  indemnify,  defend  or hold harmless Purchaser or any of its Affiliates from
any  liability  shall  terminate effective with the expiration of the applicable
statute  of  limitations  (including  extensions)  in respect of such liability.
(ii)     Purchaser  shall, and shall cause the Conveyed Companies to, indemnify,
defend  and hold Pfizer and its Affiliates harmless from and against, (A) except
to  the  extent Pfizer is otherwise required to indemnify Purchaser for such Tax
pursuant  to  Section  7.4(g)(i),  all  liability  for  Taxes  of  the  Conveyed
Companies;  (B)  all  liability  for  Taxes attributable to a Purchaser Tax Act,
including  all  liability  for Taxes resulting from Purchaser making an election
under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to its purchase or deemed purchase
of  any  of the Conveyed Companies, and any additional Taxes arising as a result
of  a  reduction in the amount of foreign tax credits and other Tax credits that
are  available  to Pfizer (computed as if Pfizer did not utilize any foreign tax
credits  or  other  Tax credits, net operating losses or other Tax attributes to
reduce  the  additional  Taxes);  and  (C)  all  liability for reasonable legal,
accounting and appraisal fees and expenses with respect to any item described in
clause  (A)  or  (B) above.  Purchaser's obligation to indemnify, defend or hold
harmless  Pfizer  or  any  of  its Affiliates from any liability shall terminate
effective  with  the  expiration  of  the  applicable  statute  of  limitations
(including  extensions)  in  respect  of  such  liability.
(iii)     In  the  case  of  any  Straddle  Period:
(A)     The  periodic  Taxes  of  the  Conveyed  Companies that are not based on
income or receipts (e.g., property Taxes) for the portion of any Straddle Period
                    ----
     ending on the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Period") shall be computed
                                      ----------------------
based upon the ratio of the number of days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
number  of  days  in  the  entire  Tax  Period;  and
(B)     Taxes  of  the  Conveyed Companies for the Pre-Closing Tax Period (other
than  Taxes  described  in Section 7.4(g)(iii)(A) above) shall be computed as if
such  taxable  period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date and,
in the case of any Taxes of the Conveyed Companies attributable to the ownership
by  the  Conveyed  Companies  of any equity interest in any partnership or other
"flowthrough"  entity,  as  if  a  taxable  period  of such partnership or other
"flowthrough"  entity  ended  as  of  the close of business on the Closing Date.
(iv)     Any  indemnity  payment  required  to  be made pursuant to this Section
7.4(g)  shall  be  made within 30 days after the indemnified party makes written
demand  upon the indemnifying party, but in no case earlier than 5 Business Days
prior  to  the  date  on which the relevant Taxes are required to be paid to the
relevant  taxing  authority  (including  estimated  Tax  payments).
(v)     Any  indemnity  payment made pursuant to this Section 7.4(g), other than
for  Straddle  Period  Taxes pursuant to the first sentence of Section 7.4(b)(B)
shall  be  treated  as  an  adjustment  to  the  price paid by Purchaser for the
relevant  Conveyed  Company  for Tax purposes, unless a final determination with
respect to the indemnified party or any of its Affiliates causes such payment to
be  treated other than as an adjustment to the purchase price for federal Income
Tax  purposes.
(h)     Timing Adjustment.  In the event that a final determination (which shall
---     -----------------
     include the execution of an IRS Form 870-AD or successor form) results in a
timing  difference (e.g., an acceleration of income or delay of deductions) that
                    ----
would  increase  Pfizer's  liability  for  Taxes pursuant to this Section 7.4 or
results  in a timing difference (e.g., an acceleration of deductions or delay of
                                 ----
income)  that  would  increase  Purchaser's liability for Taxes pursuant to this
Section  7.4,  Purchaser  or  Pfizer,  as  the  case may be, shall promptly make
payments to Pfizer or Purchaser as and when Purchaser or Pfizer, as the case may
be, actually realizes any Tax benefits as a result of such timing difference (or
under  such  other  method  for  determining  the  present  value  of  any  such
anticipated  Tax  benefits  as  agreed to by the parties).  Such Tax benefit for
federal,  state  and  local  Income  Tax purposes shall be computed for any year
using Purchaser's or Pfizer's, as the case may be, actual tax liability with and
without  giving  effect  to  such  timing  difference.
(i)     Tax  Contests.
---     -------------
(A)     If  a claim shall be made by any taxing authority (a "Tax Claim") which,
                                                              ---------
if  successful, might result in an indemnity payment pursuant to Section 7.4(g),
the indemnifying party shall promptly notify the indemnified party of such claim
     no  later  than  20  Business  Days after such Tax Claim is made; provided,
                                                                       --------
however,  the  failure to provide such notification within such period shall not
    ---
release  the  indemnifying  party from its indemnification obligations hereunder
except  to  the  extent  the  indemnified  party  is  prejudiced  thereby.
(B)     With  respect to any Tax Claim relating to a taxable period ending on or
before  the  Closing Date or relating to or affecting a Consolidated Tax Return,
Pfizer  shall  control  all  proceedings  and  may  make  all decisions taken in
connection  with  such  Tax  Claim (including selection of counsel) and, without
limiting  the foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue or forego any and all
administrative  appeals,  proceedings,  hearings and conferences with any taxing
authority  with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either pay the
Tax  claimed and sue for a refund where applicable law permits such refund suits
or contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner.  Purchaser shall be entitled
to  be  informed of such Tax Claim within a reasonable time after such Tax Claim
is  asserted  and  the  developments  with  respect  to  such  Tax  Claim at any
administrative  meeting,  conference,  hearing  or  other  proceeding.
(C)     Except  as otherwise provided in Section 7.4(i)(B), Pfizer and Purchaser
shall  jointly  control  and  participate in all proceedings taken in connection
with  any Tax Claim relating to Taxes of the Conveyed Companies for any Straddle
Period.  Neither  Pfizer  nor  Purchaser shall settle any such Tax Claim without
the  prior  written  consent  of  the  other,  which  shall  not be unreasonably
withheld.
(D)     Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  Section  7.4(i)(B), Purchaser shall
control  all  proceedings with respect to Taxes for any taxable period beginning
after  the  Closing  Date.
(E)     Purchaser,  the  Conveyed  Companies  and  each  of  their  respective
Affiliates,  on  the  one hand, and Pfizer and its respective Affiliates, on the
other,  shall  cooperate  in  contesting  any Tax Claim, which cooperation shall
include  the  retention and (upon request) the provision to the requesting party
of  records  and  information  which  are reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim,
making  employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information  or  explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at
proceedings  relating  to  such  Tax Claim.  Purchaser shall execute and deliver
such  powers  of  attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the
intent  of  this  Section.
Section 7.5     Employees and Employee Benefits.  (a)  Employees (US) - Offer of
                -------------------------------        -------------------------
     Employment;  Continued  Employment;  Severance.  Purchaser  agrees to offer
     ----------------------------------------------
employment as of 12:01 a.m. on the day immediately following the Closing Date to
each  Employee (US) (or to cause the Conveyed Companies to offer to continue the
employment of each of their Employees (US)) in the same or a comparable position
and  at a rate of pay at least equal to such Employee's rate of pay in effect on
the  Closing  Date  and with benefits which shall be substantially comparable in
the  aggregate to the employee benefits as are set forth in Schedule 7.5(a) and,
                                                            ---------------
in  the  event  of  Purchaser's  termination  of employment of an Employee (US),
identical  to  such  other  benefits  as are set forth in the Employee Severance
Program  in Schedule 7.5(a)(i).  The employee benefit plans, programs, policies,
            ------------------
and  fringe  benefits  of  Purchaser set forth on Schedule 7.5(a)(iii), provided
                                                  --------------------
Purchaser makes an additional fully vested contribution of 3.5% of each Affected
Employee's pay (to include base salary, bonus, overtime, shift differentials and
premium  pay)  for the balance of the two-year benefit comparabilty period (such
period  shall be reduced by the period of time during which Purchaser replicates
Pfizer's  employee  benefit  plans),  to  the  Pension  Plus Match Account to be
established for each Affected Employee under Purchaser's Defined Benefit Pension
Plan (regardless of whether such Affected Employee is otherwise a participant in
such  plan or Purchaser's Savings Plan) shall be deemed substantially comparable
in  the  aggregate  to the employee benefit plans, programs, policies and fringe
benefits  of  Pfizer.  Such  contribution  by  Purchaser  to Purchaser's Defined
Benefit  Pension  Plan shall be made on each of the first and second anniversary
of  the  Closing  Date.  Nothing  herein  shall  require  Purchaser  to  provide
post-retirement  medical  or  other  post-retirement  welfare  benefits  to  any
Affected  Employee  or  their  dependents.  For  purposes  of  this Section 7.5,
references to "pay" shall include base pay plus any commission, bonus, incentive
pay, overtime, premium pay, and shift differentials, but shall exclude retention
and  retention/performance  allowances.  Such  employment shall be at a location
that  is  no more than 30 miles farther than the distance between the employee's
home  and  the  employee's principal place of employment as of the Closing Date.
Schedule 7.5(a)(ii) (which shall be updated by Pfizer on the Closing Date) shall
 ------------------
set  forth  the  name of each Employee (US), and his or her current rate of pay,
position  and  date of hire.  Purchaser shall have no obligation whatsoever with
regard  to  (i) former employees of the Business who are retired, or who are not
or  shall  have  ceased  to  be  Employees  (US) as of the Closing Date, or (ii)
employees  who  do  not  accept  the  offer  of  employment  or  continuation of
employment  given by Purchaser in accordance with this Section 7.5(a) and do not
work  for Purchaser or its Affiliates for at least one day, unless such employee
is  otherwise  an  Affected Employee.  Purchaser shall be solely responsible for
all  salaries or wages (including commissions, bonuses, incentive pay, overtime,
premium  pay,  shift differentials and severance pay) accruing after the Closing
Date  with  respect  to  the  Affected  Employees.  The  following conditions of
employment  shall  remain unchanged until the date immediately following the 2nd
anniversary  of the Closing Date: (i) the location requirement described in this
Section  7.5(a)  and  (ii)  the  pay  and  benefits  comparability  requirements
described  in  this  Section  7.5(a),  and the obligations described in Schedule
                                                                        --------
7.5(a)(i).  Notwithstanding  the foregoing sentence, Purchaser or its Affiliates
    -----
may  terminate  an  Employee  (US)  during  such  2-year  period  due  to
"Performance-Related  Terminations"  or  "Curtailment  or  Cessation  of
Operations/Reorganization/Position Elimination" (as those terms are described in
Exhibit  E,  the  Pfizer  Employee  Separation Plan) as long as Purchaser or its
Affiliates  (i)  first  offers  such  employee the opportunity to sign a release
agreement  in  substantially  the  form attached hereto as Exhibit F (individual
termination)  or  Exhibit  G  (group  termination), as appropriate, (ii) pays or
otherwise  provides  severance  benefits  to  such  employee  in accordance with
Pfizer's  Employee  Separation Plan and (iii) provides benefits continuation and
other  benefits  as  set  forth  in  Schedule 7.5(a)(i), provided, however, that
                                     ------------------  --------  -------
Purchaser  or  its  Affiliates  may terminate an Employee (US) without paying or
otherwise  providing severance benefits to such employee in accordance with such
policy and practice if such employee is terminated, in the reasonable discretion
of  Purchaser  or  its  Affiliates,  "for cause" (as such term is defined in the
Pfizer  Employee  Separation  Plan).  Notwithstanding  anything  to the contrary
herein,  on  the  date  immediately following the 2nd anniversary of the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall provide pay and benefits and severance plans, programs and
policies  which  are  no  less  favorable than those provided to other similarly
situated  employees of Purchaser, as the case may be.  Except with regard to any
defined  benefit  pension plans maintained by Purchaser, employees shall also be
provided  credit by Purchaser for all service with Pfizer and its Affiliates, to
the  same extent as such service was credited for such purpose by Pfizer and its
Affiliates,  under (x) all employee benefit plans, programs, policies and fringe
benefits  of  Purchaser  described  in  Schedule  7.5(a)(iii)  for  purposes  of
                                        ---------------------
eligibility,  vesting and benefit accrual, and (y) severance plans, programs and
policies  for  purposes  of  calculating  the  amount  of  each  such employee's
severance  benefits.
(b)     Qualified  Plans.  (i)  Pfizer  sponsors  the  following  Plans covering
---     ----------------
Employees  (US)  which  are intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
---
Code (collectively, the "Pfizer Qualified Plans"):  the Pfizer Savings Plan (the
--                       ----------------------
     "Savings  Plan")  and  the  Warner-Lambert Retirement Plan (the "Retirement
      -------------                                                   ----------
Plan").  Effective  as  of the Closing Date, the Seller Corporations shall cause
   -
each  Affected  Employee  who  is  a participant in one or both Pfizer Qualified
Plans  to become one hundred percent (100%) vested in his or her accrued benefit
under  each  such  Plan.
(ii)     Effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the day immediately following the Closing
     Date,  each  participant  in  a  Pfizer  Qualified  Plan who is an Affected
Employee shall cease to be an active participant under each such Plan, and shall
become  a  participant  in  the  Purchaser Qualified Plans as listed in Schedule
                                                                        --------
7.5(b)(ii)  (such  plans  being  collectively  referred  to  as  the  "Purchaser
    ------                                                             ---------
Qualified  Plans").  Purchaser  shall  ensure that the Purchaser Qualified Plans
    ------------
will  recognize  the  accrued  service of Affected Employees with Pfizer and its
Affiliates  up to and including the Closing Date for all purposes, to the extent
credited under the terms of the corresponding Pfizer Qualified Plan as in effect
on  the  Closing  Date.  As  soon  as practicable after the Closing Date, Pfizer
shall  deliver  such  accrued service data to Purchaser.  Purchaser shall assume
all  liabilities  with respect to Employees (US) under Purchaser Qualified Plans
for  benefits  accrued  after  the  Closing  Date.
(iii)     If  Purchaser maintains or establishes a Purchaser Qualified Plan that
corresponds  with  the  Savings  Plan  ("Purchaser  Savings Plan"), Pfizer shall
                                         -----------------------
cause,  as  soon  as  practicable  after  the  Closing Date, the Savings Plan to
transfer the account balance of each Affected Employee to such Purchaser Savings
Plan  as  of  the  valuation  date  next  preceding  the  date  of  transfer.
(iv)     With  respect  to  the Purchaser Qualified Plan that corresponds to the
Retirement Plan (the "Purchaser Defined Benefit Pension Plan"), Pfizer agrees to
                      --------------------------------------
calculate and transfer to such Purchaser Defined Benefit Pension Plan as soon as
practicable  after  the Closing Date the amount required under Section 414(l) of
the  Code,  reflecting  the  appropriate  PBGC  assumptions  in effect as of the
Closing Date.  In the event the amount required under Section 414(l) of the Code
is less than the aggregate ABO determined as of the Closing Date of the Affected
Employees  under the Retirement Plan, Pfizer shall pay in cash (plus interest at
LIBOR  minus  1/8%  for the period from the Closing Date to the payment date) to
Purchaser upon, or as soon as practicable after, the Closing Date the difference
between  the aggregate ABO and the amount of assets transferred to the Purchaser
Defined  Benefit  Pension  Plan  pursuant  to  Section  414(l)  of the Code.  In
calculating  the aggregate ABO for Affected Employees under the Retirement Plan,
Pfizer  shall  utilize  the  same  assumptions  (including  the  discount  rate
assumption)  that  it  used  in  its  most  recent  financial disclosure for the
Retirement Plan.  Service with Pfizer and its Affiliates shall be counted toward
vesting  and  eligibility  under  the  Purchaser  Defined  Benefit Pension Plan.
Purchaser shall recognize service with Pfizer and its Affiliates with respect to
the  level of benefit accrual to be prospectively credited to such Employee from
the  Closing  Date forward under the Purchaser Defined Benefit Pension Plan (but
no benefit accrual under the provisions of the Purchaser Defined Benefit Pension
Plan  shall  be  attributable  to  such  service  to Pfizer and its Affiliates).
Purchaser  shall cause the Purchaser Defined Benefit Pension Plan to maintain as
a  separate  frozen  accrued benefit under such plan the accrued benefit of each
Affected  Employee  under the Retirement Plan determined as of the Closing Date.
Purchaser  shall  recognize  service  with  both  Pfizer  and its Affiliates and
Purchaser  for  determining  any  early  retirement  subsidies  that  may  be
attributable  to  determining  such  frozen  accrued  benefit.  In addition, the
optional  form  of benefit subsidies that are provided under the Retirement Plan
shall  be  provided on the frozen accrued benefit.  As soon as practicable after
the  Closing  Date, Pfizer shall deliver such accrued service date to Purchaser.
(v)     Purchaser, on the one hand, and Pfizer, on the other hand, each agree to
use commercially reasonable efforts and to cooperate with the other to effect as
promptly  as  possible  the  transfers  of  assets  contemplated  under Sections
7.5(b)(iii) and 7.5(b)(iv), subject to Pfizer's receipt of satisfactory evidence
that  the  Purchaser  Qualified  Plans are in compliance with all relevant Laws;
such  evidence  shall  include  a  current determination letter from the IRS and
representations  satisfactory to Pfizer from the administrators of the Purchaser
Qualified  Plans.  If  a  current  determination  letter  has not been obtained,
Purchaser  and  its  counsel  shall  provide a representation that the Purchaser
Qualified Plans are qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and that a timely
application  for  a determination letter is pending and that Purchaser will take
all  necessary  steps  to  secure  a determination letter.  Pfizer and Purchaser
shall  each  bear their own individual costs regarding the transfer of assets as
contemplated  under  Sections  7.5(b)(iii)  and  7.5(b)(iv).
(vi)     Pfizer shall deliver to Purchaser as soon as practicable following such
request,  all  data  and records reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection
with  its  administration  of  retirement  benefits for those Affected Employees
transferred  to  the  Purchaser  Qualified  Plans.
(c)     Non-Qualified  Plans.  Certain  of the Affected Employees participate in
---     --------------------
(i)  the  Warner-Lambert  Excess  Savings  Plan,  (ii) the Warner-Lambert Excess
Retirement  plan,  (iii)  the  Pfizer  Supplemental  Savings  Plan,  (iv)  the
Warner-Lambert  Incentive  Compensation Plan and (v) the Warner-Lambert Overseas
Retirement Plan.  The pre-Closing liabilities associated with the Warner-Lambert
     Excess  Savings  Plan,  the Warner-Lambert Overseas Retirement Plan and the
Warner-Lambert Incentive Compensation Plan shall remain as liabilities of Pfizer
after  the  Closing and Pfizer shall administer the benefits payable under those
arrangements.  Upon the Closing, Pfizer shall transfer to Purchaser assets equal
to  the aggregate accrued liability attributable to the Affected Employees as of
the Closing Date of each non-qualified plan described in this Section 7.5(c)(ii)
and  (iii),  and  Purchaser  shall  assume  all  liabilities attributable to the
Affected  Employees  incurred  under said non-qualified plans as of the Closing.
In  measuring  the  liabilities attributable to the Affected Employees under the
non-qualified  plans,  Pfizer  shall use the assumptions (including the discount
rate  assumption)  utilized  in its most recent financial disclosures concerning
the  non-qualified  plans.
(d)     Accrued  Entitlements.  Purchaser  shall  be responsible for all accrued
---     ---------------------
entitlements,  including vacation days, for Affected Employees as of the Closing
--
Date  consistent  with  Pfizer's  policies  in  respect  thereof.
(e)     Medical and Welfare Plan Obligations.  Effective on the Closing Date and
---     ------------------------------------
continuing  until  on or about December 31, 2003, each Employee (US) who accepts
employment  with  Purchaser  shall  continue  to  be  eligible  for  and/or  to
participate  in health and welfare plans that are substantially similar to those
plans  currently  maintained  by Pfizer, and Pfizer shall provide administrative
services  with  respect  to such plans pursuant to the terms of Article 2 of the
Transition  Services  Agreement.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing, nothing herein
shall  be  construed  as  an  obligation by Purchaser to provide post-retirement
medical or other post-retirement welfare benefits to any Affected Employees, and
Purchaser  expressly  disclaims  any obligation to do so.  Effective on or about
January  1,  2004,  each Employee (US) shall be eligible to participate in those
medical  and  welfare  benefit  plans  maintained by Purchaser for its similarly
situated  Employees,  and  Purchaser  agrees  to  waive  any  waiting periods or
limitations  for  preexisting  conditions  under  its  medical,  dental,  life
insurance, short-term and long-term disability plans, and any other similar such
plans,  and  shall  ensure  that such employees are given credit for any amounts
paid  toward  deductibles, out-of-pocket limits or other fees on or prior to the
Closing  Date.  Claims  by  an Affected Employee for medical and dental services
rendered  as  of  12:01  a.m.  on the day immediately following the Closing Date
shall  be  the  responsibility  of  the  medical  and  dental  plans provided by
Purchaser  to  such  employees.  Claims incurred for medical and dental services
for Affected Employees rendered prior to and including the Closing Date shall be
the responsibility of the group medical and dental plans of Pfizer or the Seller
Corporation  which  covered  such  employees  prior to and including the Closing
Date.
(f)     Employees  (non-US)  -  Offer  of  Employment;  Continued  Employment;
---     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Severance.  Purchaser  agrees  to  offer  employment as of 12:01 a.m. on the day
---     -
immediately  following  the  Closing Date to each Employee (non-US) (or to cause
---
the  Conveyed  Companies  to  offer  to continue the employment of each of their
--
Employees (non-US)) in the same or a comparable position and at a rate of pay at
--
least  equal  to  such  employee's rate of pay in effect on the Closing Date and
with  benefits  which  shall  be  substantially  comparable  to  such employee's
benefits  which are in effect on the Closing Date.  Schedule 7.5(f) (which shall
                                                    ---------------
be  updated  by  Pfizer  on  the  Closing Date) shall set forth the name of each
Employee  (non-US).  Purchaser  agrees  to deal with employee matters, including
offers  of  employment,  compensation,  benefits  (including Foreign Plans), and
severance payment and benefit continuation matters for Employees (non-US) in the
same  manner  as the manner in which Employees (US) matters have been dealt with
in  this  Article  VII, subject to such modifications as are necessary to comply
with  applicable Laws of the foreign countries and their political subdivisions;
applicable  labor agreements; local Pfizer policies, programs and practices; and
established  local  business  custom in similar transactions.  In the event that
Purchaser  is  required  to  assume  any  unfunded liabilities under any Foreign
Plans,  such  liabilities under such Foreign Plans shall be accrued and provided
for  on  the  Closing  balance  sheet.  In  measuring the liabilities under such
unfunded  Foreign  Plans, Pfizer shall value those liabilities on the same basis
that  it  valued such liabilities for accounting and funding purposes within the
foreign  jurisdiction  in  which  such Plans are maintained.  With regard to the
Foreign  Plans  maintained  in  Japan,  France,  Canada  and Taiwan, Pfizer will
transfer  to  the  analogous  Purchaser  Plan  as  soon as practicable after the
Closing Date the aggregate ABO of the Affected Employees who participate in such
Foreign  Plans,  or  such  amount  as  shall  be  required  by applicable Law or
regulation  of  the applicable jurisdiction.  In the event such legally-required
amount  is  less  than the ABO, Pfizer shall pay in cash (plus interest at LIBOR
minus 1/8% for the period from the Closing Date to the payment date) upon, or as
soon  as  practicable  after,  the  Closing  Date,  the  difference  between the
aggregate  ABO  and  the  amount  of  assets legally required to be transferred.
(i)     The  calculation  of the ABO for purposes of Section 7.5(b)(iv) and this
Section  7.5(f)  shall be subject to review and approval of Purchaser's actuary,
but  such  approval shall relate only to the calculation of the ABO on the basis
set  forth  in  this  Agreement  and  not  as  to  the  assumptions  themselves.
(ii)     Pfizer  will use its best efforts to effect the transfer of sponsorship
of  the  Foreign  Plan  in  the  United Kingdom (the "UK Wilkinson Sword Pension
                                                      --------------------------
Plan")  from  Wilkinson  Sword  to  Pfizer  prior  to  the  Closing  Date.
(g)     Employees  (US) and Employees (non-US) Absent on Disability or Leaves of
---     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Absence  -  Offer  of  Employment;  Continued  Employment;  Severance.  When  an
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Employee  (US)  or  Employee (non-US) who is, on the Closing Date, absent due to
-------
illness or on short-term disability (including maternity disability) or workers'
--
     compensation  seeks  to  return to active employment, Purchaser shall offer
immediate  employment  to  such employee in the same or a comparable position to
that  which the employee occupied before such absence but only at such time that
such  employee is medically capable of performing the essential functions of the
position  occupied  immediately  before  such  absence.  In  addition, immediate
employment  in  the same or comparable positions will be offered by Purchaser to
those  Employees (US) and Employees (non-US) returning from authorized leaves of
absence  such  as  parental,  family  and  medical, and military leaves or other
leaves  where  return  to  work  is  subject  to  statutory  requirements.  Such
employees,  returning  from  disability or leaves of absence, will be subject to
the  same  pay,  benefits, severance and all other policies, plans, programs and
arrangements  as stipulated in this Article VII for similarly situated Employees
(US)  and  Employees  (non-US).
(h)     No  Third  Party  Beneficiaries.  Except  as  expressly provided herein,
---     -------------------------------
nothing  contained  herein, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any
---
Employee of Seller Corporations or the Conveyed Companies any benefits under any
benefit  plans,  programs,  policies  or other arrangements, including severance
benefits  or  right  to employment or continued employment with Purchaser or any
Affiliate of Purchaser for any period by reason of this Agreement.  In addition,
the  provisions  of  this Agreement, in particular this Article VII, are for the
sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and are not for the benefit of any
third  party.
(i)     Warner-Lambert  Enhanced  Severance  Plan.  Pfizer  will  retain
---     -----------------------------------------
responsibility  for  all  liabilities  pursuant  to  the Warner-Lambert Enhanced
---     ----
Severance  Plan  ("ESP")  incurred on or prior to the Closing Date including any
---                ---
payments  and  benefits due as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
--
Agreement  or  as  a result of the Closing.  With respect to the individuals set
forth  on  Schedule  7.5(i),  Purchaser  shall  assume  responsibility  for such
-          ----------------
liabilities  and  obligations  pursuant  to  the  ESP  incurred  as  a result of
Purchaser's actions in terminating (either actually or constructively as defined
in the ESP) the employment of any individual listed on Schedule 7.5(i) after the
                                                       ---------------
Closing  Date  and  within  the  protection period applicable to such individual
under  the  ESP.
Section 7.6     Certain Dividends, Etc.  Notwithstanding any provision herein to
                -----------------------
     the  contrary  (including  Section  7.2),  each  Conveyed  Company  will be
permitted  to  distribute  to  Pfizer  or  any  one  or  more  of its designated
Affiliates,  effective  as of the Closing Date, up to the amount of its retained
earnings accrued through the Closing Date, but not in excess of cash on hand and
in no event to be effected through any additional borrowings from Pfizer, any of
its  Affiliates  or  any  third  person.  In addition, Pfizer and its Affiliates
shall  be  permitted  to  continue  to  conduct  their activities regarding cash
management  matters  relating  to  the  Business  (including  the collection and
transfer  of  accounts  receivable  and  disbursement  of  funds  by  Pfizer) in
accordance  with the practice in effect as of the date of this Agreement, except
as  may  be  affected  by actions taken pursuant to Section 2.4(b) and as may be
necessary  to  settle  intercompany  payables  and  receivables  and  to  effect
intercompany  funding.  After the Closing Date, Purchaser shall take all actions
(or  shall  cause  its  Affiliates  to take all actions) reasonably requested by
Pfizer  to effect the provisions of this Section 7.6.  Any action taken pursuant
to  this  Section 7.6 after the Closing Date shall be deemed for the purposes of
Section  2.8  to have occurred on the Closing Date and shall be reflected in the
calculation of the Working Capital of the Business pursuant to such Section 2.8.
Section  7.7     Resignations;  Delivery of Surveys and Title Policies.  (a)  At
                 -----------------------------------------------------
the  Closing  and  except as otherwise requested by Purchaser in writing, Pfizer
will deliver to Purchaser the resignations (effective on or prior to Closing) of
all  directors  and non-employee officers of each of the Conveyed Companies from
their  positions.
(b)     Pfizer  shall,  and  shall cause its Affiliates to, deliver to Purchaser
copies  of  all  surveys  and  title  policies relating to each Facility that is
located  in  the  United States and the appropriate evidence of ownership of the
Facilities  that  are  located  outside  of  the United States promptly upon the
receipt  of  such  surveys,  title  policies  and  evidence  of  ownership.
Section  7.8     Bulk  Transfer  Laws.  Purchaser  acknowledges  that the Seller
                 --------------------
Corporations  have  not taken, and do not intend to take, any action required to
comply  with  any  applicable  bulk  sale or bulk transfer laws or similar laws.
SECTION 7.9      Noncompetition.  (a)  Subject to the provisions of this Section
                 --------------
7.9,  Pfizer  agrees  that for a period of 2 years from the Closing Date, Pfizer
shall  not,  and it shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, compete in any material
respect  with  the  Business  as  conducted as of the Closing Date ("Competitive
                                                                     -----------

this subsection for Pfizer or any of its Subsidiaries (t) to engage, directly or
indirectly,  in  the  research, manufacture or sale of any human pharmaceutical,
human consumer healthcare or animal pharmaceutical product or any medical device

own  any  debt  securities or other debt obligations; (v) to invest in any third
Person  (including  any  corporation  or mutual or other fund) which invests in,
manages  or  operates  a Competitive Activity, so long as Pfizer's or any of its
Subsidiary's  investment  is less than 15% of the outstanding ownership interest
in  such  third Person and Pfizer and its Subsidiaries do not control or conduct
such third Person or Competitive Activity; (w) to invest in, own an interest in,

engaged  primarily in a Competitive Activity; (x) to invest in securities having
less  than  20% of the outstanding voting power of any Person, the securities of
which  are  publicly  traded  or  listed on any securities exchange or automated

extent that Pfizer or a Subsidiary had, directly or indirectly, acquired, or had
a right to acquire, such interest prior to the date of this Agreement; or (z) to
own any equity interests through any employee benefit plan or pension plan.  For
purposes  of  this  Section  7.9,  "engaged primarily in a Competitive Activity"
shall mean that greater than 35% of the aggregate net revenue derived during the
last complete fiscal year of such Person (calculated on a consolidated basis) is
derived  from  the Competitive Activity.  Each investment or acquisition made by
Pfizer  or  its  Subsidiaries which is subject to the provisions of this Section
7.9  must  be  permissible  hereunder  at the time of such investment; provided,
                                                                       --------
however,  that  any  such  investment  which  was  permissible  when made cannot
    ---
thereafter  be  the  basis  of  a  claim  of violation of this Section 7.9.  The
    ---
restrictions contained in this Section 7.9 shall not apply to any portion of the
    --
Business  that  cannot  be  sold  as  a result of any restriction imposed by any
Governmental  Authority,  any  part of the Business subject to the provisions of
7.3(g)  or  activities  in  connection  with  the  Business  pursuant  to  the
Transitional  Services  Agreement.
(b)     For a period of 2 years after the Closing Date, Pfizer shall not, and it
     shall  cause  its  Subsidiaries  not  to, directly or indirectly, induce or
attempt  to  induce  any  officers,  Employees,  representatives  or  agents  of
Purchaser  or  any of its Affiliates engaged solely in the Business to leave the
employ  of  Purchaser  or  any  such Affiliate for employment with Pfizer or its
Subsidiaries,  or  violate  the  terms  of  their  contracts,  or any employment
arrangements,  with Purchaser or any such Affiliate, except that nothing in this
sentence shall restrict or preclude the rights of Pfizer and its Subsidiaries to
make  generalized  searches  for  employees  by the use of advertisements in the
media  (including trade media) or by engaging search firms to engage in searches
that  are  not  targeted  or  focused on the Employees employed by the Business.
(c)     Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in subsection (a) of
this  Section  7.9,  Pfizer  and  its  Subsidiaries  shall not be deemed to have
violated  the  restrictions contained in Section 7.9(a) in the event that Pfizer
or  a  Subsidiary acquires (by purchase of stock or assets, merger or otherwise)
or  invests in any Person engaged primarily in a Competitive Activity; provided,
                                                                       --------
however,  that  Pfizer  or  such Subsidiary thereafter divests a portion of such
-------
Competitive  Activity  within 18 months from the date of purchase of such Person
---
so  as  to  be  in  compliance  with  Section  7.9(a).
(d)     Prior  to  Closing,  except  as  otherwise  agreed  in  writing, neither
Purchaser  nor  any  of  its  Affiliates  will  offer or provide employment on a
full-time  or part-time or consulting basis to any individual employed by Pfizer
or any of its Affiliates, except that nothing in this sentence shall restrict or
preclude the rights of Purchaser and its Affiliates to make generalized searches
for  employees by the use of advertisements in the media (including trade media)
or  by  engaging  search  firms  to  engage in searches that are not targeted or
focused  on  the  employees  of  Pfizer  or  any  of  its  Affiliates.
(e)     Pfizer  and  Purchaser  acknowledge that this Section 7.9 constitutes an
independent  covenant and shall not be affected by performance or nonperformance
of  any  other  provision  of  this Agreement.  Each of Pfizer and Purchaser has
independently consulted with its counsel and after such consultation agrees that
the  covenants  set  forth in this Section 7.9 are reasonable and proper.  It is
the  desire  and  intent  of the parties that the provisions of this Section 7.9
shall  be  enforced  to the fullest extent permissible under applicable Law.  If
all  or  part of this Section 7.9 is held invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced  by  any  Law  or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this
Agreement  shall  nevertheless  remain in full force and effect.  If any part of
this Section 7.9 is held to be excessively broad as to duration, scope, activity
or  subject, such part will be construed by limiting and reducing it so as to be
enforceable  to  the  maximum  extent  compatible  with  applicable  Law.
Section  7.10     Transitional  Services.  At  the Closing, Purchaser and Pfizer
                  ----------------------
shall  enter  into,  execute  and  deliver  a  transitional  services  agreement
substantially  to  the effect set forth in Exhibit C (the "Transitional Services
                                                           ---------------------
Agreement").
 --------
Section  7.11     Transitional  Intellectual Property License Agreement.  At the
                  -----------------------------------------------------
Closing,  Purchaser  and  Pfizer  shall  enter  into,  execute  and  deliver  a
transitional intellectual property license agreement substantially to the effect
set  forth  in  Exhibit  D  (the  "Transitional  Intellectual  Property  License
                                   ---------------------------------------------
Agreement").
        -
Section  7.12     Compliance  with  WARN,  Etc.  With  respect  to WARN or other
                  -----------------------------
similar  Laws  of  any  jurisdiction, Purchaser will timely give any notices and
take  any  other  actions  as  may  be  required  thereunder.
Section  7.13     Foreign  Implementing  Agreements.  As promptly as practicable
                  ---------------------------------
after the date hereof, Pfizer and Purchaser shall cause the Foreign Implementing
Agreements  to  be  prepared  and  executed  by  their  applicable  Affiliates.
Section  7.14     Litigation  Support.  Purchaser  and its Affiliates on the one
                  -------------------
hand  and  Pfizer  and its Affiliates on the other hand will cooperate with each
other in the defense or settlement of any Liabilities (including Product Claims)
or lawsuits involving the Business for which they have responsibility under this
Agreement  by providing the other party and such other party's legal counsel and
other  designated  Persons  access  to  employees,  records,  documents,  data,
equipment,  facilities,  products,  parts,  prototypes  and  other  information
regarding  the Business and its products as such other party may request, to the
extent  maintained  or  under  the possession or control of the requested party.
The  requesting  party  shall  reimburse  the  other  party  for  its reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses paid to third parties in performing its obligations under
this  Section  7.14.  Pfizer  shall keep Purchaser informed of the status of the
pendency  of  the  relevant  Liabilities and lawsuits involving the Business for
which  it  has  responsibility  under  this  Agreement, will advise Purchaser of
material  issues involved in the litigation and will use commercially reasonable
efforts  to  seek a confidentiality agreement with respect to any settlements of
such  lawsuits.  For  so  long  as  any  Liabilities  or  lawsuits involving the
Business  for  which  Pfizer  has  responsibility  under  this  Agreement remain
outstanding,  Purchaser  will  advise  Pfizer of material issues involved in the
lawsuits  involving  the  Business  for which it has responsibility and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek a confidentiality agreement with respect
to  any  settlements  of  such  lawsuits.
Section  7.15     Insurance.  As  of  the  Closing  Date, the coverage under all
                  ---------
insurance  policies  related  to  the  Business (other than such policies as are
included  in the Purchased Assets, if any, or such policies, if any, held by the
Conveyed  Companies  outside  of  the Pfizer Corporate Insurance Program and are
solely  related  to  the Business and are not shared with other Pfizer entities)
shall  continue  in  force  only  for the benefit of the Seller Corporations and
their  Affiliates  and  not  for  the benefit of Purchaser.  Purchaser agrees to
arrange for its own insurance policies with respect to the Business covering all
periods,  provided,  however,  that  to  the  extent any insurance policy covers
          --------   -------
claims  that arose prior to the Closing but are asserted against Purchaser after
the  Closing,  any  payments on such claims by such policy shall be paid over to
Purchaser  to  the  extent such claims were not previously indemnified by Pfizer
(and  Pfizer  shall  use  all reasonable efforts to facilitate the making of and
payment  on  such  claim).
Section  7.16     Trade  Notification;  Notification of Certain Matters; Revised
                  --------------------------------------------------------------
Schedules.  (a)  Pfizer  and  Purchaser shall agree on the method and content of
  -------
the notifications to customers of the sale of the Purchased Assets to Purchaser.
Pfizer  and  Purchaser  agree  that said notifications are to provide sufficient
advance  notice  of  the  sale  and  the  plans  associated  therewith, with the
objective  of  minimizing  any  disruption  of  the  Business.
(b)     Pfizer  shall  give prompt notice to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall give
prompt  notice to Pfizer, of (i) the occurrence of any event which constitutes a
breach  of  a  representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement;
and  (ii) any material failure of Pfizer or the Selling Corporations (on the one
hand)  or  Purchaser  (on the other hand), as the case may be, to comply with or
satisfy  any  covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by  it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
     this  Section  7.16(b)  shall  not  limit  or otherwise affect the remedies
available  hereunder to the party receiving such notice.  Pfizer shall also give
immediate  notice  to  Purchaser  of the occurrence of any other event likely to
result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Business, taken as a whole, including
developments  with  respect  to  New  Products.
(c)     Prior  to  the  Closing,  Pfizer  will  provide  Purchaser with a set of
updated  disclosure  Schedules.  The  provision  of  such  updated  disclosure
Schedules  shall  not  be  deemed  to  cure  any breach of any representation or
warranty  made  in  this Agreement on the date hereof or have any effect for the
purpose  of  determining  the  compliance  by Pfizer with any covenant set forth
herein.  No  update  to  any  Schedule shall be deemed to cure any breach of any
representation  or  warranty  made  in this Agreement as of the Closing Date, or
amend or otherwise modify a condition set forth in Article IV to the extent that
such  update  constitutes  a  Material  Adverse  Change  since  the date hereof.
Section  7.17     Products  Received by Asset Selling Corporations.  If products
                  ------------------------------------------------
of the Business are received by any Asset Selling Corporation after the Closing,
     Pfizer shall cause such Asset Selling Corporation to ship those products to
Purchaser,  or  Purchaser's  stated  representative,  at  Pfizer's  cost  unless
otherwise provided in the Transitional Services Agreement.  Within 15 days after
notification  from  an Asset Selling Corporation, Purchaser shall reimburse such
Asset  Selling  Corporation  for  all  customer  claims  made against such Asset
Selling  Corporation  in  the  form of invoice deductions for amounts associated
with such returned products which are received by such Asset Selling Corporation
or  Asset  Selling  Corporation's  agent  after  the  Closing.
Section  7.18     Audited  Financial Statements.  Within forty-five (45) days of
                  -----------------------------
Closing,  Pfizer  shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser at the cost and expense
of  Purchaser  financial  statements  for  the year ended December 31, 2002 (the
"2002  Financial  Statements"), which shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP,
    ------------------------
and  shall fairly present in all material respects, (i) the financial condition,
assets  and  liabilities of the Business (excluding Excluded Assets and Retained
Liabilities)  as  of  the  dates  therein  specified;  and  (ii)  the results of
operations  of  the  Business  for  the  periods  indicated.  Pfizer  shall  use
commercially  reasonable  efforts  to  cause  KPMG  to review and audit the 2002
Financial  Statements,  which  review  and  audit  shall  be  completed  within
forty-five  (45) days of Closing.  Purchaser shall provide Pfizer with access to
the  books,  records,  and  personnel  of  the Business to the extent reasonably
necessary for Pfizer to prepare the 2002 Financial Statements.  Purchaser agrees
to  reimburse  Pfizer  for  its  actual  cost  of  such  audit.
Section  7.19     New  Products.  (a)  Pfizer  shall use commercially reasonably
                  -------------
efforts  to cause the Conveyed Companies or Asset Selling Corporations after the
date hereof to incur and/or contract to incur in the aggregate not less than 90%
of  the  capital  expenditure  amounts set forth in Schedule 7.19(a) hereto with
                                                    ----------------
respect  to  the  launch  of the Intuition project, and not less than 75% of the
capital expenditure amounts set forth in Schedule 7.19(a) hereto with respect to
                                         ----------------
the launch of the H3 project for the periods set forth in such Schedule.  To the
extent  the  Asset  Selling Corporations and Conveyed Companies do not incur the
amounts  set  forth  in the forgoing sentence with respect to the period between
the  date  hereof  and  the Closing (measured on a pro-rata basis if the Closing
shall occur on a date other than the last day of a month) unless the requirement
to  incur  such  capital  expenditure  is waived by Purchaser ("Required Capital
Expenditure"),  Pfizer  shall  pay  to  Purchaser such amount as is equal to the
excess  of  the  Required Capital Expenditure and the actual capital expenditure
for  such  period.  During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2002,  the Conveyed
Companies  and the Asset Selling Corporations incurred not less than $29,000,000
of  capital  expenditures in the aggregate with respect to projects set forth in
Schedule  7.19(a).
 ----------------
(b)     Pfizer  shall  cause  the Asset Selling Corporations and/or the Conveyed
Companies  to  incur  or commit to incur media slot purchases in connection with
the  launch  of  the  "Intuition"  project  in amounts not less than 100% of the
amounts  set  forth  on  Schedule  7.19(b)  for  the  periods  set forth on such
                         -----------------
Schedule.
(c)     Pfizer  shall, at Closing, transfer to Purchaser all of its rights under
confidentiality  agreements  entered  into  with  other  parties relating to the
Business  or  the  New  Products  and, to the extent any of such confidentiality
agreements are not transferable to Purchaser, Pfizer shall take such actions, at
Purchaser's  expense,  as  Purchaser  may  reasonably  request  to  enforce  the
obligations  of  confidentiality  under  such  agreements.
(d)     Pfizer  shall  cause  the Asset Selling Corporations and/or the Conveyed
Companies to incur or commit to build inventory in connection with the launch of
the  "Intuition" project in a commercially reasonable manner for the periods set
forth  on  Schedule  7.19(d).
           -----------------
(e)     Nothing  contained  in  this  Section  or  otherwise  shall  be deemed a
representation  of  the performance level that will be attained in the future by
the  "Intuition"  project  or  other  new  projects.
Section  7.20     Intercompany  Debt.  Pfizer  shall cause, at or before 60 days
                  ------------------
after  the  Closing  Date,  all  Intercompany  Receivables  and all Intercompany
Payables  as  at Closing (other than (i) Business Intercompany Balances and (ii)
the  Hong Kong Debt) to be paid or otherwise discharged in full, so that no such
Intercompany  Liabilities  or  Intercompany Receivables will be reflected in the
Working  Capital  Statement.  The  net  effect  of  the  remaining  Intercompany
Liabilities  and  Intercompany  Receivables  (comprising  (i)  the  Business
Intercompany  Balances and (ii) the Hong Kong Debt), as reflected in the Working
Capital  Statement  will  be  zero.  Pfizer  shall  be  responsible  for any tax
liability  arising  from  the  actions  taken  pursuant  to  this  Section 7.20.
Section 7.21     Cash and Bank Accounts. (a) With respect to the Business, until
                 ----------------------
the  Closing  Date,  Pfizer  shall  continue to employ cash management practices
consistent  with those employed immediately prior to the date of this Agreement,
including  (i) continuing to collect funds generated from the Business from bank
accounts  of  Pfizer,  the Asset Selling Corporations and the Conveyed Companies
and  through  Pfizer's  standard  cash  management  transfer  system;  and  (ii)
continuing  to  fund the bank accounts of Pfizer, the Asset Selling Corporations
and  the Conveyed Companies in connection with cash disbursements related to the
Business.
(b)     All  collection and disbursement bank accounts of the Conveyed Companies
existing  as  of  the  Closing  Date,  including  the balances therein, shall be
retained  at  Closing  by  such Conveyed Companies, which shall retain liability
with  respect  to  all checks or other drafts or withdrawals written on all such
accounts  prior  to  the  Closing.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  it  is the
intention  of  the parties that the book cash balance of the Conveyed Companies,
in  the  aggregate,  as  of 11:59 PM on the day before the Closing Date shall be
zero  unless  otherwise agreed to by Purchaser.  Further it is the intent of the
parties that the cash book accounts in each foreign jurisdiction where such cash
     cannot be readily remitted to the United States without a tax penalty shall
be  withdrawn  by  Pfizer  prior to Closing so that excess cash beyond the short
term  need of the Business in such jurisdiction is zero.  To the extent that the
actual  cash  balance  at  the  Closing  Date, determined in the ordinary course
consistent  with  past  practices,  is  negative,  such negative amount shall be
treated  as a current liability on the Working Capital Statement.  To the extent
that  the  actual  book cash balance is positive, such excess over zero shall be
treated  as  a  current  asset on the Working Capital Statement.  The balance of
book cash, and the calculation of current assets and liabilities for purposes of
the  Working  Capital Statement, shall be determined consistently, and as of the
same  cut-off time.  All disbursement bank accounts of Pfizer which are utilized
by  the  Business  prior  to  the  Closing  Date shall be retained at Closing by
Pfizer,  which shall retain liability with respect to all checks or other drafts
or  withdrawals written on all such accounts prior to 11:59 PM on the day before
the Closing Date.  At Closing, no other checks or other drafts or withdrawals of
the  Business  shall be made against such accounts, except as may be provided in
the Transitional Services Agreement.  All bona fide checks and other instruments
deposited in Pfizer accounts or accounts of the U.S. Conveyed Companies prior to
the  Closing  Date  and  related  to  the  operations  of the Business which are
returned  to  such accounts thereafter shall be assigned to and shall become the
responsibility  of  Purchaser,  and  Purchaser shall reimburse Pfizer as soon as
practicable  for all such items returned to Pfizer accounts upon the transfer to
Purchaser  of  all rights relating to such checks or instruments and the receipt
by  Purchaser  or  a  Conveyed  Company  of  payment  in cash in respect of such
returned  items; provided that such reimbursement shall be limited to the amount
actually  received  by  Purchaser  or a Conveyed Company and Purchaser shall use
commercially  reasonable  best  efforts  to  collect  such  checks  in  full.
(c)     The  parties  agree  to  cooperate  with each other in managing the cash
accounts  of  the  Business prior to Closing to meet the short term needs of the
Business prior to and after Closing and effectuate the intent of the parties set
forth  in  subsections  (a)  and  (b)  above.
ARTICLE  VIII

INDEMNIFICATION
Section  8.1     Indemnification  by  Pfizer.  (a)  Subject to the provisions of
                 ---------------------------
this  Article  VIII,  Pfizer  agrees  to  defend,  indemnify  and  hold harmless
Purchaser  and  its  Affiliates, and, if applicable, their respective directors,

     claims,  actions, causes of action, judgments, awards, Liabilities, losses,
costs  or  damages  (collectively, a "Loss" or, the "Losses") claimed or arising
                                      ----           ------
directly  from  (i) any Excluded Asset or Retained Liability, (ii) any breach by
any  Seller  Corporation of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement,  (iii)  any  breach  of  any  warranty  or  representation  of Pfizer
contained  in  this  Agreement, or (iv) any non-compliance with bulk transfer or
similar  Laws  to the extent the underlying obligation to the creditor is not an
Assumed  Liability.
(b)     Purchaser  shall  take  and  shall  cause  its  Affiliates  to  take all
commercially  reasonable  steps  to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any
event  which  would  reasonably  be  expected  to,  or  does, give rise thereto,
including  incurring  costs  only  to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the
breach  which  gives  rise  to  the  Loss.
(c)     Nothing  in  this  Section  8.1 shall be construed to impose Liabilities
with  respect  to  Taxes.
Section 8.2     Indemnification by Purchaser.  (a)  Subject to the provisions of
                ----------------------------
     this  Article VIII, Purchaser agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
the  Seller  Corporations  and  their  Affiliates,  and,  if  applicable,  their
respective  directors,  officers, agents, employees, successors and assigns from
and  against  any  and all Loss claimed or arising directly from (i) any Assumed
Liability, (ii) any breach by Purchaser of any of its covenants or agreements in
this  Agreement, (iii) any breach of any warranty or representation of Purchaser
contained  in  this  Agreement, or (iv) events occurring on or after the Closing
Date  in  connection  with  the  Business,  the  Purchased Assets, or the Shares
including  the  use,  ownership,  possession,  operation  or  occupancy  of  any
Facility,  Leased  Real  Property or Real Property, the Intellectual Property of
the  Business,  the  Purchased  Assets, or the Shares from and after the Closing
Date.
(b)     Pfizer  shall  take  and  cause  its Affiliates to take all commercially
reasonable  steps  to  mitigate  any Loss upon becoming aware of any event which
would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto, including incurring
     costs only to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the breach which gives
rise  to  the  Loss.
(c)     Nothing  in  this  Section  8.2 shall be construed to impose Liabilities
with  respect  to  Taxes.
Section  8.3     Notice of Claims.  (a)  If any of the Persons to be indemnified
                 ----------------
under  this  Article VIII (the "Indemnified Party") has suffered or incurred any
                                -----------------
Loss,  the Indemnified Party shall so notify the party from whom indemnification
is  sought  (the "Indemnifying Party") promptly in writing describing such Loss,
                  ------------------
the  amount  or  estimated  amount  thereof,  if  known or reasonably capable of
estimation,  and  the  method  of  computation of such Loss, all with reasonable
particularity  and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement or
any  other  agreement,  instrument  or  certificate delivered pursuant hereto in
respect of which such Loss shall have occurred.  If any action at Law or suit in
     equity  is instituted by or against a third party with respect to which the
Indemnified  Party  intends  to claim any Liability as a Loss under this Article
VIII, the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such
action  or  suit and tender to the Indemnifying Party the defense of such action
or  suit.  A  failure  by the Indemnified Party to give notice and to tender the
defense  of  the  action or suit in a timely manner pursuant to this Section 8.3
shall  not  limit  the  obligation  of the Indemnifying Party under this Article
VIII,  except  (i)  to the extent such Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby,
(ii)  to  the extent expenses are incurred during the period in which notice was
not  provided,  and  (iii)  as  provided  by  Section  8.5.
(b)     Except  when  a notice, report or other filing must be filed immediately
pursuant to Environmental Laws, Purchaser will provide notice and an opportunity
     to  comment  to  Pfizer  before  Purchaser  files any Required Governmental
Report  or  any  other  report,  notification  or  filing  with any Governmental
Authority  or  third  party in connection with an event that would be reasonably
likely  to  result  in  a Loss subject to the indemnification provisions of this
Article.  In  the  event  Purchaser  is required to file a Required Governmental
Report  or  any other report, notification or filing immediately, Purchaser will
provide  simultaneous  notice  to  Pfizer  when  it  files  the  report with the
Governmental  Authority.
Section  8.4     Third  Party  Claims.  (a)  The  Indemnifying  Party under this
                 --------------------
Article  VIII  shall  have  the  right,  but  not the obligation, to conduct and
control, through counsel of its choosing, any third party claim, action, suit or
     proceeding  (a  "Third  Party  Claim"),  and  the  Indemnifying  Party  may
                      -------------------
compromise  or  settle the same, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall give
the  Indemnified  Party advance notice of any proposed compromise of settlement,
and  provided,  further,  that  Third  Party Claims (other than those related to
     --------   -------
Retained  Liabilities)  may  be compromised or settled by the Indemnifying Party
only  with  the  consent  of  the  Indemnified  Party  if any such compromise or
settlement could reasonably be expected to have an adverse impact on the ongoing
Business.  No  Indemnified  Party may compromise or settle any Third Party Claim
for  which  it  is  seeking indemnification hereunder without the consent of the
Indemnifying  Party.  The  Indemnifying Party shall permit the Indemnified Party
to  participate  in,  but  not  control,  the defense of any such action or suit
through  counsel  chosen  by  the  Indemnified Party, provided that the fees and
expenses  of  such  counsel  shall  be  borne  by the Indemnified Party.  If the
Indemnifying  Party  elects not to control or conduct the defense or prosecution
of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party nevertheless shall have the right
to  participate  in  the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and, at
its  own  expense,  to  employ  counsel  of  its  own choosing for such purpose.
(b)     The  parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any
Third  Party  Claim,  with such cooperation to include (i) the retention and the
provision  of the Indemnifying Party records and information that are reasonably
relevant  to  such Third Party Claim, and (ii) the making available of employees
on  a  mutually  convenient  basis  for  proving  additional  information  and
explanation  of  any  material  provided  hereunder.

relating  thereto  is  less  than $75,000 and (ii) in respect of each individual

     the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds $10,000,000, in which event
Pfizer  shall  be  required  to  pay  the  amount  of  such Losses which exceeds
$10,000,000  but  only  up  to a maximum amount of 20% of the Aggregate Purchase
Price,  except with respect to Losses related to breaches of the representations

(b)     Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of this Article VIII, Pfizer shall not

respect of Excluded Environmental Liabilities, (i) for any individual item where

(c)     Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of this Article VIII, Pfizer shall not

Section  8.7     Losses Net of Insurance, Etc.  The amount of any Loss for which
                 ----------------------------
indemnification  is  provided  under  Section 8.1 or 8.2 shall be net of (i) any

Statement,  (ii)  any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party pursuant to any

Losses  were  incurred  by  the  Indemnified Party in connection therewith.  The
Indemnified  Party  shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maximize actual
tax  benefits.  Indemnification  under  this Article VIII shall not be available
unless  the Indemnified Party first uses commercially reasonable efforts to seek
recovery  from  all  Collateral  Sources.  The Indemnifying Party may require an
Indemnified  Party  to  assign  the  rights  to  seek  recovery  pursuant to the
preceding  sentence; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party will then be
responsible  for  pursuing  such  claim at its own expense.  If the amount to be
netted  hereunder  from  any  payment  required  under  Sections  8.1  or 8.2 is
determined  after  payment  by  the  Indemnifying  Party of any amount otherwise
required  to  be  paid  to  an  Indemnified  Party  to  this  Article  VIII, the
Indemnified  Party  shall  repay  to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such
determination,  any amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay
pursuant  to  this  Article VIII had such determination been made at the time of
such  payment.

CONTRARY  CONTAINED  HEREIN,  NO  PARTY  TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIABLE TO OR
OTHERWISE  RESPONSIBLE  TO  ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO OR ANY AFFILIATE OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HERETO FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR FOR DIMINUTION
IN  VALUE  OR  LOST PROFITS THAT ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
PERFORMANCE  OR  BREACH  HEREOF  OR ANY LIABILITY RETAINED OR ASSUMED HEREUNDER.
Section  8.9     Sole  Remedy/Waiver.  The  parties hereto acknowledge and agree
                 -------------------
that  the remedies provided for in this Agreement shall be the parties' sole and
exclusive  remedy  with  respect  to the subject matter of this Agreement, other
than  with  respect to remedies for fraud or intentional breach.  In furtherance
of  the  foregoing, the parties hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of action (including
rights of contributions, if any) known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which
exist  or  may  arise  in  the  future,  that  it  may  have  against the Seller
Corporations  or any of their Affiliates, or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates,
as  the case may be, arising under or based upon any federal, state or local Law
(including  any  such  Law relating to environmental matters or arising under or
based upon any securities Law, common Law or otherwise); provided, however, that
                                                         --------  -------
neither  of the parties waive any rights, claims and causes of action (including

exist  or  may  arise in the future, related to the alleged fraud or intentional
breach  of  this  Agreement  by  the  other  party  hereto.
Section  8.10     Procedures  for Remedial Actions.  Notwithstanding anything to
                  --------------------------------
the contrary in this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in Sections 8.3 and
8.4  of this Agreement, obligations for Remedial Action under this Agreement and
obligations  with respect to the covenants in Sections 7.3(b) and 7.3(c) of this
Agreement  are  subject  to  the  provisions  of  this  Section  8.10.
(a)      Pfizer  shall  have  the  right  but  not the obligation to conduct and
control  the  management  of  a  Remedial  Action  at a property included in the
Purchased  Assets that is subject to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement.
     Pfizer  must  notify  Purchaser,  within  30  days  of receipt of notice of
Purchaser's  claim  for  indemnification for such matter, that (i) it intends to
undertake  said  responsibility  or  (ii)  that  more information is needed from
Purchaser  before  Pfizer  can  reasonably  determine  that Purchaser's claim is
subject to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement.  Purchaser shall promptly
respond  to  such  requests  for  information (to the extent such information is
reasonably  available  to  Purchaser)  and,  within  30  days of receipt of such
information,  Pfizer shall notify Purchaser as to whether it shall undertake the
Remedial  Action.  Prior  to  a determination by Pfizer that it will undertake a
Remedial  Action  pursuant  to  this  Section,  Purchaser  shall take only those
actions necessary to comply with applicable Laws or address conditions that pose
an  immediate  and  acute health risk (unless additional actions are approved by
Pfizer  or  unless  additional  actions are required to comply with Governmental
Orders).
(b)     Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in relation
to  the  Known Milford Issues, Pfizer shall be deemed to have given notice under
Section  8.10(a).
(c)     In  undertaking a Remedial Action pursuant to this Section, Pfizer shall
retain  a qualified independent environmental consultant, which consultant shall
be subject to Purchaser's approval (such approval not to be unreasonably delayed
or  withheld).  Pfizer  shall  consult with Purchaser in all material aspects of
the  Remedial  Action.  Pfizer  shall undertake such Remedial Action in a prompt
and  expeditious fashion in accordance with applicable Laws and shall not cause,
through  its  own inaction, any undue delay in obtaining written notice from the
appropriate  Governmental Authority that no further investigation or remediation
is  necessary  with  respect  to  the  matter  that  is  the  subject  of  the
indemnification claim to meet the Applicable Remedial Action Standards or, if no
Governmental  Authority  is  involved in such matter, a good faith determination
from  its  environmental consultant that no further investigation or remediation
is  required  to  bring  the  Purchased  Assets into conformance with Applicable
Remedial  Action  Standards.  Pfizer  shall  comply  with  all  applicable Laws,
including  all  applicable  Environmental  Laws, with respect to its performance
pursuant  to  this  Section.  Pfizer  shall  provide  copies to Purchaser of all
written  notices,  final  submissions,  final  work plans, and final reports and
shall  give  Purchaser  a reasonable opportunity (at Purchaser's own expense) to
comment  on  any  submissions  Pfizer  intends  to  deliver  or  submit  to  the
appropriate  Governmental Authority prior to said submission.  Purchaser may, at
its  own  expense, hire its own consultants, attorneys or other professionals to
monitor  the Remedial Action, including any field work undertaken by Pfizer, and
Purchaser  shall  provide  Pfizer  with  the  results  of  all  such monitoring.
Notwithstanding  the  above,  Purchaser  shall  not  take any actions that shall
unreasonably interfere with Pfizer's performance of the Remedial Action.  Pfizer
shall  undertake  any such work required herein in a manner designed to minimize
any  disruption, to the greatest extent possible, with the conduct of operations
at  the  Conveyed  Companies.  Purchaser shall allow Pfizer reasonable access to
conduct  any  of  the  work  contemplated  herein and shall fully cooperate with
Pfizer  in  the  performance  of the Remedial Action, including providing Pfizer
with  reasonable  access  to  employees  and  documents  as  necessary.
(d)     Pfizer's  performance  of  any  Remedial Action pursuant to this Section
8.10 shall be deemed to be complete (i) upon receipt of notice from the relevant
Governmental Authority indicating that no further Remedial Action is required to
be  conducted  (a  "Governmental Sign-Off"); or (ii) where allowed by applicable
Environmental Law, a certification from a licensed environmental professional or
its equivalent that no further action is necessary under applicable Laws (unless
within  the  time specified by applicable Law, if any, the relevant Governmental
Authority  determines  that further Remedial Action is required); or (iii) if no
Governmental  Authority  has  asserted  jurisdiction  or if for any other reason
Governmental  Sign-Off  is  not  obtainable,  when  Pfizer's  and  Purchaser's
environmental  consultants  jointly  agree  that  the  Remedial  Action has been
completed  in accordance with the Applicable Remedial Action Standard; provided,
                                                                       ---------
however,  that  if Pfizer's and Purchaser's environmental consultants are unable
--------
to  reach  such  joint  agreement,  then  Pfizer's and Purchaser's environmental
consultants  shall  jointly select an independent third environmental consultant
(the  "Independent  Consultant") acceptable to each of them and that Independent
Consultant  shall  review  all  relevant  information  provided  by  Pfizer  and
Purchaser  and  shall make a determination, which determination shall be binding
on both Pfizer and Purchaser, as to whether the Remedial Action has achieved the
Applicable  Remedial  Action Standard and no further action is required.  In the
event  the  Independent  Consultant  finds that additional work is required, the
scope  and  extent  of  that work shall be negotiated by the parties.  All fees,
costs  and  expenses  of  the Independent Consultant shall be borne equally (50%
each)  by  Pfizer  and  Purchaser.
(e)     If  Pfizer declines to undertake the performance of a Remedial Action as
provided  in  Section  8.10(a),  Purchaser  shall  be  entitled to undertake the
Remedial  Action  to  the Applicable Remedial Action Standards.  Purchaser shall
promptly provide copies to Pfizer of all notices, correspondence, draft reports,
submissions,  work  plans,  and final reports and shall give Pfizer a reasonable
opportunity  (at  Pfizer's  own expense) to comment on any submissions Purchaser
intends  to  deliver  or  submit to any appropriate Governmental Agency prior to
said  submission.  Pfizer  may,  at  its  own expense, hire its own consultants,
attorneys  or  other professionals to monitor the Remedial Action, including any
field  work  undertaken  by Purchaser, and Purchaser shall provide to Pfizer the
results  of  all  such  field work.  Notwithstanding the above, Pfizer shall not
take  any actions that shall unreasonably interfere with Purchaser's performance
of  the  Remedial  Action.  Pfizer's  decision  to  allow Purchaser to undertake
Remedial  Action  hereunder  shall  not  limit  or affect Pfizer's obligation to
indemnify  Purchaser  for said Remedial Action to the Applicable Remedial Action
Standards  as  otherwise  provided  in  this  Agreement.
Section  8.11     Limitation  on  Remedial  Action  Obligations.  (a)
                  ---------------------------------------------
Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  in this Agreement, obligations for
Remedial  Action  under  this  Agreement  and  obligations  with  respect to the
covenants  in  Sections  7.3(b)  and 7.3(c) of this Agreement are subject to the
provisions  of  this  Section 8.11.  Pfizer shall be responsible for the cost of
such  Remedial  Action only to the extent necessary to meet the least stringent,
most  cost-effective standard required by (i) applicable Law and (ii) consistent
with the industrial/commercial use of the Facility as of the Closing Date taking
     into  consideration,  where  applicable,  engineering  and/or institutional
controls  or  a standard pursuant to applicable Environmental Laws acceptable to
the  relevant  Governmental  Authorities making a claim for Remedial Action (the
"Applicable  Remedial  Action  Standard").  Pfizer  shall not be responsible for
  -------------------------------------
those  costs  incurred  in  connection with a Remedial Action to the extent such
  -
costs  arise  from  or  are  exacerbated  by actions of Purchaser, including the
  -
initiation of Remedial Action by Purchaser or at the request of a Third Party in
  -
the  absence  of a requirement of Environmental Law after the Closing Date.  For
purposes  of  this  Section  8.11, in determining the Applicable Remedial Action
Standard,  the  term  Environmental  Law shall mean those Laws applicable to and
governing the Remedial Action at the time the Remedial Action is being conducted
and  as  necessary  to achieve completion of the Remedial Action pursuant to the
terms  of  Section  8.10(d)  of  this  Agreement.
(b)     Unless  Purchaser otherwise agrees, Pfizer shall not seek to impose land
use  restrictions  solely  to  avoid obligations for Remedial Action, and Pfizer
shall not seek to impose land use restrictions and institutional and engineering
     controls  at a Facility where Remedial Action is being conducted other than
those that (i) are required by any Governmental Authority; (ii) do not interfere
with  the  commercial/industrial  use  of the Facility; (iii) prevent the use of
groundwater;  or  (iv)  Pfizer's and Purchaser's environmental consultants agree
are  necessary  because  further Remedial Action will not achieve the Applicable
Remedial Action Standard.  If Pfizer's and Purchaser's environmental consultants
are  unable  to  reach  such  joint  agreement,  the  provisions of Section 8.10
(d)(iii)  shall  apply.
Section  8.12     Limitation  on  Indemnification  for  Non-Compliance  with
                  ----------------------------------------------------------
Environmental  Laws.  (a)  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  in this
         ----------
Agreement, Purchaser shall not be entitled to claim or seek indemnity or defense
     under this Agreement for Environmental Liabilities identified in subsection
(iii) of the definition of Excluded Environmental Liabilities or for breaches of
representations  and  warranties  in  Section  5.11  relating to compliance with
Environmental  Laws  or  Environmental  Permits  to  the  extent  that  such
Environmental  Liabilities arise out of or to the extent that they are increased
as  a  result of (i) changes (including increases or decreases in production) in
operations  at  a  Facility after the Closing; (ii) upgrades to a Facility after
the Closing; (iii) Environmental Laws that are enacted or come into effect after
the  Closing;  or  (iv)  changes  after  the  Closing  to  Environmental  Laws,
Environmental  Permits  or  criteria,  guidance,  policy  or  interpretations in
relation  to  Environmental  Laws  or  Environmental  Permits.
(a)     Notwithstanding  anything  to  the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser
shall not be entitled to claim or seek indemnity or defense under this Agreement
     for  Environmental  Liabilities  identified  in  subsection  (iii)  of  the
definition  of  Excluded  Environmental  Liabilities  without  documentation
identifying  (i) the specific nature of the failure to comply with Environmental
Laws or Environmental Permits; (ii) the actions necessary to correct the failure
to  comply  with  Environmental  laws or Environmental Permits; and/or (iii) the
specific costs incurred to correct the failure to comply with Environmental Laws
or  Environmental  Permits.
ARTICLE  IX

termination  to  the  other  party, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
prior  to  July  31,  2003 (unless the failure to consummate the Closing by such
date  (i)  shall  be  due  to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement to have fulfilled any of its obligations under this Agreement, or (ii)
is  due  to  the continuance of a waiting period or lack of an approval required
under  or an injunction or equivalent thereof entered based upon any Competition
Laws,  in  which event Purchaser may not rely upon this Section 9.1 to terminate
this  Agreement  until  the  1st  anniversary of the date of this Agreement); or
(c)     by  either Pfizer or Purchaser if any court of competent jurisdiction or
other  competent  Governmental  Authority  of  the United States of America, the
European  Union  or  Japan  shall  have issued a Governmental Order or taken any
other  action  permanently  restraining,  enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such Governmental Order or other
action  shall  have  become  final  and  nonappealable.
Section  9.2     Effect of Termination.  (a)  In the event of the termination of
                 ---------------------

thereafter  become  void  and have no effect, and no party hereto shall have any
liability  to  the other party hereto or their respective Affiliates, directors,

contained  in  this  Section 9.2 and in Sections 7.1, 10.1, 10.7, 10.8, 10.9 and
10.11  hereof,  and  except  that  nothing  herein  will  relieve any party from
Liability  for  any  breach of any covenant set forth in this Agreement prior to
such  termination.
(b)     In  the  event  this  Agreement shall be terminated and at such time any
party  is  in  material breach of or default under any term or provision hereof,
such  termination  shall  be without prejudice to, and shall not affect, any and
all rights to damages that the other party may have hereunder or otherwise under
     applicable  Law.  The damages recoverable by the non-defaulting party shall
include all attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by such party in connection with
the  transactions  contemplated  hereby.
(c)     If  this  Agreement  is  terminated  in  accordance  with  Section  9.1,
Purchaser  agrees  that  the  prohibition  in  the  Confidentiality  Agreement
restricting  Purchaser's  ability  to solicit any Employee to join the employ of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates shall be extended to a period of 3 years from
the  date of this Agreement, except that nothing in this sentence shall restrict
or  preclude  the rights of Purchaser to make generalized searches for employees
by the use of advertisements in the media (including trade media) or by engaging
search  firms  to  engage  in  searches  that are not targeted or focused on the
Employees  employed  by  the  Business.

that Purchaser may without such consent assign its rights to purchase the Shares
and  the  Purchased Assets hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates, provided,
                                                                       --------
however,  that no such assignment by Purchaser shall relieve Purchaser of any of
 ------
its  obligations  hereunder.
Section  10.4     Entire Agreement.  This Agreement (including all Schedules and
                  ----------------
Exhibits  hereto)  contains the entire agreement between the parties hereto with
respect  to  the  subject  matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings,  oral  or  written, with respect to such matters, except for the
Confidentiality  Agreement  which  will  remain in full force and effect for the
term  provided  for  therein and other than any written agreement of the parties
that  expressly  provides  that  it  is  not  superseded  by  this  Agreement.
Section 10.5     Fulfillment of Obligations; Cooperation.  (a) Any obligation of
                 ---------------------------------------
any  party  to  any  other  party  under  this  Agreement,  which  obligation is
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by an Affiliate of such party, shall be deemed
to  have  been  performed,  satisfied  or  fulfilled  by  such  party.
(b)     On  or  after the Closing Date, the parties shall, on request, cooperate
with  one  another  by  furnishing  any  additional  information,  executing and
delivering  any  additional  documents  and  instruments,  including  contract
assignments,  and  doing  any  and  all  such  other things as may be reasonably
required  by  the  parties or their counsel to consummate or otherwise implement
the  transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement.  In  connection  with  the
liabilities  assumed  by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, and the retention
by  Pfizer  of  the  Retained Liabilities, each of the parties hereto shall, and
shall  cause  their  affiliates and employees to, aid, cooperate with and assist
the  other  party  or  parties  in  their  defense  of  such assumed or retained
litigation or liabilities, by, among other things, providing such other party or
     parties  with  full access to pertinent records at such times as such other
party  or  parties may reasonably request, and making available for depositions,
testimony  or  other  consultation,  such officers, employees, or agents as such
party  or  parties  may reasonably request without cost to such party or parties
except for reimbursement by it or them of out-of-pocket expenditures incurred in
connection  with  such  cooperation  and  assistance.
(c)     Pfizer  agrees  to  execute  transfer  documents  for  all  Intellectual
Property  rights,  in  a  recordable  form  provided  by  Purchaser  for  each
jurisdiction  where  such  property is registered, at, or as soon as practicable
following,  Closing.  Pfizer  shall have the continuing obligation after Closing
to  use  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to  cooperate  with Purchaser in the
registration  of  the  transfers  for,  and/or  in  the  enforcement  of, and/or
maintenance  of  any  Intellectual  Property  rights  after  Closing  until such
transfers  are  completed  pursuant  to  the  requirements of each jurisdiction.
Following  Closing,  Purchaser shall pay the expenses of preparing and recording
such  transfers,  to  the  extent  they  have  not  been  provided  at  Closing.
Section 10.6     Parties in Interest.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit
                 -------------------
     of  and  be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors
and  permitted  assigns.  Nothing  in  this  Agreement,  express  or implied, is
intended to confer upon any Person other than Purchaser, Seller Corporations, or
their successors or permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason
of  this  Agreement.
Section  10.7     Public  Disclosure;  Confidentiality.  (a)  Notwithstanding
                  ------------------------------------
anything  herein  to  the contrary, each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
agrees  with  the other parties hereto that, except as may be required to comply
with  the  requirements of any applicable Laws, and the rules and regulations of
each  stock  exchange upon which the securities of one of the parties is listed,
if  any, no press release or similar public announcement or communication shall,
if  prior  to the Closing, be made or caused to be made concerning the execution
or  performance  of  this  Agreement  unless the parties shall have consulted in
advance  with  respect  thereto.
(b)     Pfizer, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Subsidiaries, agrees that
     after  the  Closing it will hold any non-public information with respect to
the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Conveyed Companies and this Agreement in
confidence using the same safeguards to protect such confidential information as
it  has  established  to  protect  its  own  confidential  information.
Section  10.8     Return  of  Information.  If  for  any  reason  whatsoever the
                  -----------------------
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, Purchaser shall
     promptly  return  to  Pfizer all books and records furnished by Pfizer, any
other  Seller  Corporation,  any  Conveyed  Company  or  any of their respective
Affiliates,  agents,  employees,  or  representatives  (including  all  copies,
summaries  and  abstracts,  if any, thereof) in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality  Agreement.
Section  10.9     Expenses.  Except  as  otherwise  expressly  provided  in this
                  --------
Agreement,  whether  or  not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated,  all  costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and  the  transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the party incurring
such  expenses.  Notwithstanding the foregoing and Section 7.4(b), except as set
forth  in  this  Section  10.9,  all  Taxes (including any value added Taxes but
excluding  any Income Taxes) and fees relating to the transfer of the Shares and
the  Purchased Assets shall be paid by Purchaser.  All Taxes (including, without
limitation,  any  value  added  Taxes  but  excluding any Income Taxes) and fees
relating to the transfer of the Shares and the Purchased Assets shall be paid by
the  person  liable  therefor  but  the  liability for such Taxes as between the
Seller  Corporations and Purchaser shall be borne as follows:  (y) in respect of
any  such  Taxes  which  are  refundable  or  in respect of which a credit is or
becomes  available, by Purchaser; and (z) in respect of any other such Taxes not
falling  within  subsection (y) above, equally by the Seller Corporations on the
one  hand  and  Purchaser on the other hand, provided, however, that if any such
                                             --------  -------
Tax  or any other Tax from which there is otherwise a refund or a credit becomes
payable  or  non-refundable  as  a  result of Purchaser's failing to register or
become liable for such Tax, for example value added Tax, such Tax shall be borne
by Purchaser solely.  The Seller Corporations and Purchaser, as the case may be,
will  on  demand reimburse the other for its share of any such Taxes paid by the
other  in  accordance  with  the  foregoing  provisions  of  this  Section.
Section  10.10     Schedules.  The  disclosure  of any matter in any Schedule to
                   ---------
this Agreement, as may be amended or supplemented prior to the Closing, shall be
deemed  to  be  a disclosure for all purposes of this Agreement (but only to the
extent disclosure for such purposes is reasonably apparent), but shall expressly
not be deemed to constitute an admission by any Seller Corporation or Purchaser,
or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material for the purposes of this
Agreement.
Section  10.11     Governing  Law;  Jurisdiction.  (a)  This  Agreement shall be
                   -----------------------------
governed  by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York,
without  regard  to  the  conflicts  of  law  rules  of  such  state.
(b)     With  respect  to  any  suit,  action  or  proceeding  relating  to this
Agreement  (each,  a "Proceeding"), each party hereto irrevocably (i) agrees and
                      ----------
consents  to  be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York or any New York State court sitting in New
     York  City  and  (ii) waives any objection which it may have at any time to
the  laying  of  venue  of  any Proceeding brought in any such court, waives any
claim that such Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum and further
waives  the  right  to  object, with respect to such Proceeding, that such court
does  not  have  any  jurisdiction  over  such  party.
Section  10.12     Counterparts.  This  Agreement may be executed in one or more
                   ------------
counterparts,  each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall
constitute  one  and  the  same agreement and shall become effective when ore or
more  counterparts  have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other  party,  it  being  understood  that  both  parties need not sign the same
counterpart.
Section  10.13     Headings.  The  heading  references  herein  and the table of
                   --------
contents  hereto  are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of
this  Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions
hereof.
Section  10.14     Severability.  The  provisions  of  this  Agreement  shall be
                   ------------
deemed  severable  and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall
not  affect  the  validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof.  If
any term or other provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any
person  or entity or any circumstance, is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, (a)
a  suitable  and  equitable  provision shall be substituted therefor in order to
carry  out,  so  far  as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of
such  invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement
and  the  application  of  such  provision  to  other  persons,  entities  or
circumstances  shall  not  be  affected  by  such  invalidity,  illegality  or
unenforceability,  nor  shall  such  invalidity,  illegality or unenforceability
affect  the  validity  or  enforceability  of such provision, or the application
thereof,  in  any  other  jurisdiction.
