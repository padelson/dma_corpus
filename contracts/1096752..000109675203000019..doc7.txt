Companies or any Subsidiary of Pfizer or Purchaser, to the extent that such
consent shall not have been given prior to the Closing, will, at Closing, be

consents. Pfizer agrees promptly to request all such consents, as may be
required, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consents
and to otherwise obtain satisfaction of conditions to such assignments or
transfers as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an attempt to
assign to Purchaser any Rights having the following character: (i) any
lease, license, contract, engagement or commitment which, as a matter of law
or by the terms thereof, is not assignable without the consent of the other
party or parties to such lease, license, contract, engagement or commitment,
unless such consents shall have been given; or (ii) any claim or demand
thereunder as to which all of the remedies for the enforcement thereof
enjoyed by the assignor would not, as a matter of law, pass to Purchaser as
an incident of the transfers to be made under this Agreement. Purchaser and

necessary consents to the assignment of the Rights (provided that neither the
Seller Corporations nor any of their respective Subsidiaries nor Purchaser
shall be required to commence any litigation or offer or grant

Purchaser an arrangement, reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, designed to
provide for Purchaser the benefits thereof in some other manner, provided,
that none of Seller  -------- Corporations, Purchaser nor any of the
Conveyed Companies or their respective Affiliates shall be required to expend
money without reimbursement, commence any litigation or offer or grant any
unreasonable accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party in
order to obtain such benefits. Until such Rights are assigned to Purchaser
with such consent, or the Delayed Transfer Deadline, whichever is earlier,
the applicable Seller Corporation shall hold the Rights in trust for
Purchaser. Until the Delayed Transfer Deadline or the effective date of such
assignment, whichever is earlier, in order that the full value of the Rights
may be realized for the benefit of Purchaser, the applicable Seller
Corporation will, at the request and under the direction of the Purchaser, in
the name of the applicable Seller Corporation or otherwise as Purchaser shall
specify, take all such action and do or cause to be done all such lawful
things as shall be commercially reasonable in order that the obligations of
the applicable Seller Corporation thereunder may be performed in such manner
that the value of such Rights shall be preserved and shall inure to the
benefit of Purchaser, and that the collection of any moneys due and
payable or to become due and payable to Purchaser in and under the Rights
shall be received by Purchaser; and the applicable Seller Corporation will
promptly pay over to Purchaser all moneys collected by or paid to the
applicable Seller Corporation in respect of every such Right. In addition, if
transfers of Conveyed Companies or aggregate Purchased Assets in a particular
country (each, a "Business Unit") cannot be obtained as of Closing because of
required  -------------- third-party consents (whether in respect of Rights,
Competition Laws or any  ----- other basis) that have not been obtained,
Pfizer and Purchaser shall enter into  - management agreements reasonably
acceptable to each party (each, a "Management  ---------- Agreement")
pursuant to which Pfizer shall operate such Business Units for the 
-------- benefit of Purchaser and (to the extent permitted by law) at the
direction of Purchaser, consistent with the letter agreement attached as
Exhibit H hereto until the transfer of such Business Unit or the Delayed
Transfer Deadline, whichever is earlier. Upon the occurrence of the Delayed
Transfer Deadline, Purchaser and Pfizer shall negotiate in good faith to
arrive at a valuation for any and all Rights and Business Units that have not
been transferred, which valuation shall take into account the significance of
the Business Unit to the overall Business, as conducted immediately prior to
Closing. If after 30 days the parties have been unable to agree, each party
shall nominate an investment bank and the two investment banks shall, within
15 days, select a third investment bank, which third investment bank shall,
within 45 days after its selection, make a binding determination of the value
of such Rights and Business Units, which amount Pfizer shall promptly pay to
Purchaser as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. (c) Purchaser acknowledges
that certain consents to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may
be required from parties to the Rights and that such consents have not been
and may not be obtained. Provided that Pfizer is in full compliance with the
provisions of subsections (a) and (b) above and has satisfied any disclosure
obligations under this Agreement with respect to such consents, Purchaser
agrees that no representation or warranty of Pfizer contained herein shall be
breached or deemed breached, and, except as set forth in Section 4.2 of this
Agreement, no condition to Purchaser\'s obligations to close the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed not satisfied as a result of
the failure to obtain any such consent. Section 2.4 Excluded Assets of the

Closing Date (the "Working Capital  ---------------- Statement"). The
Working Capital Statement shall be unaudited and shall state the Working

Excluded Asset as of the Closing Date, taking into account any transfers made
pursuant to Section 2.4(b) and the settlement of any Liabilities referred to

the Working Capital Statement shall be deemed to have been settled on the
Closing Date at the amount settled. Purchaser shall provide Pfizer with
access to the books, records, and personnel of the Business to the extent
reasonably necessary  for Pfizer to prepare the Working Capital Statement.
Pfizer shall also consult with Purchaser in connection with the preparation

Purchaser and its independent accountants shall be permitted to review the
supporting workpapers used to prepare the Working Capital Statement and shall
have access to personnel of Pfizer as may be reasonably necessary to permit
it to review in detail the manner in which the relevant statements were
prepared. (c) Purchaser may dispute the amounts reflected on the line items
of the Working Capital Statement (a "Disputed Item"), but only (i) on the
basis that an  ------------- entry contained on such Working Capital
Statement is based on facts or occurrences arising solely between the date of
the Financial Statements and the date of the Working Capital Statement; (ii)
on the basis that a Disputed Item does not reflect, or has not been made in a
manner consistent with, the provisions of this Agreement; and (iii) to the
extent the amount disputed with respect to any one Disputed Item exceeds
$50,000 with respect to an individual item or series of related items and all
such allowable Disputed Items exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate; provided,
however, Purchaser shall notify Pfizer in  -------- ------- writing of each
Disputed Item, and specify the amount thereof in dispute and the basis
therefor, within 60 days after receipt of the Working Capital Statement. The
failure by Purchaser to provide a notice of Disputed Items to Pfizer
within such 60 day period will constitute Purchaser\'s acceptance of all the
items in the Working Capital Statement. (d) If a notice of Disputed Items
shall be timely delivered pursuant to subclause (b) above, Pfizer and
Purchaser shall, during the 30 Business Days following the date of such
delivery (the "Resolution Period"), negotiate in good 
----------------- faith to resolve the Disputed Items. If, during such
Resolution Period the parties are unable to reach agreement, Pfizer and
Purchaser shall refer all unresolved Disputed Items to Deloitte and Touche LLP,
or any other independent accounting firm as Pfizer and Purchaser shall
mutually agree upon (the "Independent Accountant"). The Independent
Accountant shall make a  --------------- determination with respect to each
unresolved Disputed Item within 15 days after  --- its engagement by Pfizer
and Purchaser to resolve such Disputed Items, which determination shall be
made in accordance with the rules set forth in this Section 2.8. The
Independent Accountant shall deliver to Pfizer and Purchaser, within such 15
day period, a report setting forth its adjustments, if any, to the Working
Capital Statement and the calculations supporting such adjustments. Such
report shall be final, binding on the parties and conclusive. Pfizer
and Purchaser shall each pay one-half of all the costs incurred in connection
with the engagement of the Independent Accountant. As used herein, "Final
Working  ------------- Capital" shall mean (i) if no notice of Disputed
Items is delivered by Purchaser  ----- within the period provided in
subclause (b) above, Working Capital of the Business as shown in the Working
Capital Statement as prepared by Pfizer; or (ii) if such a notice of Disputed
Items is delivered by Purchaser, either (x) Working Capital of the Business
as agreed to in writing by Pfizer and Purchaser; or (y) Working Capital of
the Business as shown in the Independent Accountant\'s calculation delivered
pursuant to this subclause (c). The parties acknowledge that they have
discussed their past contacts, if any, with the Independent Accountant, and
that neither party shall have the right to object to the Independent
Accountant\'s service in such role by reason of non-disclosure of past
contacts, conflicts of interest, or any other reason. (e) If the Final
Working Capital excluding Cash Equivalents to the extent it is an Excluded
Asset is less than $132,500,000, then Pfizer, on behalf of the Seller
Corporations, shall, within 10 days after the determination of the
Final Working Capital, pay to Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in accordance with written instructions given to Pfizer by
Purchaser, the amount of such shortfall, together with interest on such
amount from the Closing Date to the date of such payment at a rate equal to
the 90-day London Interbank Offered Rate prevailing at the Closing Date minus
1/8%, as determined by Pfizer. If the Final Working Capital is greater than
$132,500,000 then Purchaser shall, within 10 days after the determination of
the Final Working Capital, pay to Pfizer, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in accordance with written instructions given by Pfizer to
Purchaser, the amount of such excess, together with interest on such amount
from the Closing Date to the date of such payment at an annual rate equal to
the 90-day London Interbank Offered Rate prevailing at the Closing Date plus
0.2%, as determined by Pfizer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pfizer agrees
to make one or more installment payments toward the payment provided for in
this Section 2.8(d) at such times as amounts reflected in the calculation of
the Working Capital of the Business become fixed and are not Disputed Items
and the non-Disputed Items are such that a payment would be due and owing to
Purchaser pursuant to the first sentence of this subsection (d). Similarly,
Purchaser agrees to make one or more installment payments toward the payment
provided for in this Section 2.8(d) at such times as amounts reflected in the
calculation of the Working Capital of the Business become fixed and are not
Disputed Items and the non-Disputed Items are such that a payment would be
due and owing to Pfizer pursuant to the second sentence of this subsection
(d). The final installment payment to be made after the determination of
Final Working Capital shall take into account all previously-made installment
payments. Section 2.9 Allocation of the Aggregate Purchase Price. Pfizer, on
behalf  ------------------------------------------- of itself and the Seller
Corporations, and Purchaser (i) have agreed to the allocation of the
Aggregate Purchase Price among the Conveyed Subsidiaries and the Asset
Selling Corporations as set forth in Schedule 2.9 (the "Section 2.9(i) 
------------ --------------  Allocation") and (ii) shall agree as set forth
below on the allocation  ---------- among the Purchased Assets sold by each
Asset Selling Corporation of the Asset Purchase Price allocable to such Asset
Selling Corporation as set forth in Schedule 2.9 (the "Section 2.9(ii)
Allocation" and, together with the Section  --------
-------------------------- 2.9(i) Allocation, the "Allocation"). Each of the
Seller Corporations on the  ---------- one hand and Purchaser on the other
shall (i) be bound by the Allocation for purposes of determining any Taxes;
(ii) prepare and file, and cause its Affiliates to prepare and file, its Tax
Returns on a basis consistent with the Allocation; and (iii) take no
position, and cause its Affiliates to take no position, inconsistent with the
Allocation on any applicable Tax Return or in any proceeding before any
taxing authority or otherwise. In the event that the Allocation is disputed
by any taxing authority, the party receiving notice of the dispute shall
promptly notify the other party hereto, and both Pfizer and Purchaser agree
to use their best efforts to defend such Allocation in any audit or similar
proceeding, and the matter shall be handled as a Tax Claim described in
Section 7.4(i)(B). Each of the Seller Corporations and Purchaser
acknowledge that the Section 2.9(i) Allocation was done at arm\'s length
based upon a good faith estimate of fair market values. Pfizer and Purchaser
agree that Purchaser shall choose an independent appraisal firm to perform an
appraisal to support the Section 2.9(ii) Allocation. The cost of such
appraisal firm shall be borne by Purchaser. Pfizer shall be provided with a
copy of the appraiser\'s report at least 15 working days prior to Closing
and, provided that Pfizer consents to the report (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), the Section 2.9(ii) Allocation shall be made as
specified in the report. If Pfizer does not consent to the appraiser\'s
report, Pfizer and Purchaser shall use their best efforts to mutually agree
prior to Closing (or, if they fail to reach an agreement prior to Closing,
the parties shall mutually agree after Closing) on any changes to be made to
the report and the Section 2.9(ii) Allocation shall be made as specified in
the report so changed. Working capital adjustments pursuant to Section
2.8 and other post-Closing adjustments, if any, to the Aggregate Purchase
Price shall be allocated to the Conveyed Company or to the Asset Selling
Corporation to which the adjustment relates, and shall be further allocated
(if relevant for purposes of any applicable Law) to the assets to which the
adjustment relates. The Aggregate Purchase Price allocation to such Conveyed
Company or Asset Selling Corporation shall be correspondingly increased or
decreased. Pfizer and Purchaser acknowledge that, in accordance with GAAP,
the fair market value of the Purchased Assets is not less than the net book
value of the Purchased Assets and that, in accordance therewith, if after all
other adjustments to the Allocation are made, the Allocation with respect to
any Asset Selling Corporation, when expressed in the relevant local currency
at the rate of exchange used to determine Final Working Capital, is less than
the local currency net book value, determined in accordance with GAAP, of the
Purchased Assets of such Asset Selling Corporation as of the Closing Date,
then the Allocation with respect to such Asset Selling Corporation shall be
adjusted so that it is equal to such local currency net book value converted
at the rate of exchange used to determine Final Working Capital and a
corresponding adjustment will be made to the Allocation pro rata with respect
to Warner-Lambert Company and Warner Lambert Trading Co. Ltd. based on their
relative Aggregate Purchase Price allocation. ARTICLE

parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary
for it to do under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) to comply promptly

foregoing clauses (A), (B) or (C) if such action is necessary or reasonably
advisable to obtain approval or consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Agreement by any Governmental Antitrust Entity; and (iv) Purchaser
shall take promptly, in the event that any permanent or preliminary
injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be
entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of the acquisition of
the Shares and the Purchased Assets and the transactions contemplated hereby
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would prevent
or delay consummation of the acquisition of the Shares and the Purchased
Assets or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any and all
steps (including the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of
the steps contemplated by clause (iii) of this subsection (c)) necessary to
vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such
consummation on a Schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of Pfizer and Purchaser will provide to the other copies of
all correspondence between it (or its advisor) and any Governmental
Antitrust Entity relating to the acquisition of the Shares and the Purchased

Purchaser agree that all telephone calls and meetings with a Governmental

Authority of the United States of America (or any state or subdivision
thereof), Japan, the European Union, or any Key European Country) having
jurisdiction that is necessary to lawfully consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby is not obtained on or prior to the Closing
Date, Pfizer and Purchaser agree to effect Closing (including payment of the
total Aggregate Payment and Aggregate Purchase Price), subject to the terms
of this Agreement, with respect to all Shares, Purchased Assets and Assumed
Liabilities outside of the jurisdiction of any such Governmental Authority;
provided, however, that the  -------- ------- obligations of the parties
hereto set forth in this Section 7.3 shall continue with respect to any such
approval or action until such approval or action is given or taken, as the
case may be, and upon the occurrence of such approval or action, the parties
hereto shall effect transfer of the effected Shares, Purchased Assets and
Assumed Liabilities in accordance with the Foreign Implementing Agreements
for the jurisdiction relating thereto, subject to the provisions of Section
2.3(c) hereof. Each such transfer, upon occurrence, shall be retroactive to
and be deemed to have occurred on the Closing Date. As of the Closing Date,
Pfizer and Purchaser shall, subject to applicable Law, enter into mutually
agreeable alternative business arrangements consistent with the terms of this
Agreement or other arrangements which provide Purchaser with the net economic
benefit or loss (as determined pursuant the Letter Agreement attached as
Exhibit H) of the affected Conveyed Subsidiaries and Purchased Assets
from and after the Closing Date and continuing until any such third-party
consent is obtained. Section 7.4 Tax Matters.  ------------ (a) (i)
Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns. Pfizer shall prepare and 
---------------------------------------- timely file or shall cause to be
prepared and timely filed all federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns
in respect of the Conveyed Companies and the Asset  Selling Corporations,
their assets and activities that (i) are required to be filed (taking into
account extensions) on or before the Closing Date; or (ii) are required to be
filed (taking into account extensions) after the Closing Date and (A) are
Consolidated Tax Returns of Pfizer and its Affiliates; (B) are with respect
to Income Taxes and are required to be filed on a separate Tax Return basis
for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date; or (C) are to
be filed by an Asset Selling Corporation. Purchaser shall prepare or cause to
be prepared and shall file or cause to be filed all other Tax Returns
required of the Conveyed Companies, or in respect of their assets or
activities or required to be filed after the Closing Date with respect to the
Purchased Assets or the Business. Any such Tax Returns that include periods
ending on or before the Closing Date or that include the activities of the
Conveyed Companies or an Asset Selling Corporation (with respect to the
Business) prior to the Closing Date shall, insofar as they relate to the
Conveyed Companies or an Asset Selling Corporation (with respect to the
Business) prior to the Closing Date, be on a basis consistent with the last
previous such Tax Returns filed in respect of the Conveyed Companies or such
Asset Selling Corporation (with respect to the Business), unless Pfizer or
Purchaser, as the case may be, concludes that there is no reasonable basis
for such position. With respect to any Tax Return required to be filed by
Purchaser for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), Purchaser shall deliver, at 
--------------- least 30 days prior to the due date for the filing of such
Tax Return (taking into account extensions), to Pfizer a statement setting
forth the amount of Tax for which Pfizer is responsible pursuant to Sections
7.4(g) and a copy of such Tax Return. Pfizer shall have the right to review
such Tax Return and statement prior to the filing of such Tax Return. Pfizer
and Purchaser agree to consult and resolve in good faith any issue arising as
a result of Pfizer\'s review of such Tax Return and statement and mutually to
consent to the filing of such Tax Return as promptly as possible. Unless
otherwise required by an appropriate Governmental Authority, neither
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall file any amended Tax Returns for
any periods for or in respect of the Conveyed Companies with respect to which
Purchaser is not obligated to prepare or cause to be prepared the original
such Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 7.4(a)(i) without the prior written
consent of Pfizer which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Neither
Pfizer nor any of its Affiliates shall file any amended Tax Returns for or in
respect of the Conveyed Companies for such periods without the prior written
consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, Purchaser may, at its
option, make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to its
purchase or deemed purchase of any of the Conveyed Companies, in which event
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for preparing the separate return for
any U.S. corporation reflecting the consequences of such election, and shall
be responsible for and shall pay, any and all Taxes resulting from such
election, including any additional Taxes arising as a result of a reduction
in the amount of foreign tax credits and other Tax credits that are available
to Pfizer (computed as if Pfizer did not utilize any foreign tax credits or
any other Tax credits, net operating losses or other Tax attributes to reduce
the additional Taxes), and shall indemnify Pfizer (in the manner provided
herein) with respect to such Taxes. If Pfizer determines that any of the
Conveyed Companies is entitled to file or make a formal or informal claim for
refund or file an amended Tax Return providing for a refund with respect to a
period for which it is obligated to prepare or cause to be prepared
the original such Tax Return pursuant to this Section 7.4(a)(i), Pfizer shall
be entitled to file or make such claim or amended Tax Return on behalf of
such Conveyed Company and will be entitled to control the prosecution of such
refund claims. In the event that Pfizer fails to prepare and timely file or
cause to be prepared and timely filed any Tax Return or pay Taxes shown to be
due with respect to a Tax Return which Pfizer is obligated to prepare and
file or cause to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 7.4(a), Purchaser
shall have the right to prepare and file such Tax Return and pay the Taxes
shown to be due on such Tax Return notwithstanding anything in this Section
7.4(g)(i) and 7.4(b) to the contrary, provided such Tax Return shall be
prepared and filed on a basis consistent with the principles set forth in
this Section 7.4(g)(i). (ii) Internal Restructurings. Pfizer shall have the
right to cause an ---- ------------------------ election pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3 to be filed, ---- effective from a
date on or prior to the Closing Date, for those of the Conveyed ---- 
Companies that are not United States entities to be treated as a branch
for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes. Prior to the Closing, Pfizer shall
provide Purchaser with a list of all Conveyed Companies for which elections
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3 have been filed, together
with copies of such elections. (b) Payment of Taxes. Except for Taxes that
are accrued or reserved against --- ----------------  in the Working Capital
Statement, Pfizer shall pay or cause to be paid (A) all Taxes due with
respect to Tax Returns which Pfizer is obligated to prepare and file or cause
to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 7.4(a); and (B) all Taxes due
with respect to Tax Returns for Straddle Periods for which Pfizer is
responsible pursuant to Section 7.4(g)(i). Purchaser shall pay or cause to be
paid (A) all Taxes due with respect to Tax Returns which Purchaser
is obligated to prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed pursuant
to Section 7.4(a) other than Taxes which Pfizer shall pay or cause to be paid
in accordance with the preceding sentence; and (B) all Taxes owed by the
Conveyed Companies other than Taxes which Pfizer shall pay or cause to be
paid in accordance with the preceding sentence. (c) Tax Sharing Agreements.
On the Closing Date, all Tax sharing agreements ---
---------------------- and arrangements, including profit pooling or similar
arrangements under non-United States law, between (i) the Conveyed Companies,
on the one hand; and (ii) Pfizer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
(other than the Conveyed Companies), on the other hand, shall be terminated
effective as of the close of the Closing Date and have no further effect for
any taxable year or period (whether a past, present or future year or
period), and no additional payments shall be made thereunder with respect to
any period after the Closing Date in respect of a redetermination of Tax
liabilities or otherwise. (d) Carryforwards and Carrybacks. Purchaser shall
cause the Conveyed --- ------------------------------ Companies to elect,
when permitted by law, to carry forward any net operating --- loss,
charitable contribution credit or other item arising after the
Closing -- Date that could, in the absence of such an election, be carried
back to a -- taxable period of the Conveyed Companies ending on or before
the Closing Date in -- which the Conveyed Companies were included in a
Consolidated Tax Return of Pfizer and its Affiliates. Purchaser, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, hereby waives any right to use or
apply any net operating loss, charitable contribution credit or other item
(including any net capital loss, foreign tax credit or research and
development credit) of the Conveyed Companies for any tax year ending on any
date following the Closing Date to any period of the Conveyed Companies
ending on or before the Closing Date. If any net capital loss, foreign tax
credit or research and development credit shall be carried back to any such
period, Purchaser shall indemnify Pfizer and its Affiliates (other than the
Conveyed Companies) for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Pfizer
or any of such Affiliates in filing such claims or in connection with any
audit of such claims. (e) Refunds. Pfizer shall be entitled to retain, or
receive prompt payment --- ------- from Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates (including the Conveyed Companies) of, any refund or credit
with respect to Taxes (including refunds and credits arising by reason of
amended Tax Returns filed after the Closing Date or otherwise) with respect
to any Tax period or portion thereof that ends on or before the Closing Date
relating to the Conveyed Companies or any Asset Selling Corporation;
provided, however, that (i) Purchaser and the Conveyed Companies  --------
------- shall be entitled to retain, or receive prompt payment from Pfizer
of, any such refund or credit to the extent that such refund or credit arises
as a result of the use or application (as provided in Section 7.4(d)) of any
net capital loss, foreign tax credit or research and development credit of
the Conveyed Companies for any tax year ending on any date following the
Closing Date to any period of the Conveyed Companies ending on or before the
Closing Date; and (ii) to the extent that Pfizer or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Conveyed Companies) would, but for the carryback by the
Conveyed Companies of any such net capital loss, foreign tax credit or
research and development credit, be entitled to a refund or credit in respect
of any net capital loss, foreign tax credit or research and development
credit of Pfizer or any of Pfizer\'s Affiliates (other than the Conveyed
Companies), Pfizer shall be entitled to receive prompt payment from Purchaser
of any such amount to the extent Purchaser has previously received a refund
or credit from a carryback to Pfizer\'s return. Purchaser and the Conveyed
Companies shall be entitled to retain, or receive prompt payment from Pfizer
of, any refund or credit with respect to Taxes with respect to any taxable
period beginning after the Closing Date relating to any of the
Conveyed Companies. Purchaser and Pfizer shall equitably apportion any refund
or credit with respect to Taxes with respect to a Straddle Period in a manner
consistent with the principles set forth in Section 7.4(g)(iii). If a refund
for which a payment has been made to a party hereto (the recipient) by the
other party hereto (the payor) pursuant to this Section 7.4(e) is
subsequently reduced or disallowed, the recipient shall indemnify the payor
for any Tax assessed against the Payor by reason of such reduction or
disallowance. (f) Tax Cooperation. Each of Purchaser and Pfizer shall provide
each other --- ---------------- with such information and records and make
such of its officers, directors, employees and agents available as may
reasonably be requested by such other party in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Return or any audit or other proceeding that relates
to the Conveyed Companies or the Asset Selling Corporations. Purchaser shall,
within 120 days after the Closing Date, prepare or cause the Conveyed
Companies to prepare, in a manner consistent with the Conveyed Companies\'
past practice, the tax work paper preparation package or packages necessary
to enable Pfizer to prepare Tax Returns Pfizer is obligated to prepare or
cause to be prepared. (g) Tax Indemnification. --- -------------------- (i)
Pfizer shall indemnify, defend and hold Purchaser and its Affiliates harmless
from and against all liability for U.S. and non-U.S. Taxes of the Conveyed
Companies for any taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date and
the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, including (A)
all liability for any breach of Pfizer\'s representations and warranties
contained in Article V or covenants contained in this Article VII with
respect to the Conveyed Companies; (B) all liability (as a result of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) or otherwise) for Taxes of Pfizer or any 
other Person (other than the Conveyed Companies) which is or has ever
been affiliated with the Conveyed Companies, or with whom the Conveyed
Companies otherwise join or have ever joined (or are or have ever been
required to join) in filing any consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return,
prior to the Closing; (C) all liability for Taxes of the Business which
constitutes a Retained Liability pursuant to Section 2.6 of this Agreement;
and (D) all liability for reasonable legal, accounting and appraisal fees and
expense with respect to any item described in clause (A) or (B) above;
provided, however,  -------- ------- that Pfizer\'s indemnity obligation for
Taxes pursuant to this Section 7.4(g)(i) shall be reduced by refunds of Taxes
(excluding carrybacks from post-Closing Date years to the extent permitted
hereunder) with respect to such periods received after the Closing Date by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and not previously remitted to Pfizer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pfizer shall not indemnify, defend or hold
harmless Purchaser or any of its Affiliates from any liability for Taxes (a)
attributable to (i) any election under any provision of the Code (including
Section 338(g)) or any other action taken, (ii) any failure to comply with
Law or (iii) any other failure to act which constitutes gross negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates that (A)
would otherwise give rise to a Pfizer Tax indemnity payment, (B) is made
after the Closing by Purchaser, any of its Affiliates (including the Conveyed
Companies) or any transferee of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and (C) is
not expressly required or otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement
and has not been approved in writing by Pfizer (a "Purchaser Tax 
------------- Act"); or (b) to the extent accrued or reserved against in the
Working Capital Statement. Purchaser shall pay to Pfizer the amount of Tax
savings realized by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates as a result of any
loss or credit carryforwards of the Conveyed Companies existing as of the
Closing Date, as soon as practicable after such savings may be realized.
Further, Pfizer\'s obligation to indemnify, defend or hold harmless Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates from any liability shall terminate effective with
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including
extensions) in respect of such liability. (ii) Purchaser shall, and shall
cause the Conveyed Companies to, indemnify, defend and hold Pfizer and its
Affiliates harmless from and against, (A) except to the extent Pfizer is
otherwise required to indemnify Purchaser for such Tax pursuant to Section
7.4(g)(i), all liability for Taxes of the Conveyed Companies; (B) all
liability for Taxes attributable to a Purchaser Tax Act, including all
liability for Taxes resulting from Purchaser making an election under Section
338(g) of the Code with respect to its purchase or deemed purchase of any of
the Conveyed Companies, and any additional Taxes arising as a result of a
reduction in the amount of foreign tax credits and other Tax credits that are
available to Pfizer (computed as if Pfizer did not utilize any foreign
tax credits or other Tax credits, net operating losses or other Tax
attributes to reduce the additional Taxes); and (C) all liability for
reasonable legal, accounting and appraisal fees and expenses with respect to
any item described in clause (A) or (B) above. Purchaser\'s obligation to
indemnify, defend or hold harmless Pfizer or any of its Affiliates from any
liability shall terminate effective with the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (including extensions) in respect of such
liability. (iii) In the case of any Straddle Period: (A) The periodic Taxes
of the Conveyed Companies that are not based on income or receipts (e.g.,
property Taxes) for the portion of any Straddle Period  ----  ending on the
Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Period") shall be computed 
---------------------- based upon the ratio of the number of days in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the number of days in the entire Tax Period; and (B)
Taxes of the Conveyed Companies for the Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than
Taxes described in Section 7.4(g)(iii)(A) above) shall be computed as if such
taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date and, in
the case of any Taxes of the Conveyed Companies attributable to the
ownership by the Conveyed Companies of any equity interest in any partnership
or other "flowthrough" entity, as if a taxable period of such partnership or
other "flowthrough" entity ended as of the close of business on the Closing
Date. (iv) Any indemnity payment required to be made pursuant to this
Section 7.4(g) shall be made within 30 days after the indemnified party makes
written demand upon the indemnifying party, but in no case earlier than 5
Business Days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes are required to
be paid to the relevant taxing authority (including estimated Tax
payments). (v) Any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Section 7.4(g),
other than for Straddle Period Taxes pursuant to the first sentence of
Section 7.4(b)(B) shall be treated as an adjustment to the price paid by
Purchaser for the relevant Conveyed Company for Tax purposes, unless a final
determination with respect to the indemnified party or any of its Affiliates
causes such payment to be treated other than as an adjustment to the purchase
price for federal Income Tax purposes. (h) Timing Adjustment. In the event
that a final determination (which shall --- -----------------  include the
execution of an IRS Form 870-AD or successor form) results in a timing
difference (e.g., an acceleration of income or delay of deductions) that 
---- would increase Pfizer\'s liability for Taxes pursuant to this Section
7.4 or results in a timing difference (e.g., an acceleration of deductions or
delay of  ---- income) that would increase Purchaser\'s liability for Taxes
pursuant to this Section 7.4, Purchaser or Pfizer, as the case may be, shall
promptly make payments to Pfizer or Purchaser as and when Purchaser or
Pfizer, as the case may be, actually realizes any Tax benefits as a result of
such timing difference (or under such other method for determining the
present value of any such anticipated Tax benefits as agreed to by the
parties). Such Tax benefit for federal, state and local Income Tax purposes
shall be computed for any year using Purchaser\'s or Pfizer\'s, as the case
may be, actual tax liability with and without giving effect to such timing
difference. (i) Tax Contests. --- ------------- (A) If a claim shall be
made by any taxing authority (a "Tax Claim") which,  --------- if
successful, might result in an indemnity payment pursuant to Section
7.4(g), the indemnifying party shall promptly notify the indemnified party of
such claim  no later than 20 Business Days after such Tax Claim is made;
provided,  -------- however, the failure to provide such notification within
such period shall not  --- release the indemnifying party from its
indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent the indemnified
party is prejudiced thereby. (B) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or relating to or
affecting a Consolidated Tax Return, Pfizer shall control all proceedings and
may make all decisions taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including
selection of counsel) and, without limiting the foregoing, may in its sole
discretion pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings,
hearings and conferences with any taxing authority with respect thereto, and
may, in its sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund
where applicable law permits such refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in
any permissible manner. Purchaser shall be entitled to be informed of such
Tax Claim within a reasonable time after such Tax Claim is asserted and the
developments with respect to such Tax Claim at any administrative meeting,
conference, hearing or other proceeding. (C) Except as otherwise provided in
Section 7.4(i)(B), Pfizer and Purchaser shall jointly control and participate
in all proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim relating to Taxes
of the Conveyed Companies for any Straddle Period. Neither Pfizer nor
Purchaser shall settle any such Tax Claim without the prior written consent
of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. (D) Except as
otherwise provided in Section 7.4(i)(B), Purchaser shall control all
proceedings with respect to Taxes for any taxable period beginning after the
Closing Date. (E) Purchaser, the Conveyed Companies and each of their
respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Pfizer and its respective
Affiliates, on the other, shall cooperate in contesting any Tax Claim, which
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon request) the provision to
the requesting party of records and information which are reasonably relevant
to such Tax Claim, making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided
hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim. Purchaser
shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are
necessary to carry out the intent of this Section. Section 7.5 Employees and
Employee Benefits. (a) Employees (US) - Offer of 
------------------------------- -------------------------  Employment;
Continued Employment; Severance. Purchaser agrees to offer 
---------------------------------------------- employment as of 12:01 a.m. on
the day immediately following the Closing Date to each Employee (US) (or to
cause the Conveyed Companies to offer to continue the employment of each of
their Employees (US)) in the same or a comparable position and at a rate of
pay at least equal to such Employee\'s rate of pay in effect on the Closing
Date and with benefits which shall be substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the employee benefits as are set forth in Schedule 7.5(a) and, 
--------------- in the event of Purchaser\'s termination of employment of an
Employee (US), identical to such other benefits as are set forth in the
Employee Severance Program in Schedule 7.5(a)(i). The employee benefit plans,
programs, policies,  ------------------ and fringe benefits of Purchaser set
forth on Schedule 7.5(a)(iii), provided  -------------------- Purchaser
makes an additional fully vested contribution of 3.5% of each
Affected Employee\'s pay (to include base salary, bonus, overtime, shift
differentials and premium pay) for the balance of the two-year benefit
comparabilty period (such period shall be reduced by the period of time
during which Purchaser replicates Pfizer\'s employee benefit plans), to the
Pension Plus Match Account to be established for each Affected Employee under
Purchaser\'s Defined Benefit Pension Plan (regardless of whether such
Affected Employee is otherwise a participant in such plan or Purchaser\'s
Savings Plan) shall be deemed substantially comparable in the aggregate to
the employee benefit plans, programs, policies and fringe benefits of Pfizer.
Such contribution by Purchaser to Purchaser\'s Defined Benefit Pension Plan
shall be made on each of the first and second anniversary of the Closing
Date. Nothing herein shall require Purchaser to provide post-retirement
medical or other post-retirement welfare benefits to any Affected Employee or
their dependents. For purposes of this Section 7.5, references to "pay" shall
include base pay plus any commission, bonus, incentive pay, overtime, premium
pay, and shift differentials, but shall exclude retention and
retention/performance allowances. Such employment shall be at a location that
is no more than 30 miles farther than the distance between the
employee\'s home and the employee\'s principal place of employment as of the
Closing Date. Schedule 7.5(a)(ii) (which shall be updated by Pfizer on the
Closing Date) shall  ------------------ set forth the name of each Employee
(US), and his or her current rate of pay, position and date of hire.
Purchaser shall have no obligation whatsoever with regard to (i) former
employees of the Business who are retired, or who are not or shall have
ceased to be Employees (US) as of the Closing Date, or (ii) employees who do
not accept the offer of employment or continuation of employment given by
Purchaser in accordance with this Section 7.5(a) and do not work for
Purchaser or its Affiliates for at least one day, unless such employee is
otherwise an Affected Employee. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for all
salaries or wages (including commissions, bonuses, incentive pay,
overtime, premium pay, shift differentials and severance pay) accruing after
the Closing Date with respect to the Affected Employees. The following
conditions of employment shall remain unchanged until the date immediately
following the 2nd anniversary of the Closing Date: (i) the location
requirement described in this Section 7.5(a) and (ii) the pay and benefits
comparability requirements described in this Section 7.5(a), and the
obligations described in Schedule  -------- 7.5(a)(i). Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, Purchaser or its Affiliates  ----- may terminate an
Employee (US) during such 2-year period due to "Performance-Related
Terminations" or "Curtailment or Cessation
of Operations/Reorganization/Position Elimination" (as those terms are
described in Exhibit E, the Pfizer Employee Separation Plan) as long as
Purchaser or its Affiliates (i) first offers such employee the opportunity to
sign a release agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit
F (individual termination) or Exhibit G (group termination), as appropriate,
(ii) pays or otherwise provides severance benefits to such employee in
accordance with Pfizer\'s Employee Separation Plan and (iii) provides
benefits continuation and other benefits as set forth in Schedule 7.5(a)(i),
provided, however, that  ------------------ -------- ------- Purchaser or
its Affiliates may terminate an Employee (US) without paying or otherwise
providing severance benefits to such employee in accordance with such policy
and practice if such employee is terminated, in the reasonable discretion of
Purchaser or its Affiliates, "for cause" (as such term is defined in
the Pfizer Employee Separation Plan). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, on the date immediately following the 2nd anniversary of the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide pay and benefits and severance plans,
programs and policies which are no less favorable than those provided to
other similarly situated employees of Purchaser, as the case may be. Except
with regard to any defined benefit pension plans maintained by Purchaser,
employees shall also be provided credit by Purchaser for all service with
Pfizer and its Affiliates, to the same extent as such service was credited
for such purpose by Pfizer and its Affiliates, under (x) all employee benefit
plans, programs, policies and fringe benefits of Purchaser described in
Schedule 7.5(a)(iii) for purposes of  --------------------- eligibility,
vesting and benefit accrual, and (y) severance plans, programs and policies
for purposes of calculating the amount of each such employee\'s severance
benefits. (b) Qualified Plans. (i) Pfizer sponsors the following Plans
covering --- ---------------- Employees (US) which are intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the --- Code (collectively, the "Pfizer
Qualified Plans"): the Pfizer Savings Plan (the -- ---------------------- 
"Savings Plan") and the Warner-Lambert Retirement Plan (the "Retirement 
------------- ---------- Plan"). Effective as of the Closing Date, the Seller
Corporations shall cause  - each Affected Employee who is a participant in
one or both Pfizer Qualified Plans to become one hundred percent (100%)
vested in his or her accrued benefit under each such Plan. (ii) Effective as
of 12:01 a.m. on the day immediately following the Closing  Date, each
participant in a Pfizer Qualified Plan who is an Affected Employee shall
cease to be an active participant under each such Plan, and shall become a
participant in the Purchaser Qualified Plans as listed in Schedule 
-------- 7.5(b)(ii) (such plans being collectively referred to as the
"Purchaser  ------ --------- Qualified Plans"). Purchaser shall ensure that
the Purchaser Qualified Plans  ------------ will recognize the accrued
service of Affected Employees with Pfizer and its Affiliates up to and
including the Closing Date for all purposes, to the extent credited under the
terms of the corresponding Pfizer Qualified Plan as in effect on the Closing
Date. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Pfizer shall deliver
such accrued service data to Purchaser. Purchaser shall assume all
liabilities with respect to Employees (US) under Purchaser Qualified
Plans for benefits accrued after the Closing Date. (iii) If Purchaser
maintains or establishes a Purchaser Qualified Plan that corresponds with the
Savings Plan ("Purchaser Savings Plan"), Pfizer shall 
----------------------- cause, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date,
the Savings Plan to transfer the account balance of each Affected Employee to
such Purchaser Savings Plan as of the valuation date next preceding the date
of transfer. (iv) With respect to the Purchaser Qualified Plan that
corresponds to the Retirement Plan (the "Purchaser Defined Benefit Pension
Plan"), Pfizer agrees to  -------------------------------------- calculate
and transfer to such Purchaser Defined Benefit Pension Plan as soon
as practicable after the Closing Date the amount required under Section
414(l) of the Code, reflecting the appropriate PBGC assumptions in effect as
of the Closing Date. In the event the amount required under Section 414(l) of
the Code is less than the aggregate ABO determined as of the Closing Date of
the Affected Employees under the Retirement Plan, Pfizer shall pay in cash
(plus interest at LIBOR minus 1/8% for the period from the Closing Date to
the payment date) to Purchaser upon, or as soon as practicable after, the
Closing Date the difference between the aggregate ABO and the amount of
assets transferred to the Purchaser Defined Benefit Pension Plan pursuant to
Section 414(l) of the Code. In calculating the aggregate ABO for Affected
Employees under the Retirement Plan, Pfizer shall utilize the same
assumptions (including the discount rate assumption) that it used in its most
recent financial disclosure for the Retirement Plan. Service with Pfizer and
its Affiliates shall be counted toward vesting and eligibility under the
Purchaser Defined Benefit Pension Plan. Purchaser shall recognize service
with Pfizer and its Affiliates with respect to the level of benefit accrual
to be prospectively credited to such Employee from the Closing Date forward
under the Purchaser Defined Benefit Pension Plan (but no benefit accrual
under the provisions of the Purchaser Defined Benefit Pension Plan shall be
attributable to such service to Pfizer and its Affiliates). Purchaser shall
cause the Purchaser Defined Benefit Pension Plan to maintain as a separate
frozen accrued benefit under such plan the accrued benefit of each Affected
Employee under the Retirement Plan determined as of the Closing
Date. Purchaser shall recognize service with both Pfizer and its Affiliates
and Purchaser for determining any early retirement subsidies that may
be attributable to determining such frozen accrued benefit. In addition,
the optional form of benefit subsidies that are provided under the Retirement
Plan shall be provided on the frozen accrued benefit. As soon as practicable
after the Closing Date, Pfizer shall deliver such accrued service date to
Purchaser. (v) Purchaser, on the one hand, and Pfizer, on the other hand,
each agree to use commercially reasonable efforts and to cooperate with the
other to effect as promptly as possible the transfers of assets contemplated
under Sections 7.5(b)(iii) and 7.5(b)(iv), subject to Pfizer\'s receipt of
satisfactory evidence that the Purchaser Qualified Plans are in compliance
with all relevant Laws; such evidence shall include a current determination
letter from the IRS and representations satisfactory to Pfizer from the
administrators of the Purchaser Qualified Plans. If a current determination
letter has not been obtained, Purchaser and its counsel shall provide a
representation that the Purchaser Qualified Plans are qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code and that a timely application for a determination letter
is pending and that Purchaser will take all necessary steps to secure a
determination letter. Pfizer and Purchaser shall each bear their own
individual costs regarding the transfer of assets as contemplated under
Sections 7.5(b)(iii) and 7.5(b)(iv). (vi) Pfizer shall deliver to Purchaser
as soon as practicable following such request, all data and records
reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with its administration of
retirement benefits for those Affected Employees transferred to the Purchaser
Qualified Plans. (c) Non-Qualified Plans. Certain of the Affected Employees
participate in --- -------------------- (i) the Warner-Lambert Excess
Savings Plan, (ii) the Warner-Lambert Excess Retirement plan, (iii) the
Pfizer Supplemental Savings Plan, (iv) the Warner-Lambert Incentive
Compensation Plan and (v) the Warner-Lambert Overseas Retirement Plan. The
pre-Closing liabilities associated with the Warner-Lambert  Excess Savings
Plan, the Warner-Lambert Overseas Retirement Plan and the Warner-Lambert
Incentive Compensation Plan shall remain as liabilities of Pfizer after the
Closing and Pfizer shall administer the benefits payable under
those arrangements. Upon the Closing, Pfizer shall transfer to Purchaser
assets equal to the aggregate accrued liability attributable to the Affected
Employees as of the Closing Date of each non-qualified plan described in this
Section 7.5(c)(ii) and (iii), and Purchaser shall assume all liabilities
attributable to the Affected Employees incurred under said non-qualified
plans as of the Closing. In measuring the liabilities attributable to the
Affected Employees under the non-qualified plans, Pfizer shall use the
assumptions (including the discount rate assumption) utilized in its most
recent financial disclosures concerning the non-qualified plans. (d) Accrued
Entitlements. Purchaser shall be responsible for all accrued ---
--------------------- entitlements, including vacation days, for Affected
Employees as of the Closing -- Date consistent with Pfizer\'s policies in
respect thereof. (e) Medical and Welfare Plan Obligations. Effective on the
Closing Date and --- ------------------------------------ continuing until
on or about December 31, 2003, each Employee (US) who accepts employment with
Purchaser shall continue to be eligible for and/or to participate in health
and welfare plans that are substantially similar to those plans currently
maintained by Pfizer, and Pfizer shall provide administrative services with
respect to such plans pursuant to the terms of Article 2 of the Transition
Services Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be
construed as an obligation by Purchaser to provide post-retirement medical or
other post-retirement welfare benefits to any Affected Employees,
and Purchaser expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. Effective on or
about January 1, 2004, each Employee (US) shall be eligible to participate in
those medical and welfare benefit plans maintained by Purchaser for its
similarly situated Employees, and Purchaser agrees to waive any waiting
periods or limitations for preexisting conditions under its medical, dental,
life insurance, short-term and long-term disability plans, and any other
similar such plans, and shall ensure that such employees are given credit for
any amounts paid toward deductibles, out-of-pocket limits or other fees on or
prior to the Closing Date. Claims by an Affected Employee for medical and
dental services rendered as of 12:01 a.m. on the day immediately following
the Closing Date shall be the responsibility of the medical and dental plans
provided by Purchaser to such employees. Claims incurred for medical and
dental services for Affected Employees rendered prior to and including the
Closing Date shall be the responsibility of the group medical and dental
plans of Pfizer or the Seller Corporation which covered such employees prior
to and including the Closing Date. (f) Employees (non-US) - Offer of
Employment; Continued Employment; ---
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Severance.
Purchaser agrees to offer employment as of 12:01 a.m. on the day ---
- immediately following the Closing Date to each Employee (non-US) (or to
cause --- the Conveyed Companies to offer to continue the employment of each
of their -- Employees (non-US)) in the same or a comparable position and at
a rate of pay at -- least equal to such employee\'s rate of pay in effect on
the Closing Date and with benefits which shall be substantially comparable to
such employee\'s benefits which are in effect on the Closing Date. Schedule
7.5(f) (which shall  --------------- be updated by Pfizer on the Closing
Date) shall set forth the name of each Employee (non-US). Purchaser agrees to
deal with employee matters, including offers of employment, compensation,
benefits (including Foreign Plans), and severance payment and benefit
continuation matters for Employees (non-US) in the same manner as the manner
in which Employees (US) matters have been dealt with in this Article VII,
subject to such modifications as are necessary to comply with applicable Laws
of the foreign countries and their political subdivisions; applicable labor
agreements; local Pfizer policies, programs and practices; and established
local business custom in similar transactions. In the event that Purchaser is
required to assume any unfunded liabilities under any Foreign Plans, such
liabilities under such Foreign Plans shall be accrued and provided for on the
Closing balance sheet. In measuring the liabilities under such unfunded
Foreign Plans, Pfizer shall value those liabilities on the same basis that it
valued such liabilities for accounting and funding purposes within
the foreign jurisdiction in which such Plans are maintained. With regard to
the Foreign Plans maintained in Japan, France, Canada and Taiwan, Pfizer
will transfer to the analogous Purchaser Plan as soon as practicable after
the Closing Date the aggregate ABO of the Affected Employees who participate
in such Foreign Plans, or such amount as shall be required by applicable Law
or regulation of the applicable jurisdiction. In the event such legally-
required amount is less than the ABO, Pfizer shall pay in cash (plus interest
at LIBOR minus 1/8% for the period from the Closing Date to the payment date)
upon, or as soon as practicable after, the Closing Date, the difference
between the aggregate ABO and the amount of assets legally required to be
transferred. (i) The calculation of the ABO for purposes of Section
7.5(b)(iv) and this Section 7.5(f) shall be subject to review and approval of
Purchaser\'s actuary, but such approval shall relate only to the calculation
of the ABO on the basis set forth in this Agreement and not as to the
assumptions themselves. (ii) Pfizer will use its best efforts to effect the
transfer of sponsorship of the Foreign Plan in the United Kingdom (the "UK
Wilkinson Sword Pension  -------------------------- Plan") from Wilkinson
Sword to Pfizer prior to the Closing Date. (g) Employees (US) and Employees
(non-US) Absent on Disability or Leaves of ---
------------------------------------------------------------------------ Absence
- Offer of Employment; Continued Employment; Severance. When
an --------------------------------------------------------------------- Employee
(US) or Employee (non-US) who is, on the Closing Date, absent due
to ------- illness or on short-term disability (including maternity
disability) or workers\' --  compensation seeks to return to active
employment, Purchaser shall offer immediate employment to such employee in
the same or a comparable position to that which the employee occupied before
such absence but only at such time that such employee is medically capable of
performing the essential functions of the position occupied immediately
before such absence. In addition, immediate employment in the same or
comparable positions will be offered by Purchaser to those Employees (US) and
Employees (non-US) returning from authorized leaves of absence such as
parental, family and medical, and military leaves or other leaves where
return to work is subject to statutory requirements. Such employees,
returning from disability or leaves of absence, will be subject to the same
pay, benefits, severance and all other policies, plans, programs
and arrangements as stipulated in this Article VII for similarly situated
Employees (US) and Employees (non-US). (h) No Third Party Beneficiaries.
Except as expressly provided herein, ---
------------------------------- nothing contained herein, expressed or
implied, is intended to confer upon any --- Employee of Seller Corporations
or the Conveyed Companies any benefits under any benefit plans, programs,
policies or other arrangements, including severance benefits or right to
employment or continued employment with Purchaser or any Affiliate of
Purchaser for any period by reason of this Agreement. In addition, the
provisions of this Agreement, in particular this Article VII, are for
the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and are not for the benefit
of any third party. (i) Warner-Lambert Enhanced Severance Plan. Pfizer will
retain --- ----------------------------------------- responsibility for all
liabilities pursuant to the Warner-Lambert Enhanced --- ---- Severance Plan
("ESP") incurred on or prior to the Closing Date including any ---
--- payments and benefits due as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this -- Agreement or as a result of the Closing. With respect to the
individuals set forth on Schedule 7.5(i), Purchaser shall assume
responsibility for such - ---------------- liabilities and obligations
pursuant to the ESP incurred as a result of Purchaser\'s actions in
terminating (either actually or constructively as defined in the ESP) the
employment of any individual listed on Schedule 7.5(i) after the 
--------------- Closing Date and within the protection period applicable to
such individual under the ESP. Section 7.6 Certain Dividends, Etc.
Notwithstanding any provision herein to  -----------------------  the
contrary (including Section 7.2), each Conveyed Company will be permitted to
distribute to Pfizer or any one or more of its designated Affiliates,
effective as of the Closing Date, up to the amount of its retained earnings
accrued through the Closing Date, but not in excess of cash on hand and in no
event to be effected through any additional borrowings from Pfizer, any
of its Affiliates or any third person. In addition, Pfizer and its
Affiliates shall be permitted to continue to conduct their activities
regarding cash management matters relating to the Business (including the
collection and transfer of accounts receivable and disbursement of funds by
Pfizer) in accordance with the practice in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, except as may be affected by actions taken pursuant to Section
2.4(b) and as may be necessary to settle intercompany payables and
receivables and to effect intercompany funding. After the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall take all actions (or shall cause its Affiliates to take all
actions) reasonably requested by Pfizer to effect the provisions of this
Section 7.6. Any action taken pursuant to this Section 7.6 after the Closing
Date shall be deemed for the purposes of Section 2.8 to have occurred on the
Closing Date and shall be reflected in the calculation of the Working Capital
of the Business pursuant to such Section 2.8. Section 7.7 Resignations;
Delivery of Surveys and Title Policies. (a) At 
----------------------------------------------------- the Closing and except
as otherwise requested by Purchaser in writing, Pfizer will deliver to
Purchaser the resignations (effective on or prior to Closing) of all
directors and non-employee officers of each of the Conveyed Companies
from their positions. (b) Pfizer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
deliver to Purchaser copies of all surveys and title policies relating to
each Facility that is located in the United States and the appropriate
evidence of ownership of the Facilities that are located outside of the
United States promptly upon the receipt of such surveys, title policies and
evidence of ownership. Section 7.8 Bulk Transfer Laws. Purchaser acknowledges
that the Seller  -------------------- Corporations have not taken, and do
not intend to take, any action required to comply with any applicable bulk
sale or bulk transfer laws or similar laws. SECTION 7.9 Noncompetition. (a)
Subject to the provisions of this Section  -------------- 7.9, Pfizer agrees
that for a period of 2 years from the Closing Date, Pfizer shall not, and it
shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, compete in any material respect with the
Business as conducted as of the Closing Date ("Competitive 
----------- Activity"); provided, however, that it shall not be deemed to be
a violation of  ---- -------- ------- this subsection for Pfizer or any of
its Subsidiaries (t) to engage, directly or indirectly, in the research,
manufacture or sale of any human pharmaceutical, human consumer healthcare or
animal pharmaceutical product or any medical device for the delivery of human
or animal pharmaceutical products; (u) to invest in or own any debt
securities or other debt obligations; (v) to invest in any third Person
(including any corporation or mutual or other fund) which invests in, manages
or operates a Competitive Activity, so long as Pfizer\'s or any of
its Subsidiary\'s investment is less than 15% of the outstanding ownership
interest in such third Person and Pfizer and its Subsidiaries do not control
or conduct such third Person or Competitive Activity; (w) to invest in, own
an interest in, or acquire all or a majority of the stock or assets of any
Person which is not engaged primarily in a Competitive Activity; (x) to
invest in securities having less than 20% of the outstanding voting power of
any Person, the securities of which are publicly traded or listed on any
securities exchange or automated quotation system; (y) to invest in any
Person after the Closing Date to the extent that Pfizer or a Subsidiary had,
directly or indirectly, acquired, or had a right to acquire, such interest
prior to the date of this Agreement; or (z) to own any equity interests
through any employee benefit plan or pension plan. For purposes of this
Section 7.9, "engaged primarily in a Competitive Activity" shall mean that
greater than 35% of the aggregate net revenue derived during the last
complete fiscal year of such Person (calculated on a consolidated basis)
is derived from the Competitive Activity. Each investment or acquisition made
by Pfizer or its Subsidiaries which is subject to the provisions of this
Section 7.9 must be permissible hereunder at the time of such investment;
provided,  -------- however, that any such investment which was permissible
when made cannot  --- thereafter be the basis of a claim of violation of
this Section 7.9. The  --- restrictions contained in this Section 7.9 shall
not apply to any portion of the  -- Business that cannot be sold as a result
of any restriction imposed by any Governmental Authority, any part of the
Business subject to the provisions of 7.3(g) or activities in connection with
the Business pursuant to the Transitional Services Agreement. (b) For a
period of 2 years after the Closing Date, Pfizer shall not, and it  shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, induce or attempt to
induce any officers, Employees, representatives or agents of Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates engaged solely in the Business to leave the employ of
Purchaser or any such Affiliate for employment with Pfizer or
its Subsidiaries, or violate the terms of their contracts, or any
employment arrangements, with Purchaser or any such Affiliate, except that
nothing in this sentence shall restrict or preclude the rights of Pfizer and
its Subsidiaries to make generalized searches for employees by the use of
advertisements in the media (including trade media) or by engaging search
firms to engage in searches that are not targeted or focused on the Employees
employed by the Business. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in subsection (a) of this Section 7.9, Pfizer and its Subsidiaries
shall not be deemed to have violated the restrictions contained in Section
7.9(a) in the event that Pfizer or a Subsidiary acquires (by purchase of
stock or assets, merger or otherwise) or invests in any Person engaged
primarily in a Competitive Activity; provided,  -------- however, that
Pfizer or such Subsidiary thereafter divests a portion of
such ------- Competitive Activity within 18 months from the date of purchase
of such Person --- so as to be in compliance with Section 7.9(a). (d) Prior
to Closing, except as otherwise agreed in writing, neither Purchaser nor any
of its Affiliates will offer or provide employment on a full-time or part-
time or consulting basis to any individual employed by Pfizer or any of its
Affiliates, except that nothing in this sentence shall restrict or preclude
the rights of Purchaser and its Affiliates to make generalized searches for
employees by the use of advertisements in the media (including trade
media) or by engaging search firms to engage in searches that are not
targeted or focused on the employees of Pfizer or any of its Affiliates. (e)
Pfizer and Purchaser acknowledge that this Section 7.9 constitutes
an independent covenant and shall not be affected by performance or
nonperformance of any other provision of this Agreement. Each of Pfizer and
Purchaser has independently consulted with its counsel and after such
consultation agrees that the covenants set forth in this Section 7.9 are
reasonable and proper. It is the desire and intent of the parties that the
provisions of this Section 7.9 shall be enforced to the fullest extent
permissible under applicable Law. If all or part of this Section 7.9 is held
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect. If any part of this Section 7.9 is held to be
excessively broad as to duration, scope, activity or subject, such part will
be construed by limiting and reducing it so as to be enforceable to the
maximum extent compatible with applicable Law. Section 7.10 Transitional
Services. At the Closing, Purchaser and Pfizer  ---------------------- shall
enter into, execute and deliver a transitional services
agreement substantially to the effect set forth in Exhibit C (the
"Transitional Services  --------------------- Agreement"). 
-------- Section 7.11 Transitional Intellectual Property License Agreement.
At the  ----------------------------------------------------- Closing,
Purchaser and Pfizer shall enter into, execute and deliver a transitional
intellectual property license agreement substantially to the effect set forth
in Exhibit D (the "Transitional Intellectual Property License 
--------------------------------------------- Agreement").  - Section 7.12
Compliance with WARN, Etc. With respect to WARN or other 
----------------------------- similar Laws of any jurisdiction, Purchaser
will timely give any notices and take any other actions as may be required
thereunder. Section 7.13 Foreign Implementing Agreements. As promptly as
practicable  --------------------------------- after the date hereof, Pfizer
and Purchaser shall cause the Foreign Implementing Agreements to be prepared
and executed by their applicable Affiliates. Section 7.14 Litigation Support.
Purchaser and its Affiliates on the one  ------------------- hand and Pfizer
and its Affiliates on the other hand will cooperate with each other in the
defense or settlement of any Liabilities (including Product Claims) or
lawsuits involving the Business for which they have responsibility under
this Agreement by providing the other party and such other party\'s legal
counsel and other designated Persons access to employees, records, documents,
data, equipment, facilities, products, parts, prototypes and other
information regarding the Business and its products as such other party may
request, to the extent maintained or under the possession or control of the
requested party. The requesting party shall reimburse the other party for its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses paid to third parties in performing its
obligations under this Section 7.14. Pfizer shall keep Purchaser informed of
the status of the pendency of the relevant Liabilities and lawsuits involving
the Business for which it has responsibility under this Agreement, will
advise Purchaser of material issues involved in the litigation and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek a confidentiality agreement with
respect to any settlements of such lawsuits. For so long as any Liabilities
or lawsuits involving the Business for which Pfizer has responsibility under
this Agreement remain outstanding, Purchaser will advise Pfizer of material
issues involved in the lawsuits involving the Business for which it has
responsibility and will use commercially reasonable efforts to seek a
confidentiality agreement with respect to any settlements of such
lawsuits. Section 7.15 Insurance. As of the Closing Date, the coverage under
all  --------- insurance policies related to the Business (other than such
policies as are included in the Purchased Assets, if any, or such policies,
if any, held by the Conveyed Companies outside of the Pfizer Corporate
Insurance Program and are solely related to the Business and are not shared
with other Pfizer entities) shall continue in force only for the benefit of
the Seller Corporations and their Affiliates and not for the benefit of
Purchaser. Purchaser agrees to arrange for its own insurance policies with
respect to the Business covering all periods, provided, however, that to the
extent any insurance policy covers  -------- ------- claims that arose prior
to the Closing but are asserted against Purchaser after the Closing, any
payments on such claims by such policy shall be paid over to Purchaser to the
extent such claims were not previously indemnified by Pfizer (and Pfizer
shall use all reasonable efforts to facilitate the making of and payment on
such claim). Section 7.16 Trade Notification; Notification of Certain
Matters; Revised 
-------------------------------------------------------------- Schedules. (a)
Pfizer and Purchaser shall agree on the method and content of  ------- the
notifications to customers of the sale of the Purchased Assets to
Purchaser. Pfizer and Purchaser agree that said notifications are to provide
sufficient advance notice of the sale and the plans associated therewith,
with the objective of minimizing any disruption of the Business. (b) Pfizer
shall give prompt notice to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall give prompt notice
to Pfizer, of (i) the occurrence of any event which constitutes a breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement; and (ii)
any material failure of Pfizer or the Selling Corporations (on the one hand)
or Purchaser (on the other hand), as the case may be, to comply with
or satisfy any covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to  this Section 7.16(b) shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. Pfizer shall
also give immediate notice to Purchaser of the occurrence of any other event
likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Business, taken as a
whole, including developments with respect to New Products. (c) Prior to the
Closing, Pfizer will provide Purchaser with a set of updated disclosure
Schedules. The provision of such updated disclosure Schedules shall not be
deemed to cure any breach of any representation or warranty made in this
Agreement on the date hereof or have any effect for the purpose of
determining the compliance by Pfizer with any covenant set forth herein. No
update to any Schedule shall be deemed to cure any breach of
any representation or warranty made in this Agreement as of the Closing Date,
or amend or otherwise modify a condition set forth in Article IV to the
extent that such update constitutes a Material Adverse Change since the date
hereof. Section 7.17 Products Received by Asset Selling Corporations. If
products  ------------------------------------------------ of the Business
are received by any Asset Selling Corporation after the Closing,  Pfizer
shall cause such Asset Selling Corporation to ship those products
to Purchaser, or Purchaser\'s stated representative, at Pfizer\'s cost
unless otherwise provided in the Transitional Services Agreement. Within 15
days after notification from an Asset Selling Corporation, Purchaser shall
reimburse such Asset Selling Corporation for all customer claims made against
such Asset Selling Corporation in the form of invoice deductions for amounts
associated with such returned products which are received by such Asset
Selling Corporation or Asset Selling Corporation\'s agent after the
Closing. Section 7.18 Audited Financial Statements. Within forty-five (45)
days of  ----------------------------- Closing, Pfizer shall prepare and
deliver to Purchaser at the cost and expense of Purchaser financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2002 (the "2002 Financial
Statements"), which shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, 
------------------------ and shall fairly present in all material respects,
(i) the financial condition, assets and liabilities of the Business
(excluding Excluded Assets and Retained Liabilities) as of the dates therein
specified; and (ii) the results of operations of the Business for the periods
indicated. Pfizer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause KPMG to
review and audit the 2002 Financial Statements, which review and audit shall
be completed within forty-five (45) days of Closing. Purchaser shall provide
Pfizer with access to the books, records, and personnel of the Business to
the extent reasonably necessary for Pfizer to prepare the 2002 Financial
Statements. Purchaser agrees to reimburse Pfizer for its actual cost of such
audit. Section 7.19 New Products. (a) Pfizer shall use commercially
reasonably  ------------- efforts to cause the Conveyed Companies or Asset
Selling Corporations after the date hereof to incur and/or contract to incur
in the aggregate not less than 90% of the capital expenditure amounts set
forth in Schedule 7.19(a) hereto with  ---------------- respect to the
launch of the Intuition project, and not less than 75% of the capital
expenditure amounts set forth in Schedule 7.19(a) hereto with respect to 
---------------- the launch of the H3 project for the periods set forth in
such Schedule. To the extent the Asset Selling Corporations and Conveyed
Companies do not incur the amounts set forth in the forgoing sentence with
respect to the period between the date hereof and the Closing (measured on a
pro-rata basis if the Closing shall occur on a date other than the last day
of a month) unless the requirement to incur such capital expenditure is
waived by Purchaser ("Required Capital Expenditure"), Pfizer shall pay to
Purchaser such amount as is equal to the excess of the Required Capital
Expenditure and the actual capital expenditure for such period. During the
year ended December 31, 2002, the Conveyed Companies and the Asset Selling
Corporations incurred not less than $29,000,000 of capital expenditures in
the aggregate with respect to projects set forth in Schedule 7.19(a). 
---------------- (b) Pfizer shall cause the Asset Selling Corporations and/or
the Conveyed Companies to incur or commit to incur media slot purchases in
connection with the launch of the "Intuition" project in amounts not less
than 100% of the amounts set forth on Schedule 7.19(b) for the periods set
forth on such  ----------------- Schedule. (c) Pfizer shall, at Closing,
transfer to Purchaser all of its rights under confidentiality agreements
entered into with other parties relating to the Business or the New Products
and, to the extent any of such confidentiality agreements are not
transferable to Purchaser, Pfizer shall take such actions, at Purchaser\'s
expense, as Purchaser may reasonably request to enforce the obligations of
confidentiality under such agreements. (d) Pfizer shall cause the Asset
Selling Corporations and/or the Conveyed Companies to incur or commit to
build inventory in connection with the launch of the "Intuition" project in a
commercially reasonable manner for the periods set forth on Schedule
7.19(d).  ----------------- (e) Nothing contained in this Section or
otherwise shall be deemed a representation of the performance level that will
be attained in the future by the "Intuition" project or other new
projects. Section 7.20 Intercompany Debt. Pfizer shall cause, at or before 60
days  ------------------ after the Closing Date, all Intercompany
Receivables and all Intercompany Payables as at Closing (other than (i)
Business Intercompany Balances and (ii) the Hong Kong Debt) to be paid or
otherwise discharged in full, so that no such Intercompany Liabilities or
Intercompany Receivables will be reflected in the Working Capital Statement.
The net effect of the remaining Intercompany Liabilities and Intercompany
Receivables (comprising (i) the Business Intercompany Balances and (ii) the
Hong Kong Debt), as reflected in the Working Capital Statement will be zero.
Pfizer shall be responsible for any tax liability arising from the actions
taken pursuant to this Section 7.20. Section 7.21 Cash and Bank Accounts. (a)
With respect to the Business, until  ---------------------- the Closing
Date, Pfizer shall continue to employ cash management practices consistent
with those employed immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement, including (i) continuing to collect funds generated from the
Business from bank accounts of Pfizer, the Asset Selling Corporations and the
Conveyed Companies and through Pfizer\'s standard cash management transfer
system; and (ii) continuing to fund the bank accounts of Pfizer, the Asset
Selling Corporations and the Conveyed Companies in connection with cash
disbursements related to the Business. (b) All collection and disbursement
bank accounts of the Conveyed Companies existing as of the Closing Date,
including the balances therein, shall be retained at Closing by such Conveyed
Companies, which shall retain liability with respect to all checks or other
drafts or withdrawals written on all such accounts prior to the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the intention of the parties that the
book cash balance of the Conveyed Companies, in the aggregate, as of 11:59 PM
on the day before the Closing Date shall be zero unless otherwise agreed to
by Purchaser. Further it is the intent of the parties that the cash book
accounts in each foreign jurisdiction where such cash  cannot be readily
remitted to the United States without a tax penalty shall be withdrawn by
Pfizer prior to Closing so that excess cash beyond the short term need of the
Business in such jurisdiction is zero. To the extent that the actual cash
balance at the Closing Date, determined in the ordinary course consistent
with past practices, is negative, such negative amount shall be treated as a
current liability on the Working Capital Statement. To the extent that the
actual book cash balance is positive, such excess over zero shall be treated
as a current asset on the Working Capital Statement. The balance of book
cash, and the calculation of current assets and liabilities for purposes
of the Working Capital Statement, shall be determined consistently, and as of
the same cut-off time. All disbursement bank accounts of Pfizer which are
utilized by the Business prior to the Closing Date shall be retained at
Closing by Pfizer, which shall retain liability with respect to all checks or
other drafts or withdrawals written on all such accounts prior to 11:59 PM on
the day before the Closing Date. At Closing, no other checks or other drafts
or withdrawals of the Business shall be made against such accounts, except as
may be provided in the Transitional Services Agreement. All bona fide checks
and other instruments deposited in Pfizer accounts or accounts of the U.S.
Conveyed Companies prior to the Closing Date and related to the operations of
the Business which are returned to such accounts thereafter shall be assigned
to and shall become the responsibility of Purchaser, and Purchaser shall
reimburse Pfizer as soon as practicable for all such items returned to Pfizer
accounts upon the transfer to Purchaser of all rights relating to such checks
or instruments and the receipt by Purchaser or a Conveyed Company of payment
in cash in respect of such returned items; provided that such reimbursement
shall be limited to the amount actually received by Purchaser or a Conveyed
Company and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to
collect such checks in full. (c) The parties agree to cooperate with each
other in managing the cash accounts of the Business prior to Closing to meet
the short term needs of the Business prior to and after Closing and
effectuate the intent of the parties set forth in subsections (a) and (b)
above. ARTICLE VIII  INDEMNIFICATION Section 8.1 Indemnification by
Pfizer. (a) Subject to the provisions of  --------------------------- this
Article VIII, Pfizer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser
and its Affiliates, and, if applicable, their respective directors, officers,
agents, employees, successors and assigns from and against any and all 
claims, actions, causes of action, judgments, awards, Liabilities,
losses, costs or damages (collectively, a "Loss" or, the "Losses") claimed or
arising  ---- ------ directly from (i) any Excluded Asset or Retained
Liability, (ii) any breach by any Seller Corporation of any of its covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement, (iii) any breach of any warranty
or representation of Pfizer contained in this Agreement, or (iv) any non-
compliance with bulk transfer or similar Laws to the extent the underlying
obligation to the creditor is not an Assumed Liability. (b) Purchaser shall
take and shall cause its Affiliates to take all commercially reasonable steps
to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably
be expected to, or does, give rise thereto, including incurring costs only to
the minimum extent necessary to remedy the breach which gives rise to the
Loss. (c) Nothing in this Section 8.1 shall be construed to impose
Liabilities with respect to Taxes. Section 8.2 Indemnification by Purchaser.
(a) Subject to the provisions of  ----------------------------  this Article
VIII, Purchaser agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Corporations and their Affiliates, and, if applicable, their respective
directors, officers, agents, employees, successors and assigns from and
against any and all Loss claimed or arising directly from (i) any
Assumed Liability, (ii) any breach by Purchaser of any of its covenants or
agreements in this Agreement, (iii) any breach of any warranty or
representation of Purchaser contained in this Agreement, or (iv) events
occurring on or after the Closing Date in connection with the Business, the
Purchased Assets, or the Shares including the use, ownership, possession,
operation or occupancy of any Facility, Leased Real Property or Real
Property, the Intellectual Property of the Business, the Purchased Assets, or
the Shares from and after the Closing Date. (b) Pfizer shall take and cause
its Affiliates to take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss
upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to, or
does, give rise thereto, including incurring  costs only to the minimum
extent necessary to remedy the breach which gives rise to the Loss. (c)
Nothing in this Section 8.2 shall be construed to impose Liabilities with
respect to Taxes. Section 8.3 Notice of Claims. (a) If any of the Persons to
be indemnified  ---------------- under this Article VIII (the "Indemnified
Party") has suffered or incurred any  ----------------- Loss, the
Indemnified Party shall so notify the party from whom indemnification is
sought (the "Indemnifying Party") promptly in writing describing such Loss, 
------------------ the amount or estimated amount thereof, if known or
reasonably capable of estimation, and the method of computation of such Loss,
all with reasonable particularity and containing a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or
certificate delivered pursuant hereto in respect of which such Loss shall
have occurred. If any action at Law or suit in  equity is instituted by or
against a third party with respect to which the Indemnified Party intends to
claim any Liability as a Loss under this Article VIII, the Indemnified Party
shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such action or suit and
tender to the Indemnifying Party the defense of such action or suit. A
failure by the Indemnified Party to give notice and to tender the defense of
the action or suit in a timely manner pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall not
limit the obligation of the Indemnifying Party under this Article VIII,
except (i) to the extent such Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby, (ii)
to the extent expenses are incurred during the period in which notice was not
provided, and (iii) as provided by Section 8.5. (b) Except when a notice,
report or other filing must be filed immediately pursuant to Environmental
Laws, Purchaser will provide notice and an opportunity  to comment to Pfizer
before Purchaser files any Required Governmental Report or any other report,
notification or filing with any Governmental Authority or third party in
connection with an event that would be reasonably likely to result in a Loss
subject to the indemnification provisions of this Article. In the event
Purchaser is required to file a Required Governmental Report or any other
report, notification or filing immediately, Purchaser will provide
simultaneous notice to Pfizer when it files the report with the Governmental
Authority. Section 8.4 Third Party Claims. (a) The Indemnifying Party under
this  -------------------- Article VIII shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing, any
third party claim, action, suit or  proceeding (a "Third Party Claim"), and
the Indemnifying Party may  ------------------- compromise or settle the
same, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall give the Indemnified Party
advance notice of any proposed compromise of settlement, and provided,
further, that Third Party Claims (other than those related to  --------
------- Retained Liabilities) may be compromised or settled by the
Indemnifying Party only with the consent of the Indemnified Party if any such
compromise or settlement could reasonably be expected to have an adverse
impact on the ongoing Business. No Indemnified Party may compromise or settle
any Third Party Claim for which it is seeking indemnification hereunder
without the consent of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall
permit the Indemnified Party to participate in, but not control, the defense
of any such action or suit through counsel chosen by the Indemnified Party,
provided that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to control or conduct
the defense or prosecution of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
nevertheless shall have the right to participate in the defense or
prosecution of any Third Party Claim and, at its own expense, to employ
counsel of its own choosing for such purpose. (b) The parties hereto shall
cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim, with such
cooperation to include (i) the retention and the provision of the
Indemnifying Party records and information that are reasonably relevant to
such Third Party Claim, and (ii) the making available of employees on a
mutually convenient basis for proving additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. Section 8.5 Expiration. (a)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to  ---------- the contrary, if
the Closing shall have occurred, all covenants, agreements, warranties and
representations made herein or in any certificate delivered pursuant to
Exhibit A or B shall survive the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all

this Agreement and all indemnification obligations under Sections 8.1 with
respect thereto shall terminate and expire at, and no action or proceeding
seeking damages or other relief for breach of any thereof or for any
misrepresentation or inaccuracy with respect thereto shall be commenced

thereto shall have been made, with reasonable specificity, by written notice
given under Section 8.3. (b) As to indemnification obligations under Section

Sections 5.2 and 5.3 of this Agreement, for which there shall be no maximum
indemnification amount. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article
VIII, Pfizer shall not have any indemnification obligations for Losses under

indemnification agreement with any third party, (iii) any insurance proceeds
or other cash receipts or sources of reimbursement received as an offset

------------------ in an actual reduction in cash payments for Taxes in the
same fiscal year such Losses were incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection therewith. The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to maximize actual tax benefits. Indemnification under this Article
VIII shall not be available unless the Indemnified Party first uses
commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery from all Collateral Sources.
The Indemnifying Party may require an Indemnified Party to assign the rights

the parties\' sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement, other than with respect to remedies for fraud or intentional
breach. In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties hereby waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims
and causes of action (including rights of contributions, if any) known or
unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that
it may have against the Seller Corporations or any of their Affiliates, or
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, as the case may be, arising under or
based upon any federal, state or local Law (including any such Law relating
to environmental matters or arising under or based upon any securities Law,
common Law or otherwise); provided, however, that  -------- ------- neither
of the parties waive any rights, claims and causes of action
(including rights of contributions, if any) known or unknown, foreseen or
unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, related to the alleged
fraud or intentional breach of this Agreement by the other party
hereto. Section 8.10 Procedures for Remedial Actions. Notwithstanding
anything to  -------------------------------- the contrary in this
Agreement, except as otherwise provided in Sections 8.3 and 8.4 of this
Agreement, obligations for Remedial Action under this Agreement
and obligations with respect to the covenants in Sections 7.3(b) and 7.3(c)
of this Agreement are subject to the provisions of this Section 8.10. (a)
Pfizer shall have the right but not the obligation to conduct and control the
management of a Remedial Action at a property included in the Purchased
Assets that is subject to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement.  Pfizer
must notify Purchaser, within 30 days of receipt of notice of Purchaser\'s
claim for indemnification for such matter, that (i) it intends to undertake
said responsibility or (ii) that more information is needed from Purchaser
before Pfizer can reasonably determine that Purchaser\'s claim is subject to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement. Purchaser shall promptly respond
to such requests for information (to the extent such information
is reasonably available to Purchaser) and, within 30 days of receipt of
such information, Pfizer shall notify Purchaser as to whether it shall
undertake the Remedial Action. Prior to a determination by Pfizer that it
will undertake a Remedial Action pursuant to this Section, Purchaser shall
take only those actions necessary to comply with applicable Laws or address
conditions that pose an immediate and acute health risk (unless additional
actions are approved by Pfizer or unless additional actions are required to
comply with Governmental Orders). (b) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, in relation to the Known Milford Issues, Pfizer
shall be deemed to have given notice under Section 8.10(a). (c) In
undertaking a Remedial Action pursuant to this Section, Pfizer shall retain a
qualified independent environmental consultant, which consultant shall be
subject to Purchaser\'s approval (such approval not to be unreasonably
delayed or withheld). Pfizer shall consult with Purchaser in all material
aspects of the Remedial Action. Pfizer shall undertake such Remedial Action
in a prompt and expeditious fashion in accordance with applicable Laws and
shall not cause, through its own inaction, any undue delay in obtaining
written notice from the appropriate Governmental Authority that no further
investigation or remediation is necessary with respect to the matter that is
the subject of the indemnification claim to meet the Applicable Remedial
Action Standards or, if no Governmental Authority is involved in such matter,
a good faith determination from its environmental consultant that no further
investigation or remediation is required to bring the Purchased Assets into
conformance with Applicable Remedial Action Standards. Pfizer shall comply
with all applicable Laws, including all applicable Environmental Laws, with
respect to its performance pursuant to this Section. Pfizer shall provide
copies to Purchaser of all written notices, final submissions, final work
plans, and final reports and shall give Purchaser a reasonable opportunity
(at Purchaser\'s own expense) to comment on any submissions Pfizer intends to
deliver or submit to the appropriate Governmental Authority prior to said
submission. Purchaser may, at its own expense, hire its own consultants,
attorneys or other professionals to monitor the Remedial Action, including
any field work undertaken by Pfizer, and Purchaser shall provide Pfizer with
the results of all such monitoring. Notwithstanding the above, Purchaser
shall not take any actions that shall unreasonably interfere with Pfizer\'s
performance of the Remedial Action. Pfizer shall undertake any such work
required herein in a manner designed to minimize any disruption, to the
greatest extent possible, with the conduct of operations at the Conveyed
Companies. Purchaser shall allow Pfizer reasonable access to conduct any of
the work contemplated herein and shall fully cooperate with Pfizer in the
performance of the Remedial Action, including providing Pfizer with
reasonable access to employees and documents as necessary. (d) Pfizer\'s
performance of any Remedial Action pursuant to this Section 8.10 shall be
deemed to be complete (i) upon receipt of notice from the
relevant Governmental Authority indicating that no further Remedial Action is
required to be conducted (a "Governmental Sign-Off"); or (ii) where allowed
by applicable Environmental Law, a certification from a licensed
environmental professional or its equivalent that no further action is
necessary under applicable Laws (unless within the time specified by
applicable Law, if any, the relevant Governmental Authority determines that
further Remedial Action is required); or (iii) if no Governmental Authority
has asserted jurisdiction or if for any other reason Governmental Sign-Off is
not obtainable, when Pfizer\'s and Purchaser\'s environmental consultants
jointly agree that the Remedial Action has been completed in accordance with
the Applicable Remedial Action Standard; provided,  --------- however, that
if Pfizer\'s and Purchaser\'s environmental consultants are
unable -------- to reach such joint agreement, then Pfizer\'s and
Purchaser\'s environmental consultants shall jointly select an independent
third environmental consultant (the "Independent Consultant") acceptable to
each of them and that Independent Consultant shall review all relevant
information provided by Pfizer and Purchaser and shall make a determination,
which determination shall be binding on both Pfizer and Purchaser, as to
whether the Remedial Action has achieved the Applicable Remedial Action
Standard and no further action is required. In the event the Independent
Consultant finds that additional work is required, the scope and extent of
that work shall be negotiated by the parties. All fees, costs and expenses of
the Independent Consultant shall be borne equally (50% each) by Pfizer and
Purchaser. (e) If Pfizer declines to undertake the performance of a Remedial
Action as provided in Section 8.10(a), Purchaser shall be entitled to
undertake the Remedial Action to the Applicable Remedial Action Standards.
Purchaser shall promptly provide copies to Pfizer of all notices,
correspondence, draft reports, submissions, work plans, and final reports and
shall give Pfizer a reasonable opportunity (at Pfizer\'s own expense) to
comment on any submissions Purchaser intends to deliver or submit to any
appropriate Governmental Agency prior to said submission. Pfizer may, at its
own expense, hire its own consultants, attorneys or other professionals to
monitor the Remedial Action, including any field work undertaken by
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall provide to Pfizer the results of all such
field work. Notwithstanding the above, Pfizer shall not take any actions that
shall unreasonably interfere with Purchaser\'s performance of the Remedial
Action. Pfizer\'s decision to allow Purchaser to undertake Remedial Action
hereunder shall not limit or affect Pfizer\'s obligation to indemnify
Purchaser for said Remedial Action to the Applicable Remedial
Action Standards as otherwise provided in this Agreement. Section 8.11
Limitation on Remedial Action Obligations. (a) 
--------------------------------------------- Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, obligations for Remedial Action under this
Agreement and obligations with respect to the covenants in Sections 7.3(b)
and 7.3(c) of this Agreement are subject to the provisions of this Section
8.11. Pfizer shall be responsible for the cost of such Remedial Action only
to the extent necessary to meet the least stringent, most cost-effective
standard required by (i) applicable Law and (ii) consistent with the
industrial/commercial use of the Facility as of the Closing Date taking  into
consideration, where applicable, engineering and/or institutional controls or
a standard pursuant to applicable Environmental Laws acceptable to the
relevant Governmental Authorities making a claim for Remedial Action
(the "Applicable Remedial Action Standard"). Pfizer shall not be responsible
for  ------------------------------------- those costs incurred in
connection with a Remedial Action to the extent such  - costs arise from or
are exacerbated by actions of Purchaser, including the  - initiation of
Remedial Action by Purchaser or at the request of a Third Party in  - the
absence of a requirement of Environmental Law after the Closing Date.
For purposes of this Section 8.11, in determining the Applicable Remedial
Action Standard, the term Environmental Law shall mean those Laws applicable
to and governing the Remedial Action at the time the Remedial Action is being
conducted and as necessary to achieve completion of the Remedial Action
pursuant to the terms of Section 8.10(d) of this Agreement. (b) Unless
Purchaser otherwise agrees, Pfizer shall not seek to impose land use
restrictions solely to avoid obligations for Remedial Action, and
Pfizer shall not seek to impose land use restrictions and institutional and
engineering  controls at a Facility where Remedial Action is being conducted
other than those that (i) are required by any Governmental Authority; (ii) do
not interfere with the commercial/industrial use of the Facility; (iii)
prevent the use of groundwater; or (iv) Pfizer\'s and Purchaser\'s
environmental consultants agree are necessary because further Remedial Action
will not achieve the Applicable Remedial Action Standard. If Pfizer\'s and
Purchaser\'s environmental consultants are unable to reach such joint
agreement, the provisions of Section 8.10 (d)(iii) shall apply. Section 8.12
Limitation on Indemnification for Non-Compliance with 
---------------------------------------------------------- Environmental
Laws. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 
---------- Agreement, Purchaser shall not be entitled to claim or seek
indemnity or defense  under this Agreement for Environmental Liabilities
identified in subsection (iii) of the definition of Excluded Environmental
Liabilities or for breaches of representations and warranties in Section 5.11
relating to compliance with Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits to
the extent that such Environmental Liabilities arise out of or to the extent
that they are increased as a result of (i) changes (including increases or
decreases in production) in operations at a Facility after the Closing; (ii)
upgrades to a Facility after the Closing; (iii) Environmental Laws that are
enacted or come into effect after the Closing; or (iv) changes after the
Closing to Environmental Laws, Environmental Permits or criteria, guidance,
policy or interpretations in relation to Environmental Laws or Environmental
Permits. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Purchaser shall not be entitled to claim or seek indemnity or defense under
this Agreement  for Environmental Liabilities identified in subsection (iii)
of the definition of Excluded Environmental Liabilities without
documentation identifying (i) the specific nature of the failure to comply
with Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits; (ii) the actions necessary
to correct the failure to comply with Environmental laws or Environmental
Permits; and/or (iii) the specific costs incurred to correct the failure to
comply with Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits. ARTICLE
IX  TERMINATION Section 9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated
at any time prior  -----------  to the Closing: (a) by written agreement of
Purchaser and Pfizer, acting as agent for the Seller Corporations; (b) by
either Purchaser or Pfizer, by giving written notice of such termination to
the other party, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to July
31, 2003 (unless the failure to consummate the Closing by such date (i) shall
be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
have fulfilled any of its obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) is due to
the continuance of a waiting period or lack of an approval required under or
an injunction or equivalent thereof entered based upon any Competition Laws,
in which event Purchaser may not rely upon this Section 9.1 to terminate this
Agreement until the 1st anniversary of the date of this Agreement); or (c) by
either Pfizer or Purchaser if any court of competent jurisdiction or other
competent Governmental Authority of the United States of America,

10.7, 10.8, 10.9 and 10.11 hereof, and except that nothing herein will
relieve any party from Liability for any breach of any covenant set forth in
this Agreement prior to such termination. (b) In the event this Agreement

default under any term or provision hereof, such termination shall be without
prejudice to, and shall not affect, any and all rights to damages that the
other party may have hereunder or otherwise under  applicable Law. The

fees reasonably incurred by such party in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. (c) If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Section 9.1, Purchaser agrees that the prohibition in the Confidentiality
Agreement restricting Purchaser\'s ability to solicit any Employee to join
the employ of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates shall be extended to a
period of 3 years from the date of this Agreement, except that nothing in
this sentence shall restrict or preclude the rights of Purchaser to make
generalized searches for employees by the use of advertisements in the media
(including trade media) or by engaging search firms to engage in searches
that are not targeted or focused on the Employees employed by the
Business. ARTICLE X  MISCELLANEOUS Section 10.1 Notices. All notices or

Interest. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit  -------------------  of
and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and
