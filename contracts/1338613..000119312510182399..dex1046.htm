Interests or Units to the Buyer, shall be treated as a sale of such Zephyr
Owners Membership Interests or Units for cash. If, contrary to the forgoing,
the Parties hereto are required to treat the assignment, sale or transfer of
the Membership Interests and Units as a merger or consolidation of the
Companies with and into Buyer pursuant to Section 708(b)(2)(A) of the Code,
then the Parties intend that: (i) such merger or consolidation shall be
treated in the manner set forth in the Treasury Regulations Section
1.708-1(c)(3)(i); (ii) this Agreement is intended to and shall constitute an
election to treat such assignment, sale or transfer as a sale of Membership
Interests and Units by the Zephyr Owners to the extent of cash received
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(4); and (iii) to the
extent of cash received by any Zephyr Owner, to treat such Zephyr Owner as
selling their respective Membership Interests and Units for cash pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(4) and Example 5 of the Treasury
Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(5).

2.7 _Procedures_. 

(a) Upon the delivery to the Paying Agent by each Zephyr Owner of a duly
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit 2.7(a)_ (each, a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), including all
documents required pursuant thereto (collectively with the Letter of
Transmittal, the " _Owner Materials_ "), such Zephyr Owner shall be entitled
to receive, at the times specified herein, in exchange therefor the amount(s)
set forth in _Section 2.8 _and _Section 2.9_, as applicable, payable by the
Paying Agent in accordance with the Paying Agent Agreement. The amounts paid
pursuant to this _Section 2.7_ and the Paying Agent Agreement shall be deemed
to be full payment and satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Units and
Membership Interests represented by such Owner Materials, except for any
rights of the Zephyr Owners as set forth in this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements. Until the Owner Materials are delivered to the Paying Agent as
contemplated by this  _Section 2.7(a)_, each such Unit and Membership
Interest shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive the amount set forth in _Section 2.8_, as
applicable.

 

(b) As of the Effective Time, the books of the Companies shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no transfers of any Units or Membership Interests
of the Companies, as applicable.

2.8 _Closing Payments_.

 

(a) _Buyer Payments_. At the Closing, the Buyer shall make the following
payments:

 

(i) an amount equal to $27,750,000.00 (the " _Escrow Amount_ "), to be
deposited in an account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") with the Escrow Agent;



 

18 (ii) an amount equal to $250,000, to be deposited in an account with
the Escrow Agent to serve as the Owner Representative Reserve;

(iii) an amount equal to the Closing Payment Amount to be deposited with the
Paying Agent for disbursement among the Members and Unit Holders pursuant to
the Net Merger Consideration Payment Schedule and the Paying Agent Agreement;
provided that upon delivery of such payment by the Buyer to the Paying Agent,
the Buyers obligation to pay the Closing Payment Amount to the Members and
the Unit Holders at Closing shall be fully satisfied;

 

(iv) to the Owner Representative the DandO Tail Amount;

 

(v) to the extent unpaid, to each holder of any Third-Party Debt the amounts
specified in the Debt Payoff Letters; 

(vi) to the extent unpaid, to the payees of any Expenses in the amounts
specified in the Payoff Letters less, to the extent applicable, Medicaid,
Social Security, income tax, unemployment tax and other amounts required to be
withheld; and

 

(vii) an amount of $684,044 representing excess cash as of the Balance Sheet
Date to be deposited with the Paying Agent. 

(b) _Form of Payments_. All payments to be made by the Buyer pursuant to
_Section 2.8(a)_ shall be made 100% in cash in immediately available funds.

(c) _Escrow Account_. The Escrow Agent will hold the Escrow Amount delivered
pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_ in the Escrow Account, with such amount to be
held and disbursed pursuant to the provisions of the Escrow Agreement.

 

(d) _Withholding_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement any such
amounts required to be deducted and withheld with respect to payment under any
provision of Tax law. If the Buyer withholds any such amounts, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which the Buyer made such deduction or withholding.

2.9 _Merger Consideration Adjustment_.

(a) _Balance Sheet Date Net Working Capital_. The " _Balance Sheet Date Net
Working Capital_ " means $(5,878,475.00) (which is a negative number and
includes the Net Working Capital calculated as of the Balance Sheet Date plus
an agreed upon amount of $1,500,000), as calculated in the manner set forth
on  _Exhibit 2.9(a)_.

(b) _Estimates_. At least 5 Business Days prior to Closing, the Companies
shall prepare in good faith and deliver to the Buyer a statement (the "
_Estimated Closing Statement_ "), setting forth (i) Expenses, the Debt Payoff
Amount and a reasonably detailed determination of the Companies good faith
estimation of (A) the Net Working



 

19  Capital as of the Effective Time plus an agreed upon amount of $1,500,000
(the " _Estimated Effective Time Net Working Capital_ ") calculated in the
same manner as the calculation of the Balance Sheet Date Net Working Capital
set forth on _Exhibit 2.9(a)_, (B) the Net Income Amount (the " _Estimated
Net Income Amount_ ") calculated in the same manner as the calculation on
_Exhibit 2.9(b)_ and (C) the Reimbursable Amount (the " _Estimated
Reimbursable Amount_ "), together with reasonably detailed supporting
information, (ii) based on such Estimated Effective Time Net Working Capital,
the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount and (iii) the Companies
calculation of the Closing Payment Amount. If the Estimated Effective Time Net
Working Capital is less than the Balance Sheet Date Net Working Capital, the
amount equal to such difference is the " _Estimated Net Working Capital
Deficiency_." If the Estimated Effective Time Net Working Capital is greater
than the Balance Sheet Date Net Working Capital, the amount equal to such
difference is the " _Estimated Net Working Capital Excess_." The Expenses and
the Debt Payoff Amount to be set forth on the Estimated Closing Statement
shall be based on amounts set forth in the Payoff Letters and Debt Payoff
Letters, or, to the extent a Payoff Letter or Debt Payoff Letter has not been
provided for any Expense or Third-Party Debt, the Companies good faith
estimate of such amount, and in each case, shall be subject to final
determination in the preparation of the Closing Statement. If the Buyer
has any questions or disagreements regarding the Estimated Closing Statement,
the Buyer shall contact the Owner Representative at least 2 Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, and in such case the Owner Representative and the
Buyer shall in good faith attempt to resolve any questions or disagreements.
If the Owner Representative and the Buyer agree on changes to the Companies
proposed Estimated Closing Statement (including the Expenses, the Debt Payoff
Amount, the calculation of the Estimated Effective Time Net Working Capital,
the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount, the Estimated Net Income
Amount, the Estimated Reimbursable Amount, or the Closing Payment Amount set
forth therein) based on such discussions, then the Closing Payment Amount to
be paid at Closing shall be determined by giving effect to such changes (and
the Estimated Closing Statement, as so adjusted, shall be deemed to be the
Estimated Closing Statement for all purposes herein). If the
Owner Representative and the Buyer do not agree on changes to such amounts,
then the Closing Payment Amount to be paid at Closing shall be determined
based on the amounts set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement initially
delivered by the Companies. In either such case, appropriate adjustments to
the Merger Consideration shall be made after the Closing pursuant to _Sections
2.9(c)_ and _2.9(d)_.

 

(c) _Post-Closing Merger Consideration Reconciliation_.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, but in no
event later than 60 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer Parties shall
prepare in good faith and deliver to the Owner Representative a statement (the
" _Closing Statement_ "), setting forth (A) Expenses, the Debt Payoff Amount
and a reasonably detailed proposed final calculation of (1) the Net Working
Capital as of the Effective Time (" _Effective Time Net Working Capital_ ")
calculated in the same manner as the calculation of the Balance Sheet Date Net
Working Capital set forth on  _Exhibit 2.9(a)_, (2) the Net Income Amount
calculated in the same manner as the calculation on _Exhibit 2.9(b)_ and (3)
the Reimbursable Amount,

 



 

20  together with reasonably detailed supporting information, (B) based on such
Effective Time Net Working Capital, the Working Capital Adjustment Amount and
(C) based on such amounts, the Merger Consideration Surplus or the Merger
Consideration Deficit.

(ii) From and after the delivery of the Closing Statement, the Buyer Parties
shall provide the Owner Representative and its Representatives reasonable
access to the records and employees of the Buyer Parties and their Affiliates
and shall cause the employees of the Buyer Parties and their Affiliates to
cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Owner Representative in
connection with its review of such work papers and other documents and
information relating to the calculation of Expenses, the Debt Payoff Amount,
the Reimbursable Amount, the Effective Time Net Working Capital and the Net
Income Amount, as the Owner Representative shall reasonably request and that
are available to the Buyer Parties and their Affiliates.

 

(iii) Within 30 days after the Owner Representatives receipt of the Closing
Statement, the Owner Representative shall notify the Buyer if the Owner
Representative disagrees with the Closing Statement, which notice shall set
forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement (the "
_Objection Notice_ "). If the Owner Representative provides a notice of
agreement or does not deliver to the Buyer an Objection Notice within such
30-day period, then the Owner Representative shall be deemed to have accepted
the calculations and the amounts set forth in the Closing Statement delivered
by the Buyer, which shall then be final, binding and conclusive for all
purposes hereunder. If any such Objection Notice is timely delivered, then the
Owner Representative and the Buyer shall each endeavor in good faith for a
period of 30 days thereafter to resolve any disagreements with respect to the
calculations in the Closing Statement.

 

(iv) If, at the end of the 30-day resolution period, the Owner Representative
and the Buyer are unable to resolve any disagreement between them with
respect to the preparation of the Closing Statement, then each such Party
shall deliver simultaneously to PricewaterhouseCoopers (or if such firm is
unwilling or unable to serve, another nationally recognized accounting firm
mutually agreed on by such Parties, the accounting firm ultimately chosen, the
" _Accountants_ ") the Objection Notice, the Closing Statement and any
engagement, indemnity and other agreements as the Accountants may require as
a condition to such engagement (each a " _Submission_ ") within 5 days of
retaining the Accountants (the " _Closing Statement Submission Deadline_ ").
Such Parties shall instruct the Accountants to deliver to the Parties a
written determination (such determination to include a worksheet setting forth
all material calculations used in arriving at such determination and to be
based solely on information provided to the Accountants by the Parties,
or their respective Affiliates) of, and the Accountants engagement shall be
limited to the resolution of, disputed amounts set forth in the Closing
Statement that have been identified by the Owner Representative in the
Objection Notice, which resolution shall be in



 

21  accordance with this Agreement, and no other matter relating to the Closing
Statement shall be subject to determination by the Accountants except to the
extent affected by resolution of the disputed amounts. In resolving any
disputed item, the Accountants shall not assign a value to any item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by the Buyer or the Owner
Representative or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by the
Buyer or the Owner Representative. Such Parties shall cooperate diligently
with any reasonable request of the Accountants in an effort to resolve any
disputed matter as soon as reasonably possible after the Accountants are
engaged. If possible, the decision of the Accountants shall be made within 20
days after the Closing Statement Submission Deadline. The fees and expenses of
the Accountants shall be allocated by the Accountants between the Buyer
Parties, on the one hand, and the Zephyr Owners, on the other hand, and in
accordance with their Zephyr Owner Percentage (which the Owner Representative
must first pay out of the Owner Representative Reserve, to the extent
available), so that the aggregate amount of such fees and expenses paid by
the Zephyr Owners bears the same proportion to the total fees and expenses as
the aggregate dollar amount of items unsuccessfully disputed by the Owner
Representative, if any (as determined by the Accountants), bears to the total
dollar amount of items in dispute, and the Buyer Parties shall pay the
remainder of such fees and expenses, if any. The determination of the
Accountants shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder,
absent manifest error or fraud.

(d) _True-Up Payment_. If the Final Adjustment Amount is less than the
Estimated Adjustment Amount (the amount of such shortfall, if any, the "
_Merger Consideration Deficit_ "), the Owner Representative and Buyer Parties
shall, within 5 Business Days after the final determination of the Closing
Statement, promptly deliver joint instructions to the Escrow Agent,
instructing the Escrow Agent to (i) pay to Buyer from the Escrow Account, in
cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Buyer, an amount equal to the Merger Consideration Deficit and (ii) pay to
an account or accounts designated by the Owner Representative in cash by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to $9,250,000.00
_less_ the Merger Consideration Deficit (if such difference is a positive
number). If the Final Adjustment Amount is more than the Estimated Adjustment
Amount (the amount of such excess, the " _Merger Consideration Surplus_ "),
(i) Buyer shall, within 5 Business Days after the final determination of the
Closing Statement, promptly pay to an account or accounts designated by the
Owner Representative in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
an amount equal to the Merger Consideration Surplus and (ii) Owner
Representative and Buyer Parties shall, within 5 Business Days after the final
determination of the Closing Statement, promptly deliver joint instructions to
the Escrow Agent, instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to an account
or accounts designated by the Owner Representative from the Escrow Account,
in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to
$9,250,000.00. Any payment due either Buyer or the Owner Representative under
this  _Section 2.9(d) _shall accrue interest at an annual rate equal to the
Agreed Rate, which interest shall begin to accrue on the Closing Date and end
on the date such payment is made.

 



 

22 (e) _No Duplicative Effect_. The provisions of this  _Section 2.9_ shall
apply in such a manner so as not to give the components and calculations
duplicative effect to any item of adjustment and, the Parties covenant and
agree that no amount shall be (or is intended to be) included, in whole or in
part (either as an increase or reduction) more than once in the calculations
of (including any component of) Net Working Capital or any other calculated
amount pursuant to this Agreement if the effect of such additional inclusion
(either as an increase or reduction) would be to cause such amount to be
overstated or understated for purposes of such calculation.

2.10  _Closing Date_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Locke Lord
Bissell and Liddell LLP, at 10:00 a.m., Houston, Texas time no later than
five (5) Business Days after all conditions precedent set forth in _Sections
7.1_, _7.2_ and _7.3_ shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions precedent that by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing)
or at such other date and time as the Parties may agree. The date on which
the Closing shall occur is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_ ".

has received any written notice of termination or breach of any Material
Contract and to the Companies Knowledge, neither Company has received oral
notice of any breach or violation of any Material Contract or termination or
intention to terminate any Material Contract. Each Company has complied in
all material respects with the terms of each Material Contract to which it is
a party and has performed all of its material obligations thereunder. To the
Companies Knowledge, there has not occurred any event that (with the
lapse of time or the giving of notice or both) would constitute a default

Property that is currently used in the operation of such Companys business,
and to the Knowledge of the Companies, the use of such Intellectual Property
by the Surviving Company in substantially the same manner following the
Closing will not infringe upon the rights of any third party, and (b) has
taken reasonable measures to protect the proprietary nature of each item of
such Intellectual Property, and to maintain in confidence all trade secrets
and confidential information that it owns or uses, in each case except as
would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect. No third party has delivered a written notice, or to the Companies
Knowledge oral notice, to the Companies asserting a claim that any Company is
infringing on the Intellectual Property of such third party and, to the
Knowledge of the Companies, no third party is infringing on the Intellectual
Property owned or exclusively licensed by any Company.

former employee, officer or director of a Company or any ERISA Affiliate,
except to the extent required by Law.

 

(c) Each Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
Laws, and the Companies and all ERISA Affiliates have satisfied all of their
statutory, regulatory, financial and contractual obligations with respect to
each such Plan, in each case except where the failure to do so would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. No Proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Companies, threatened with respect to any Plan (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course of business).

 

(d) There has been no prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section

provision of this Agreement) to the contrary, _Section 3.9_ (Taxes),
_Section 3.12_ (Employee Benefit Plans) and _Section 3.13_ (Environmental

either Company under such insurance policies upon or as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Companies, there are no organizational campaigns, petitions or other
unionization activities focusing on persons employed by a Company that
seek recognition of a collective bargaining unit, or (b) subject to any

has a valid leasehold interest in all material personal property that is
necessary for the ownership and operation of its business as currently
conducted. Such personal property of the Companies is in sufficiently good

of the Companies to be operated in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practices of the Companies. As of the date of this Agreement, all of
the material assets of the Companies are free and clear of all Liens except

court or other Governmental Authority, which decree, judgment, injunction or
other order would make the transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal

of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Buyer Parties and the
Companies shall use Reasonable Efforts to contest and resist any such action
or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any such

(a) The Companies shall provide the Buyer Parties with prompt written notice

Companies have Knowledge that causes or would be reasonably likely to cause
any representation or warranty of the Companies contained in this Agreement or

respect at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Closing determined

Companies provide any such notice after the tenth Business Day prior to the
Termination Date. The Buyer Parties shall have 10 Business Days to review each

of Buyer under _Sections 8.2_ or _9.1(b)_ of this Agreement; _provided,
however_ , that if any Schedule Update, together with all other prior Schedule
Updates, gives the Buyer Parties a right to terminate the Agreement pursuant

cure period referenced in _Section 9.1(b)_ is applicable, within five (5)

related to such Schedule Update.

indemnification obligations, if any, pursuant to _Article VIII_ as if such
Schedule Update did not occur.

Affiliates will not and will cause each of their respective employees,

Companies, the assets of the Companies, or any material portion thereof, or

TAX MATTERS

 

6.1 _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns, Payment of Taxes_.

 

(a) _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_. The Owner Representative shall prepare all Tax
Returns required to be filed by or with respect to each Company for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period (" _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_ "). For the avoidance of
doubt, the Owner Representative shall cause to be prepared and timely filed
the federal income Tax Returns for the Companies on IRS Form 1065 and all
corresponding state income Tax Returns for the period that ends on the Closing
Date. The Pre-Closing Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with
past practice except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law. Not
later than twenty (20) days prior to the due date for filing any such Tax
Return, the Owner Representative shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return,
together with all supporting documentation and workpapers, to Buyer for its
review and reasonable comment. The Buyer will cause such Tax Return (as
revised to incorporate Buyers reasonable comments) to be timely filed and
will provide a copy to the Owner Representative. Not later than five (5) days
prior to the due date for payment of Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Return, the Zephyr Owners shall pay to the Buyer the amount of any Zephyr
Owner Taxes with respect to such Tax Return.

 

(b) _Straddle Period Tax Returns_. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared
all Tax Returns of the Companies for all Straddle Periods (" _Straddle Tax
Returns_ "). Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with
past practice except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law. Buyer
shall file, or cause to be filed, all Straddle Tax Returns. Buyer shall
provide a copy of each Straddle Tax Return, together with all supporting
documentation and workpapers, to the Owner Representative at least twenty (20)
days before the due date for such Tax Return. Prior to the filing of any
Straddle Tax Return, Buyer shall make any revisions or adjustments reasonably
requested by the Zephyr Owners. Not later than five (5) days prior to the due
date for payment of Taxes with respect to any Straddle Tax Return, the Zephyr
Owners shall pay to the Buyer the amount of any Zephyr Owner Taxes with
respect to such Tax Return for the amounts owed by the Zephyr Owners as
calculated in the following sentence. Liability for Taxes attributable to a
Straddle Period shall be apportioned between Buyer and Zephyr Owners as
follows: (i) property and similar ad valorem Taxes shall be apportioned to the
Zephyr Owners for the period up to and including the Closing Date and to the
Buyer for the period after the Closing Date on a ratable daily basis; and
(ii) all other Taxes shall be apportioned between Buyer and Zephyr Owners
based on an interim closing of the books of each of the Companies as of the
Closing Date. For this purpose, any margin or franchise Tax paid or payable
with respect to the Companies shall be allocated to the



 

44  taxable period during which the income, receipts, operations, assets or
capital comprising the base of such Tax is measured, regardless of whether the
right to do business for another taxable period is obtained by the payment of
such Tax.

6.2 _Responsibility for Tax Audits and Contests_. The Zephyr Owners
shall control any audit or contest with respect to any Taxes for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period; _provided, however_ , that the Party with the greater
potential Tax liability shall control any audit or contest with respect to a
Straddle Period; provided further, that the Party so in control of an audit
or contest with respect to a Straddle Period shall allow the other Party to
participate at such other Partys cost and expense. The Party in control of an
audit or controversy shall keep the other Party informed of the status of the
audit or controversy (including providing copies of correspondence and
pleadings). Neither Buyer nor the Zephyr Owners shall settle any audit or
contest in a way that would adversely affect the other Party without the
other Partys written consent, which the other Party shall not unreasonably
withhold.

6.3 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Buyer, the Zephyr Owners and the Owner
Representative shall cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably requested
by another Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit
or contest with respect to Taxes imposed on or with respect to the assets,
operations or activities of the Companies. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or audit or
contest. The Owner Representative further agrees, upon request, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary
to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on the Buyer
or the Companies (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).

 

6.4 _Amended Tax Returns_. Unless required by applicable Law or as set forth
below, Buyer agrees not to amend any of the Companies previously filed Tax
Returns without Zephyr Owners prior consent if such amended Tax Return or
settlement would increase (other than a de minimis amount) the amount of
Zephyr Owner Taxes. Notwithstanding the above, Buyer may file or cause to be
filed an amended Tax Return even if not required by applicable Law without the
consent of the Zephyr Owners, provided that any additional Taxes resulting
therefrom will not be deemed to constitute Zephyr Owner Taxes.

 

6.5 _Tax Refunds_. The Zephyr Owners shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes
paid with respect to Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall be
entitled to all other refunds except that refunds for a Straddle Period shall
be apportioned between the Buyer and the Zephyr Owners in accordance with the
principles set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_. If a Party receives a refund to
which the other Party is entitled, the Party receiving the refund shall pay it
to the Party entitled to the refund within twenty (20) Business Days after
receipt, net of any costs or expenses incurred by such party or
its Affiliates in procuring such refund.

6.6 _Transfer Taxes_. All state or local transfer, sales, use, stamp,
registration or other similar Taxes resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, together with any interest, penalties or
additions thereto, shall be borne equally by Buyer and the Zephyr Owners.

 



 

45 6.7 _Merger Consideration Allocation_. At least five (5) days prior to
the Closing, the Owner Representative shall deliver a proposed Allocation (as
defined below) to the Buyer. The Owner Representative and Buyer shall
thereafter use their best efforts to agree on the Allocation. The Merger
Consideration (together with the liabilities of the Companies assumed by the
Buyer) shall be allocated among the assets of the Companies subject to any
applicable Code sections and Treasury regulations (and any similar provision
of state, local or foreign Law, as appropriate) (the " _Allocation_ "). The
Zephyr Owners and Buyer shall report the transactions contemplated hereby on
all Tax Returns, including, but not limited to Form 8594, as applicable, in a
manner consistent with the Allocation. If the Merger Consideration is
subsequently adjusted for any reason such that an adjustment to the Allocation
is needed in order for such Allocation to comply with this _Section 6.7_, the
Owner Representative shall prepare such adjustment to the Allocation which
adjustment shall be submitted to Buyer, and the Owner Representative and Buyer
shall use their best efforts to agree on the final adjustment within thirty
(30) days after the determination of the adjusted Merger Consideration. Buyer
and its Affiliates shall timely and properly prepare, execute, file, and
deliver all such documents, forms, and other information as the Owner
Representative may reasonably request in preparing any required adjustment to
the Allocation. If, contrary to the intent of the parties hereto as expressed
in this _Section 6.7_, any Taxing authority makes or proposes an allocation
different from the Allocation determined under this _Section 6.7_, the Owner
Representative and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in good faith to
contest such Taxing authoritys allocation (or proposed allocation), provided,
however, that, after consultation with the party (or parties) adversely
affected by such allocation (or proposed allocation), the other party (or
parties) hereto may file such protective claims or Tax Returns as may be
reasonably required to protect its (or their) interests.

 

6.8 _Disputes over Tax Provisions_. The Accountants shall resolve any dispute
between Buyer and the Zephyr Owners over the calculation of Taxes and under
this _Article VI_ substantially in the manner described in _Section
2.9(c)(iv)_.

agreement in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement
will survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to the
preceding provisions if written notice of the inaccuracy or breach thereof
giving rise to such right of indemnity has been given to the Party against
whom such indemnification may be sought prior to such time; _provided_ that
such right of indemnity shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis for
indemnification hereunder only until the related claim for indemnification
is resolved or disposed of in accordance with the terms of this _Article
VIII_ (any such claim, a " _Continuing Claim_ ").

 

8.2 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Article VIII_ , the Zephyr Owners will jointly and severally (except for
Individual Claims as provided in _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_, which shall be several
and not joint subject to _Section 8.2(c)_) indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Buyer Parties and their officers, members, directors, partners,
managers, employees and Affiliates (the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ")
against any and all claims, demands, causes of action, Liabilities, damages,
judgments, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys and
consultants fees and expenses) (" _Losses_ ") incurred or suffered as a
result of, relating to or arising out of:

 

(i) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Companies in this Agreement (other than any representation or warranty made
by the Companies in _Section 3.3_ or _Section 3.9_ of this Agreement or any
closing certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_ as it relates to
such representations and warranties);

(ii) the inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty made by a Zephyr
Owner in a Letter of Transmittal (only with respect to representations and
warranties regarding title to the Units and Membership Interests and authority
of such Zephyr Owner (an " _Individual Claim_ ")) and the inaccuracy or breach
of any representation or warranty made by the Companies in _Section 3.3_ of
this Agreement or any closing certificate delivered pursuant to _Section
7.1(a)_ solely to the extent it relates to such representations and
warranties;

(iv) the Merger Consideration Deficit, if any;



 

52 (v) any Third-Party Debt, Expenses, Change of Control Amounts and
Severance Obligations that do not result in a reduction in the Merger

(vi) any and all Zephyr Owner Taxes.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, the Buyer Parties will jointly and severally
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Zephyr Owners and their officers,
members, directors, partners, managers, employees and Affiliates (the " _Owner
Indemnified Parties_ ") against any and all Losses incurred or suffered as a
result of, relating to or arising out of: 

(i) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Buyer Parties in this Agreement or any closing certificate delivered pursuant
to _Section 7.2(a)_, to the extent such a representation or warranty survives

(ii) the breach or non-performance of any covenant or agreement made or to be
performed by any Buyer Parties pursuant to this Agreement or any closing
certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_; and

(iii) except to the extent the Zephyr Owners are required to indemnify the
Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_, the ownership and
operation of the assets and properties of the Companies after the Effective
Time.

 

(c) The indemnification obligations of a Zephyr Owner with respect to an
Individual Claim will be joint and several with the indemnification
obligations of all other Zephyr Owners to the extent of any Losses incurred
solely to the extent that there are funds remaining in the Escrow Account to
cover such Losses. To the extent that there are insufficient funds
remaining in the Escrow Account to cover such Losses, the indemnification
obligations of each Zephyr Owner with respect to such Individual Claim shall
be several and not joint solely to the extent of any Losses incurred in excess
of the amount remaining in the Escrow Account.



   8.3 | _Limitations on Liability_. 
---|--- 
 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Zephyr Owners
obligations pursuant to  _Section 8.2(a)_ are subject to the following
additional limitations:

(i) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover under
_Section 8.2(a)(i)_ for any individual item or series of related items
arising out of the same or similar set of facts or circumstances where the
Losses relating thereto for which the Zephyr Owners would otherwise be
required to indemnify are less than $25,000 (each, a " _De Minimis Loss
Amount_ ") and no De Minimis Loss Amounts shall be included in the calculation
of the Basket;

 

(ii) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover under
_Section 8.2(a)(i)_, until the aggregate Losses which the Buyer Indemnified
Parties



 

53  have incurred under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_, exceeds $1,850,000.00 (the "
_Basket_ "), at which point the Buyer Indemnified Parties will be entitled to
Losses in excess of the Basket up to the Ceiling;

(iii) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover under 
_Sections 8.2(a)(i)_, _8.2(a)(iii)_ , _8.2(a)(iv)_ , _8.2(a)(v)_ and

_Ceiling_ ");

 

(iv) with respect to Non-Escrow Indemnity Claims, a Buyer Indemnified Party
shall not be entitled to recover from any Zephyr Owner in excess of an amount
equal to the applicable Zephyr Owner Percentage multiplied by the amount of
Losses incurred with respect to such claims (the " _Individual Indemnity
Limit_ "); provided this Individual Indemnity Limit shall not prevent a Buyer
Indemnified Party from recovering the full amount of any indemnification claim
from the Escrow Account irrespective of the Zephyr Owner Percentage of any
Zephyr Owner; and

 

(v) in no event shall a Buyer Indemnified Party be entitled to recover from a
Zephyr Owner in excess of the Merger Consideration actually received by such
Zephyr Owner (taking into account any distributions from the Escrow Account
for Individual Claims with respect to such Zephyr Owner).

 

(b) _Waiver of Consequential Damages_. With respect to any and all Losses for
which indemnification may be available hereunder, no Indemnifying Parties
shall have any liability for any consequential, indirect, punitive, exemplary,
and special damages with respect to any claim for which an Indemnifying Party
may have liability pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that this
waiver shall not apply to the extent such consequential, indirect, punitive,
exemplary or special damages are (i) awarded in a Proceeding brought or
asserted by a third party against an Indemnified Party, or (ii) actually paid
by an Indemnified Party to a third party.

(c) _ESCROW AMOUNT_. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO NON-ESCROW INDEMNITY CLAIMS, THE
AMOUNT IN THE ESCROW ACCOUNT SHALL BE THE SOLE RECOURSE FOR ANY PAYMENT
REQUIRED TO BE MADE BY THE ZEPHYR OWNERS TO ANY BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTY
PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO NON-ESCROW INDEMNITY
CLAIMS, THE AMOUNT IN THE ESCROW ACCOUNT SHALL BE THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF LOSSES
RECOVERABLE BY ANY BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTY PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT. SUBJECT
TO THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN _SECTIONS 8.3(a)(iv)_ and _8.3(a)(v)_ , IF A
CLAIM FOR INDEMNIFICATION IS BROUGHT BY A BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTY WITH RESPECT
TO A NON-ESCROW INDEMNITY CLAIM, THE BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTY MAY FIRST RECOVER
THE LOSSES INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO SUCH CLAIM FROM THE ESCROW ACCOUNT IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE ESCROW AGREEMENT TO THE EXTENT OF AMOUNTS AVAILABLE IN
THE ESCROW ACCOUNT, AND THEREAFTER SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ANY LOSSES
WITH RESPECT TO A NON-ESCROW INDEMNITY CLAIM NOT RECOVERED FROM THE ESCROW
ACCOUNT FROM THE APPLICABLE ZEPHYR OWNER.



 

54 (d) _Exclusive Remedy and Release_. Other than with respect to claims for
fraud, the indemnification and remedies set forth in this _Article VIII_
shall, from and after the Closing, constitute the sole and exclusive remedies
of the Parties with respect to any breach of representation or warranty
or non-performance, partial or total, of any covenant or agreement (except
for the covenants contained in _Section 2.9(d)_, _Section 5.2(b)_, _Section
5.5_, _Section 5.7_, and _Article VI_ ) contained in this Agreement;
_provided_ that nothing in this _Section 8.3_ shall prevent either Party from
seeking injunctive or equitable relief, including, but not limited to,
specific performance.

 

(e) _Disclaimer_. EACH BUYER PARTY HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT
FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN _ARTICLE III_
AND IN THE CERTIFICATE(S) TO BE DELIVERED PURSUANT TO _SECTION 7.1(a),_ AND
THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE ZEPHYR OWNERS IN THE LETTERS OF
TRANSMITTAL, THERE ARE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTER RELATING TO THE COMPANIES, THE UNITS,
THE MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS, THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF ANY OF THE ASSETS OF THE
COMPANIES, THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OR OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO THE
PHYSICAL CONDITION OR USE OF ANY ASSETS OF THE COMPANIES, THE VALUE OF THE
ASSETS OF THE COMPANIES (OR ANY PORTION THEREOF), THE MERCHANTABILITY OR
FITNESS OF THE PERSONAL PROPERTY OR ANY OTHER PORTION OF THE ASSETS OF THE
COMPANIES FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ANY STATEMENTS OR INFORMATION
CONTAINED IN THE ANY OTHER MATERIALS FURNISHED OR STATEMENTS MADE BY THE
COMPANIES OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
PROJECTIONS, ESTIMATES OR BUDGETS DELIVERED TO OR MADE AVAILABLE TO BUYER OF
FUTURE REVENUES, FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE
FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANIES, OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION MADE AVAILABLE
TO THE BUYER PARTIES OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AT ANY TIME IN ANY AND ALL
"DATA ROOMS," MANAGEMENT PRESENTATIONS, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION MEMORANDA,
BREAK-OUT SESSIONS, OR RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY THE BUYER PARTIES
OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES). WITHOUT IN ANY WAY LIMITING THE FOREGOING,
THE COMPANIES HEREBY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO TITLE
AND AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT
TO ANY PORTION OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANIES, THE UNITS OR THE MEMBERSHIP
INTERESTS, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH
IN _ARTICLE III_ AND IN THE CERTIFICATE(S) TO BE DELIVERED PURSUANT TO
_SECTION 7.1(a),_ AND THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE ZEPHYR OWNERS
IN THE LETTERS OF TRANSMITTAL. 



 

55 (f) THE COMPANIES HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, EXCEPT FOR
THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN _ARTICLE IV_ AND
IN THE CERTIFICATE(S) TO BE DELIVERED PURSUANT TO _SECTION 7.2(A)_, THERE ARE
NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT
TO ANY MATTER RELATING TO THE BUYER PARTIES MADE BY THE BUYER PARTIES OR
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES.

(g) Buyer is not entitled to indemnification under this _Article VIII_ in
respect of the calculation of the Final Adjustment Amount, or matters
reflected in the calculation thereof, except to the extent that a value used
in the calculation of Final Adjustment Amount is inaccurate because of the
failure of a representation or warranty made by Companies in this Agreement to
be true and correct as of the Closing. If the Buyer Parties are entitled to
indemnification due to the exception set forth in the previous sentence, the
Buyer Parties claim shall be limited to the amount that exceeds the
inaccurate value reflected in the calculation of the Final Adjustment Amount,
and is subject to the limitations on indemnification hereunder,
including without limitation the Basket and Ceiling; provided that if any
difference between the Estimated Adjustment Amount and the Final Adjustment
Amount is the direct result of such a failure, Buyer shall not be entitled to
indemnification for such failure under this _Article VIII_.

8.4 _Procedures_. Claims for indemnification under this Agreement shall
be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) If any Person who or which is entitled to seek indemnification under 
_Section 8.2_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") receives notice of the assertion
or commencement of any claim asserted against an Indemnified Party by a third
party (" _Third-Party Claim_ ") in respect of any matter that is subject to
indemnification under _Section 8.2_, the Indemnified Party shall promptly (i)
notify the Party(ies) obligated to indemnify (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of
the Third-Party Claim and (ii) transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written
notice (" _Claim Notice_ ") describing in reasonable detail the nature of the
Third-Party Claim, a copy of all papers served with respect to such claim (if
any), the Indemnified Partys best estimate of the amount of Losses
attributable to the Third-Party Claim and the basis of the Indemnified Partys
request for indemnification under this Agreement. Failure to timely provide
such Claim Notice shall not affect the right of the Indemnified Partys
indemnification hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
prejudiced by such delay or omission.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified
Party against such Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost
and expense. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim (such
election to be without prejudice to the right of the Indemnifying Party to
dispute whether such claim is an indemnifiable Loss under this _Article VIII_
), then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such Third-Party
Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (who shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), by all appropriate
proceedings, to a final conclusion or settlement at the discretion of the
Indemnifying

 



 

56  Party in accordance with this _Section 8.4(b)_. The Indemnifying Party
shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any
compromise or settlement thereof;  _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party
shall not enter into any settlement agreement without the written consent of
the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided further_ , that such consent shall not be
required if (i) the settlement agreement contains a complete and unconditional
general release by the third party asserting the claim to all Indemnified
Parties affected by the claim, (ii) the settlement agreement does not contain
any sanction or restriction upon the conduct of any business by, and does not
contain an injunction or other equitable relief upon, the Indemnified Party or
its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to employ separate counsel to represent the Indemnified
Party if the Indemnified Party is advised by outside counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party that a conflict of interest exists that
requires the Indemnified Party to be represented by separate counsel under
the applicable rules of professional responsibility or if the court in which
such Third-Party Claim is pending determines that a conflict of interest
exists such that the Indemnifying Partys counsel is prohibited by such court
or otherwise unable to represent the Indemnified Party with respect to such
Third-Party Claim or if there is one or more defenses that could be asserted
by the Indemnified Party that could not be asserted by the Indemnifying Party
or the Indemnifying Partys counsel (on the Indemnified Partys behalf), and,
in the event the Indemnified Party has the right to employ separate counsel
for the reasons set forth in this sentence, the reasonable expenses and fees
of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. If requested
by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees, at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party, to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party
and its counsel in contesting any Third-Party Claim which the Indemnifying
Party elects to contest, including the making of any related counterclaim
against the Person asserting the Third-Party Claim or any cross complaint
against any Person. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not
control, any defense or settlement of any Third-Party Claim controlled by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 8.4(b)_, and the Indemnified
Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation.

(c) Unless and until the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to
_Section 8.4(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, and
be reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense (but only if
the Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in
regard to the Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party
(who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party), by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by
the Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall
defend any such Third-Party Claim in good faith and have full control of such
defense and proceedings; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Party may
not enter into any compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim if
indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying Partys
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any
defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this
_Section 8.4(c)_, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and
expenses with respect to such participation.



 

57 (d) Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of Losses that does
not result from a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") will be asserted
by giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but
in any event not later than 30 days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware
of such Direct Claim. Such notice by the Indemnified Party will describe the
Direct Claim in reasonable detail, will include copies of all available
material written evidence thereof and will indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of Losses that have been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will have a period of five (5)
Business Days within which to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such period, the Indemnifying
Party will be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which event the
Indemnified Party will be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to
the Indemnified Party subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

(e) Any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be net
of any insurance proceeds realized by and paid to the Indemnified Party in
respect of such claim.

8.5 _Characterization of Payments_. For all applicable income Tax purposes,
the parties agree to treat (and will cause each of their respective Affiliates
to treat) any indemnification payment under this _Article VIII_ as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration.

 

8.6 _Losses_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for
purposes of determining whether a breach has occurred and the amount of
Losses suffered by any Buyer Indemnified Party, upon a breach of any
representation or warranty of the Companies or a Zephyr Owner, each
representation and warranty set forth in _Article III_ (other than in any
defined terms such as "Material Contract"), shall be read without regard to
and without giving effect to any "material," "materiality," Material Adverse
Effect or similar qualifications that may be contained in any
such representation or warranty.

ARTICLE IX

(b) by the Buyer by written notice to the Companies, if there has been a
breach by any Company of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in
this Agreement (except where such breach would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect) that has prevented the satisfaction of
any condition to the obligations of the Buyer Parties at the Closing and, if
such breach is of a character that it is capable of being cured, such breach
has not been cured by the Companies within 



 

58  20 days after written notice thereof from the Buyer Parties; _provided_ ,
_however_ , if such breach is capable of being cured but is not capable of
being cured within such 20 day period, it shall be sufficient for the
Companies to commence the cure within such 20 day period and use Reasonable
Efforts to continue to cure;

 

(c) by the Companies by written notice to the Buyer Parties, if there has been
a breach by any Buyer Party of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement (except where such breach would not reasonably be
expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect) that has prevented the
satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of the Companies at the
Closing and, if such breach is of a character that it is capable of being
cured, such breach has not been cured by the Buyer Parties within 20 days
after written notice thereof from the Companies; _provided_ , _ however_ , if
such breach is capable of being cured but is not capable of being cured within
such 20 day period, it shall be sufficient for the Buyer Parties to commence
the cure within such 20 day period and use Reasonable Efforts to continue to
cure, except that this additional cure period shall not apply to a breach
regarding the failure or inability of a Buyer Party to pay any portion Merger
Consideration or a breach of the representation set forth in _Section 4.6_; 

(d) by either the Buyer Parties or the Companies by written notice to the
other, if any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction has issued
a final, non-appealable Order, decree, ruling or injunction (other than a
temporary restraining order) or taken any other action permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and such other action shall have become final and non-
appealable; provided, however, that no Party may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the terms of this _Section 9.1(d)_ if such Party has not
first complied with its obligations under _Section 5.4_;

(e) by either the Buyer Parties or the Companies by written notice to the
other, if the transactions contemplated hereby have not been consummated by 90
days from the date of this Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "), _provided_
, that neither the Buyer Parties nor the Companies will be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(e)_ if such Persons
breach of this Agreement has prevented the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; or

 

(f) by the Buyer Parties or the Companies by written notice to the other as
provided in _Section 7.4_ with respect to a Casualty Loss.

9.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated under _Section
9.1_, all further obligations of the Parties under this Agreement will
terminate without further liability or obligation of either Party to the other
Parties hereunder; _provided, however_ , that no Party will be released from
liability hereunder if this Agreement is terminated and the transactions
abandoned by reason of (a) failure of such Party to have performed its
material obligations under this Agreement or (b) any material
misrepresentation made by such Party of any matter set forth in this
Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 9.2_ will relieve any Party to this
Agreement of liability for breach of this Agreement occurring prior to any
termination, or for breach of any provision of this Agreement
