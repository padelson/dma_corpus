Ordinary Shares.

  



  

(H) The press release of the Company (the " **Company Press Release** ") and
the Position Statement (as defined hereafter) shall contain a statement of

defined hereafter).

  



  

(I) The Offeror, the Company and the Executive Board (as defined hereafter)
and the Supervisory Board (as defined hereafter) have discussed their

defined hereafter) of its intentions regarding the possible steps to be taken

(K) The Executive Board (as defined hereafter) and the Supervisory Board (as
defined hereafter) have received a fairness opinion from ABN AMRO N.V.
in connection with the Offer, in so far as it relates to the Ordinary Shares,
in form and content satisfactory to the Boards (as defined hereafter) (the "
**Fairness Opinion** ").

  



  

(L) The Offeror currently owns 22,456,115 (twenty million four hundred fifty-
six thousand and hundred fifteen) Ordinary Shares, In addition, certain large
Shareholders (as defined hereafter) who currently own 42,701,904 (forty-two

the Offer in respect of all Shares that they currently hold and/or will
acquire after the date hereof and that they shall tender such Shares to the
Offeror in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer.

June, 2008.

  



  

(N) The Company has called an extraordinary meeting of shareholders of the
Company as required in accordance with Article 18 of the Dutch Public Offers
Decree ( _Besluit Openbare Biedingen Wft_ , the " **DPOD** ") to provide its

being declared unconditional.

  



  

(P) Having regard to the fact that the Offer, in so far as it relates to the
Ordinary Shares, has been recommended by both the Supervisory Board and
the Executive Board, the 


  



        
   

  


 Protection Trust, subject to the Offer being declared unconditional (
_gestand wordt gedaan_ ), has for the benefit of the Offeror irrevocably and
otherwise unconditionally renounced its rights under the Option Agreement in
writing (a copy of which is attached as Schedule 3), provided however that if
and for as long as the Offeror holds less than 75% of the Ordinary Shares,
the Protection Trust reserves its rights under the Option Agreement to file
an application for, or participate in any proceeding relating to, an inquiry
into the policy and conduct of business of the Company at the Enterprise
Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal ( _Ondernemingskamer_ ).

(including its shareholders), the Company confirms that the Boards have duly
considered the Offer and unanimously resolved:

  



  

(a) to approve and consent to the Merger Protocol and the entering into by

(d) subject to the provisions of this Merger Protocol, that the Boards and
each of their members shall not revoke or materially modify, amend or qualify

as to their position with respect to the Offer or make any negative public
statements in relation to the Offer in so far as it relates to the
other Securities, 


  



        
   

  


 provided that in case one or more members of the Boards are misquoted
or inadvertently or without intent make such modifications,
amendments, qualifications or public contradictory statements, the Company
shall not be in breach of this provision if it publicly reconfirms the
recommendation of (the relevant members of) the Boards within 48 (forty
eight) hours following the publication of such misquote, modification,
amendment, qualification or public contradictory statement.

  



  

## 2.8 **The Position Statement**

  

##

advisers shall be given the opportunity to comment on the Position Statement
which comments shall reasonably be taken into account by the Company.

  



  

## 2.9 **Offer Conditions**

  



  

(a) The obligations of the Offeror to declare the Offer unconditional shall
be subject to the conditions precedent that are set out in Section 6.5 of the
Offer Memorandum (the " **Offer Conditions** "), provided that the minimum
acceptance condition of the Offer, as contained in Section 6.5.1 of the Offer
Memorandum, has been lowered to the tender for acceptance of such number of
Ordinary Shares, including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs, Preference
Shares A and Bonds that the votes attached to those securities, together with
the votes attached to the same types of securities owned by the Offeror
and/or any of its affiliates at 17:30 hours CET on the Closing Date,
represent at least 51% of votes attached to the Ordinary Shares, including
Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs, Preference Shares A and Bonds issued and
outstanding at 17:30 hours CET on the Closing Date. For purposes of the
calculation of the percentage of votes referred to in the preceding sentence,
(i) the Bonds shall be deemed to give right to such number of votes as would
have been the case if they had been converted on the Business Day immediately
preceding the Closing Date at a conversion price of EUR 6.87 (six Euro and
eighty seven cents) per Bond and (ii) the Ordinary Shares, Preference Shares
A or Bonds shall include any options granted by the Company to subscribe for
Ordinary Shares, Preference Shares A or Bonds, as the case may be, that are
not exercised and have not otherwise resulted in the issue by the Company of
such Ordinary Shares, Preference Shares A or Bonds, as the case may be, to
the option holders on or prior to 17:30 hours CET on the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) The Offer Conditions are for the benefit of the Offeror and may, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, be waived by the Offeror (either in whole
or in part) at any time by written notice to the Company. However,
the Offeror will 


  



        
   

  


 not waive the 51% threshold referred to above without the prior
written approval of the Company.

  



  

## 2.10 **Best Efforts**

  

## 

  

Each of the Parties undertakes to use its best efforts to procure the
fulfilment of the Offer Conditions as soon as reasonably practicable. If at
any time a Party becomes aware of a fact or circumstance that might prevent
an Offer Condition being satisfied, it shall immediately inform the other
Parties in writing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
the Parties shall make all applications and notifications required by the
Offer Conditions and shall use its best efforts to procure that all such
information as is requested by the relevant authorities in connection with
such applications and notifications is provided as promptly as
reasonably practical.

  



  

# **3.** UNDERTAKINGS

  

# ** **

  

## 3.1 Within two business days of the Settlement Date, the Company
shall call a second extraordinary meeting of shareholders of the Company (the
" **Second Company EGM** "), for which the record date shall be set after the
Settlement Date in order to, _inter alia_ , propose to the shareholders
to resolve to approve (i) the proposed amendments to the articles
of association of Corporate Express (the " **Corporate Express Articles of
Association** ") as described in Section 6.6 of the Offer Memorandum, (ii)
the proposed appointments of the Offerors designees as members of the
Executive Board and of the Supervisory Board, with immediate effect and (iii)
to grant the release of liability ( _d echarge_) of the resigning members of
the Supervisory Board, with immediate effect. The Company shall reasonably
do, and procure to be done, all those things necessary to ensure that the
resolutions referred to in (i), (ii) and (iii) are passed as soon as
reasonably possible.

  

## 

  

## 3.2 With respect to the proposed merger between the Company and
Lyreco S.A.S. (the " **Lyreco Transaction** "), which has been laid down in
a merger agreement between the Company and Corely S.C., dated 19 May, 2008
(together with all ancillary agreements related there to referred to as, the
" **Lyreco Agreement** "):

  

## 

  

(a) the Offeror is aware of the break fee of EUR 30,000,000 (thirty million
Euro) included in article 6.2(c) of the Lyreco Agreement, which shall have to
be paid by the Company to Corely S.C. if the Company recommends the Offer and
the Offer is declared unconditional;

  



  

(b) the Company shall terminate the Lyreco Agreement immediately prior to the
execution of this Merger Protocol by sending to Lyreco S.A.S. and Corely S.C.
a letter in a form substantially similar to the draft attached as Schedule 7;
and

  



  

(c) the Boards shall include in the Company Press Release and the Position
Statement the termination of the Lyreco Agreement.

  



  

## 3.3 The Company shall and shall procure that all of its Group
Companies shall pursue its and their rights under or pursuant to the Lyreco
Agreement and the confidentiality 


  



        
   

  

## 
 agreement entered into with Lyreco, dated 25 March 2008, and shall not
waive any of its or their rights thereunder without the prior approval of
Staples, except in relation to the break free arrangements made in the Lyreco
Agreement (which will be dealt with at the sole discretion of the Company).

  

## 

  

## 3.4 The Parties acknowledge that all rights in respect of the
employee share option plan of the Company will be respected. The Company will
ensure that any Shares vesting under its employee share option plan will
result in cash payments to the relevant beneficiary rather than the issue or
delivery of any Shares, at the level of the Increased Offer Price per

# **6.** EMPLOYEES AND BUSINESS STRATEGY

  

# ** **

  

## 6.1 **Employee Undertakings**

  



  

(a) The Parties recognize the importance of the role that the Group Employees
will have for purposes of ensuring the success of the contemplated business
combination. Although the Parties have not yet prepared specific plans for 


  



        
   

  


 combining the two businesses, based solely on publicly available
information and its limited due diligence review Staples (i) intends to
continue the activities of the Company and the Group Companies and plans to
maintain a significant presence in The Netherlands, (ii) does not currently
intend to materially reduce the number, or materially change the terms or
conditions of employment, of Group Employees and (iii) if any such action is
taken however, the Offeror acknowledges that it shall take into account
any applicable rules and regulations on employee consultation.

  



  

(b) For a period of 12 months following the Settlement Date, or longer as may
otherwise be required by applicable law, and without any prejudice to any
amendments that may be agreed by the relevant parties or otherwise
become effective, the Offeror shall, or cause the Group Companies to, honour,
fulfil and discharge all obligations in existence on the date hereof to all
Group Employees under the employee benefit plans and will allow the Company
to implement in the event of any redundancies of Group Employees, any
severance plans and practices used by the Company in determining applicable
severance payments, except if and to the extent such benefit plans and
practices materially differ from what is customary in the relevant
jurisdiction. Nothing in this paragraph shall restrict the Parties from
amending the employee benefit plans in the event of a change in the
applicable law.

  



  

(c) The Parties agree that for purposes of the nomination,
selection, appointment or dismissal of employees of the Offeror Group
(including, following Settlement, the Group Companies) following the
Settlement Date Group Employees shall be given equal opportunities as
employees of the Offeror Group (other than Group Companies).

  



  

(d) The Parties agree that existing obligations pursuant to (i)
employment agreements of the employees of the Company and the Group Companies
and pursuant to (ii) existing employee consultation arrangements, will be
honoured.

  



  

(e) The Parties agree (i) that the rights of the Group Employees and former
Group Employees in relation to pension entitlements shall be respected in
accordance with applicable law and the relevant terms of those
legally binding entitlements and (ii) that the Company and/or the Offeror
shall not take any action to extract cash from the relevant pension funds, in
each case, without prejudice to any rights of Group Companies to seek
suspensions from the obligations to make pension contributions in line with
the Companys past practice. The preceding sentence does not intend to create
or imply a requirement that Group Companies make contributions to the pension
funds that are not required by applicable law and regulations or by existing
agreements with the relevant pension funds.

  



  

(f) The Parties shall negotiate in good faith during the 2 (two)
weeks following the date hereof whether it is appropriate for retention
purposes to create a 


  



        
   

  


 voluntary scheme under which an amount of up to EUR 8,000,000 (eight
million Euro) that has yet to become due for the financial year 2008
becomes guaranteed.

  



  

## 6.2 **Business Strategy**

  

## 

  

The Parties have discussed their combined business strategy upon
successful completion of the Offer. The Parties are of the firm opinion that
the Groups business and the Offerors business are highly complementary and
provides the growth and platform necessary for the combined business to
remain competitive taking advantage of synergies and economies of scale and
making more effective use of the merging parties network. The Parties are
furthermore of the opinion that the combined business will benefit from each
Partys know how and experience and excellence in service delivery to its
customers. Further arrangements and discussions are set out in SCHEDULE 6.

  



  

# **7.** EXCLUSIVITY

  

# ** **

  

## 7.1 **For the purpose of this Protocol:**

  

## 

  

(a) **Alternative Proposal** means any offer for any or all of the Shares or
Bonds or for the whole or any material parts of the undertaking, business or
assets of the Company or any significant Group Company or any proposal

Company or any significant Group Company or reorganisation or re-
capitalisation of the Company or any significant Group Company.

  



  

(b) **More Beneficial Alternative Proposal** means a serious proposal from a
_bona fide_ third party for a business combination that would involve
an attempt to effect a change of control of the Company through a cash offer
for (i) all issued and outstanding Shares and Bonds or (ii) all of the assets
of the Corporate Express Group that, in either case, in the reasonable
opinion of the Boards is  taking into account the identity and track record
of Staples and the Offeror and that of the third party making such proposal,
certainty of execution (including but not limited to certainty of funding),
conditionality, timing, benefits for employees and the interests of the
shareholders and other stakeholders of the Company  a more beneficial offer

consideration offered by the party that makes the More Beneficial Alternative
Proposal must be in cash and at least EUR 9.75 (nine Euro and seventy-five
cents) per Ordinary Share. The consideration of any subsequent More
Beneficial Alternative Proposal (which shall include any amended More
Beneficial Alternative Proposal) must exceed the most recent consideration
offered by the Offeror for each of the Ordinary Shares, including in any
Revised Offer (as defined below), by at least 5%, failing which such merger,
offer or proposal shall not qualify as a More Beneficial Alternative Proposal
for the purpose of this Clause.

it or any of its Relevant Persons from any third party in relation to an
Alternative Proposal, it being understood that as a minimum the Company shall
promptly notify the Offeror of its knowledge of the identity of such third
party, the proposed consideration, the conditions to (the making of)
the Alternative Proposal and other key terms of such Alternative Proposal, so
as to enable the Offeror to consider its position in light of such
Alternative Proposal and to assess the (possible) effects of such Alternative
Proposal on the Offer and the Offers chances of success.

  



  

## 7.3 In the event that a third party makes or announces its intention
to make an Alternative Proposal or informs the Company directly or any
member of the Companys Board that it will make or considers making an
Alternative Proposal, the following steps shall be completed:

  

## 

  

(a) In the event the Boards conclude that the Alternative Proposal is a More
Beneficial Alternative Proposal as contemplated in this Merger Protocol, the

information in writing hereinafter the " **Notice** ") and shall provide to
the Offeror all material details known to the Company regarding the More
Beneficial Alternative Proposal (including (i) the identity of the relevant
third party, (ii) the proposed consideration and other key terms of the More
Beneficial Alternative Proposal and (iii) whether the Company intends to
provide to a third party confidential information or to enter into
negotiations with such third party.

  



  

(b) The Offeror shall have 5 (five) Business Days following the date on which
it has received the Notice in respect of a More Beneficial Alternative
Proposal to announce to the Company a revision of the Offer that either
provides an offer price for the Ordinary Shares that is at least as high as
the More Beneficial Alternative Proposal or is in the reasonable opinion of
the Boards 


  



        
   

  


 at least equivalent to the terms and conditions of the More
Beneficial Alternative Proposal as contained in the Notice ("
**Revised Offer** ").

  



  

(c) If the Offeror fails to agree to make a Revised Offer in accordance with
Clause 7.3(b) or has indicated that it will not announce a Revised Offer
within such 10 (ten) Business Day period following the date on which
it received the Notice in respect of the More Beneficial Alternative
Proposal, the Boards may revoke the Recommendation, each Party shall be
entitled to terminate this Merger Protocol with immediate effect, following
which, without prejudice to Clause 11.1, the Parties shall no longer be bound
by this Merger Protocol in any respect.

  



  

(d) If the Offeror has announced a Revised Offer in accordance with Clause

an Alternative Proposal, and (ii) that, other than the EUR 30,000,000 (thirty
million Euro) break fee referred to in Clause 3.2(a) above, it has no
liabilities pursuant or relating to any break fee arrangement, incentive fee,

connection with an Alternative Proposal except for existing obligations with
the Companys investment bankers, financing banks and other advisors in
relation to the Lyreco Transaction and the Offer referred to in Clause
3.8(h).
