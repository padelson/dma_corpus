                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

                     This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated
as of October 26, 2003, is among UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, a Minnesota
corporation ("Parent"), MU Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Mid Atlantic
Medical Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

                     WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and
the Company and the Managing Member of Merger Sub have approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub
(the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement;

                     WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended
that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and that this Agreement
constitutes, and hereby is adopted as, a plan of reorganization; and

                     WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with
the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

                     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                     Section 1.01. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the General
Corporation Law and the Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware
(collectively, "Delaware Law"), the Company shall be merged with and into Merger
Sub at the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of the Company shall cease, and Merger Sub shall continue as the
surviving entity in the Merger (the "Surviving Entity") and shall succeed to and
assume all the rights and obligations of the Company in accordance with Delaware
Law.

                     Section 1.02. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the

day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the

<PAGE>
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such
time), at the offices of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, 1501 K Street, Suite 100,
Washington, DC 20005, unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by
the parties hereto.

                     Section 1.03. Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall
file a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law and, as soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings or
recordings required under Delaware Law. The Merger shall become effective at
such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall
agree and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger
becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

                     Section 1.04. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have
the effects set forth in Delaware Law.

                     Section 1.05. Certificate of Formation; Operating
Agreement.

                     (a) The Certificate of Formation of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of
Formation of the Surviving Entity until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by Delaware Law or other applicable Law.

                     (b) The Operating Agreement of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Operating Agreement of the
Surviving Entity until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law; provided, however, that the Operating Agreement of the Surviving
Entity shall be amended as necessary to comply with the obligations of the
Surviving Entity set forth in Section 6.04 hereof.

                     Section 1.06. Managers. The managers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the managers of the Surviving
Entity until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their

                     Section 1.07. Officers. The officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Entity until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their

           cease to exist, and no shares of Parent Common Stock, cash or other
           consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

                      (c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Section
           2.01(d) and Section 2.02(e), each issued and outstanding share of
           Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance
           with Section 2.01(b), and other than as provided in Section 2.02(k)
           with respect to shares as for which appraisal rights have been
           perfected) shall be converted into the right to receive:

                     (i) 0.82 (the "Exchange Ratio") validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent
("Parent Common Stock") (the "Stock Consideration"); and

                     (ii) $18.00 in cash (the "Cash Consideration," and together
with the Stock Consideration, the "Merger Consideration").

                     As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c)
and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e), in each case to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance
with Section 2.02(b), without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of the


                                       3
<PAGE>
occurrence or record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction,
the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction.

(d) Adjustments. In the event that the aggregate market value of the Stock
Consideration at the Effective Time will be less than 45% of the sum of the
Merger Consideration plus any cash paid pursuant to Sections 2.02(e) and
2.02(k), the Merger Consideration will be adjusted by reducing the amount of
Cash Consideration and by increasing by the same amount the amount of Stock
Consideration payable to each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise
have received Cash Consideration to the extent necessary so as to increase the
aggregate market value of the Stock Consideration to 45% of the sum of the
Merger Consideration plus any cash paid pursuant to Sections 2.02(e) and
2.02(k). For purposes of this paragraph (i), the "aggregate market value of the
Stock Consideration" will be determined based, as closely as reasonably
possible, on the actual Parent Common Stock price for the last trade prior to
the Effective Time or, if the Effective Time is after the close of regular
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the mean between the highest and lowest
quoted selling price of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange for
the date on which the Effective Time occurs and (ii) the Stock Consideration and
Cash Consideration transferred to the Trust, or to the holders of Company Common
Stock who acquire their stock from the Company or the Trust after the date
hereof, shall be disregarded.

                     Section 2.02. Exchange of Certificates.

                     (a) Exchange Agent. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with The Bank of New York or such other bank or trust company as may be
designated by Parent, with the Company's prior written consent, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed (the "Exchange Agent"), for exchange in
accordance with this Article II, through the Exchange Agent, (i) certificates
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section
2.01(c) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, (ii) cash
sufficient to pay the Cash Consideration and (iii) from time to time as needed,
additional cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.02(e) hereof and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to
Section 2.02(c) hereof (such shares of Parent Common Stock and Cash
Consideration, together with any dividends or other distributions with respect
thereto with a record date after the Effective Time and any cash payments in
lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, being hereinafter referred
to as the "Exchange Fund").

                     (b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c),
(i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon


                                       4
<PAGE>
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in
customary form and shall have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing the Stock Consideration portion of the
Merger Consideration and cash representing the Cash Consideration portion of the
Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which holders of
Certificates are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holders are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.02(e). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (A) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II after taking into account all the shares of
Company Common Stock then held by such holder under all such Certificates so
surrendered and (B) a check for the cash that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, including for the Cash
Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, (w) a certificate representing the proper number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, (x) a check for the Cash Consideration portion of the
Merger Consideration, (y) any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and (z) cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.02(e), may be issued to a person other than the person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if, upon presentation
to the Exchange Agent, such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such issuance shall pay
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of
Parent Common Stock to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to
which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and
cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e). No interest will be paid or will accrue
on the Merger Consideration or on any cash payable to holders of Certificates
pursuant to Section 2.02(c) or (e).

                     (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the share of Parent Common Stock that
the holder thereof has the right to receive upon the surrender thereof, and no


                                       5
<PAGE>
cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(e), in each case until the
holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with
this Article II. Following surrender of any Certificate, there shall be paid to
the holder thereof (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of cash payable
in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and the amount of dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time and paid with respect to Parent
Common Stock prior to such surrender and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

                     (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.
All shares of Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II
(including any dividends or other distributions paid pursuant to Section 2.02(c)
and cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(e))
shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented
by such Certificates, and at the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Entity of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Subject to the last
sentence of Section 2.02(f), if, at any time after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

                     (e) No Fractional Shares.

                      (i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional
           shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
           exchange of Certificates, no dividends or other distributions of
           Parent shall relate to such fractional share interests and such
           fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote
           or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent.

                      (ii) In lieu of such fractional share interests, Parent
           shall pay to each former holder of shares of Company Common Stock an
           amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the
           fractional share interest to which such former holder (after taking
           into account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the Effective
           Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the per share
           closing price of Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date (or, if such
           date is not a trading day, the trading day immediately preceding the
           Closing Date) on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Composite
           Transactions Tape (or, if not reported thereby, as reported by any
           other authoritative source). As promptly as practicable after the
           determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
           fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent and


                                       6
<PAGE>
           Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to deposit such amount with
           the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward
           payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in
           accordance with the terms hereof.

                     (f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for
nine months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand,
and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for
the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with this Article II. If any Certificate shall
not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any Merger
Consideration (and all dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(c) and all cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.02(e)) would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration (and all dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and all cash payable in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(e)) in respect thereof shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

                     (g) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of
Parent Common Stock (or dividends or other distributions with respect thereto)
or cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or cash from the
Exchange Fund, in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

                     (h) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily
basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
the property of, and shall be paid to, Parent. Any losses resulting from such
investments shall not in any way diminish Parent's and Merger Sub's obligation
to pay the full amount of the Merger Consideration.

                     (i) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which the holder of such
Certificate would be entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of
any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would be
entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e), in each case in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement.


                                       7
<PAGE>
                     (j) Withholding Rights. The Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any
holder of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts
as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or under any provision of state or foreign tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the former holder of the shares of Company Common Stock. Any
such withholding shall be applied first against the Cash Consideration to the
full extent thereof and then against the Stock Consideration. If withholding is
required from shares of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall sell in
the open market such shares of Parent Common Stock on behalf of the former
holder of Company Common Stock as is necessary to satisfy such withholding
obligation and shall pay such cash proceeds to the appropriate taxing authority.


                     (k) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.01(c), any
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by a person who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance
with Delaware Law (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into a right
to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or
withdraws or otherwise loses its rights to appraisal or it is determined that
such holder does not have appraisal rights in accordance with Delaware Law. If,
after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses its
right to appraisal, or if it is determined that such holder does not have
appraisal rights, such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The
Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub prompt notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of shares, and Parent and Merger Sub shall have the
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands except as required by applicable Law. The Company shall not, except with
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, unless and to the extent required to do so
under applicable Law.

                     Section 2.03. Company Stock Options.

                     (a) During the thirty (30) day period prior to the Closing,
each holder of outstanding Company Stock Options (whether or not then vested or
exercisable by its terms) shall have the opportunity to exercise his or her
Company Stock Options upon payment of the exercise price in accordance with the
terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan, or, at the option of the Company, on
a net "cashless exercise" basis upon delivery to the Company of an exercise
agreement in a form mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company. Except for
vested options being exercised in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Company Stock Plan, such option exercises shall be deemed effective as of, and
conditioned upon, the occurrence of the Closing. All written communications
distributed generally to employees by or on behalf of the Company regarding such
exercises will be mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company. Each


                                       8
<PAGE>
outstanding Company Stock Option which is not exercised prior to the Closing in
accordance with this Section 2.03 shall be cancelled upon the occurrence of the
Closing and no consideration shall be paid therefor.

                     (b) Effective on the Closing each of the Company Stock
Plans, including, without limitation, the SCT Agreement, shall be terminated in
accordance with their respective terms.

                     (c) In connection with the termination of the Company Stock
Plans, following the Effective Time, no holder of Company Stock Options or any
participant in or beneficiary of the Company Stock Plans or Trust, will have any
right to acquire or receive any equity securities of the Surviving Entity or any
Subsidiary thereof or any consideration other than as contemplated pursuant to
this Section 2.03; provided, however, that all proceeds remaining in the Trust
immediately after the Effective Time shall be applied, first to be returned to
the Company in an amount equal to the principal amount, plus any accrued
interest thereon, of the Loan (as defined in the SCT Agreement) that was
forgiven upon such termination, and second as provided in the SCT Agreement, to
satisfy obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under employee benefit
plans of the Company listed on Schedule A of the SCT Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE III

                  Representations and Warranties of the Company
                  ---------------------------------------------

                     Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule (with
specific reference to the Section or Subsection of this Agreement to which the
information stated in such disclosure relates; provided that any fact or
condition disclosed in any section of such disclosure schedule in such a way as
to make its relevance to a representation or representations made elsewhere in
this Agreement or information called for by another section of such disclosure
schedule reasonably apparent shall be deemed to be an exception to such
representation or representations or to be disclosed on such other section of
such disclosure schedule notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross
reference thereto) delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of
this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), the Company represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

                     Section 3.01. Organization, Standing and Corporate Power.
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
formed and has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now
being conducted. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed individually or
in the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, "Company


                                       9
<PAGE>
Material Adverse Effect" shall mean any change, effect, event, occurrence or
state of facts that is materially adverse to the business, financial condition,
or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
other than any change, effect, event, occurrence or state of facts relating to
(a) the economy or the financial markets in general, (b) the industry in which
the Company and its Subsidiaries operate in general and not specifically
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries, (c) the announcement of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the identity of Parent
(provided that the exclusion set forth in this clause (c) shall not apply to
Section 3.04(b) hereof), (d) any Company action prohibited by Section 5.01(a)
hereto that Parent does not consent to the Company taking; (e) changes in
applicable Laws or regulations after the date hereof, or (f) changes in GAAP or
regulatory accounting principles after the date hereof. The Company has made
available to Parent complete and correct copies of its Certificate of
Incorporation (the "Company Certificate") and By-laws (the "Company By-laws")
and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or comparable organizational
documents) of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the date of
this Agreement. The Company has made available to Parent and its representatives
correct and complete copies of the minutes of all meetings of stockholders, the
Board of Directors and each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries held since December 31, 2000.

                     Section 3.02. Subsidiaries. Section 3.02 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule lists all the Subsidiaries of the Company and, for each such
Subsidiary, the state of formation and each jurisdiction in which such
Subsidiary is qualified or licensed to do business. All the outstanding shares
of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each such Subsidiary have
been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly
or indirectly by the Company free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens,
charges, encumbrances or security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever
(collectively, "Liens"), and free of any restriction on the right to vote, sell
or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity interests. Except for
the capital stock or other equity or voting interests of its Subsidiaries and
publicly traded securities held for investment which do not exceed 5% of the
outstanding securities of any entity, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock or other equity or voting interests in any person.

                     (a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and

Liabilities.

                     (a) The Company has filed all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents (including exhibits and other information
incorporated therein) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
required to be filed by the Company since December 31, 2000 (such documents, the

applicable to such Company SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements

material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in

business, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise)
that individually or in the aggregate have had or would reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                     Section 3.07. Information Supplied. None of the information

incorporation by reference in (a) the registration statement on Form S-4 to be
filed with the SEC by Parent in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent
Common Stock in the Merger (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the
"Form S-4") will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it
is amended or supplemented and at the time it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading or (b) the proxy statement relating to the Company Stockholders
Meeting (together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, in each
case in the form or forms mailed to the Company's stockholders, the "Proxy
Statement") will, at the date it is first mailed to the stockholders of the
Company and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement
will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty is
made by the Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement based on information supplied by Parent
or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Form S-4 of the Proxy Statement.

                     Section 3.08. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since
the date of the most recent audited financial statements included in the Company
SEC Documents filed by the Company and publicly available prior to the date of
this Agreement (the "Filed Company SEC Documents"), except (a) for liabilities
incurred in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby to Parent, Merger Sub and the Company's financial and legal advisors or
(b) as disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents there has not been any
change, effect, event, occurrence or state of facts that individually or in the


                                       14
<PAGE>
aggregate has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

                     Section 3.09. Litigation. There is no suit, action or
proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that individually or in the aggregate has had
or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction,
rule or order of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator outstanding against,
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, investigation by any Governmental Authority
involving, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that individually or in the

Adverse Effect or prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

           would restrict the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
           including the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries) to compete in
           any business or with any person or in any geographic area;

           and the regulations promulgated thereunder (including 45 C.F.R. parts

                     (c) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is, or
has received written notice or has Knowledge that any other party to any of its
Contracts is, in violation or breach of or default (with or without notice or
lapse of time or both) under, or has waived or failed to enforce any rights or
benefits under, any Contract to which it is a party or any of its properties or
other assets is subject, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there has
occurred no event giving to others any right of termination, amendment or

Contract except, in each case for violations, breaches, defaults, waivers or
failures to enforce rights or benefits that individually or in the aggregate
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

                     Section 3.11. Compliance with Laws.

                     (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in
compliance with all statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, judgments,
orders and decrees of any Governmental Authority (collectively, "Laws")
applicable to it, its properties or other assets or its business or operations,
except for instances of noncompliance or possible noncompliance that
individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. None of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries has received, since December 31, 2001, a notice or other
communication alleging or relating to a possible material violation of any Laws
applicable to its businesses or operations. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have in effect all material permits, licenses, variances, exemptions,
authorizations, operating certificates, franchises, orders and approvals of all
Governmental Authorities (collectively, "Permits") necessary to carry on their
businesses as now conducted, and there has occurred no violation of, default
(with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or event giving to
others any right of termination, amendment or cancellation of, with or without
notice or lapse of time or both, any Permit, except for violations, defaults or
events that individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no
event which has occurred that, to the Knowledge of the Company, would reasonably
be expected to result in the revocation, cancellation, non-renewal or adverse
modification of any such Permit that individually or in the aggregate would
reasonably be expected to cause a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Merger,
in and of itself, would not cause the revocation or cancellation of any such
Permit that individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                     (b) The Company and each of its officers and directors are

("Sarbanes-Oxley") and (B) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules
and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange. The Company has previously
disclosed to Parent any of the information required to be disclosed by the
Company and certain of its officers to the Company's Board of Directors or any

<PAGE>
committee thereof pursuant to the certification requirements contained in Form
10-K and Form l0-Q under the Exchange Act.

                     Section 3.12. Employee Benefit Plans.

                     (a) Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a correct and complete list of: (i) all "employee benefit plans" (as
defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended ("ERISA")), and all other employee benefit plans, programs,
agreements, policies, arrangements or payroll practices, including bonus plans,
employment, consulting or other compensation agreements, collective bargaining
agreements, incentive, equity or equity-based compensation, or deferred
compensation arrangements, change in control, termination or severance plans or
arrangements, stock purchase, severance pay, sick leave, vacation pay, salary
continuation for disability, hospitalization, medical insurance, life insurance
and scholarship plans and programs maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries contributed or
is obligated to contribute thereunder for current or former employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Employees") (collectively, the "Company
Plans").

                     (b) Correct and complete copies of the following documents,
with respect to each of the Company Plans (other than a Multiemployer Plan),
have been delivered to Parent by the Company, to the extent applicable: (i) any
plans, all amendments and attachments thereto and related trust documents,
insurance contracts or other funding arrangements, and amendments thereto; (ii)
the most recent Forms 5500 and all schedules thereto and the most recent
actuarial report, if any; (iii) the most recent IRS determination letter; (iv)
summary plan descriptions; and (v) written communications to employees generally
and relating to the SCT Agreement, except, in the case of communications
relating to the SCT Agreement, as individually or in the aggregate would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                     (c) The Company Plans have been maintained in accordance
with their terms and with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable
Laws, and neither the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) nor any "party in
interest" or "disqualified person" with respect to the Company Plans has engaged
in a non-exempt "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 4975 of
the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, except as individually or in the aggregate
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. No fiduciary has any liability for breach of fiduciary duty or
any other failure to act or comply in connection with the administration or
investment of the assets of any Company Plan, except as individually or in the
aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

                     (d) The Company Plans intended to qualify under Section 401
of the Code are so qualified and any trusts intended to be exempt from Federal
income taxation under Section 501 of the Code are so exempt, except as


                                       18
<PAGE>
individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                     (e) None of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any trade or
business (whether or not incorporated) that is treated as a single employer,
with any of them under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code has any
current or contingent liability with respect to (i) a plan subject to Title IV
or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code or (ii) any
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA). Each Company
Plan that is intended to meet the requirements for tax-favored treatment under
Subchapter B of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code meets such requirements,
with such exceptions that individually or in the aggregate have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                     (f) All contributions (including all employer contributions
and employee salary reduction contributions) required to have been made under
any of the Company Plans (including workers compensation) or by Law (without
regard to any waivers granted under Section 412 of the Code), to any funds or
trusts established thereunder or in connection therewith have been made by the
due date thereof (including any valid extension).

                     (g) There are no pending actions, claims or lawsuits that
have been asserted or instituted against the Company Plans, the assets of any of
the trusts under the Company Plans or the sponsor or administrator of any of the
Company Plans, or against any fiduciary of the Company Plans with respect to the
operation of any of the Company Plans (other than routine benefit claims), nor
does the Company have any Knowledge of facts that could form the basis for any
such action, claim or lawsuit, other than such actions, claims or lawsuits that
individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                     (h) None of the Company Plans provides for post-employment
life or health insurance, benefits or coverage for any participant or any
beneficiary of a participant, except as may be required under the Consolidate
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), and at the
expense of the participant or the participant's beneficiary. Each of the Company
and any ERISA Affiliate which maintains a "group health plan" within the meaning
Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code has complied with the notice and continuation
requirements of Section 4980B of the Code, COBRA, Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title
I of ERISA and the regulations thereunder, except where the failure to comply
individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                     (i) Except as specifically provided in this Agreement,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in any payment becoming due to
any Employee, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company


                                       19
<PAGE>
Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any
such benefits under any Company Plan or (iv) result in any obligation to fund
any trust or other arrangement with respect to compensation or benefits under a
Company Plan.

(j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has a contract, plan or
commitment, whether legally binding or not, to create any additional Company
Plan or to modify any existing Company Plan, except as required by applicable
Law or tax qualification requirement.

(k) Any individual who performs services for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than through a contract with an organization other than such
individual) and who is not treated as an employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for Federal income tax purposes by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is not an employee for such purposes, except as individually or in
the aggregate, together with any breach or breaches of Section 3.12(c) hereof
(without regard to any materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifiers
therein), has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

                     (l) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to any contract, agreement or other arrangement which provides for the
payment of any amount which would not be deductible by reason of Section 162(m)
(to the extent not properly reflected on the Company's applicable tax returns)
or Section 280G of the Code.

                     Section 3.13. Taxes.

                     (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has timely
filed, or has caused to be timely filed on its behalf (taking into account any
extension of time within which to file), all material tax returns required to be
filed by it, and all such filed tax returns are correct and complete in all
material respects. All taxes shown to be due on such tax returns, and all
material taxes otherwise required to be paid by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, have been timely paid.

                     (b) The most recent financial statements contained in the

                     (c) Other Actions. Except as otherwise contemplated or
permitted by this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall not, and shall not
permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, take any action that would

materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect,
as the case may be, becoming untrue, (ii) any of such representations and

                     (d) Advice of Changes; Filings. The Company and Parent

Merger Sub) to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies
with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under
this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall promptly provide the other copies
of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Authority in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

                     Section 5.02. No Solicitation by the Company.

                     (a) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit
any of its Subsidiaries, any of its or their respective directors, officers or
employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or
other advisor, agent or representative retained by the Company or any Subsidiary
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, "Representatives") to, directly or indirectly through another
person, (i) solicit, initiate, cause, knowingly encourage, or knowingly
facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or is


                                       33
<PAGE>
reasonably likely to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal or (ii) participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding any Company Takeover Proposal, or
furnish to any person any information in connection with or in furtherance of
any Company Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that
any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of
this Section 5.02(a) by the Company. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and instruct its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted
heretofore with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal and request the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval (and in no event after obtaining such Company Stockholder
Approval), in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Company Takeover
Proposal made after the date hereof that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith constitutes or is reasonably likely to constitute a
Company Superior Proposal, the Company may, if its Board of Directors determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that it is necessary to
do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law, and subject to compliance with Section 5.02(c) and
after giving Parent two Business Days written notice of such determination, (A)
furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant
to a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such person
than the Confidentiality Agreement, provided that all such information (to the
extent that such information has not been previously provided to Parent) is
provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is
provided to such person, and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with
the person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives)
regarding such Company Takeover Proposal.

                     For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Takeover Proposal"
shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer, whether or not conditional and
whether or not withdrawn, (a) for a merger, consolidation, dissolution,
recapitalization or other business combination involving the Company, (b) for
the issuance of 20% or more of the equity securities of the Company as
consideration for the assets or securities of another person or (c) to acquire
in any manner, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the equity securities of
the Company or assets (including equity securities of any Subsidiary of the
Company) that represent 20% or more of the total consolidated assets of the
Company, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                     For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Superior Proposal"
shall mean any bona fide written offer made by a third party, that if
consummated would result in such person (or its shareholders) owning, directly
or indirectly, greater than 50% of the shares of Company Common Stock then
outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect
parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially all of the
total consolidated assets of the Company (i) on terms which the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with


                                       34
<PAGE>
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
in light of all relevant circumstances, including, without limitation, all the
terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement) to be more favorable
to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) which is reasonably likely
to be completed, taking into account any financing and approval requirements and
all other financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

                     (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any
committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent), or propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of
Directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement or the Merger or (B)
recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve,
any Company Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being
referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement,
option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other
similar agreement constituting or related to, any Company Takeover Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to Section 5.02(a)).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change if such Board of Directors determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that it is necessary to do
so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law; provided, however, that no Company Adverse
Recommendation Change may be made in response to a Company Superior Proposal
until after the fifth business day following Parent's receipt of written notice
from the Company (an "Adverse Recommendation Notice") advising Parent that the
Board of Directors of the Company intends to make such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and containing all information required by Section
5.02(c), together with copies of any written offer or proposal in respect of
such Company Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such Company
Superior Proposal shall require a new Adverse Recommendation Notice and a new
five (5) business day period). In determining whether to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Company Superior Proposal, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall take into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent (in response to an Adverse Recommendation
Notice or otherwise) in determining whether such third party Company Takeover
Proposal still constitutes a Company Superior Proposal.

                     (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth
in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 5.02, the Company shall promptly
advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for information or other
inquiry that the Company reasonably believes could lead to any Company Takeover
Proposal or of any Company Takeover Proposal, the terms and conditions of any
such request, Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including any changes
thereto) and the identity of the person making any such request, Company
Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall promptly keep Parent fully


                                       35
<PAGE>
informed of the status and details (including any change to the terms thereof)
of any such request, Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry.

                     (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit
the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any required disclosure to the
stockholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company (after consultation with outside counsel), failure to
so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law.

                              Additional Agreements
                              ---------------------

                     Section 6.01. Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy
Statement; Stockholder Meetings.

                     (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement
and the Company and Parent shall prepare and Parent shall file with the SEC the
Form S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of
the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to have the Form S-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing and keep the Form S-4 effective for so long as necessary to
consummate the Merger. The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act.
Parent shall also take any action required to be taken under any applicable
state securities Laws in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common
Stock in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning
the Company and the holders of shares of Company Common Stock as may be
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any such action. No filing of,
or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by Parent, and no
filing of, or amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement will made by the
Company, without providing the other party and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their
respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
either the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that either such document would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with
the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of


                                       36
<PAGE>
the Company. The parties shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or
the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the
Form S-4 or for additional information and shall supply each other with copies
of (i) all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to
the Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or the Merger and (ii) all orders of the SEC
relating to the Form S-4.

                     (b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the
date of this Agreement, establish a record date for, and promptly after the Form
S-4 is declared effective, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") solely for the purpose
of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to Section 5.02(b), the
Company shall, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders
adoption of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Company's obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.01(b)
shall not be affected by (i) the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company of any Company Takeover Proposal or
(ii) any Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

                     Section 6.02. Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a)
Subject to applicable Laws each party shall afford to the others, and the
others' officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all
its and its Subsidiaries' properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel
and records and, during such period, each party shall furnish promptly to the
others (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed by such party during such period pursuant to the requirements of
Federal or state securities Laws and (b) consistent with its legal obligations
all other information concerning such party and its Subsidiaries' business,
properties and personnel as the other party may reasonably request. Except for
disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the confidentiality agreement,
dated as of March 10, 2003, between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended
from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), each party shall hold, and
shall cause its officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors
and other Representatives to hold, all information received from the other
party, directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.02 or
information provided or received by any party hereto pursuant to this Agreement
will affect any of the representations or warranties of the parties hereto
contained in this Agreement or the conditions hereunder to the obligations of
the parties hereto.

                     (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein or in any other agreement to which the parties hereto are parties or by
which they are bound (including, without limitation, the Confidentiality
Agreement), commencing on the Release Date (as defined below), the obligations
of confidentiality contained herein and therein, as they relate to the
transactions contemplated herein, shall not apply to the tax structure or tax


                                       37
<PAGE>
treatment of the transactions contemplated herein, and each party hereto (and
any employee, representative, or agent of any party hereto) may disclose after
the Release Date to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax
structure and tax treatment of the transactions contemplated herein; provided,
however, that such disclosure shall not include the name (or other identifying
information not relevant to the tax structure or tax treatment) of any person
and shall not include information for which nondisclosure is reasonably
necessary in order to comply with applicable securities laws. For purposes of
this agreement, "Release Date" means the date that is the earlier of (a) the
date of the public announcement of discussions relating to the transactions
contemplated herein, (b) the date of the public announcement of the transactions
contemplated herein or (c) the date of the execution of an agreement (with or
without conditions) to enter into the transactions contemplated herein.

                     Section 6.03. Reasonable Efforts. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties
agrees to use its reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable
efforts to accomplish the following: (a) the taking of all acts necessary to
cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (b)
the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Authorities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities, if
any) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or
waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by any Governmental Authority,
(c) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties and (d) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out
the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the
first sentence of this Section 6.03, each of the Company and its Board of
Directors and Parent and its Board of Directors shall (i) take all action
reasonably necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute
or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state
takeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all
action reasonably necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to require Parent to (A) agree to, or proffer to, divest or hold separate
any assets or any portion of any business of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or, assuming the consummation of the Merger, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (B) not compete in any geographic area or line of business or (C)
restrict the manner in which, or whether, Parent, the Company, the Surviving


                                       38
<PAGE>
Entity or any of their respective Affiliates may carry on business in any part
of the world, which, in the case of any of clauses (A) through (C) above, would
reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or materially impair the long-term benefits sought to be
derived from the Merger.

                     Section 6.04. Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

                     (a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers and employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in
the Company Certificate or the Company By-laws (in each case, as in effect on
the date hereof) shall be assumed by the Surviving Entity in the Merger, without
further action, as of the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. The Parent
shall indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to the
Indemnified Parties to the same extent such persons are indemnified or have the
right to advancement of expenses as of the date hereof by the Company pursuant
to the Company Certificate and the Company By-laws.

                     (b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
maintain in effect the Company's current directors' and officers' liability
insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby)
covering the Indemnified Parties currently covered by the Company's directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy (a correct and complete copy of which
has been heretofore made available to Parent), on terms with respect to such
coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the
date hereof; provided, however, that Parent may substitute therefor policies of
Parent containing terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable to
such Indemnified Parties; provided further, however, that in satisfying its
obligation under this Section 6.04(b) Parent shall not be obligated to pay
aggregate premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company in its
last full fiscal year (which premiums are hereby represented and warranted by
the Company to be approximately $2,500,000), it being understood and agreed that
Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may be
obtained for such 300% amount.

                     (c) The covenants contained in this Section 6.04 are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives, and
shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party
is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.

                     Section 6.05. Fees and Expenses. All fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring
such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that
each of the Company and Parent shall bear and pay one-half of (a) the costs and


                                       39
<PAGE>
expenses incurred in connection with filing, printing and mailing the Form S-4
and (b) the filing fees for the premerger notification and report forms under
the HSR Act.

                     Section 6.06. Public Announcements. Parent and the Company
shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities quotation
system. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form
heretofore agreed to by the parties.

                     Section 6.07. Affiliates. Prior to the Effective Time the
Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all persons who will be at
the time this Agreement is submitted for adoption by the stockholders of the
Company, "affiliates" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act and applicable SEC rules and regulations. The Company shall use
its reasonable efforts to cause each such person to deliver to Parent at least
10 days prior to the Closing Date a written agreement substantially in the form
attached as Exhibit A.

                     Section 6.08. Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use its
reasonable efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in
the Merger to be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

                     Section 6.09. Reorganization Treatment. The Company, Parent
and Merger Sub shall execute and deliver to each of Dewey Ballantine LLP,
special counsel to the Company, and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, counsel to
Parent and Merger Sub, certificates substantially in the forms attached hereto
at Exhibits B and C at such time or times as reasonably requested by each such
law firm in connection with its delivery of the opinion referred to in Section
7.02(e) or 7.03(c), as the case may be. Prior to the Effective Time, none of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall take or cause to be taken any action which
would cause to be untrue any of the representations in such certificates. The
parties intend the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of
the Code and the parties will take the position for all tax purposes that the
Merger so qualifies unless a contrary position is required by a final
determination within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code.

                     Section 6.10. Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall
promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any stockholder litigation
against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall keep Parent fully informed regarding
any such stockholder litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to consult with the Company regarding the defense or settlement of any such


                                       40
<PAGE>
stockholder litigation, shall give due consideration to Parent's advice with
respect to such stockholder litigation and shall not settle any such litigation
prior to such consultation and consideration.

                     Section 6.11. Employee Matters.

                     (a) Parent agrees to honor, or cause the Surviving Entity
to honor, from and after the Effective Time any bonus payments for the Company's
2003 fiscal year under the bonus plans set forth in Section 6.11 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately
before the Effective Time.

                     (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide each individual who, as of the
Effective Time, is an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with
compensation and benefits that are comparable in the aggregate to the
compensation and benefits that are provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent.

                     (c) With respect to any benefit plan, program, arrangement
(including any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) and
any vacation program), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to,
recognize the service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continue
their employment after the Effective Time (the "Affected Employees") for
purposes of such plan or program.

                     (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
such steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by Section
2.03 and any other dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby by each individual who is a director or officer of the
Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, such
steps to be taken in accordance with the interpretive letter, dated January 12,
1999, issued by the SEC with respect to such matters.

                     (e) With respect to any welfare plan in which employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries are eligible to participate after the Effective
Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees
to the extent such conditions were satisfied under the welfare plans of the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide each
such employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan.

                     (f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
terminate its defined contribution 401(k) plan. Parent agrees to provide, or
cause the Surviving Entity to provide, that the Affected Employees are eligible
to participate in a defined contribution 401(k) plan immediately following the
Effective Time and that such defined contribution plan shall accept "eligible


                                       41
<PAGE>
rollover distributions" for Affected Employees from the Company's defined
contribution 401(k) plan.

                     Section 6.12. Employment Agreements. The Company will use
its best efforts to procure the agreement of each of the employees named on
Section 6.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule to enter into employment
agreements with the Company (the "Employment Agreements") to be effective as of
the Effective Time and substantially in the form set forth on Exhibit D hereto.
For purposes of this Section 6.12, it is understood that "best efforts" shall
not constitute a guaranty that any particular individual or any number of
individuals will agree to enter into an Employment Agreement. No provisions of
the Employment Agreements or any other employment agreements between the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and their respective employees will be amended
without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent may be withheld in
the sole discretion of Parent.

                     Section 6.13. Standstill Agreements, Confidentiality
Agreements, Anti-takeover Provisions. During the period from the date of this
Agreement through the Effective Time, the Company will not terminate, amend,
modify or waive any provision of any agreement required to be disclosed pursuant
to Section 3.10(b)(v) hereof to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
other than the Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to its terms or by written
agreement of the parties thereto. During such period, the Company shall enforce,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any such
agreement, including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any material breaches
of such agreements and to enforce specifically the material terms and provisions
thereof in any court of the United States of America or of any state having
jurisdiction. In addition, the Company will not approve a Company Takeover
Proposal or Company Superior Proposal for purposes of Section 203 of Delaware
Law.

                     Section 6.14. Issuance of Shares. All shares of Company
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to exercises of Company Stock Options after
the date hereof shall be issued by the Trust and the Company will not issue any
shares of Company Common Stock under the Company Stock Plans or the Company
Stock Options.

                     Section 7.01. Conditions to Each Party's Obligation to
Effect the Merger. The respective obligation of each party to effect the Merger
is subject to the satisfaction or waiver on or prior to the Closing Date of the
following conditions:

                      (a) Stockholder Approval. The Company Stockholder Approval
           shall have been obtained.

                      (b) Stock Exchange Listing. The shares of Parent Common
           Stock issuable to the stockholders of the Company as contemplated by


                                       42
<PAGE>
           this Agreement shall have been approved for listing on the New York
           Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance.

                      (c) Antitrust. The waiting period (and any extension
           thereof) applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act or any other
           applicable competition, merger control, antitrust or similar Law
           shall have been terminated or shall have expired.

                      (d) No Injunctions or Restraints. No temporary restraining
           order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment or order
           issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other statute, law,
           rule, legal restraint or prohibition (collectively, "Restraints")
           shall be in effect preventing the consummation of the Merger.

                      (e) Form S-4. The Form S-4 shall have become effective
           under the Securities Act and shall not be the subject of any stop
           order or proceedings seeking a stop order.

                      (f) Closing Consents. The consents listed on Exhibit E
           hereto shall have been obtained and shall be in full force and
           effect.

                     Section 7.02. Conditions to Obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub. The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger are
further subject to the satisfaction or waiver on or prior to the Closing Date of
the following conditions:

                      (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations
           and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement shall be
           true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
           Closing Date as though made on the Closing Date (without regard to
           materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifiers contained
           therein), except to the extent such representations and warranties
           expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier
           date, except where the failure of the representations and warranties
           to be true and correct individually or in the aggregate, has not had
           and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
           Adverse Effect. Parent shall have received a certificate signed on
           behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer and the chief
           financial officer of the Company to such effect.

                      (b) Performance of Obligations of the Company. The Company
           shall have performed in all material respects all obligations
           required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to
           the Closing Date, and Parent shall have received a certificate signed
           on behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer and the chief
           financial officer of the Company to such effect.

                      (c) No Litigation. There shall not be pending or
           threatened any suit, action or proceeding by any Governmental
           Authority (i) challenging the acquisition by Parent or Merger Sub of
           any shares of Company Common Stock, seeking to restrain or prohibit


                                       43
<PAGE>
           the consummation of the Merger, seeking to place limitations on the
           ownership of shares of Company Common Stock (or shares of capital
           stock of the Surviving Entity) by Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) seeking
           to prohibit or limit the ownership or operation by the Company or any
           of its Subsidiaries or by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any
           portion of any business or of any assets of the Company and its
           Subsidiaries or Parent and its Subsidiaries or to compel the Company
           or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
           divest or hold separate any portion of any business or of any assets
           of the Company and its Subsidiaries or Parent and its Subsidiaries,
           as a result of the Merger or (iii) seeking to obtain from the
           Company, Parent or Merger Sub any damages, which, in the case of
           clauses (ii) and (iii) above, would reasonably be likely to have a
           Parent Material Adverse Effect, have a Company Material Adverse
           Effect, or materially impair the long-term benefits sought to be
           derived from the Merger.

                      (d) Restraint. No Restraint that would reasonably be
           expected to result, directly or indirectly, in any of the effects
           referred to in Section 7.02(c) shall be in effect.

                      (e) Tax Opinion. Parent shall have received from Weil,
           Gotshal & Manges LLP, counsel to the Parent, on the Closing Date, an
           opinion in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and
           dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that the Merger will
           qualify for United States Federal income tax purposes as a
           "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In
           rendering such opinion, Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP may rely upon
           customary assumptions and the representations and covenants contained
           in the certificates of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub referred to
           in Section 6.09.

                      (f) Closing Consents. The consents listed on Exhibit E
           hereto shall have been obtained and shall be in full force and
           effect, without any conditions which would reasonably be likely to
           have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, have a Company Material
           Adverse Effect, or materially impair the long-term benefits sought to
           be derived from the Merger.

                     Section 7.03. Conditions to Obligation of the Company. The
obligation of the Company to effect the Merger is further subject to the
satisfaction or waiver on or prior to the Closing Date of the following
conditions:

                      (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations
           and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement
           shall be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of
           the Closing Date as though made on the Closing Date (without regard
           to materiality or Parent Material Adverse Effect qualifiers contained
           therein), except to the extent such representations and warranties
           expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier
           date, except where the failure of the representations and warranties
           to be true and correct individually or in the aggregate, has not had


                                       44
<PAGE>
           and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
           Adverse Effect. The Company shall have received a certificate signed
           on behalf of Parent by an executive officer of Parent to such effect.

                      (b) Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub.
           Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed in all material respects
           all obligations required to be performed by them under this Agreement
           at or prior to the Closing Date, and the Company shall have received
           a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by an executive officer of
           Parent to such effect.

                      (c) Tax Opinion. The Company shall have received from
           Dewey Ballantine LLP, special counsel to the Company, on the Closing
           Date, an opinion in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
           Company and dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that the
           Merger will qualify for United States Federal income tax purposes as
           a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
           In rendering such opinion, Dewey Ballantine LLP may rely upon
           customary assumptions and representations and covenants contained in
           the certificates of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub referred to in
           Section 6.09.

                     Section 7.04. Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set
forth in Section 7.01, 7.02 or 7.03, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such
failure was caused by such party's failure to use its reasonable efforts to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
as required by and subject to Section 6.03.

                                 on or before July 31, 2004; provided, however,
                                 that the right to terminate this Agreement
                                 under this Section 8.01(b)(i) shall not be
                                 available to any party whose action or failure
                                 to act has been a principal cause of or
                                 resulted in the failure of the Merger to be
                                 consummated on or before such date;

                                 Section 7.02(c) shall be in effect and shall
                                 have become final and nonappealable;

                      (iii)      if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not
                                 have been obtained at the Company Stockholders
                                 Meeting duly convened therefor or at any

           failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants
           or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to
           perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth
           in Section 7.02(a) or (b) and (B) is incapable of being cured, or is
           not cured, by the Company within 30 calendar days following receipt
           of written notice from Parent of such breach or failure to perform;

                      (d) by the Company, if Parent shall have breached or
           failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants
           or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to
           perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth
           in Section 7.03(a) or (b) and (ii) is incapable of being cured, or is
           not cured, by Parent within 30 calendar days following receipt of
           written notice from the Company of such breach or failure to perform;

                                 (i) this Agreement is terminated by either
                      Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i), and
                      (A) a vote to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval has
                      not been held, (B) the failure to hold such vote was not
                      due to circumstances beyond the control of the Company,
                      including Parent's breach of its obligations contained in
                      this Agreement or any Restraint which had the effect of
                      delaying the Company Stockholders Meeting past July 31,
                      2004, despite the Company's reasonable efforts to remove
                      the Restraint and hold the meeting in a timely manner and
                      (C) within 12 months after such termination the Company
                      shall have reached a definitive agreement to consummate,
                      or shall have consummated, a Company Takeover Proposal;

                                 (ii) this Agreement is terminated by either
                      Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii) and
                      (A) Parent shall not have been entitled to terminate this
                      Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e), (B) after the date
                      of this Agreement a Company Takeover Proposal shall have
                      been made or communicated to the Company or shall have
                      been made directly to the stockholders of the Company
                      generally and (C) within 12 months after such termination
                      the Company shall have reached a definitive agreement to
                      consummate, or shall have consummated, a Company Takeover
                      Proposal;

                                 (iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent
                      pursuant to Section 8.01(c) and (A) the Company's breach
                      or failure triggering such termination shall have been
                      willful, (B) after the date of this Agreement a Company
                      Takeover Proposal shall have been made or communicated to
                      the Company or shall have been made directly to the
                      stockholders of the Company generally and (C) within 12
                      months after such termination the Company shall have
                      reached a definitive agreement to consummate, or shall
                      have consummated, a Company Takeover Proposal; or

                                 (iv) this Agreement is terminated by Parent
                      pursuant to Section 8.01(e),

then the Company shall (x) in the case of a Termination Fee payable pursuant to
clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 8.02(a), upon the earlier of the date
of such definitive agreement and such consummation of a Company Takeover
Proposal or (y) in the case of a Termination Fee payable pursuant to clause (iv)
of this Section 8.02(a), on the date of such termination, pay Parent a fee equal
to $116,388,089 (the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer of same-day funds. In
the case of a Termination Fee payable pursuant to clause (iii) of this Section
8.02(a), the parties agree that the Termination Fee shall be the appropriate
measure of liquidated damages, and shall be the total damages and sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub relating to the willful breach or
failure which triggered the payment of the Termination Fee.

                     (b) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in Section 8.02(a) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would
not enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails promptly to pay the amount
due pursuant to Section 8.02(a), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the
Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the
date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made.

                     Section 8.03. Effect of Termination. In the event of
termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in
Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect,
without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, other than the provisions of the penultimate sentence of Section
6.02(a), Sections 6.05 and 8.02, this Section 8.03 and Article IX, which
provisions shall survive such termination; provided that nothing herein shall
relieve any party from any liability for any willful breach hereof, subject to
the final sentence of Section 8.02(a).

                     Section 8.04. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by
the parties hereto at any time before or after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that after such approval has been
obtained, there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval
by the stockholders of the Company without such approval having been obtained.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.

                     Section 8.05. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the

inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) subject to the proviso to the first
sentence of Section 8.04, waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute
a waiver of such rights.

                     Section 8.06. Procedure for Termination or Amendment. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01 or an amendment of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.04 shall, in order to be effective, require, in
the case of Parent or the Company, action by its Board of Directors or, with
respect to any amendment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.04, the duly
authorized committee or other designee of its Board of Directors to the extent
permitted by Law.

Time. This Section 9.01 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties
which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

                     Section 9.09. Specific Enforcement; Consent to
Jurisdiction. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the
parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any Federal court located in the State of Delaware or in any state
court in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties
hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any Federal
court located in the State of Delaware or of any state court located in the
State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt
to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for
leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any court other than a Federal court located in the State of Delaware or a state
court located in the State of Delaware.

                     Section 9.10. Severability. If any term or other provision
of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
