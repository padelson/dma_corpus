Ratio; _provided_ , that immediately prior to the actions in this clause
(iii), the Special Limited Partner shall be treated as having contributed its

special limited partnership interest in the Company Operating Partnership, the
amount of which distributions is evidenced by the Listing Agreement, to the
Company Operating Partnership in exchange for 5,613,374 OP Units in a
transaction intended to qualify as a contribution of property pursuant to
Section 721 of the Code, and such contribution shall cause the capital
accounts of the partners of the Company Operating Partnership to be "booked-
up" in accordance with Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) and
(g), to the extent possible, as of immediately prior to the Partnership Merger
Effective Time which "book-up" shall be allocated to the partners in
accordance with the allocations provisions of the Company Operating
Partnership Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Proration_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the
maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock that may be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration pursuant to this _Article III_
(the " _Cash Conversion Number_ "), shall be equal to the product (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) of ten percent (10%) times the number of
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including Company Restricted Shares). All other shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled as provided in
_Section 3.1(a)(i)_) shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration.

 



 

(b) Within two (2) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among former holders of
Company Common Stock of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock
Consideration as follows:

 



 

(i) If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to
which Cash Elections shall have been made (the " _Cash Election Number_ ")
exceeds the Cash Conversion Number, then all Stock Election Shares and all
Non-Electing Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration and Cash Election Shares held by a holder thereof will be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that

 



      
 

 



 

number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(A) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (B) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Number and the denominator of
which is the Cash Election Number (with the Exchange Agent to determine,
consistent with _Section 3.2(a)_, whether fractions of Cash Election Shares
shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holders Cash
Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration; and

 



 

(ii) If the Cash Election Number is less than or equal to the Cash Conversion
Number, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration and the Non-Electing Shares and Stock Election
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Election Procedures_. Each holder of record of shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and (each holder of Company Restricted Shares (any of the foregoing, a "
_Holder_ ") shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Article III_, to submit an election on or prior to the Election Deadline in
accordance with the following procedures:

 



 

(a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 3.3_ (herein called an " _Election_ ") (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to
which such Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such
Holder desires to make a Cash Election.

 



 

(b) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Form of Election_"), which shall be mailed by the Company to record holders
of Company Common Stock and delivered to holders of Company Restricted Shares
so as to permit those Holders to exercise their right to make an Election
prior to the Election Deadline.

 



 

(c) The Company shall mail or cause to be mailed or delivered, as applicable,
the Form of Election to record holders of Common Stock and holders of Company
Restricted Shares as of the record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting
not less than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the anticipated Election
Deadline (the " _Mailing Date_ "). Parent shall make available one or more
Forms of Election as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all
persons who become holders of record of Company Common Stock during the period
following the record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting and prior to the
Election Deadline.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Mailing Date, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent, which
shall be a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the purpose of receiving Elections and exchanging
shares of Company Common Stock represented by Certificates for Merger
Consideration, pursuant to an exchange agent agreement entered into prior to
the Mailing Date (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ "). Any Election shall have
been made properly only if the Exchange Agent shall have received, by the
Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly completed and signed and
accompanied by Certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock to
which such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in
form acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company or

 



      
 

 



 

by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, as set
forth in such Form of Election, from a firm that is an "eligible guarantor
institution" (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act); _provided_ ,
that such Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time
required in such guarantee of delivery, and, in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
any additional documents specified in the procedures set forth in the Form of
Election. Failure to deliver shares of Company Common Stock covered by such a
guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be
deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made Election, unless otherwise
determined by Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion. As used herein,
unless otherwise agreed in advance by the Company and Parent, " _Election
Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal
office of the Exchange Agent is located) on the later of (i) the date
immediately prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting and (ii) the date that
Parent and the Company shall agree is two (2) Business Days prior to the
expected Closing Date. The Company and Parent shall issue a press release
reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the anticipated date of the
Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15) Business Days before, and at
least five (5) Business Days prior to, the Election Deadline. If the Closing
is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Deadline shall be similarly
delayed to a subsequent date (which shall be the second (2nd) Business Day
prior to the Closing Date) and the Company and Parent shall cooperate to
promptly publicly announce such rescheduled Election Deadline and Closing.

 



 

(e) Any Holder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change or
revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent
prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed
revised Form of Election or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of
his or her Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such Certificates,
or any documents in respect of Book-Entry Shares, previously deposited with
the Exchange Agent. After an Election is validly made with respect to any
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Restricted Shares, any subsequent
transfer of such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Restricted Shares
shall automatically revoke such Election. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, all Elections shall be automatically deemed
revoked upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of written notification from Parent
or the Company that this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
_Article VIII_. Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement and this
Agreement, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine if
any Election is not properly made with respect to any shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Restricted Shares (neither Parent nor the Company nor the
Exchange Agent being under any duty to notify any stockholder of any such
defect); in the event the Exchange Agent makes such a determination, such
Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Restricted Shares covered by such Election shall, for
purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Electing Shares, unless a proper Election
is thereafter timely made with respect to such shares.

 



 

(f) Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Parent and the
Company, in the exercise of their reasonable discretion, shall have the joint
right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement, governing (i) the manner and extent to which Elections are to be
taken into account in making the determinations prescribed by _Section 3.2_,
(ii) the issuance and delivery of certificates representing the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock into which shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Restricted

 



      
 

 



 

Shares are converted into the right to receive in the Merger and (iii) the
method of payment of cash for shares of Company Common Stock converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and
Company Restricted Shares at the Effective Time, for exchange in accordance
with this _Article III_, (i) evidence of Parent Common Stock in book-entry
form issuable pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ equal to the aggregate Stock
Consideration and (ii) immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Cash
Consideration (together with, to the extent then determinable, any cash
payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.14_)
(collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ ") and Parent shall instruct the Exchange
Agent to timely pay the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional
shares, in accordance with this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange
Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent or the
Surviving Entity. Interest and other income on the Exchange Fund shall be the
sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Entity and shall be
paid to Parent or the Surviving Entity, as Parent directs. No investment of
the Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange
Agent from making the payments required by this _Article III_, and following
any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Exchange Agent to the extent necessary to satisfy Parents
obligations hereunder for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock at the Effective Time, which additional funds will be deemed to
be part of the Exchange Fund.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth
(5th) Business Day following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail
to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share immediately
prior to the Effective Time a form of letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration, in such form as the Company and Parent
may reasonably agree. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant
to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration (which,
to the extent it is Stock Consideration, shall be in non-certificated book-
entry form) in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will
be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Share Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the share transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of

 



      
 

 



 

transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective
Time, Persons who held shares of Company Common Stock or Company Restricted
Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with
respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein. On or after
the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or the
Surviving Entity for any reason shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented thereby.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Dividends with Respect to Parent Common Stock_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with
respect to such Certificate in accordance with this Agreement, and all such
dividends and other distributions shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange
Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the
surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in
accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) there
shall be paid to the record holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock, if
any, issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) all dividends and
other distributions payable in respect of any such shares of Parent Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or
prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares
of Parent Common Stock.

 



 

Section 3.8 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) which
remains undistributed to the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock
or Company Restricted Shares on the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any former holders of
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Restricted Shares who have not
theretofore received any Merger Consideration (including any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any applicable dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock) to which they are entitled under this _Article
III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Entity for payment
of their claims with respect thereto.

 



 

Section 3.9 _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Entity, OP Merger Sub, the Company Operating Partnership, the
Surviving Partnership or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer,
director, agent or Affiliate of any of them, shall be liable to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock in respect of any cash that would have
otherwise been payable in respect of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
holders of any such shares immediately prior to the time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Entity, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders
or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled
thereto.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.10 _Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Company Restricted Shares_. Each Company Restricted Share that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the occurrence of the
Closing and without any action on the part of any holder of any Company
Restricted Share, vest in full, and the restrictions with respect thereto
shall lapse. Each such Company Restricted Share shall be deemed an issued and
outstanding share of Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
determined in accordance with this Agreement and otherwise subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section 3.1_ and _Section
3.3_). Any amounts withheld with respect to the Restricted Shares pursuant to
_Section 3.11_ shall be withheld first from the aggregate Cash Consideration
payable in respect of such holders Company Restricted Shares.

 



 

(b) _LTIP Units_. The parties to the OPP Agreement have as of the date hereof,
entered into an agreement to terminate the OPP Agreement (without payment
thereunder to the Company Advisor or any of its Affiliates) effective as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent on the occurrence of
the Effective Time (the " _OPP Termination Agreement_ "). A true, correct and
complete copy of the OPP Termination Agreement has been provided to Parent.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 3.10_.

 



 

Section 3.11 _Withholding Rights_. Each and any Parent Party, the Company, the
Surviving Entity, the Company Operating Partnership, the Surviving Partnership
or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Merger Consideration and any other amounts or property otherwise
payable or distributable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts
or property (or portions thereof) as such Parent Party, the Company, the
Surviving Entity, the Surviving Partnership or the Exchange Agent is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment or
distribution under the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority by a Parent Party, the Company, the Surviving Entity, the Surviving
Partnership or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Parent Party, the Company, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as
applicable.

 



 

Section 3.12 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable and customary amount as the Surviving Entity may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof
is entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.13 _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall
be available with respect to the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.14 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or Class C Units of the Surviving
Partnership shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or
with respect to Book-Entry Shares or otherwise, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, (i) each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted
pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock and (ii) each holder who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Class C Unit of the
Surviving Partnership shall receive (aggregating for this purpose all the
shares of Parent Common Stock or Class C Units, as applicable, that such
holder is entitled to receive hereunder), in lieu thereof, cash, without
interest, in an amount equal to the product of (a) such fractional part of a
share of Parent Common Stock or Class C Unit, as applicable, multiplied by (b)
the per share closing price of Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date on the
NYSE, as reported in The Wall Street Journal.

Section 4.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The Company has filed with, or furnished (on a publicly available basis)
to, the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements and documents required
to be filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
as the case may be, including any amendments or supplements thereto, from and
after January 1, 2012 (collectively, the " _Company SEC Filings_ "). Each
Company SEC Filing, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, (i) as of its
date, or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent
amendment or supplement thereto, complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and (ii) did
not, at the time it was filed (or became effective in the case of registration
statements), or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent
amendment or supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of
this Agreement, no Company Subsidiary is separately subject to the periodic
reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.

 



 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained or incorporated by
reference in the Company SEC Filings (as amended, supplemented or restated, if
applicable), including the related notes and schedules, was prepared (except
as indicated in the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, and each such consolidated
financial statement presented fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position, results of operations, stockholders equity
and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments).

 



 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries that are used in the system of internal accounting
controls described in the following sentence are recorded, stored, maintained
and operated under means that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or accountants, except for
any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably
be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the system of internal
accounting controls. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have devised and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP, including that: (1) transactions are executed only in accordance with
managements authorization; (2) transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of the financial statements of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the assets of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries; (3) access to such assets is permitted only in
accordance with managements authorization; (4) the reporting of such assets
is compared with existing assets at regular intervals; and (5) accounts, notes
and other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and
adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a
current and timely basis. The Companys principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed to the Companys

 



      
 

 



 

auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys
internal controls, and the Company has made available to Parent copies of any
material written materials relating to the foregoing. The Company has
established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is
defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure
that material information relating to the Company required to be included in
reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its consolidated subsidiaries,
is made known to the Companys principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared, and, to the knowledge of the Company, such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective in timely alerting the Companys principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer to material information
required to be included in the Companys periodic reports required under the
Exchange Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary has made any prohibited loans to any
director or executive officer of the Company (as defined in Rule 3b-7
promulgated under the Exchange Act).

 



 

(d) Except as and to the extent disclosed or reserved against on the Companys
most recent balance sheet (or, in the notes thereto) included in the Company
SEC Filings, none of the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise), except for liabilities or obligations (i) expressly
contemplated by or under this Agreement, including _Section 6.1_ hereof, (ii)
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since the most recent balance sheet set forth in the Company SEC Filings made
through and including the date of this Agreement, (iii) described in any
section of the Company Disclosure Letter or (iv) that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(e) Except as set forth in _Section 4.7(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
to the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC Filings is as of the
date hereof the subject of ongoing SEC review and the Company has not received
any comments from the SEC with respect to any of the Company SEC Filings which
remain unresolved, nor has it received any inquiry or information request from
the SEC as of the date hereof as to any matters affecting the Company which
has not been adequately addressed. None of the Company SEC Filings as of the
date hereof is the subject of any confidential treatment request by the
Company.

the SEC, at any time such document is amended or supplemented or at the time
such document is declared effective by the SEC, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii)
the Proxy

Company, at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, at the time the Form
S-4 is declared effective by the SEC or at the Effective Time, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. All

connection with the transactions contemplated herein, to the extent relating
to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or other information supplied by or
on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for inclusion therein, will
comply as to form, in all material respects, with the provisions of the

of the SEC thereunder and each such document required to be filed with any
Governmental Authority (other than the SEC) will comply in all material
respects with the provisions of any applicable Law as to the information
required to be contained therein.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 4.8_ or this
Agreement, the Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to
statements made or incorporated, or omissions included, in the Form S-4 or the
Proxy Statement to the extent based upon information supplied to the Company
by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

ordinary course. Between December 31, 2013 and the date hereof, there has not

necessary for Parent, Merger Sub and each other Parent Subsidiary to own,
lease and, to the extent applicable, operate its properties or to carry on its
respective business substantially as it is being conducted as of the date

in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in possession of, or
the failure to be valid or in full force and effect of, any of the Parent

applications required to have been filed for the renewal of Parent Permits
have been duly filed on a timely basis with the appropriate Governmental
Authority, and all other filings required to have been made with respect to
such Parent Permits have been duly made on a timely basis with the appropriate
Governmental Authority, except in each case for failures to file which,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any
Parent Subsidiary has received any claim or notice nor has any knowledge
indicating that Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is currently not in compliance
with the terms of any such Parent Permits, except where the failure to be in
compliance with the terms of any such Parent Permits, individually or in the

Section 5.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) Parent has filed with, or furnished (on a publicly available basis) to,
the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements and documents required to be
filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the
case may be, including any amendments or supplements thereto, from and after
January 1, 2012 (collectively, the " _Parent SEC Filings_ "). Each Parent SEC
Filing, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, (i) as of its date, or, if
amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or
supplement thereto, complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time it
was filed (or became effective in the case of registration statements), or, if
amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or
supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement,

 



      
 

 



 

neither Merger Sub nor any other Parent Subsidiary is separately subject to
the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.

 



 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained or incorporated by
reference in the Parent SEC Filings (as amended, supplemented or restated, if
applicable), including the related notes and schedules, was prepared (except
as indicated in the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, and each such consolidated
financial statement presented fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position, results of operations, stockholders equity
and cash flows of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments).

 



 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries that are used in the system of internal accounting
controls described in the following sentence are recorded, stored, maintained
and operated under means that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries or accountants, except for any
non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be
expected to have a materially adverse effect on the system of internal
accounting controls. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have devised and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP, including that: (1) transactions are executed only in accordance with
managements authorization; (2) transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of the financial statements of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the assets of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries; (3) access to such assets is permitted only in accordance
with managements authorization; (4) the reporting of such assets is compared
with existing assets at regular intervals; and (5) accounts, notes and other
receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate
procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and
timely basis. Parents principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer have disclosed to Parents auditors and the audit committee of the
Parent Board (i) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Parents internal controls, and Parent has made available to the
Company copies of any material written materials relating to the foregoing.
Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act)
designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent required to be
included in reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known to Parents principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer by others within those entities, particularly
during the periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange
Act are being prepared, and, to the knowledge of Parent, such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Parents principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer to material information
required to be included in Parents periodic reports required under the
Exchange Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of Parent,
Merger Sub or

 



      
 

 



 

any other Parent Subsidiary has made any prohibited loans to any director or
executive officer of Parent (as defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the
Exchange Act).

 



 

(d) Except as and to the extent disclosed or reserved against on Parents most
recent balance sheet (or, in the notes thereto) included in the Parent SEC
Filings, none of Parent or its consolidated subsidiaries has any liabilities
or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise), except for liabilities or obligations (i) expressly contemplated
by or under this Agreement, including _Section 6.2_ hereof, (ii) incurred in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since the most
recent balance sheet set forth in the Parent SEC Filings made through and
including the date of this Agreement, (iii) described in any section of the
Parent Disclosure Letter or (iv) that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(e) Except as set forth in _Section 5.7(e)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
to the knowledge of Parent, none of the Parent SEC Filings is as of the date
hereof the subject of ongoing SEC review and Parent has not received any
comments from the SEC with respect to any of the Parent SEC Filings which
remains unresolved, nor has it received any inquiry or information request
from the SEC as of the date hereof as to any matters affecting Parent which
has not been adequately addressed. None of the Parent SEC Filings as of the
date hereof is the subject of any confidential treatment request by Parent.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Disclosure Documents_.

 



 

(a) None of the information supplied or to be supplied in writing by or on
behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time such document
is filed with the SEC, at any time such document is amended or supplemented or
at the time such document is declared effective by the SEC, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
(ii) the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the
stockholders of the Company, at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting,
at the time the Form S-4 is declared effective by the SEC or at the Effective
Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading. All documents that Parent is responsible for filing with the SEC
in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, to the extent
relating to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or other information supplied by
or on behalf of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary for inclusion therein, will
comply as to form, in all material respects, with the provisions of the
Securities Act or Exchange Act, as applicable and the rules and regulations of
the SEC thereunder and each such document required to be filed with any
Governmental Authority (other than the SEC) will comply in all material
respects with the provisions of any applicable Law as to the information
required to be contained therein.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.8_ or this
Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty
with respect to statements made or incorporated, or omissions included, in the

to Parent by or on behalf of the Company.

Company, the Company Entities and the Companys Affiliates will not enter into
any definitive agreement or otherwise become subject to any binding obligation

request).

 



 

(f) If requested by Parent at least forty-five (45) days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall dispose of the properties listed
in _Section 6.1(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter without any continuing

a Qualified REIT Subsidiary or a Taxable REIT Subsidiary under the applicable

treated as a Taxable REIT Subsidiary under the applicable provisions of
Section 856 of the Code as of the date hereof to be so treated; or

 



 

(v) authorize, or enter into any contract, agreement, commitment or
arrangement to do any of the foregoing.

concerning itself, its Affiliates and the holders of its capital stock to the
other and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and
Proxy Statement. The Form S-4 and Proxy Statement shall include all
information reasonably requested by such other party to be included therein.
Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement, and shall, as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other with copies
of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement or the Form S-4 received from the SEC and advise the other party of
any oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 received
from the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement and the Form S-4. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments from the SEC with respect thereto, each
of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and provide the other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the
proposed final version of such document or response). Parent shall advise the
Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time of
effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto
or the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Mergers for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and
Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to have any
such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Parent
shall also take any other action required to be taken under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue
sky" Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the
issuance of the Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and the Company shall
furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of the Company
Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
actions.

 



 

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, should be set forth in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement,
so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to,
the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 and, to the extent required by Law, in
disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to
stockholders of the Company and the stockholders of Parent. Nothing in this
_Section 6.3(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any party under _Section
6.3(a)_. For purposes of _Section 4.8_, _Section 5.8_ and this _Section
6.3_, any information concerning or related to the Company, its Affiliates or
the Company Stockholder Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by the
Company, and any information concerning or related to Parent or its Affiliates
will be deemed to have been provided by Parent.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Charter and
Company Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
stockholders of the Company entitled to vote at the Company Stockholder
Meeting and to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as soon as practicable
after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. The Company
shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that they give
the Company Stockholder Approval, include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval, except to the extent that the Company Board
shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by _Section
6.5(d)_; _provided_ , _however_ , the Companys obligation to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting shall be
unconditional unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms
and shall not be affected by any Adverse Recommendation Change.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.3(c)_, if, on a
date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, the Company has
not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company
Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a
quorum is present, the Company shall have the right to make one or more
successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Stockholder Meeting;
_provided_ that the Company Stockholder Meeting is not postponed or adjourned
to a date that is more than (i) thirty (30) days after the date for which the
Company Stockholder Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any
adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law) or (ii) one hundred
twenty (120) days after the record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting.

confirm the accuracy of the representations and warranties in Section

Companys receipt of the ruling described in _Schedule 6.11(c)_.

reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the
Company that may result from the requests for access, data and information
hereunder.

Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including any information
exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.4_, in confidence to the extent
required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement.

reasonable best efforts to cause its and their officers and directors,
managers or equivalent, and other Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly through another Person, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage

any of the foregoing.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.5_, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may,
directly or indirectly through any Representative, in response to an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party made after
the date of this Agreement (i) furnish non-public information to such Third
Party (and such Third Partys Representatives) making an Acquisition Proposal
( _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) prior to so furnishing such information,
the Company receives from the Third Party an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) any non-public information concerning the
Company Entities that is provided to such Third Party shall, to the extent not
previously provided to Parent or Merger Sub, be provided to Parent or Merger
Sub prior to or substantially at the same time that such information is
provided to such Third Party), and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations
with such Third Party (and such Third Partys

 



      
 

 



 

Representatives) with respect to the Acquisition Proposal if, in the case of
each of clauses (i) and (ii), the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a
Superior Proposal.

 



 

(c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any
request for nonpublic information relating to the Company Entities by any
Third Party, or any Inquiry from any Person seeking to have discussions or
negotiations with the Company relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal.
Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate
the identity of the Third Party making the Acquisition Proposal, request or
Inquiry and the material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposals,
Inquiries, proposals or offers (including a copy thereof if in writing and any
related documentation or correspondence). The Company shall also promptly, and
in any event within twenty-four (24) hours, notify Parent orally and in
writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any
Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic information or data to any Person
in accordance with this _Section 6.5(c)_ and keep Parent reasonably informed
of the status and material terms of any such proposals, offers, discussions or
negotiations on a current basis, including by providing a copy of all material
documentation or material correspondence relating thereto.

 



 

(d) Except as permitted by this _Section 6.5(d)_, neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify (or
publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify), in a manner
adverse to any Parent Party, the Company Recommendation, (ii) approve, adopt
or recommend (or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend) any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement or any Schedule 14D-9, as applicable, (iv) fail to publicly
recommend against any Acquisition Proposal within five (5) Business Days of
the request of Parent and/or fail to reaffirm the Company Recommendation
within five (5) Business Days of the request of Parent, or such fewer number
of days as remains prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting ( _provided_ that
Parent shall not be permitted to make such request (x) on more than one (1)
occasion in respect of each Acquisition Proposal and (y) on more than one (1)
occasion in respect of each material modification to an Acquisition Proposal,
if any) (any of the actions described in clauses _(i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ and
_(iv)_ of this _Section 6.5(d)_, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or
(v) approve, adopt, declare advisable or recommend (or agree to, resolve or
propose to approve, adopt, declare advisable or recommend), or cause or permit
any Company Entity to enter into, any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with
this _Section 6.5_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement (A) at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, if the Company Board (x) has received an unsolicited bona fide
Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of this _Section
6.5_) that, in the good faith determination of the Company Board, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a
Superior Proposal, after having complied with, and giving effect to all of the
adjustments which may be offered by the Parent Parties pursuant to _Section
6.5(e)_, and such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn, and (y) determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the directors duties under
applicable Law, then in such case the Company may (i) terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ or

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) make an Adverse Recommendation Change, including approving or
recommending such Superior Proposal to the Companys stockholders, and, in the
case of a termination, the Company may immediately prior to or concurrently
with such termination of this Agreement, enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; or (B) in response to an
Intervening Event, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law, the
Company may make an Adverse Recommendation Change, _provided_ , _that_ , in
the event of any termination by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_
or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, as may be applicable, the
Company complies with its obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 8.3(a)_.

 



 

(e) The Company Board shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)_ or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ unless (i) the Company has
provided a written notice (a " _Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") to
the Parent Parties that the Company intends to take such action, specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons therefor and, in the case of an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)(A)_, describing the
material terms and conditions of, and attaching a complete copy of, the
Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action (it being understood that
such material terms shall include the identity of the Third Party), (ii)
during the three (3) Business Day period following the Parent Parties receipt
of the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Representatives to, negotiate with the Parent Parties in good faith
(to the extent the Parent Parties desire to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Adverse
Recommendation Change or termination of this Agreement is no longer necessary,
and (iii) following the end of the three (3) Business Day period, the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, taking into account any changes to this
Agreement proposed in writing by the Parent Parties in response to the Notice
of Adverse Recommendation Change or otherwise, (x) that in the case of an
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)(A)_, the Superior
Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change continues
to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (y) in the case of an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to either _Section 6.5(d)(A)_ or _Section
6.5(d)(B)_, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the directors duties under
applicable Law. Any material change to the terms of such Superior Proposal,
including any change to the financial terms, and any material change to the
facts and circumstances relating to an Intervening Event, as applicable, shall
require a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change and the provisions of
this _Section 6.5(e)_ shall again apply with respect to such Superior
Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board, directly or indirectly
through its Representatives, from disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board
has determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any disclosure other than a "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by

 



      
 

 



 

Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, an express rejection of any
applicable Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the Company
Recommendation shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

(g) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause each
of the other Company Entities, and its and their officers and directors,
managers or equivalent, and other Representatives to (i) immediately cease any
existing discussions, negotiations or communications with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and (ii) take such action
as is necessary to enforce any confidentiality or standstill provisions or
provisions of similar effect to which any Company Entity is a party or of
which any Company Entity is a beneficiary. The Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause all Third Parties who have been furnished confidential
information regarding any Company Entity in connection with the solicitation
of or discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal within the six (6) months
prior to the date of this Agreement to promptly return or destroy such
information (to the extent that they are entitled to have such information
returned or destroyed).

 



 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide inquiry, proposal or
offer made by any Person, whether in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, relating to (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination or similar transaction involving any of the Company
Entities, (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, license, transfer
or other disposition, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, sale
of equity interests, share exchange, joint venture, business combination or
otherwise, of any assets of any Company Entity representing fifteen percent
(15%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company Entities, taken as a
whole as determined on a book-value basis, (iii) any issue, sale or other
disposition of (including by way of merger, consolidation, joint venture,
business combination, share exchange or any similar transaction) securities
(or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into,
such securities) representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting
power of the Company, (iv) any tender offer or exchange offer in which any
Person or " _group_ " (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act) shall seek to acquire beneficial ownership (as such term is
defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act), or the right to
acquire beneficial ownership, of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of the Company, or (v)
any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
type of transaction with respect to the Company in which a Third Party shall
acquire beneficial ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall not
include the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal (except that, for purposes of this definition, the references in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" to "fifteen percent (15%)" shall be
replaced by "fifty percent (50%)") made by a Third Party on terms that the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, taking into account all
financial, legal, regulatory and any other aspects of the transaction
described in such proposal that the Company

 



      
 

 



 

Board deems relevant, including the identity of the Person making such
proposal, any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions
to consummation, as well as any changes to the financial terms of this
Agreement proposed by the Parent Parties in response to such proposal or
otherwise, to be (A) more favorable to the Company and the Companys
stockholders (solely in their capacity as such) from a financial point of view
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) reasonably likely
to receive all required governmental approvals on a timely basis and otherwise
reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
the Company and each of the Parent Parties shall and shall cause the other
Company Entities and the other Parent Entities, respectively, to use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or
pursuant to any contract or agreement to consummate and make effective, as
promptly as practicable, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including (i) the taking of all actions necessary to cause
the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied, (ii)
the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents
(including the Lender Consents) and approvals from Governmental Authorities or
other Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the Mergers and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental
Authorities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary in
connection with the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including promptly responding to all requests
by a Governmental Authority or other Person for additional information in
support of any such filing or request for approval or waiver), (iii) the
defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Mergers
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to
have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Authority vacated or reversed, the avoidance of each and every
impediment under any antitrust, merger control, competition or trade
regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect
to the Mergers so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably
possible, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of the Parent
Parties and the Company shall give (or shall cause the other Parent Entities
or the other Company Entities, respectively, to give) any notices to Third
Parties, and each of the Parent Parties and the Company shall use, and cause
each of their respective Affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts to
obtain any Third Party consents not covered by _Section 6.6(a)_ that are
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Mergers. Each of the parties
hereto will furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may

 



      
 

 



 

request in connection with the preparation of any required governmental
filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a
Governmental Authority, including promptly informing the other parties of such
inquiry, consulting in advance before making any presentations or submissions
to a Governmental Authority, and supplying each other with copies of all
material correspondence, filings or communications between either party and
any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement. To the extent
reasonably practicable, the parties or their Representatives shall have the
right to review in advance and each of the parties will consult the others on,
all the information relating to the other and each of their Affiliates that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that confidential
competitively sensitive business information may be redacted from such
exchanges. To the extent reasonably practicable, none of the parties hereto
shall, nor shall they permit their respective Representatives to, participate
independently in any meeting or engage in any substantive conversation with
any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or other
inquiry without giving the other party prior notice of such meeting or
conversation and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, without giving
the other parties the opportunity to attend or participate (whether by
telephone or in person) in any such meeting with such Governmental Authority.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, obtaining any approval or consent from any
third party pursuant to this _Section 6.6(b)_ shall not be a condition to the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger.

 



 

(c) In connection with obtaining the Lender Consents, and without limitation
of the foregoing, the Parent Parties shall, and Parent shall cause the other
Parent Entities to, furnish such information and provide such assistance to,
and otherwise cooperate with, the Company, in each case, as the Company may
reasonably request, in connection with any actions contemplated to be taken by
the Company with respect to obtaining the Lender Consents, including by
agreeing to provide, from and after the Closing, customary non-recourse carve-
out or "bad boy," guaranties with respect to events that are customarily the
subject of such guaranties. The Parent Parties agree that the Company shall be
expressly entitled to incur and pay any customary fees and expenses reasonably
necessary to obtain the Lender Consents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
may elect to exclude any Lender Consent from the provisions of this _Section
6.6(c)_; _provided_ , that the amount of Indebtedness to which such excluded
Lender Consent relates shall not be applied toward the threshold set forth in
_Section 2.2(a)_.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than any
Governmental Authority) with respect to the Merger, none of the parties
hereto, any of the other Company Entities or any of the other Parent Entities,
or any of the their respective Representatives, shall be obligated to pay or
commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any
cash or other consideration, make any accommodation or commitment or incur any
liability or other obligation to such Person (unless expressly required by a
written agreement that was entered into prior to the date hereof with such
Person), unless such party is promptly reimbursed for such payment. The
parties shall cooperate with respect to accommodations that may be requested
or appropriate to obtain such consents.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters; Transaction Litigation_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to the Parent Parties, and the Parent
Parties shall give prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or other
communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with this Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Mergers or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to the Parent Parties, and the Parent
Parties shall give prompt notice to the Company, if (i) any representation or
warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate
such that it would be reasonable to expect that the applicable closing
conditions would be incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date or (ii)
it fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall give prompt notice to the Parent
Parties, and the Parent Parties shall give prompt notice to the Company, if,
to the knowledge of such party, the occurrence of any state of facts, change,
development, event or condition would cause, or would reasonably be expected
to cause, any of the conditions to Closing set forth herein not to be
satisfied or satisfaction to be materially delayed. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the failure by the Company or the Parent
Parties to provide such prompt notice under this _Section 6.7(b)_ shall not
constitute a breach of covenant for purposes of _Section 7.2(b)_ or _Section
7.3(b)_.

 



 

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to give prompt written notice to the
other parties upon becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of
any event or circumstance relating to it or any of the other Company Entities
or the other Parent Entities, respectively, which could reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect
or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.

 



 

(d) The Company shall give prompt notice to the Parent Parties, and the Parent
Parties shall give prompt notice to the Company, of any Action commenced or,
to such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving such
party or any of the other Company Entities or the other Parent Entities,
respectively, which relate to this Agreement, the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall give the Parent
Parties the opportunity to reasonably participate in the defense and
settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its
directors relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The Parent Parties shall give the Company the opportunity to
reasonably participate in the defense and settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Parent Parties and/or their directors relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and no such settlement
shall be agreed to without the Companys prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.8 _Termination of Advisory and Other Agreements_. On the date
hereof, the Company or another Company Entity, as applicable, has entered into
amendments to the Advisory Agreement, the Listing Agreement (the " _Listing
Termination Agreement_ "), the Management Agreement, and any other agreements
between the Company or any of the Company Entities, on the one hand, and the
Advisor, the Special Limited Partner, the Manager, or any other Affiliate of
the Company or of the Company Advisor, on the other hand (other than the
Company Operating Partnership Agreement), terminating all such agreements
effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Closing (such
agreements, together with the OPP Termination Agreement, the " _Termination
Agreements_ "), and such terminations shall be without any liability to the
Company, any of the Company Entities, Parent, any Affiliate of Parent, or the
Surviving Entity. The Company has provided to Parent true, correct and
complete copies of the Termination Agreements. Immediately prior to the
Closing, the Company shall deliver to the Company Advisor and the Manager all
amounts owed to such Person under the Advisory Agreement and the Management
Agreement, respectively, and in exchange for such payments, the Company shall
cause the Company Advisor, the Special Limited Partner, the Manager, and any
other Affiliates of the Company or of the Company Advisor to execute a full
and unconditional release of any claims or liabilities whatsoever that they
may have against the Company, any of the Company Entities, Parent, any
Affiliate of Parent, or the Surviving Entity, including without limitation any
claims arising under (i) the Advisory Agreement, (ii) the Listing Agreement,
(iii) the OPP Agreement, (iv) the Investment Opportunity Allocation Agreement,
dated as of April 9, 2013 by and among the Company and American Realty Capital
Healthcare Trust II, Inc., (v) the Management Agreement and (vi) the Company
Operating Partnership Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any
claims to receive the Class C Units to which they are entitled under the terms
of this Agreement (in each case, other than indemnification rights in favor of
the Company Advisor or its Affiliates that, as of the date hereof, exist under
such agreements). Prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, neither the Company Operating Partnership nor any other
Company Entity shall make any payment or distribution of any kind to the
Special Limited Partner, the Company Advisor, or any of their Affiliates
pursuant to the Listing Agreement, other than at the Closing as expressly
provided in Section 2(b) of the Listing Termination Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Public Announcements_. For so long as this Agreement is in
effect, the parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements or filings
with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and none of the parties shall issue any such press release or make any such
public statement or filing prior to obtaining the other parties consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without obtaining the other
parties consent, issue such press release or make such public statement or
filing as may be required by Law, Order or the applicable rules of any stock
exchange or the applicable provisions of any listing agreement of any party
hereto. If for any reason it is not practicable to consult with the other
party before making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby, then the party making such statement
shall not make a statement that is inconsistent with public statements or
filings to which the other party had previously consented; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that such consultation and

 



       
 

 



 

consent shall not be required with respect to any release, communication or
announcement specifically permitted without the other partys consent by
_Section 6.5_.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall provide
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for each Indemnitee,
which is at least as favorable in scope and amount to such Indemnitee as the
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provided to such
Indemnitee by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time in the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws or each of
the Company Subsidiaries respective articles or certificates of incorporation
or bylaws (or comparable organizational or governing documents) as the case
may be, as in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that such
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses covers actions or
omissions at or prior to the Effective Time, including all transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Without limiting or being limited by the provisions of _Section 6.10(a)_,
during the period commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to): (i) indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses
(including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any Action,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such
Action arises out of or pertains to (x) any action or omission or alleged
action or omission in such Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer,
partner, member, trustee, employee or agent of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, or (y) this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger; and (ii) pay in advance of the
final disposition of any such Action the expenses (including attorneys fees
and any expenses incurred by any Indemnitee in connection with enforcing any
rights with respect to indemnification) of any Indemnitee without the
requirement of any bond or other security, in each case to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, but subject to Parents and the Surviving Entitys receipt
of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount if
it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, Parent or the Surviving Entity (i) shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without their prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and (ii) shall not have
any obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee to the extent that a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order
that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in which case the
Indemnitee shall promptly refund to Parent or the Surviving Entity the amount
of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, in consultation with
Parent, or, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Entity as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the
non-cancellable extension of the coverage afforded by the Companys existing
directors and officers liability insurance policies and the Companys
existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO
Insurance_"), in each case, for a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any
claim related to any period of time at or prior to

 



      
 

 



 

the Effective Time from one or more insurance carriers with the same or better
Bests credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect
to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions and retentions that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the coverage provided under the Companys
existing policies and with limits of liability that are no lower than the
limits on the Companys existing policies as long as the annual premium in the
aggregate does not exceed in any one year three hundred percent (300%) of the
annual aggregate premium(s) under the Companys existing policies. If the
Company or the Surviving Entity for any reason fails to obtain such " _tail_ "
insurance policies as of the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Entity shall
continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof
with the Companys current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with
the same or better Bests credit rating as the Companys current insurance
carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof,
or (ii) Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide,
for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, the
Indemnitees who are insured under the Companys DandO Insurance with comparable
DandO Insurance that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier, that is no less
favorable in the aggregate than the existing policy of the Company (which may
be provided under Parents DandO Insurance policy) or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Entity shall not be
required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of (for any
one year) three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium paid by the
Company for such insurance as of the date hereof; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
Parent or the Surviving Entity shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.10_ applies are third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.10_. The provisions of this _Section 6.10_
shall be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her successors, heirs,
executors, trustees, fiduciaries, administrators or representatives. Parent
shall pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be
incurred by any Indemnitee in successfully enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this _Section 6.10_.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 6.10_ shall be in
addition to any rights such Person or any employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary may have under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent organizational or
governing documents) of any of the Company Subsidiaries, or the Surviving
Entity or any of its subsidiaries, or under any applicable Law or under any
agreement of any Indemnitee. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall
be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and
officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence

pay (a) any Cash Consideration and other amounts due by the Parent Parties
hereunder, (b) any Expenses and (c) the refinancing of the Company Credit
Agreement or any other Indebtedness of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries; _provided_ that such cooperation does not unreasonably interfere

breached or violated by any action taken by the Company at the request of any
Parent Party pursuant to this _Section 6.17_. Anything in this _Section

harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all damages, losses, costs,

Company Subsidiaries) and all other actions taken by the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives at the request of Parent
pursuant to this Section 6.17, except to the extent finally determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen from any Company Entitys or
their respective

 



      
 

 



 

Representatives fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct, intentional
misrepresentation or bad faith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
provided herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement, that Parent Entities and

close of business on the last Business Day prior to the Effective Time, in
each case, subject to funds being legally available therefor. The per share
dividend amount payable by the Company shall be an amount equal to (i) the
Companys most recent monthly dividend, multiplied by the number of days
elapsed since the last dividend record date through and including the day
prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs, and divided by the actual
number of days in the calendar month in which such dividend is declared, plus
(ii) if necessary to enable the Company to make aggregate dividend
distributions during its final taxable period equal to the Minimum
Distribution Dividend, an additional amount (the " _Company Additional
Dividend Amount_ ") necessary so that the aggregate dividend payable is equal
to the Minimum Distribution Dividend, plus (iii) the Parent Additional
Dividend Amount, if any, divided by the quotient of (A) one (1) divided by (B)
the Exchange Ratio. The per share dividend amount payable by Parent shall be
an amount equal to (i) Parents most recent quarterly dividend, multiplied by
the number of days elapsed since the last dividend record date through and

divided by the actual number of days in the calendar quarter in which such
dividend is declared, plus (ii) the Company Additional Dividend Amount, if

to make aggregate dividend distributions during the taxable year that includes
the Closing Date equal to the Minimum Distribution Dividend, an additional
amount (the " _Parent Additional Dividend Amount_ ") necessary so that the
aggregate dividend payable is equal to the Minimum Distribution Dividend. If
the Company determines it is necessary to declare the Additional Dividend
Amount, the Company shall notify Parent of such determination at least ten
(10) days prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 6.18(a)_, Parent shall not make, declare or set aside
any dividend or other distribution to its stockholders other than the
authorization and payment of (i) distributions at its stated dividend or

as may be approved by Parents board of directors from time to time).

 



 

(c) In the event that a distribution or dividend with respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock permitted under the terms of this Agreement has (i) a
record date prior to the Effective Time and (ii) has not been paid as of the
Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall be
entitled to receive such distribution or dividend from the Company at the time

or shall cause the applicable Company Subsidiary to, use reasonable best
efforts to deliver all notices and take other actions required to facilitate
the termination of commitments in respect of such Indebtedness, repayment in
full of all obligations in respect of such Indebtedness and release of any
Liens and guarantees in connection therewith on the Closing Date and (ii) the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent a customary
payoff letter with respect to the Company Credit Agreement and each such other
series of Indebtedness, executed by the lenders thereunder (or the applicable
agent thereunder on their behalf), in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date (or such later date as Parent may agree in writing, but in any
event, on or prior to the Closing Date), setting forth all amounts (including
the outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest and all prepayment,
defeasance or other fees and penalties) required to be paid by the Company or
any other Company Entity under the Company Credit Agreement to cause the
termination thereof on the Closing Date and the release of all Liens, if any,
in connection therewith on the assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or otherwise on the business or operations of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Funded Debt Payoff Amount_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Company Entity
shall be obligated, by virtue of this Agreement, to make any prepayments with
respect to the amounts outstanding under the Company Credit Agreement (i)
prior to the Closing Date and (ii) unless Parent or Merger Sub provides funds
to the Company in an amount sufficient to, or places in escrow or otherwise
pays on behalf of such Company Entity, the Funded Debt Payoff Amount.

 



 

Section 6.20 _Partnership Agreement_. Within twenty (20) Business Days after

faith and use their reasonable best efforts to revise the existing Company
Partnership Agreement in a manner consistent with _Exhibit A_, which
agreement shall become the limited partnership agreement of the Surviving

conditions set forth in either _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ would
not be satisfied; or

 



 

(ii) (x) the Company Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change or
(y) the Company shall have materially breached its obligations under _Section
6.5_ or its obligations pursuant to the third sentence of _Section 6.3(c)_,
which material breach, in each case in this clause (y), if curable by the
Company, shall not have been fully cured by the Company within five (5)
calendar days following the Companys receipt of written notice of such
material breach ( _provided_ that any material breach pursuant to this clause
(y) that results in an Acquisition Proposal that is publicly disclosed shall
not be curable).

 



 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are abandoned pursuant to _Section 8.1_, written notice thereof
shall be given to the other party or parties, specifying the provisions hereof
pursuant to which such termination is made and describing the basis therefor
in reasonable detail, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void
and of no further force or effect whatsoever without liability on the part of
any party hereto (or any of the other Company Entities, the other Parent
Entities or any of the Companys or Parents respective Representatives), and
all rights and obligations of any party hereto shall cease; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary,
(a) no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or
damages resulting from or arising out of any fraud or willful and intentional
breach of this Agreement and (b) the Confidentiality Agreement, this _Section
8.2_, _Section 8.3_, _Section 8.6_, _Article IX_ and the definitions of all
defined terms appearing in such sections shall survive any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_. If this Agreement is terminated as
provided herein, all filings, applications and other submissions made pursuant
to this Agreement, to the extent practicable, shall be withdrawn from the
Governmental Authority or other Person to which they were made.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) If, but only if, the Agreement is terminated:

 



 

(i) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or by
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ and (A) in the case of a termination
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_, the Company Stockholder Approval shall not
have been obtained prior to such termination, and (B) in any such case (x)
after the date of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made
to the Company or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention
(whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
the Company (and such Acquisition Proposal or publicly announced intention
shall not have been publicly withdrawn without qualification before such
termination), and (y) the Company, within twelve (12) months of the
termination of this Agreement, consummates a transaction regarding, or
executes a definitive agreement with respect to, an Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to in clause
(x)), then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent, the
Termination Fee, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated
by Parent, not later than the earlier of the execution of a definitive
agreement with respect to and the consummation of such transaction arising
from such Acquisition Proposal; provided, however,

 



      
 

 



 

that for purposes of this _Section 8.3(a)(i)_, the references to "fifteen
percent (15%)" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
references to "fifty percent (50%)"; or

 



 

(ii) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, the
Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Parent Expense Amount
(by wire transfer to an account designated by Parent) within two (2) Business
Days of such termination; or

 



 

(iii) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, and
(x) after the date of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
made to the Company or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention
(whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
the Company (and such Acquisition Proposal or publicly announced intention
shall not have been publicly withdrawn without qualification before the
Company Stockholder Meeting), and (y) the Company, within twelve (12) months
of the termination of this Agreement, consummates a transaction regarding, or
executes a definitive agreement with respect to, an Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to in clause
(x)), then the Company shall pay or cause to be paid, to Parent the
Termination Fee (less, if previously paid pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_
above, the Parent Expense Amount), by wire transfer of same day funds to an
account designated by Parent, not later than the earlier of the execution of a
definitive agreement with respect to and the consummation of such transaction
arising from such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that for
purposes of this _Section 8.3(a)(iii)_, the references to "fifteen percent
(15%)" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
references to "fifty percent (50%)"; or

 



 

(iv) by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_, then the Company shall
pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Termination Fee, by wire transfer of
same day funds to an account designated by Parent as a condition to the
effectiveness of such termination; or

 



 

(v) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ (or by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ and at the time of such termination Parent would have
been permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_)
then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Termination
Fee, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent,
within two (2) Business Days of such termination.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that:

 



 

(i) under no circumstances shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Payment earlier than one (1) full Business Day after receipt of
appropriate wire transfer instructions from the party entitled to payment; and

 



 

(ii) under no circumstances shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 



 

(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) the Termination Payment is not a penalty, but is
liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the
circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and

 



      
 

 



 

resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these agreements,
Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails
to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the payment of any amount set forth in this _Section
8.3_, the Company shall pay Parent its costs and Expenses in connection with
such suit, together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of five
percent (5%) for the period from the date such payment was required to be made
through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is
the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

(d) (i) If the Company (the " _Termination Payor_ ") is required to pay
Parent (the " _Termination Payee_ ") the Termination Payment such Termination
Payment shall be paid into escrow on the date such payment is required to be
paid by the Termination Payor pursuant to this Agreement by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an escrow account designated in accordance with
this _Section 8.3(d)_. In the event that the Termination Payor is obligated
to pay the Termination Payee the Termination Payment, the amount payable to
the Termination Payee in any tax year of the Termination Payee shall not
exceed the lesser of (i) the Termination Payment payable to the Termination
Payee, and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to the
Termination Payee without causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the
requirements of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax
year, determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income
described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (" _Qualifying
Income_ ") and the Termination Payee has $1,000,000 of income from unknown
sources during such year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any
known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in each case, as
determined by the Termination Payees independent accountants, plus (B) in the
event the Termination Payee receives either (x) a letter from the Termination
Payees counsel indicating that the Termination Payee has received a ruling
from the IRS as described below in this _Section 8.3(d)_ or (y) an opinion
from the Termination Payees outside counsel as described below in this
_Section 8.3(d)_, an amount equal to the excess of the Termination Payment
less the amount payable under clause (A) above.

 



 

(ii) To secure the Termination Payors obligation to pay these amounts, the
Termination Payor shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the
Termination Payment with an escrow agent selected by the Termination Payor on
such terms (subject to this _Section 8.3(d)_) as shall be mutually agreed
upon by the Termination Payor, the Termination Payee and the escrow agent. The
payment or deposit into escrow of the Termination Payment pursuant to this
_Section 8.3(d)_ shall be made at the time the Termination Payor is obligated
to pay the Termination Payee such amount pursuant to _Section 8.3_ by wire
transfer. The escrow agreement shall provide that the Termination Payment in
escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to the Termination Payee
unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i)
a letter from the Termination Payees independent accountants indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Termination Payee
without causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such
amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and

 



      
 

 



 

the Termination Payee has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during
such year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or
anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in which case the escrow
agent shall release such amount to the Termination Payee, or (ii) a letter
from the Termination Payees counsel indicating that (A) the Termination Payee
received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the Termination
Payee of the Termination Payment would either constitute Qualifying Income or
would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code or (B) the Termination Payees outside counsel has
rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Termination
Payee of the Termination Payment should either constitute Qualifying Income or
should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release the
remainder of the Termination Payment to the Termination Payee. The Termination
Payor agrees to amend this _Section 8.3(d)_ at the reasonable request of the
Termination Payee in order to (i) maximize the portion of the Termination
Payment that may be distributed to the Termination Payee hereunder without
causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, or (ii) assist the Termination Payee in
obtaining a favorable ruling or legal opinion from its outside counsel, in
each case, as described in this _Section 8.3(d)_. Any amount of the
Termination Payment that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall
be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the
foregoing limitations of this _Section 8.3(d)_.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto by action
taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors (or similar
governing body or entity) at any time before or after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not
be (a) any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of
the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of
Company Common Stock, or which by applicable Law or in accordance with the
rules of any stock exchange requires the further approval of the stockholders
of the Company without such further approval of such stockholders, or (b) any
amendment or change not permitted under applicable Law. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties
hereto.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to
applicable Law, the Parent Parties, on the one hand, and the Company and the
Company Operating Partnership, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for
the performance of any obligation or other act of the others, (b) waive any
inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the others contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject to the
proviso of _Section 8.4_, waive compliance with any agreement of the others
or any condition of such parties contained herein. Any agreement on the part
of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company,
the Company Operating Partnership, Parent, OP Merger Sub or Merger Sub in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of
any other right hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.6 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such Expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and
Parent shall share equally all Expenses related to the printing and filing of
the Form S-4 and the printing, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement,
other than attorneys and accountants fees.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Transfer Taxes_. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,
transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any transfer, recording,
registration and other fees and any similar taxes that become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together with
any related interests, penalties or additions to Tax, " _Transfer Taxes_ "),
and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes.
From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall pay or cause to
be paid, without deduction or withholding from any consideration or amounts
payable to holders of the Company Common Stock, all Transfer Taxes.

termination, as set forth in _Section 8.2_), whether such liability has

Consequently, in the event

 



       
 

 



 

an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. References to
"this Agreement" shall include the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article,
Section, Appendix, Annex or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or
Section of, or an Appendix, Annex or Exhibit to, this Agreement, unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings for this Agreement are

interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used
in any certificate or other instrument made or delivered pursuant hereto
unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement

permitted assigns. All references to "dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the
United States of America (unless otherwise expressly provided herein).

 



 

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future
Law or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
and (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect promptly the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Assignment; Delegation_. Other than to the Surviving Entity,
neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or obligations hereunder
shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits,
Annexes and Appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except
for the provisions of _Section 6.10_ (from and after the Effective Time),
which shall be to the benefit of the parties referred to in such section. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 8.5_
without notice or liability to any other Person. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Accordingly, Persons other than the parties
hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to seek an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile
transmission or by e-mail of a pdf attachment shall be effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

contract, tort or otherwise), directly or indirectly, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the actions of the parties hereto in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Maryland, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Laws provision or
rule (whether of the State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Maryland.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

any other manner permitted by Law, (ii) consents to submit itself to the

judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
