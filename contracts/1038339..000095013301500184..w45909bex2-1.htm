  C. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, immediately prior to the Merger, EOP Partnership and Spieker Partnership shall execute a Certificate of Merger (the "Delaware Certificate of Merger") in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ and shall file such Delaware Certificate of Merger in accordance with Delaware law to effectuate the Partnership Merger.

  F. For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and that this Agreement shall constitute a plan of reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.  

  G. For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Partnership Merger, regardless of form, be treated as a contribution by Spieker Partnership of all of its assets to EOP Partnership in exchange for partnership interests in EOP Partnership, as provided for herein, under Section 721 of the Code, and a distribution of such partnership interests by Spieker Partnership to its partners under Section 731 of the Code.

surrender the Merger Consideration, without interest, into which the shares
of Spieker Common Stock or any series of Spieker Preferred Stock heretofore

Exchange, at the liquidation preference (excluding unpaid dividends) per
Equity Office Preferred Share). To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Equity Office or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be

of the shares of Spieker Common Stock or a series of Spieker Preferred Stock,
as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by Equity Office or the Exchange Agent.

All of the Spieker SEC Documents (other than preliminary material), as of their respective filing dates, complied in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and, in each case, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to such Spieker SEC Documents. None of the Spieker SEC Documents at the time of filing contained, nor will any report, schedule, form, statement or other document filed by Spieker or Spieker Partnership after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The consolidated financial statements of Spieker included in the Spieker SEC Documents or of Spieker Partnership included in the Spieker SEC Documents complied, or will comply, as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been or will be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented, or will fairly present, in all material respects in accordance with the applicable requirements of GAAP and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, the consolidated financial position of Spieker and its Subsidiaries or Spieker Partnership and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, in each case, taken as a whole, as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q under the    Exchange Act). Except as set forth in _Schedule 2.6(b) _to the Spieker
Disclosure Letter, Spieker has no Subsidiaries which are not consolidated for
accounting purposes. Except for liabilities and obligations set forth in the
Spieker SEC Documents or in _Schedule 2.6(c) _to the Spieker Disclosure
Letter, none of Spieker, any Spieker Subsidiary or Spieker TRS has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated

in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Spieker Material
Adverse Effect.

  (d) Except as set forth in _Schedule 2.9(d) _to the Spieker Disclosure Letter, none of Spieker, any Spieker Subsidiary or Spieker TRS has received any written or published notice to the effect that (i) any condemnation or involuntary rezoning proceedings are pending or threatened with respect to any of the Spieker Properties or (ii) any zoning, building or similar law, code, ordinance, order or regulation is or will be violated by the continued maintenance, operation or use of any buildings or other improvements on any of the Spieker Properties or by the continued maintenance, operation or use of the parking areas which would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on such Spieker Property. Except as set forth in _Schedule 2.9(d) _to the Spieker Disclosure Letter, (i) all work required to be performed, payments required to be made and actions required to be taken prior to the date hereof pursuant to any agreement entered into with a governmental body or authority in connection with a site approval, zoning reclassification or other similar action relating to any Spieker Properties ( _e.g._ , Local Improvement District, Road Improvement District, Environmental Mitigation (as defined herein)) have been performed, paid or taken, as the case may be, and (ii) Spieker has no Knowledge of any planned or proposed work, payments or actions that may be required after the date hereof pursuant to such agreements, in each of case (i) and (ii) except as set forth in development or operating budgets for such Spieker Properties delivered to Equity Office and EOP Partnership prior to the date hereof and other than those which would not reasonably be expected to have a Spieker Material Adverse Effect.

Except as set forth in a delinquency report made available to Equity Office, none of Spieker, any Spieker Subsidiary or Spieker TRS, on the one hand, nor, to the knowledge of Spieker or Spieker Partnership, any other party, on the other hand, is in monetary default under any Spieker Space Lease, except for such defaults that would not reasonably be expected to have a Spieker Material Adverse Effect.  

  (f) _Schedule 2.9(f) _contains a true and complete list, by type of insurance, carrier, coverages (including limits) and term, of all material policies of casualty, liability and other types of insurance (except title insurance) carried by Spieker or any Spieker Subsidiary.

at, on or \tunder any of the Spieker Properties, in each of the
foregoing \tcases, such that the presence of such Hazardous
Materials \t(including the presence of asbestos in any buildings
or \timprovements at the Spieker Properties) would, individually or \tin the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Spieker \tMaterial Adverse
Effect;  
   \t

Hazardous \tMaterials at, on, under or from (A) the Spieker Properties \tor

   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(iv) Spieker, the Spieker Subsidiaries and Spieker
TRS \thave been duly issued, and currently have and will maintain \tthrough

required under any Environmental Law \t(collectively, the "Environmental
Permits") necessary \tto operate their businesses as currently operated
except where \tthe failure to obtain and maintain such Environmental
Permit \twould not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be \texpected to have a Spieker Material Adverse Effect. Spieker,
the \tSpieker Subsidiaries and Spieker TRS have timely filed \tapplications
for all Environmental Permits. All of the \tEnvironmental Permits are
transferable and none require consent, \tnotification or other action to
remain in full force and effect \tfollowing consummation of the transactions

  (c) Spieker has previously delivered or made available to Equity Office complete copies of all material information, documents and reports, including, without limitation, environmental investigations and testing or analysis that are in the possession or control of any of Spieker, the Spieker Subsidiaries and Spieker TRS and which relate to compliance with Environmental Laws by any of them or to the past or current environmental condition of the Spieker Properties.    2.11 _Related Party Transactions._ Set forth in  _Schedule 2.11 _to the Spieker Disclosure Letter is a list of all material arrangements, agreements and contracts entered into by Spieker, any Spieker Subsidiary and Spieker TRS which are in effect and which are with (a) any investment banker or financial advisor, in each case, relating to any obligation to make, or which could result in the making of, any payment (except pursuant to indemnification obligations), (b) any Person who is an officer, director or Affiliate (as defined herein) of Spieker or any Spieker Subsidiary or Spieker TRS, any relative of any of the foregoing or any entity of which any of the foregoing is an Affiliate or (c) any Person who acquired Spieker Common Stock, Spieker OP Units or any series of Spieker Preferred OP Units or Spieker Preferred Stock in a private placement. Such documents, copies of all of which have previously been delivered or made available to Equity Office, are listed in _Schedule 2.11 _to the Spieker Disclosure Letter. As used in this Agreement, the term "Affiliate" shall have the same meaning as such term is defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act.  

  2.12 _Employee Benefits._ As used herein, the term "Employee Plan" includes any pension, retirement, savings, disability, medical, dental, health, life, death benefit, group insurance, profit sharing, deferred compensation, stock option, bonus, incentive, vacation pay, tuition reimbursement, severance pay, or other employee benefit plan, trust, agreement, contract, agreement, policy or commitment (including, without limitation, any pension plan, as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder ("ERISA") ("Pension Plan"), and any welfare plan as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA ("Welfare Plan")), whether any of the foregoing is funded, insured or self-funded, written or oral, (i) sponsored or maintained by Spieker, any Spieker Subsidiary or Spieker TRS (each, a "Controlled Group Member") and covering any Controlled Group Members active or former employees (or their beneficiaries), (ii) to which any Controlled Group Member is a party or by which any Controlled Group Member (or any of the rights, properties or assets thereof) is bound or (iii) with respect to which any current Controlled Group Member may otherwise have any material liability (whether or not such Controlled Group Member still maintains such Employee Plan). Each Employee Plan is listed on _Schedule 2.12 _to the Spieker Disclosure Letter. Except as disclosed in  _Schedule 2.12 _to the Spieker Disclosure Letter, with respect to the Employee Plans:  

  (a) No Controlled Group Member has any continuing liability under any Welfare Plan which provides for continuing benefits or coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a participant after such participants termination of employment, except as may be required by Section 4980B of the Code or Section 601 (et seq.) of ERISA, or under any applicable state law, and at the expense of the participant or the beneficiary of the participant.  

  (b) Each Employee Plan complies in all material respects with the applicable requirements of ERISA and any other applicable law governing such Employee Plan, and, to the Knowledge of Spieker, each Employee Plan has at all times been properly administered in all material respects in accordance with all such requirements of law, and in accordance with its terms and the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement to the extent consistent with all such requirements of law. Each Pension Plan which is intended to be qualified is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS stating that such Plan meets the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code and that the trust associated with such Plan is tax-exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code and, to the Knowledge of Spieker, no event has occurred which would jeopardize the qualified status of any such plan or the tax exempt status of any such trust under Sections 401(a) and Section 501(a) of the Code, respectively. No lawsuits, claims (other than routine claims for benefits) or formal complaints to, or by, any Person or governmental entity have been filed, are pending or, to the Knowledge of Spieker, threatened with respect to any Employee Plan and, to the Knowledge of Spieker, there is no fact or contemplated event which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any such lawsuit, claim (other than routine claims for benefits) or complaint with respect to any Pension Plan. Without limiting the foregoing, the following are true with respect to each Employee Plan: 

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(i) all Controlled Group Members have complied in
all \tmaterial respects with the reporting and disclosure requirements \tof
ERISA, the Code, or both, with respect to each Employee Plan \tand no
Controlled Group Member has incurred any material \tliability in connection
with such reporting or disclosure;       \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(ii) all contributions and payments with respect
to \tEmployee Plans that are required to be made by a Controlled \tGroup
Member with respect to periods ending on or before the \tClosing Date
(including periods from the first day of the \tcurrent plan or policy year to
the Closing Date) have been, or \twill be, made or accrued before the Closing
Date in accordance \twith the appropriate plan document, actuarial report,
collective \tbargaining agreements or insurance contracts or arrangements
or \tas otherwise required by ERISA or the Code; and  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(iii) with respect to each such Employee Plan, to
the \textent applicable, Spieker has delivered to or has made \tavailable to
Equity Office true and complete copies of \t(A) plan documents, or any and
all other documents that \testablish the existence of the plan, trust,
arrangement, \tcontract, policy or commitment and all amendments
thereto, \t(B) the most recent determination letter, if any, received \tfrom
the IRS, (C) the three most recent Form 5500 \tAnnual Reports (and all
schedules and reports relating thereto) \tand actuarial reports and (D) all
related trust agreements, \tinsurance contract or other funding agreements
that implement \teach such Employee Plan.  
    

  (c) With respect to each Employee Plan, to the Knowledge of Spieker, there has not occurred, and no Person is contractually bound to enter into, any "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 4975(c) of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, which transaction is not exempt under Section 4975(d) of the Code or Section 408 of ERISA and which could subject Spieker or any Controlled Group Member to material liability.  

  (d) No Controlled Group Member has maintained or been obligated to contribute to any Employee Plan subject to Code Section 412 or Title IV of ERISA. No Employee Plan subject to Code Section 412 or Title IV of ERISA has been terminated.  

  (e) With respect to each Pension Plan maintained by any Controlled Group Member, such Plan provides the Plan Sponsor the authority to amend or terminate the Plan at any time, subject to applicable requirements of ERISA and the Code.  

  2.13 _Employee Policies._ The employee handbooks of Spieker, the Spieker Subsidiaries and Spieker TRS currently in effect have been delivered to Equity Office and fairly and accurately summarize in all material respects all material employee policies, vacation policies and payroll policies.  

  2.14 _Taxes._   

  (a) Each of Spieker, the Spieker Subsidiaries and Spieker TRS (A) has filed all Tax returns and reports required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any filing extension properly granted by a Governmental Entity having authority to do so) and all such returns and reports are accurate and complete in all material respects, (B) has paid (or Spieker has paid on its behalf) all Taxes (as defined herein) shown on such returns and reports as required to be paid by it, and (C) has complied in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes (including, without limitation, withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446, 3121, and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under any foreign laws) and has, within the time period prescribed by law, withheld and paid over to the proper governmental entities all amounts required to be so withheld and paid over under applicable laws and regulations, except, with respect to all of the foregoing, where the failure to file such tax returns and reports or failure to pay such Taxes or failure to comply with such withholding requirements would not reasonably be expected to have a Spieker Material Adverse Effect. The most recent audited financial statements contained in the Spieker SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve for all material Taxes payable by Spieker, the Spieker Subsidiaries and Spieker TRS for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of such financial statements. Since the Spieker Financial Statement Date, Spieker has incurred no liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, including without limitation any Tax arising from a prohibited transaction described in Section 857(b)(6) of the Code, and none of Spieker, any Spieker Subsidiary or Spieker TRS has incurred any material liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business. No event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists, which presents a material risk that any material Tax described in the preceding sentences will be imposed upon Spieker, any Spieker Subsidiary, or Spieker TRS. None of Spieker, any Spieker Subsidiary or Spieker TRS is    the subject of any audit, examination, or other proceeding in respect of
federal income Taxes, and to Spiekers Knowledge, no audit, examination or
other proceeding in respect of federal income Taxes involving any of Spieker,
any Spieker Subsidiary, or Spieker TRS is being considered by any
Tax authority. To the Knowledge of Spieker, no deficiencies for any Taxes
have been proposed, asserted or assessed against Spieker, any Spieker
Subsidiary or Spieker TRS, and no requests for waivers of the time to assess
any such Taxes are pending. As used in this Agreement, "Taxes" shall include
all taxes, charges, fees, levies and other assessments, including, without
limitation, income, gross receipts, excise, property, sales, withholding
(including, without limitation, dividend withholding and withholding required
pursuant to Sections 1445 and 1446 of the Code), social
security, occupation, use, service, license, payroll, franchise,
transfer and recording taxes, fees and charges, including estimated taxes,
imposed by the United States or any taxing authority (domestic or foreign),
whether computed on a separate, consolidated, unitary, combined or any other
basis, and any interest, fines, penalties or additional amounts
attributable to, or imposed upon, or with respect to any such taxes,
charges, fees, levies or other assessments. 

  

  (b) Spieker (i) for all taxable years for which the Internal Revenue Service could assert a tax liability, has been subject to taxation as a real estate investment trust (a "REIT") within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code and has satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT for all such years, (ii) has operated since December 31, 2000 to the date of this representation, and intends to continue to operate, in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT for the taxable year ending on the earlier of December 31, 2001 or the Closing Date and, if later, for the taxable year of Spieker ending on the Closing Date, and (iii) has not taken or omitted to take any action which would reasonably be expected to result in a challenge to its status as a REIT and, to Spiekers Knowledge, no such challenge is pending or threatened.

Equity Office has delivered to Spieker complete and correct copies of the Equity Office Declaration of Trust and the Equity Office Bylaws, as amended or supplemented to the date of this Agreement.

None of the Equity Office SEC Documents at the time of filing contained, nor will any report, schedule, form, statement or other document filed by Equity Office or EOP Partnership after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The consolidated financial statements of Equity Office and the Equity Office Subsidiaries included in the Equity Office SEC Documents complied, or will comply, as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been or will be prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented, or will fairly present, in all material respects in accordance with the applicable requirements of GAAP and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, the consolidated financial position of Equity Office and the Equity Office Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q    under the Exchange Act). Except for liabilities and obligations set forth
in the Equity Office SEC Documents or in  _Schedule 3.6_ to the Equity
Office Disclosure Letter, neither Equity Office nor any Equity Office
Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth
on a consolidated balance sheet of Equity Office or in the notes thereto and
which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have
an Equity Office Material Adverse Effect.

  (a) Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.9(a)_ to the Equity Office Disclosure Letter, Equity Office or one of the Equity Office Subsidiaries owns fee simple title to each of the real properties listed in the Equity Office SEC Filings as owned by it (the "Equity Office Properties"), except where the failure to own such title would not have an Equity Office Material Adverse Effect.

  (c) Valid policies of title insurance (or fully paid and enforceable commitments therefor) have been issued insuring Equity Offices or the applicable Equity Office Subsidiarys fee simple title or leasehold estate, as the case may be, to the Equity Office Properties in amounts which are, except in the case of San Felipe    Plaza, approximately equal to the purchase price thereof paid by Equity
Office or the applicable Equity Office Subsidiaries therefor, except where
the failure to obtain such title insurance would not reasonably be expected
to have an Equity Office Material Adverse Effect. 

  

  (d) Equity Office has no Knowledge (i) that it has failed to obtain a certificate, permit or license from any governmental authority having jurisdiction over any of the Equity Office Properties where such failure would reasonably be expected to have an Equity Office Material Adverse Effect or of any pending threat of modification or cancellation of any of the same which would reasonably be expected to have an Equity Office Material Adverse Effect, (ii) of any written notice of any violation of any federal, state or municipal law, ordinance, order, rule, regulation or requirement affecting any of the Equity Office Properties issued by any governmental authorities which would reasonably be expected to have an Equity Office Material Adverse Effect or (iii) of any structural defects relating to Equity Office Properties, Equity Office Properties whose building systems are not in working order, physical damage to any Equity Office Property for which there is not insurance in effect covering the cost of the restoration and the lost revenue (subject to a reasonable deduction or retention limit), except such structural defects, building systems not in working order and physical damage, which, in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have an Equity Office Material Adverse Effect.

  (g) The rent roll previously provided by Equity Office to Spieker (the "Equity Office Rent Roll") lists each Equity Office Space Lease (as defined herein) in effect as of the respective dates indicated in the Equity Office Rent Roll and, except for omissions or discrepancies that, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have an Equity Office Material Adverse Effect, all information set forth in the Equity Office Rent Roll is true, correct, and complete as of the date thereof. "Equity Office Space Lease" means each lease or other right of occupancy affecting or relating to a property in which EOP Partnership (or an entity in which it directly or indirectly has an interest) is the landlord, either pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement or as successor to any prior landlord, but excluding any ground lease. Equity Office has made available to Spieker true, correct and complete copies of all Equity Office Space Leases, including all amendments, modifications, supplements, renewals, extensions and guarantees related thereto, as of the date hereof.

All such policies are in full force and    effect and neither Equity Office nor any Equity Office Subsidiary has
received from any insurance company notice of any material defects or
deficiencies affecting the insurability of Equity Office or any Equity Office
Subsidiary or any of their respective assets thereunder. 

  

  3.10 _Environmental Matters._   

  Except as disclosed in the Equity Office SEC Documents,  

  (i) none of Equity Office, any of the Equity Office Subsidiaries or, to Equity Offices Knowledge, any other Person has caused or permitted the presence of any Hazardous Materials at, on or under any of the Equity Office Properties, such that the presence of such Hazardous Materials (including the presence of asbestos in any buildings or improvements at the Equity Office Properties) would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an Equity Office Material Adverse Effect;  

  (ii) except in accordance with the Environmental Permits, there have been no Releases of Hazardous Materials at, on, under or from (A) the Equity Office Properties, or (B) any real property formerly owned, operated or leased by Equity Office or the Equity Office Subsidiaries during the period of such ownership, operation or tenancy, which would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an Equity Office Material Adverse Effect;  

  (iii) (y) Equity Office and the Equity Office Subsidiaries have not failed to comply in any material respect with all Environmental Laws, and (z) neither Equity Office nor any of the Equity Office Subsidiaries has any liability under the Environmental Laws, except in each of cases (y) and (z) to the extent such failure to comply or any such liability, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have an Equity Office Material Adverse Effect; and  

  (iv) Equity Office and the Equity Office Subsidiaries have been duly issued, and currently have and will maintain through the Closing Date, all Environmental Permits except where the failure to obtain and maintain such Environmental Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an Equity Office Material Adverse Effect. Equity Office and the Equity Office Subsidiaries have timely filed applications for all Environmental Permits.  

  3.11 _Taxes._   

  (a) Each of Equity Office and the Equity Office Subsidiaries (i) has filed all Tax returns and reports required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any filing extension properly granted by a Governmental Entity having authority to do so), and all such returns and reports are accurate and complete in all material respects, (ii) has paid (or Equity Office has paid on its behalf) all Taxes shown on such returns and reports as required to be paid by it and (iii) has complied in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes (including, without limitation, withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446, 3121, and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under any foreign laws) and has, within the time period prescribed by law, withheld and paid over to the proper governmental entities all amounts required to be so withheld and paid over under applicable laws and regulations, except, with respect to all of the foregoing, where the failure to file such tax returns or reports or failure to pay such Taxes or failure to comply with such requirements would not reasonably be expected to have an Equity Office Material Adverse Effect. The most recent audited financial statements contained in the Equity Office SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve for all material Taxes payable by Equity Office and the Equity Office Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of such financial statements. Since the Equity Office Financial Statement Date, Equity Office has incurred no liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, including without limitation any Tax arising from a prohibited transaction described in Section 857(b)(6) of the Code, and neither Equity Office nor any Equity Office Subsidiary has incurred any material liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business. No event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists, which presents a material risk that any material Tax described in the preceding sentence will be imposed upon Equity Office or any Equity Office Subsidiary. Neither Equity Office nor any Equity Office Subsidiary is the subject of any audit, examination, or other proceeding in respect of federal income Taxes, and to Equity Offices Knowledge, no audit, examination or other proceeding in respect of federal income Taxes involving any of Equity Office or any Equity Office    Subsidiary is being considered by any Tax authority. To the Knowledge of
Equity Office, no deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or
assessed against Equity Office or any of the Equity Office Subsidiaries, and
no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes are pending. 

  

  (b) Equity Office (i) for all taxable years commencing with 1997, which was the first year of its operations, through December 31, 2000, has been subject to taxation as a REIT within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code and has qualified as a REIT for all such years, (ii) has operated since December 31, 2000 to the date of this representation, and intends to continue to operate, in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date and (iii) has not taken or omitted to take any action which would reasonably be expected to result in a challenge to its status as a REIT and, to Equity Offices Knowledge, no such challenge is pending or threatened. Each Equity Office Subsidiary which is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company either (A)(i) has been treated since its formation and continues to be treated for federal income tax purposes either as a partnership or as an entity that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes and not as a corporation or as an association taxable as a corporation and (ii) has not since the later of its formation or the acquisition by Equity Office of a direct or indirect interest therein, owned any assets (including, without limitation, securities) that would cause Equity Office to violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code or (B)(i) met the conditions set forth in clause (A)(i) and (A)(ii) as of December 31, 2000 and (ii) as of March 31, 2001, will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a corporation and will qualify as a taxable REIT Subsidiary under Section 856(l) of the Code. EOP Partnership is not a publicly traded partnership within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code that is taxable as a corporation pursuant to Section 7704(a) of the Code. Each Equity Office Subsidiary which is a corporation (1) has been since its formation a qualified REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code or (2) as of March 31, 2001 will qualify as a taxable REIT subsidiary under Section 856(1) of the Code. Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.11 _to the Equity Office Disclosure Letter, neither Equity Office nor any Equity Office Subsidiary holds any asset (x) the disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to Section 1374 of the Code as a result of an election under IRS Notice 88-19 or Temporary Treas. Reg. §1.337(d)-5T or (y) which is subject to a consent filed pursuant to Section 341(f) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.  

  (c) To Equity Offices knowledge, as of the date hereof, Equity Office is a "domestically-controlled REIT" within the meaning of Section 897(h)(4)(B) of the Code.  

  3.12 _Brokers; Schedule of Fees and Expenses._ No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person, other than Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Equity Office and are described in the engagement letter dated February 16, 2001, between Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated and Equity Office, a true, correct and complete copy of which has previously been given to Spieker, is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Equity Office or any Equity Office Subsidiary.  

  3.13 _Compliance with Laws._ Neither Equity Office nor any of the Equity Office Subsidiaries has violated or failed to comply with any statute, law, ordinance, regulation, rule, judgment, decree or order of any Governmental Entity applicable to its business, properties or operations, except in each case to the extent that such violation or failure would not reasonably be expected to have an Equity Office Material Adverse Effect.  

  3.14 _Contracts; Debt Instruments._ Neither Equity Office nor any Equity Office Subsidiary has received a written notice that Equity Office or any Equity Office Subsidiary is in violation of or in default under (nor to the Knowledge of Equity Office does there exist any condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would cause such a violation of or default under) any material loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, permit, concession, franchise, license or any other material contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding, to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties or assets is bound, nor to the Knowledge of Equity Office does such a violation or default exist, except to the extent such violation or default, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have an Equity Office Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in the Equity Office SEC Documents or in  _Schedule 3.14_ to the Equity Office Disclosure Letter.    3.15 _Opinion of Financial Advisor._ Equity Office has received the opinion of Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated, Equity Offices financial advisor, to the effect that the consideration to be paid by Equity Office in connection with the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to Equity Office.  

  3.16 _State Takeover Statutes._ Equity Office has taken all action necessary to exempt the transactions contemplated by this Agreement between Equity Office and Spieker and its Affiliates from the operation of Takeover Statutes.  

  3.17 _Investment Company Act of 1940._ Neither Equity Office nor any of the Equity Office Subsidiaries is, or at the Effective Time will be, required to be registered under the 1940 Act.  

  3.18 _Definition of "Knowledge of Equity Office"._ As used in this Agreement, the phrase "Knowledge of Equity Office" (or words of similar import) means the actual knowledge of those individuals identified in _Schedule 3.18_ to the Equity Office Disclosure Letter.  

  3.19 _Required Shareholder Approvals and Partner Approvals._ The affirmative vote of the holders of not less than a majority of all votes entitled to be cast by holders of Equity Office Common Shares, and the affirmative vote of the partners of EOP Partnership holding at least a majority of the outstanding Partnership Units (as defined in the EOP Partnership Agreement) (including Partnership Units held by Equity Office), are the only votes of the holders of any class or series of Equity Office capital shares or EOP Partnership limited partners necessary or required under this Agreement or under applicable law to approve the Merger, this Agreement and the Proposed Equity Office Charter Amendments. The approval of the Partnership Merger by Equity Office is the only vote necessary or required under this Agreement or under applicable law to approve the Partnership Merger under the EOP Partnership Agreement.

Each of Equity Office and EOP Partnership shall timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder, and it will take such further action as any Rule 145 Affiliate of Spieker or Equity Office may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Rule 145 Affiliate to sell shares of beneficial interest of Equity Office received by such Rule 145 Affiliate in the Merger without registration under the Securities Act pursuant to (i) Rule 145(d)(1) under the Securities Act, as such rule may be amended from to time, or (ii) any successor rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC.  

  4.5 _Other Actions._ Each of Spieker and Spieker Partnership, on the one hand, and Equity Office and EOP Partnership, on the other hand, shall not take, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective Subsidiaries not to take, any action that would result in (i) any of the representations and warranties of such party (without giving effect to any "knowledge" qualification) set forth in this Agreement that are qualified as to materiality becoming untrue, (ii) any of such representations and warranties (without giving effect to any "knowledge" qualification) that are not so qualified becoming untrue in any material respect or (iii) except as expressly required by Section 4.3, any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article 6 not being satisfied.

  (c) Spieker and Spieker Partnership shall give prompt notice to Equity Office and EOP Partnership, and Equity Office and EOP Partnership shall give prompt notice to Spieker and Spieker Partnership, (i) if any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becomes untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified becomes untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) of the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.  

  5.4 _Tax Matters._   

  (a) Each of Equity Office and Spieker shall use its commercially reasonable efforts before and after the Effective Time to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Sections 368(a) of the Code and to obtain the opinions of counsel referred to in Sections 6.2(e) and 6.3(e).  

  (b) In connection with the Partnership Merger, EOP Partnership shall adopt an amendment to the EOP Partnership Agreement substantially in the form set forth as  _Exhibit K _hereto addressing certain federal income tax matters affecting the holders of Spieker OP Units who will receive Equity Office OP Units in the Partnership Merger.

Spieker will consult with Equity Office before issuing, and provide Equity Office the opportunity to review and comment upon, any material press release or other written public statement, including, without limitation, any press release or other written public statement which addresses in any manner the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such written public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange.

Equity Office shall pay or cause EOP Partnership, as appropriate, to pay or
cause to be paid, without deduction or withholding from any amounts payable
to the holders of Equity Office Common Shares or Equity Office OP Units, as
applicable, all Transfer and Gains Taxes (which term shall not in any event
be construed to include for these purposes any Tax imposed under the Code). 

  

  5.8 _Benefit Plans and Other Employee Arrangements._   

  (a) _Benefit Plans._ After the Effective Time, all employees of Spieker who are employed by the Surviving Trust shall be eligible to participate in the same manner as other similarly situated employees of the Surviving Trust who were formerly employees of Equity Office in any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, sponsored or maintained by the Surviving Trust after the Effective Time or, if Equity Office determines it is not practicable for such employees to do so immediately after the Effective Time, then such employees shall continue to be eligible to participate in an "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, of Spieker which is continued by the Surviving Trust until such time as Equity Office determines it is practicable to include them in its "employee benefit plans" for similarly situated employees of the Surviving Trust as contemplated above. With respect to each such employee benefit plan, service with Spieker or any Spieker Subsidiary (as applicable) and the predecessor of any of them shall be included for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting (if applicable) and determination of the level of entitlement to, benefits under such employee benefit plan. Equity Office shall, or shall cause the Surviving Trust and its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to all employees of Spieker who are employed by the Surviving Trust under any welfare plan that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any welfare plan maintained for such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide each such employee of Spieker who is employed by the Surviving Trust with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans that such employees are eligible to participate in after the Effective Time.  

  (b) _Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plans._ The stock option plans or programs of Spieker and the restricted stock plans or programs of Spieker shall be discontinued as of the Effective Time.  

  (c) _Spieker Stock Options._ Immediately prior to the date on which the Spieker stockholders approve the Merger, each outstanding Spieker Stock Option shall, effective as of such time, become fully vested and exercisable to the extent not already so vested and exercisable and, to the extent not otherwise provided in the applicable option agreement as permitted by applicable law, each such Spieker Stock Option shall be automatically converted at the Effective Time into an option (a "Substituted Option") to purchase a number of shares of Equity Office Common Shares equal to the number of shares of Spieker Common Stock that could have been purchased (assuming full vesting) under such Spieker Stock Option multiplied by 1.94462 (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Spieker Common Stock) at an exercise price per share of Equity Office Common Shares equal to the per-share option exercise price specified in the Spieker Stock Option divided by 1.94462 (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Such Substituted Option shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as such Spieker Stock Option. For purposes of expiration and otherwise, the date of grant of the Substituted Option shall be the date on which the corresponding Spieker Stock Option was granted. As soon as practicable after the date hereof and subject to applicable law, Equity Office shall offer to purchase, subject to consummation of the Mergers, all Spieker Stock Options outstanding on the date hereof from the holders thereof for an amount in cash in respect thereof equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) $58.50 over (B) the exercise price of such Spieker Stock Option and (ii) the number of shares of Spieker Common Stock subject thereto. If the holder of any such Spieker Stock Option tenders such option prior to 11:59 p.m., Pacific Time, on the 20th business day after the purchase offer is made to the holders thereof, then within three business days after the Effective Time, Equity    Office shall, subject to reduction for required withholding taxes, pay to
each such tendering former holder of Spieker Stock Options the purchase price
thereof. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
Equity Office shall issue to each holder of an outstanding Spieker Stock
Option a document evidencing the foregoing assumption by Equity Office. In
respect of each Spieker Stock Option assumed by Equity Office, but
not tendered for cash, and converted into a Substituted Option, and the
Equity Office Common Shares underlying such Substituted Option, Equity Office
shall, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, file and keep current
a Registration Statement on Form S-8 or other appropriate registration
statement for as long as Substituted Options remain outstanding. 

  

  (d) _Restricted Stock._ All unvested shares of restricted stock of Spieker set forth in Schedule 5.8(d) of the Spieker Disclosure Letter shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without further action of Spieker, Equity Office or the holder of such shares of restricted stock, to the extent required in the plan, agreement or instrument pursuant to which such shares of restricted stock were granted, vest and become free of all restrictions immediately prior to the date on which the Spieker shareholders approve the Merger and shall be converted into the Merger Consideration upon the Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.10.  

  (e) _Withholding._ To the extent required by applicable law, Spieker shall require each employee who exercises a Spieker Stock Option or who receives Spieker Common Stock pursuant to any existing commitment to pay to Spieker in cash or Spieker Common Stock an amount sufficient to satisfy in full Spiekers obligation to withhold Taxes incurred by reason of such exercise or issuance (unless and to the extent such withholding is satisfied pursuant to the provision regarding withholding in Section 1.13(c)).  

  (f) _Special Severance Policy._ Equity Office acknowledges that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed a "Change in Control" for purposes of the Special Severance Policy, and that severance payments shall be made in accordance with the Special Severance Policy to any participant who becomes entitled to such payments on account of a termination of employment occurring on or after the Effective Date, unless such termination is for Cause or is a voluntary resignation without Good Reason in accordance with the terms of the Special Severance Policy. As of the Effective Time, there shall not be any additional employees or other service providers thereafter designated for participation in the Special Severance Policy.  

  (g) _Bonus Plans._ From and after the Effective Time, Equity Office or EOP Partnership shall pay, if earned, development bonuses to employees identified on  _Schedule 5.8(g)_ of the Spieker Disclosure Letter up to the aggregate amount set forth on _Schedule 5.8(g)_ of the Spieker Disclosure Letter. Equity Office or EOP Partnership also shall assume the obligations of Spieker to pay annual bonuses to Spieker employees not covered by the Special Severance Policy and such bonuses shall be payable to such employees who are terminated by Equity Office (unless terminated for inadequate performance) before January 1, 2002. Such bonuses shall be payable to the extent accrued for the year 2001 through the date of termination and shall be calculated based on actual bonuses paid in 2000 (assuming such bonuses reflected a full year of employment).  

  5.9 _Indemnification._   

  (a) From and after the Effective Time, Equity Office and EOP Partnership (collectively, the "Indemnifying Parties") shall provide exculpation and indemnification for each individual who is now or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, an officer or director of Spieker or any Spieker Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") which is the same as the exculpation and indemnification provided to the Indemnified Parties by Spieker and the Spieker Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger in its charter, Bylaws or in its partnership, operating or similar agreement, as in effect on the date hereof.  

  (b) In addition to the rights provided in Section 5.9(a) above, in the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including, without limitation, any action by or on behalf of any or all security holders of Spieker or Equity Office, or any Spieker Subsidiary or Equity Office Subsidiary, or by or in the right of Spieker or Equity Office, or any Spieker Subsidiary or Equity Office Subsidiary, or any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any individual who is now, or has been, at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective    Time of the Merger, an officer, employee or director of Spieker or any
Spieker Subsidiary (the "Indemnification Parties") is, or is threatened to
be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part
out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was an officer, employee
or director of Spieker or any of the Spieker Subsidiaries or any action or
omission by such individual in his capacity as a director, or (ii) this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether in any
case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time of the Merger,
the Indemnifying Parties shall, from and after the Effective Time of the
Merger, indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the full extent permitted by
applicable law, each Indemnification Party against any losses, claims,
liabilities, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in accordance herewith in
connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation. Any Indemnification Party proposing to assert the right to
be indemnified under this Section 5.9(b) shall, promptly after receipt of
notice of commencement of any action against such Indemnification Party in
respect of which a claim is to be made under this Section 5.9(b) against the
Indemnifying Parties, notify the Indemnifying Parties of the commencement of
such action, enclosing a copy of all papers served; _provided, however,_
that the failure to provide such notice shall not affect the obligations of
the Indemnifying Parties except to the extent such failure to notify
materially prejudices the Indemnifying Parties ability to defend such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation; and _provided further, however,_
that, in the case of any action pending at the Effective Time of the Merger,
notification pursuant to this Section 5.9(b) shall be received by Equity
Office prior to such Effective Time. If any such action is brought against
any of the Indemnification Parties and such Indemnification Parties notify
the Indemnifying Parties of its commencement, the Indemnifying Parties will
be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that they elect by
delivering written notice to such Indemnification Parties promptly after
receiving notice of the commencement of the action from the Indemnification
Parties, to assume the defense of the action and after notice from
the Indemnifying Parties to the Indemnification Parties of their election to
assume the defense, the Indemnifying Parties will not be liable to the
Indemnification Parties for any legal or other expenses except as provided
below. If the Indemnifying Parties assume the defense, the Indemnifying
Parties shall have the right to settle such action without the consent of
the Indemnification Parties; _provided, however,_ that the Indemnifying
Parties shall be required to obtain such consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld) if the settlement includes any admission of wrongdoing
on the part of the Indemnification Parties or any decree or restriction on
the Indemnification Parties; _provided further, however,_ that no
Indemnifying Parties, in the defense of any such action shall, except with
the consent of the Indemnification Parties (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnification Parties of a release
from all liability with respect to such action. The Indemnification Parties
will have the right to employ their own counsel in any such action, but the
fees, expenses and other charges of such counsel will be at the expense of
such Indemnification Parties unless (i) the employment of counsel by the
Indemnification Parties has been authorized in writing by the Indemnifying
Parties, (ii) the Indemnification Parties have reasonably concluded (based
on written advice of counsel to the Indemnification Parties) that there may
be legal defenses available to them that are different from or in addition to
and inconsistent with those available to the Indemnifying Parties, (iii) a
conflict or potential conflict exists (based on written advice of counsel to
the Indemnification Parties) between the Indemnification Parties and the
Indemnifying Parties (in which case the Indemnifying Parties will not have
the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the
Indemnification Parties) or (iv) the Indemnifying Parties have not in fact
employed counsel to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable
time after receiving notice of the commencement of the action from
the Indemnification Parties, in each of which cases the reasonable fees,
disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at the expense of the
Indemnifying Parties and shall promptly be paid by each Indemnifying Party as
they become due and payable in advance of the final disposition of the claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation to the fullest extent and in
the manner permitted by law; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall any
contingent fee arrangement be considered reasonable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnifying Parties shall not be obligated to advance any
expenses or costs prior to receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
the Indemnification Party to repay any expenses advanced if it
shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnification Party is
not entitled to be indemnified against such expense. It is understood that
the Indemnifying Parties shall not, in connection with any proceeding or
related proceedings in the same   jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements and other
charges of more than one separate firm admitted to practice in such
jurisdiction at any one time for all such Indemnification Parties unless (a)
the employment of more than one counsel has been authorized in writing by the
Indemnifying Parties, (b) any of the Indemnification Parties have reasonably
concluded (based on written advice of counsel to the Indemnification Parties)
that there may be legal defenses available to them that are different from or
in addition to and inconsistent with those available to other
Indemnification Parties or (c) a conflict or potential conflict
exists (based on written advice of counsel to the Indemnification Parties)
between any of the Indemnification Parties and the other Indemnification
Parties, in each case of which the Indemnifying Parties shall be obligated to
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such additional counsel or
counsels. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Parties (i) shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without their prior written consent and (ii) shall not
have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnification Party to the extent that
a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-
appealable order that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable law.
In the event of a final and non-appealable determination by a court that any
payment of expenses is prohibited by applicable law, the Indemnification
Parties shall promptly refund to the Indemnifying Parties the amount of all
such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto. 

  

  (c) At or prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, Equity Office shall purchase directors and officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time of the Merger for a period of six years with respect to those individuals who are currently covered by Spiekers directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable to Spiekers directors and officers currently covered by such insurance than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof.  

  (d) This Section 5.9 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third-party rights to, the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnification Parties and their successors, assigns and heirs and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Equity Office and EOP Partnership. Each of the Indemnified Parties and the Indemnification Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this Section 5.9 and Equity Office and EOP Partnership acknowledge and agree that each Indemnified Party and Indemnification Party would suffer irreparable harm and that no adequate remedy at law exists for a breach of such covenants and such Indemnified Party or such Indemnification Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief and specific performance in the event of any breach of any provision in this Section 5.9.  

  (e) If Equity Office or EOP Partnership or any of its respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case the successors and assigns of such entity shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9, which obligations are expressly intended to be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each director and officer covered hereby.  

  5.10 _Declaration of Dividends and Distributions._  From and after the date of this Agreement, neither Spieker nor Equity Office shall make any dividend or distribution to its respective stockholders or shareholders without the prior written consent of the other party; _provided, however,_  the written consent of the other party shall not be required for the authorization and payment of (a) distributions at their respective stated dividend or distribution rates with respect to Equity Office Existing Preferred Shares or any series of Spieker Preferred Stock, (b) quarterly distributions with respect to the Spieker Common Stock of $0.70 per share for the quarter ending March 31, 2001 and each quarter thereafter, subject to increase as set forth below and (c) quarterly distributions with respect to the Equity Office Common Shares of up to $0.45 per share for the quarter ending March 31, 2001 and for each quarter thereafter; _provided, however,_ the record date for each distribution with respect to the Spieker Common Stock shall be the same date as the record date for the quarterly distribution for the Equity Office Common Shares, as provided to Spieker by notice not less than twenty (20) business days prior to the record date for any quarterly Equity Office distribution. Within 30 days of the date of this Agreement, Spieker shall prepare and present to Equity Office a financial plan showing in reasonable detail the expected management of its operations, including any asset dispositions, and its estimated taxable income (including allowable deductions attributable to payments required to be made by    Spieker prior to the Effective Time under the Spieker special severance
policy and allowable deductions attributable to the vesting of restricted
stock of Spieker set forth on  _Schedule 5.8(d)_ prior to the Effective
Time) in a manner that results in no required Final Spieker Dividend
in order for Spieker, at the Effective Time of the Merger, to satisfy the
requirement of the Section 857(a)(1) for the short taxable year of Spieker
ending at such time (and to avoid the payment of any tax with respect to any
undistributed income or gain for such year). Such plan shall include the
projected required quarterly dividends per share of Spieker Common
Stock necessary to ensure that no Final Spieker Dividend is required to be
paid, which quarterly dividends shall be not less than $0.70 per share nor
result in a "return of capital" per share of Spieker Common Stock that
exceeds one percent (1%) of the projected dividends per share. Upon the
approval by Equity Office of such plan, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, Spieker shall be entitled to increase
the quarterly dividend per share of Spieker Common Stock to the amount shown
in such plan, as approved by Equity Office. From and after the date of this
Agreement, Spieker Partnership shall not make any distribution to the holders
of Spieker OP Units except a distribution per Spieker OP Unit in the same
amount as a dividend per share of Spieker Common Stock permitted pursuant to
this Section 5.10, with the same record and payment dates as such dividend on
the Spieker Common Stock. If Spieker increases any quarterly dividend per
share of Spieker Common Stock to an amount in excess of $0.70 per share in
accordance with this Section 5.10, Equity Office shall be entitled
to declare a dividend per share payable to holders of Equity Office Common
Shares (and EOP Partnership shall declare a distribution per unit payable to
holders of Equity Office OP Units if a dividend has been declared on the
Equity Office Common Shares), the record dates for which shall be the close
of the business on the last business day prior to the Effective Time, in an
amount per Equity Office Common Share and Equity Office OP Unit equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (x) the aggregate amount of quarterly dividends
per share of Spieker Common Stock declared or paid by Spieker in excess of
$0.70 per share per quarter in accordance with this Section 5.10 by (y)
1.94462 (the "Additional Corresponding Equity Office Dividends and
Distributions"). If, and to the extent, the terms of any series of Equity
Office Preferred Shares or Equity Office Preferred OP Units require the
payment of a dividend or distribution by reason of the payment of
the Additional Corresponding Equity Office Dividends and Distributions,
Equity Office and EOP Partnership shall declare and pay any such required
dividends and distributions. The Additional Corresponding Equity Office
Dividends and Distributions (and any dividends payable to holders of
Equity Office Preferred Shares and distributions payable to holders
of Equity Office Preferred OP Units) shall be paid on the last business day
immediately preceding the Closing Date. The foregoing restrictions shall not
apply, however, (i) to Equity Office to the extent a distribution (or an
increase in a distribution) by Equity Office is necessary for Equity Office
to maintain REIT status, avoid the incurrence of any taxes under Section 857
of the Code, avoid the imposition of any excise taxes under Section 4981 of
the Code, or avoid the need to make one or more extraordinary or
disproportionately larger distributions to meet any of the three preceding
objectives (or to any corresponding distributions or increases in
distributions paid by EOP Partnership), (ii) to Equity Office and
EOP Partnership with respect to any Corresponding Equity Office Dividends
and Distributions, or (iii) to Spieker and Spieker Partnership with respect
to any Final Spieker Dividends and Final Spieker Partnership Distributions. 

  

  5.11 _Transfer of Spieker TRS._ At the Closing and pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, each of the holders of voting capital stock of Spieker TRS (other than Spieker Partnership, to the extent it owns any such voting capital stock) shall transfer to Equity Office TRS Sub or such Person or Persons as Equity Office TRS Sub shall designate by written notice delivered to them prior to the Closing, or shall authorize a merger that will result in such a transfer of all of the shares of Spieker TRS which are not owned by Spieker Partnership, for an aggregate consideration in an amount equal to the purchase price per share set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement multiplied by the number of outstanding shares of voting capital stock of Spieker TRS. Equity Office shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Equity Office TRS Sub to perform its obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement.  

  5.12 _Notices._ Equity Office shall provide such notice to its preferred shareholders of the Merger as is required under Maryland law or the Equity Office Declaration of Trust.    5.13 _Resignations._ On the Closing Date, Spieker shall cause the directors and officers of Spieker and of each of the Spieker Subsidiaries to submit their resignations from such positions, effective as of the Effective Time of the Merger.  

  5.14 _Assumption of Existing Tax Protection Agreements._ Effective as of the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger, Equity Office and EOP Partnership shall assume the obligations of Spieker, Spieker Partnership and/or the applicable Spieker Subsidiary, as the case may be, under the Tax Protection Agreements as described in  _Schedule 2.18(j)_ to the Spieker Disclosure Letter. Immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger, Equity Office and EOP Partnership shall enter into agreements with Spieker and Spieker Partnership, for the benefit of and enforceable by the individuals and entities who are intended to be protected by the provisions of the Tax Protection Agreements, confirming such assumption effective as of the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger.  

  5.15 _EOP Partnership Agreement._ At the Closing, EOP Partnership shall assume and perform any obligations that Spieker Partnership or any Spieker Subsidiary has immediately prior to the Effective Time to issue securities in accordance with the terms of any partnership or other agreement to which Spieker Partnership or such Spieker Subsidiary is a party and that are described on _Schedule 5.15_, in the same manner and to the same extent that Spieker Partnership or such Spieker Subsidiary would be required to perform such obligation if no Merger had been consummated.  

  5.16 _Registration Rights Agreements._ At the Closing, Spieker shall assign and Equity Office shall assume by appropriate instrument the Registration Rights Agreements described on _Schedule 5.16_ to the Spieker Disclosure Letter.

  7.2 _Certain Fees and Expenses._ If this Agreement shall be terminated (i) pursuant to Section 7.1(h), 7.1(i)(1) or 7.1(i)(3), then Spieker and Spieker Partnership theretofore or thereupon shall pay to EOP    Partnership a fee equal to the Break-Up Fee (as defined herein), and (ii)
pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or 7.1(f), then Spieker and Spieker Partnership
shall pay to EOP Partnership (provided that Spieker was not entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c) at the time of
such termination) an amount equal to the Break-Up Expenses (as defined
herein). If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or
7.1(g), then Equity Office and EOP Partnership shall pay to Spieker
Partnership (provided that Equity Office was not entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) at the time of such termination) an
amount equal to the Break-Up Expenses. If this Agreement shall be terminated
pursuant to Section 7.1(b), 7.1(d) (if primarily resulting from any action or
inaction of Spieker, Spieker Partnership or any Spieker Subsidiary or Spieker
TRS), 7.1(e), 7.1(f), 7.1(i)(2) and prior to the time of such termination an
Acquisition Proposal has been received by Spieker or Spieker Partnership, and
either prior to the termination of this Agreement or within twelve (12)
months thereafter, Spieker or Spieker Partnership enters into any written
agreement to consummate a transaction or series of transactions which,
had such agreement been proposed or negotiated during the term of this
Agreement, would have constituted an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section
4.3 (each, a "Spieker Acquisition Agreement"), which is subsequently
consummated (whether or not any Spieker Acquisition Agreement relates to the
same Acquisition Proposal which had been received at the time of
the termination of this Agreement), then Spieker and Spieker Partnership
shall pay the Break-Up Fee to EOP Partnership. 

  

  The payment of the Break-Up Fee shall be compensation for the loss suffered by Equity Office and EOP Partnership as a result of the failure of the Mergers to be consummated (including, without limitation, opportunity costs and out-of-pocket costs and expenses) and to avoid the difficulty of determining damages under the circumstances. The Break-Up Fee shall be paid by Spieker and Spieker Partnership to EOP Partnership, or the Break-Up Expenses shall be paid by Spieker and Spieker Partnership to EOP Partnership or EOP Partnership to Spieker Partnership (as applicable), in immediately available funds within two (2) business days after the date the event giving rise to the obligation to make such payment occurred (except as otherwise provided in Section 7.1(h) or 7.1(i)). Spieker acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are integral parts of this Agreement; accordingly, if Spieker and Spieker Partnership fail to promptly pay the Break-Up Fee or Break-Up Expenses due pursuant to this Section 7.2 and, in order to obtain payment, Equity Office commences a suit which results in a judgment against Spieker or Spieker Partnership for any amounts owed pursuant to this Section 7.2, Spieker and Spieker Partnership shall pay to Equity Office its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount owed at the rate on six-month U.S. Treasury obligations in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus 300 basis points.  

  As used in this Agreement, "Break-Up Fee" shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i) $160,000,000 less Break-Up Expenses paid or payable under this Section 7.2 (the "Base Amount") and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to EOP Partnership without causing Equity Office to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) and 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code ("Qualifying Income"), as determined by independent accountants to Equity Office, and (B) in the event Equity Office receives a letter from outside counsel (the "Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion") indicating that Equity Office has received a ruling from the IRS holding that EOP Partnerships receipt of the Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income of Equity Office within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the "REIT Requirements") or that the receipt by EOP Partnership of the remaining balance of the Base Amount following the receipt of and pursuant to such ruling would not be deemed constructively received prior thereto, the Base Amount less the amount payable under clause (A) above. Spiekers and Spieker Partnerships obligation to pay any unpaid portion of the Break-Up Fee shall terminate three years from the date of this Agreement. In the event that EOP Partnership is not able to receive the full Base Amount, Spieker and Spieker Partnership shall place the unpaid amount in escrow and shall not release any portion thereof to EOP Partnership unless and until Spieker receives one or both of the following: (i) a letter from Equity Offices independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to EOP Partnership without causing Equity Office to fail to meet the REIT Requirements or (ii) a Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion, in either of which events Spieker and Spieker Partnership shall pay to EOP Partnership the unpaid Base Amount or, if less and either there is no Break-up Fee Tax Opinion or the    ruling described in the Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion does not hold that the
Base Amount either would constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded
from gross income for purposes of the REIT Requirements, the maximum amount
stated in the letter referred to in (i) above. Subject to satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, there is
no limitation on the number of distributions that can be made from the
escrow prior to the third anniversary of the date of this Agreement. 

  

  The "Break-Up Expenses" payable to EOP Partnership or Spieker Partnership, as the case may be (the "Recipient"), shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i) $7,500,000 or (ii) the Recipients out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, all attorneys, accountants and investment bankers fees and expenses). If the Break-Up Expenses payable to the Recipient exceed the maximum amount that can be paid to the Recipient without causing the Recipient to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income, as determined by independent accountants to the Recipient (the "Maximum Amount"), the amount initially payable to the Recipient shall be limited to the Maximum Amount. If, however, within the three-year period commencing on the date of this Agreement, the Recipient receives a Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion indicating that it has received a ruling from the IRS holding that the Recipients receipt of the Break-Up Expenses would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income of the Recipient within the meaning of the REIT Requirements or that receipt by the Recipient of the balance of the Break-Up Expenses above the Maximum Amount following the receipt of and pursuant to such ruling would not be deemed constructively received prior thereto, the Recipient shall be entitled to have payable to it the full amount of the Break-Up Expenses. The obligation of Equity Office and EOP Partnership or Spieker and Spieker Partnership, as applicable ("Payor"), to pay any unpaid portion of the Break-Up Expenses shall terminate three years from the date of this Agreement. In the event that the Recipient is not able to receive the full Break-Up Expenses, the Payor shall place the unpaid amount in escrow and shall not release any portion thereof to the Recipient unless and until the Payor receives either one or both of the following: (i) a letter from the independent accountants of Equity Office or Spieker, as the case may be, indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to the Recipient without causing it to fail to meet the REIT Requirements or (ii) a Break-Up Expense Tax Opinion, in either of which events the Payor shall pay to the Recipient the unpaid Break-Up Expenses or, if less and either there is no Break-Up Expense Tax Opinion or the ruling described in the Break-Up Expense Tax Opinion does not hold that the Base Amount either would constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income for purposes of the REIT Requirements, the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in (i) above. Subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, there is no limitation on the number of distributions that can be made from the escrow prior to the third anniversary of the date of this Agreement.  

  7.3 _Effect of Termination._ In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Spieker or Equity Office as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Equity Office, EOP Partnership, Spieker or Spieker Partnership, other than the last sentence of Section 5.2, Section 7.2, this Section 7.3 and Article 8, and except to the extent that such termination results from a material breach by any party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.  

  7.4 _Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by the parties in writing by action of the respective Board of Trustees or Board of Directors of Equity Office and Spieker at any time before or after any Shareholder Approvals are obtained and prior to the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Department;  _provided, however,_ that, after the Shareholder Approvals and Partner Approvals are obtained, no such amendment, modification or supplement shall be made which by law requires the further approval of shareholders or partners without obtaining such further approval. The parties agree to amend this Agreement in the manner provided in the immediately preceding sentence to the extent required to (a) continue the status of each party as a REIT or (b) preserve the Merger as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.  

  7.5 _Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the    representations and warranties of the other party contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c)
subject to the proviso of Section 7.4, waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions of the other party contained in this Agreement.
Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights.

 FORM OF ARTICLES SUPPLEMENTARY  

 ESTABLISHING AND FIXING THE RIGHTS AND PREFERENCES OF SERIES E PREFERRED
SHARES AND SERIES E PREFERRED EXCESS SHARES  

  Equity Office Properties Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust (the "Trust"), certifies to the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland that:  

   _FIRST:_ Under a power contained in Article VI of the Trusts Articles of Amendment and Restatement of Declaration of Trust, as amended (the "Declaration of Trust"), the Board of Trustees (the "Board"), by resolution duly adopted on  ,  2001, classified 4,250,000 Preferred Shares (as defined in the Declaration of Trust) as Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (the "Series E Preferred Shares"), with the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of shares as follows and provided for the issuance thereof:  

  (1) _Designation and Number._ The designation of Series E Preferred Shares described in Article FIRST hereof shall be "Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (par value $.01 per share)." The number of Series E Preferred Shares to be authorized shall be 4,250,000.  

  (2) _Rank._ The Series E Preferred Shares shall, with respect to distribution rights and rights upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Trust, rank (a) senior to all classes or series of Common Shares (as defined in the Declaration of Trust) and to all equity securities the terms of which provide that such equity securities shall rank junior to such Series E Preferred Shares; (b) on a parity with all equity securities issued by the Trust, including the 8.98% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (the "Series A Preferred Shares"), the 5.25% Series B Convertible, Cumulative Preferred Shares (the "Series B Preferred Shares"), the 8 5/8% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest (the "Series C Preferred Shares"), Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (the "Series F Preferred Shares"), Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (the "Series G Preferred Shares") and Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (the "Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares") classified pursuant to resolutions duly adopted by the Board, other than those referred to in clauses (a) and (c); and (c) junior to all equity securities issued by the Trust which rank senior to the Series E Preferred Shares. The term "equity securities" shall not include convertible debt securities.  

  (3) _Distributions._  

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) Subject to the rights of series of Preferred
Shares  which may from time to time come into existence, holders of  Series
E Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive,  when and as declared by the
Board of Trustees, out of funds  legally available for the payment of
distributions, cumulative  preferential cash distributions at the rate of
$2.3625 per annum  per share. Such distributions shall be cumulative from the
last  date on which any dividends were paid with respect to  Series B
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock of Spieker  Properties, Inc. for which
Series E Preferred Shares were  exchanged in connection with the merger of
Spieker Properties,  Inc. with and into the Trust and shall be payable
quarterly in  arrears on the last day of March, June, September and
December  or, if not a business day, the next succeeding business day 
(each, a "Distribution Payment Date"). Any  distribution payable on Series E
Preferred Shares for any  partial distribution period will be computed on the
basis of a  360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Distributions 
will be payable to holders of record as they appear in the  records of the
Trust at the close of business on the applicable  record date, which shall be
on such date designated by the Board  of Trustees of the Trust for the
payment of distributions that  is not more than 50 nor less than 10 days
prior to such  Distribution Payment Date (each, a "Distribution Record 
Date").       \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(b) Distributions on Series E Preferred Shares
will \taccrue whether or not the Trust has earnings, whether or not \tthere
are funds legally available for the payment of such \tdistributions and
whether or not such distributions are \tdeclared. No interest, or sum of
money in lieu of interest, \tshall be payable in respect of any distribution
payment or \tpayments on Series E Preferred Shares which may be
in \tarrears. Holders of the Series E Preferred Shares will not \tbe
entitled to distributions in excess of the full cumulative \tdistributions as
described above.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(c) If, for any taxable year, the Trust elects
to \tdesignate as "capital gain dividends" (as defined in \tSection 857 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as \tamended, or any successor revenue
code or section (the \t"Code")) any portion (the "Capital Gains \tAmount")
of the total distributions (as determined for \tfederal income tax purposes)
paid or made available for the year \tto holders of all classes of shares of
beneficial interest (the \t"Total Distributions"), then the portion of
the \tCapital Gains Amount that shall be allocable to holders of \tSeries E
Preferred Shares shall be in the same portion that \tthe Total Distributions
paid or made available to the holders of \tSeries E Preferred Shares for the
year bears to the Total \tDistributions.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(d) If any Series E Preferred Shares are
outstanding, \tno distributions shall be declared or paid or set apart
for \tpayment on any class or series of shares of beneficial interest \tof
the Trust ranking, as to distributions, on a parity with or \tjunior to
Series E Preferred Shares for any period unless \tfull cumulative
distributions have been or contemporaneously are \tdeclared and paid or
declared and a sum sufficient for the \tpayment thereof set apart for such
payments on Series E \tPreferred Shares for all past distribution periods and
the then \tcurrent distribution period. When distributions are not paid
in \tfull (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not set \tapart)
upon the Series E Preferred Shares and the shares of \tany other series of
shares of beneficial interest ranking on \tparity as to distributions with
Series E Preferred Shares, \tall distributions declared upon Series E
Preferred Shares \tand any other series of shares of beneficial interest
ranking on \ta parity as to distributions with Series E Preferred
Shares \tshall be declared pro rata so that the amount of
distributions \tdeclared per share on Series E Preferred Shares and
such \tother series of shares of beneficial interest shall in all
cases \tbear to each other the same ratio that accrued distributions
per \tshare on Series E Preferred Shares and such other series of \tshares
of beneficial interest bear to each other.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(e) Except as provided in Section 3(d), unless
full \tcumulative distributions on Series E Preferred Shares have \tbeen or
contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and \ta sum sufficient
for the payment thereof set apart for payment \tfor all past dividend periods
and the then current dividend \tperiod, no distributions (other than in
Common Shares or other \tshares of beneficial interest ranking junior to
Series E \tPreferred Shares as to distributions and amounts
upon \tliquidation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment \tor
other distribution shall be declared or made upon the Common \tShares, Series
A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred \tShares, Series C Preferred Shares,
Series F Preferred \tShares, Series G Preferred Shares and Series
H \tPreferred Shares or any other shares of beneficial interest of \tthe
Trust ranking junior to or on a parity with Series E \tPreferred Shares as to
distributions or upon liquidation, nor \tshall any Common Shares, Series A
Preferred Shares, \tSeries B Preferred Shares, Series C Preferred
Shares, \tSeries F Preferred Shares, Series G Preferred Shares and \tSeries
H Preferred Shares or any other shares of beneficial \tinterest of the Trust
ranking junior to or on a parity with \tSeries E Preferred Shares as to
distributions or amounts \tupon liquidation be redeemed, purchased or
otherwise acquired \tfor any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or
made \tavailable for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such \tshares
of beneficial interest) by the Trust (except by \tconversion into or exchange
for other shares of beneficial \tinterest of the Trust ranking junior to
Series E Preferred \tShares as to distributions and amounts upon
liquidation).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(f) Any distribution payment made on Series
E \tPreferred Shares shall first be credited against the earliest \taccrued
but unpaid distribution due with respect to \tSeries E Preferred Shares which
remains payable.   (4) _Liquidation Rights._  

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(a) Subject to the rights of series of Preferred
Shares \twhich may from time to time come into existence, upon
any \tvoluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up \tof
the affairs of the Trust, then, before any distribution or \tpayment shall be
made to the holders of any Common Shares or any \tother class or series of
shares of beneficial interest of the \tTrust ranking junior to Series E
Preferred Shares in the \tdistribution of assets upon any liquidation,
dissolution or \twinding up of the affairs of the Trust, the holders
of \tSeries E Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive out \tof assets
of the Trust legally available for distribution to \tshareholders,
liquidation distributions in the amount of the \tliquidation preference of
$25.00 per share, plus an amount equal \tto all distributions accrued and
unpaid thereon. After payment \tof the full amount of the liquidating
distributions to which \tthey are entitled, the holders of Series E Preferred
Shares \twill have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of \tthe
Trust. In the event that, upon any such voluntary or \tinvoluntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the \taffairs of the Trust, the
available assets of the Trust are \tinsufficient to pay the amount of the
liquidation distributions \ton all outstanding Series E Preferred Shares and
the \tcorresponding amounts payable on all shares of other classes
or \tseries of shares of beneficial interest of the Trust ranking on \ta
parity with Series E Preferred Shares in the distribution \tof assets upon
any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the \taffairs of the Trust
("Parity Shares"), then the \tholders of Series E Preferred Shares and Parity
Shares \tshall share ratably in any such distribution of assets
in \tproportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they \twould
otherwise be respectively entitled.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(b) A consolidation or merger of the Trust with or
into \tany other entity or entities, or a sale, lease, conveyance
or \tdisposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the \tTrust or
the effectuation by the Trust of a transaction or \tseries of related
transactions in which more than 50% of the \tvoting power of the Trust is
disposed of, shall not be deemed to \tbe a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the affairs of \tthe Trust within the meaning of this Section
4.  
    

  (5) _Redemption._  

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(a) Series E Preferred Shares are not
redeemable \tprior to December 11, 2000. On and after December 11, \t2000,
the Trust at its option upon not less than 30 nor more \tthan 90 days
written notice may redeem outstanding \tSeries E Preferred Shares, in whole
or in part, at any time \tor from time to time, for cash at a redemption
price of $25.00 \tper share, plus an amount equal to all distributions
accrued and \tunpaid thereon to the date fixed for redemption,
without \tinterest. The redemption price of Series E Preferred
Shares \t(other than the portion thereof consisting of accrued and
unpaid \tdistributions) is payable solely out of proceeds (without
giving \teffect to any temporary use of such proceeds) from the sale
of \tother shares of beneficial interest of the Trust, which may \tinclude
Common Shares, Preferred Shares, depositary shares, \tinterests,
participations or other ownership interests in the \tTrust however designated
(other than debt securities converted \tinto or exchangeable for shares of
beneficial interest), and any \trights, warrants or options to purchase any
thereof. Holders of \tSeries E Preferred Shares to be redeemed shall
surrender \tsuch Series E Preferred Shares at the place designated in \tsuch
notice and shall be entitled to the redemption price and \tany accrued and
unpaid distributions payable upon such \tredemption following such surrender.
If fewer than all of the \toutstanding Series E Preferred Shares are to be
redeemed, \tthe number of shares to be redeemed will be determined by
the \tTrust and such shares may be redeemed pro rata from the holders \tof
record of such shares in proportion to the number of such \tshares held by
such holders (with adjustments to avoid \tredemption of fractional shares) or
by lot in a manner \tdetermined by the Trust.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(b) Unless full cumulative distributions on
all \tSeries E Preferred Shares and Parity Shares shall have been \tor
contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum \tsufficient
for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all \tpast distribution
periods and the then current distribution \tperiod, no Series E Preferred
Shares or Parity Shares shall \tbe redeemed unless all outstanding Series E
Preferred \tShares and Parity Shares are simultaneously redeemed;
provided, \thowever, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase
or \tacquisition of Series E Preferred Shares or Parity Shares \tpursuant to
a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms \tto holders of all
outstanding Series E Preferred Shares or  ---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tParity Shares, as the case may be. Furthermore, unless
full \tcumulative distributions on all outstanding Series E \tPreferred
Shares and Parity Shares have been or \tcontemporaneously are declared and
paid or declared and a sum \tsufficient for the payment thereof set apart for
payment for all \tpast distribution periods and the then current
distribution \tperiod, the Trust shall not purchase or otherwise
acquire \tdirectly or indirectly any Series E Preferred Shares or
Parity \tShares (except by conversion into or exchange for shares
of \tbeneficial interest of the Trust ranking junior to Series E \tPreferred
Shares and Parity Shares as to distributions and \tamounts upon
liquidation).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(c) Notice of redemption will be mailed at
least \t30 days but not more than 90 days before the \tredemption date to
each holder of record of Series E \tPreferred Shares at the address shown on
the stock transfer \tbooks of the Trust. Each notice shall state: (i)
the \tredemption date; (ii) the number of Series E Preferred \tShares to be
redeemed; (iii) the redemption price per \tshare; (iv) the place or places
where certificates for \tSeries E Preferred Shares are to be surrendered for
payment \tof the redemption price; and (v) that distributions on \tSeries E
Preferred Shares will cease to accrue on such \tredemption date. If fewer
than all Series E Preferred \tShares are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to
each such holder \tthereof shall also specify the number of Series E
Preferred \tShares to be redeemed from each such holder. If notice
of \tredemption of any Series E Preferred Shares has been given \tand if the
funds necessary for such redemption have been set \taside by the Trust in
trust for the benefit of the holders of \tSeries E Preferred Shares so called
for redemption, then \tfrom and after the redemption date, distributions will
cease to \taccrue on such Series E Preferred Shares, such \tSeries E
Preferred Shares shall no longer be deemed \toutstanding and all rights of
the holders of such shares will \tterminate, except the right to receive the
redemption price.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(d) The holders of Series E Preferred Shares at
the \tclose of business on a Distribution Record Date will be entitled \tto
receive the distribution payable with respect to such \tSeries E Preferred
Shares on the corresponding Distribution \tPayment Date notwithstanding the
redemption thereof between such \tDistribution Record Date and the
corresponding Distribution \tPayment Date or the Trusts default in the
payment of the \tdistribution due. Except as provided above, the Trust will
make \tno payment or allowance for unpaid distributions, whether or not \tin
arrears, on Series E Preferred Shares which have been \tcalled for
redemption.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(e) Series E Preferred Shares will not be subject
to \tany sinking fund or mandatory redemption, except as provided
in \tSection 9.  
    

  (6) _Voting Rights_. 

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(a) Except as indicated in this Section 6, or
except \tas otherwise from time to time required by applicable law,
the \tholders of Series E Preferred Shares will have no voting \trights.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(b) If six quarterly distributions (whether or
not \tconsecutive) payable on Series E Preferred Shares or any \tParity
Shares are in arrears, whether or not earned or declared, \tthe number of
trustees then constituting the Board of Trustees \tof the Trust will be
increased by two, and the holders of \tSeries E Preferred Shares, voting
together as a class with \tthe holders of shares of any other series of
Parity Shares \tentitled to such voting rights (any such other series,
the \t"Voting Preferred Shares"), will have the right to \telect two
additional trustees to serve on the Trusts Board \tof Trustees at any annual
meeting of stockholders or a properly \tcalled special meeting of the holders
of Series E Preferred \tShares and such other Voting Preferred Shares until
all such \tdistributions have been declared and paid or set aside
for \tpayment. The term of office of all trustees so elected
will \tterminate with the termination of such voting rights.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(c) The approval of a majority of the
outstanding \tSeries E Preferred Shares and all other series of
Voting \tPreferred Shares similarly affected and having voting rights
of \tthe type specified in this Section 6(c), voting as a single \tclass is
required in order to (i) enter into a share \texchange that affects Series E
Preferred Shares, or \tconsolidate with or merge the Trust with or into any
other \tentity, unless in each such case each Series E Preferred \tShare
remains outstanding without a material adverse change to \tits terms and
rights or is converted into or exchanged for \tpreferred shares of the
surviving entity having  ---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tpreferences, conversion and other rights, voting
powers, \trestrictions, limitations as to distributions,
qualifications \tand terms or conditions of redemption thereof identical to
that \tof a Series E Preferred Share, or (ii) authorize, \treclassify,
create, or increase the authorized amount of any \tclass of shares of
beneficial interest having rights senior to \tSeries E Preferred Shares with
respect to the payment of \tdistributions or amounts upon liquidation,
dissolution or \twinding up of the affairs of the Trust. However, the Trust
may \tcreate additional classes of Parity Shares and shares of \tbeneficial
interest ranking junior to Series E Preferred \tShares as to distributions or
amounts upon liquidation, \tdissolution or winding up of the affairs of the
Trust \t("Junior Shares"), increase the authorized number of \tParity Shares
and Junior Shares and issue additional series of \tParity Shares and Junior
Shares without the consent of any \tholder of Series E Preferred Shares.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(d) The approval of two-thirds of the
outstanding \tSeries E Preferred Shares and all other series of
Voting \tPreferred Shares similarly affected and having voting rights
of \tthe type specified in this Section 6(d), voting as a single \tclass, is
required in order to amend the Trusts Articles \tSupplementary or
declaration of trust to affect materially and \tadversely the rights,
preferences or voting power of the holders \tof Series E Preferred Shares or
the Voting Preferred Shares.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(e) Except as provided above and as required by law,
the \tholders of Series E Preferred Shares are not entitled to vote on \tany
merger or consolidation involving the Trust, on any share \texchange or on a
sale of all or substantially all of the assets \tof the Trust.  
    

  (7) _Conversion._ The Series E Preferred Shares are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the Trust, except that each Series E Preferred Shares is exchangeable into Series E Preferred Excess Shares as provided in Section 9.  

  (8) _Status of Redeemed Stock._ In the event any Series E Preferred Shares shall be redeemed pursuant to Section 5 hereof, the shares so redeemed shall revert to the status of authorized but unissued Preferred Shares available for future issuance and reclassification by the Trust.  

  (9) _Restrictions on Transfer; Exchange for Series E Preferred Excess Shares._ 

     \t \t|

Code. \tThe terms "Beneficial Owner," "Beneficially \tOwns" and
"Beneficially Owned" shall have \tcorrelative meanings.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t"Beneficiary" shall mean a beneficiary of

  (10) _Series E Preferred Excess Shares._ 

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(a) _Ownership in Trust._ Upon any purported
Transfer \tthat results in Series E Preferred Excess Shares pursuant \tto
Section 9(c), such Series E Preferred Excess Shares \tshall be deemed to have
been transferred to the Trust, as \tTrustee of the Series E Preferred Excess
Share Trust for \tthe exclusive benefit of such Beneficiary or Beneficiaries
to \twhom an interest in such Series E Preferred Excess Shares may \tlater
be transferred pursuant to Section 10(e). \tSeries E Preferred Excess Shares
so held in trust shall be \tissued and outstanding shares of the Trust. The
Purported Record \tTransferee shall have no rights in such Series E
Preferred \tExcess Shares except the right to receive a price for
its \tinterest in the Equity Shares which were exchanged for \tSeries E
Preferred Excess Shares. The Purported Beneficial \tTransferee shall have no
rights in such Series E Preferred \tExcess Shares except as provided in
Section 10(e).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(b) _Distribution Rights._ Series E
Preferred \tExcess Shares shall not be entitled to any distributions.
Any \tdistribution paid prior to the discovery by the Trust that
the \tSeries E Preferred Shares have been exchanged for \tSeries E Preferred
Excess Shares shall be repaid to the \tTrust upon demand, and any
distribution declared but unpaid \tshall be rescinded as void _ab initio_
with respect to such \tSeries E Preferred Excess Shares.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(c) _Rights Upon Liquidation._ In the event of
any \tvoluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up \tof,
or any distribution of the assets of, the Trust, the \tSeries E Preferred
Excess Shares shall not be entitled to \tshare in any portion of the assets
of the Trust. At such time as \t(i) the Trust has received the necessary
shareholder \tapproval with respect to a voluntary liquidation of
dissolution \tof the Trust, or (ii) the Trust has become the subject of \tan
order of a court of competent jurisdiction compelling an \tinvoluntary
liquidation or dissolution of the Trust, such \tSeries E Preferred Excess
Shares held in trust in the \tSeries E Preferred Excess Share Trust shall
without further \tact be extinguished and each Purported Beneficial
Transferee \twhose acquisition of Series E Preferred Shares resulted
in \tthe Series E Preferred Excess Shares which has been \textinguished
pursuant to this Section 10(c) shall without \tfurther act become a creditor
of the Trust. The amount by which \teach such Purported Beneficial Transferee
shall become a \tcreditor of the Trust with respect to its now-
extinguished \tinterest in the Trust (representing the number of Series
E \tPreferred Excess Shares held by the Trust attributable to a \tpurported
Transfer that resulted in the Series E Preferred \tExcess Shares) will be
equal to the lesser of (a) that \tamount of the distributable assets of the
Trust to which such \tSeries E Preferred Excess Shares would be entitled if
such \tSeries E Preferred Excess Shares were entitled to share \tratably in
the distributable assets of the Trust as Common \tShares, or (b) as
appropriate, either (1) the price \tper share paid by such Purported
Beneficial Transferee for the \tSeries E Preferred Shares which were
exchanged for \tSeries E Preferred Excess Shares, or (2) if the \tPurported
Beneficial Transferee did not give value for such \tSeries E Preferred Shares
(having received such through a \tgift, device or otherwise), a price per
share equal to the \tMarket Price on the date of the purported Transfer that
resulted \tin the Series E Preferred Excess Shares. Payment to
the \tPurported Beneficial Transferee shall be without interest and \tshall
be due concurrently with the date of first distribution of \tliquidation
proceeds to the holders of Equity Shares. If the \tTrust causes such
liquidation or dissolution to be revoked or \totherwise rescinded any Series
E Preferred Excess Shares \tpreviously automatically extinguished pursuant to
this \tSection 10(c) shall be automatically revived and  ---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tany Purported Beneficial Transferees shall without further
act \tcease to be creditors of the Trust as otherwise provided above.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(d) _Voting Rights._ The holders of Series
E \tPreferred Excess Shares shall not be entitled to vote on any \tmatters
(except as required by the General Laws of the State of \tMaryland).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(e) _Restrictions on Transfers; Designation
of \tBeneficiary._   
   

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(A) Series E Preferred Excess Shares shall not
be \ttransferable. The Trust may designate a Beneficiary of an \tinterest in
the Series E Preferred Excess Share Trust \t(representing the number of
Series E Preferred Excess \tShares held by the Series E Preferred Excess
Share Trust \tattributable to a purported Transfer that resulted in
the \tSeries E Preferred Excess Shares), if the shares of \tSeries E
Preferred Excess Shares held in trust in the \tSeries E Preferred Excess
Share Trust would not be \tSeries E Preferred Excess Shares in the hands of
such \tBeneficiary. The Purported Beneficial Transferee may receive
a \tprice for its interest in the Series E Preferred Shares \twhich were
exchanged for Series E Preferred Excess Shares \tprovided that the Purported
Beneficial Transferee does not \treceive a price that reflects a price per
share for such \tSeries E Preferred Shares that exceeds (i) the price \tper
share such Purported Beneficial Transferee paid for the \tSeries E Preferred
Shares in the purported Transfer that \tresulted in the Series E Preferred
Excess Shares, or \t(ii) if the Purported Beneficial Transferee did not
give \tvalue for such Series E Preferred Shares (through a gift, \tdevise or
otherwise), a price per share equal to the Market \tPrice on the date of the
purported Transfer that resulted in the \tSeries E Preferred Excess Shares.
Upon such transfer of an \tinterest in the Series E Preferred Excess Share
Trust, the \tcorresponding shares of Series E Preferred Excess Shares
in \tthe Series E Preferred Excess Share Trust shall be \tautomatically
exchanged for an equal number of Series E \tPreferred Shares, and such Series
E Preferred Shares shall \tbe transferred of record to the Beneficiary of the
interest in \tthe Series E Preferred Excess Share Trust designated by
the \tTrust as described above if such Series E Preferred Shares \twould not
be Series E Preferred Excess Shares in the hands \tof such Beneficiary.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(B) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a
Purported \tBeneficial Transferee receives a price for its interest in
the \tSeries E Preferred Shares which were exchanged for \tSeries E
Preferred Excess Shares that exceeds the amount \tallowable under
subparagraph (A) of Section 10(e), \tsuch Purported Beneficial Transferee
shall pay, or cause to be \tpaid, such excess to the Trust, or, at the
Trusts sole \telection, such excess shall be offset against any
future \tdistributions payable to such Purported Beneficial Transferee.  
   

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(f) _Purchase Right in Series E Preferred
Excess \tShares._ Shares of Series E Preferred Excess Shares \tshall be
deemed to have been offered for sale to the Trust, or \tits designee at a
price per share equal to the lesser of \t(i) the price per share in the
transaction that created \tsuch Series E Preferred Excess Shares (or, in the
case of \tdevisee or gift, the Market Price at the time of such devise
or \tgift) and (ii) the Market Price on the date the Trust, or \tits
designee, accepts such offer. Subject to the satisfaction of \tany applicable
requirements of the General Laws of the State of \tMaryland, the Trust shall
have the right to accept such offer \tfor a period of ninety days after the
later of (i) the date \tof the Transfer that resulted in such Series E
Preferred \tExcess Shares and (ii) the date the Board of
Trustees \tdetermines in good faith that a Transfer resulting in \tSeries E
Preferred Excess Shares has occurred, if the Trust \tdoes not receive a
notice of such Transfer pursuant to \tSection 10(e).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(g) _Further Authority._ Nothing contained in
this \tSection 10 or in any other provision of these
Articles \tSupplementary or the Declaration of Trust shall limit
the \tauthority of the Board of Trustees to take such other action as \tit
in its sole discretion deems necessary or advisable to \tprotect the Trust
and the interests of the shareholders by \tmaintaining the Trusts
eligibility to be, and preserving \tthe Trusts status as, a qualified REIT
under the Code.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(h) _New York Stock Exchange._ Nothing in
this \tSection 10 precludes the settlement of transactions entered \tinto
through the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange. As \tprovided in this
Section 10,  ---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tunder certain circumstances, a Transfer of Series
E \tPreferred Shares may result in the automatic exchange of the \tSeries E
Preferred Shares for an equal number of \tSeries E Preferred Excess Shares.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(i) _Non-applicability of Article VII
of \tDeclaration of Trust to Series E Preferred Shares._ The \trestrictions
on transfer and ownership of Shares contained in \tArticle VII of the
Declaration of Trust and the other \tprovisions of such Article VII shall not
apply to the \tSeries E Preferred Shares.  
    

   _SECOND:_ Under a power contained in Article VI of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, the Board by resolution by resolution adopted on  ,  2001, classified 4,250,000 Preferred Shares (as defined in the Declaration of Trust) as Series E Preferred Excess Shares, $.01 par value per share, with the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of shares set forth in Article FIRST and provided for the issuance thereof.

The term "equity securities" shall not include convertible debt securities.  

  (3) _Distributions._  

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) Subject to the rights of series of Preferred
Shares  which are or may from time to time come into existence, holders  of
Series F Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive,  when and as declared
by the Board of Trustees, out of funds  legally available for the payment of
distributions, cumulative  preferential cash distributions at the rate of
$1.96875 per  annum per share. Such distributions shall be cumulative from
the  last date on which any dividends were paid with respect to  Series C
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock of Spieker  Properties, Inc. for which
Series F Preferred Shares were  exchanged in connection with the merger of
Spieker Properties,  Inc. with and into the Trust and shall be payable
quarterly in  arrears on the last day of January, April, July and October
or,  if not a business day, the next succeeding business day (each, a 
"Distribution Payment Date"). Any distribution payable  on Series F Preferred
Shares for any partial distribution  period will be computed on the basis of
a 360-day year  consisting of twelve 30-day months. Distributions will be 
payable to holders of record as they appear in the records of  the Trust at
the close of business on the applicable record  date, which shall be on such
date designated by the Board of  Trustees of the Trust for the payment of
distributions that is  not more than 50 nor less than 10 days prior to such 
Distribution Payment Date (each, a "Distribution Record  Date").  
      
      |   (b) Distributions on Series F Preferred Shares will 
accrue whether or not the Trust has earnings, whether or not  there are funds
legally available for the payment of such  distributions and whether or not  ---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tsuch distributions are declared. No interest, or sum of
money in \tlieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of
any \tdistribution payment or payments on Series F Preferred \tShares which
may be in arrears. Holders of the Series F \tPreferred Shares will not be
entitled to distributions in excess \tof the full cumulative distributions as
described above.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(c) If, for any taxable year, the Trust elects
to \tdesignate as "capital gain dividends" (as defined in \tSection 857 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as \tamended, or any successor revenue
code or section (the \t"Code")) any portion (the "Capital Gains \tAmount")
of the total distributions (as determined for \tfederal income tax purposes)
paid or made available for the year \tto holders of all classes of shares of
beneficial interest (the \t"Total Distributions"), then the portion of
the \tCapital Gains Amount that shall be allocable to holders of \tSeries F
Preferred Shares shall be in the same portion that \tthe Total Distributions
paid or made available to the holders of \tSeries F Preferred Shares for the
year bears to the Total \tDistributions.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(d) If any Series F Preferred Shares are
outstanding, \tno distributions shall be declared or paid or set apart
for \tpayment on any class or series of shares of beneficial interest \tof
the Trust ranking, as to distributions, on a parity with or \tjunior to
Series F Preferred Shares for any period unless \tfull cumulative
distributions have been or contemporaneously are \tdeclared and paid or
declared and a sum sufficient for the \tpayment thereof set apart for such
payments on Series F \tPreferred Shares for all past distribution periods and
the then \tcurrent distribution period. When distributions are not paid
in \tfull (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not set \tapart)
upon the Series F Preferred Shares and the shares of \tany other series of
shares of beneficial interest ranking on \tparity as to distributions with
Series F Preferred Shares, \tall distributions declared upon Series F
Preferred Shares \tand any other series of shares of beneficial interest
ranking on \ta parity as to distributions with Series F Preferred
Shares \tshall be declared pro rata so that the amount of
distributions \tdeclared per share on Series F Preferred Shares and
such \tother series of shares of beneficial interest shall in all
cases \tbear to each other the same ratio that accrued distributions
per \tshare on Series F Preferred Shares and such other series of \tshares
of beneficial interest bear to each other.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(e) Except as provided in Section 3(d), unless
full \tcumulative distributions on Series F Preferred Shares have \tbeen or
contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and \ta sum sufficient
for the payment thereof set apart for payment \tfor all past dividend periods
and the then current dividend \tperiod, no distributions (other than in
Common Shares or other \tshares of beneficial interest ranking junior to
Series F \tPreferred Shares as to distributions and amounts
upon \tliquidation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment \tor
other distribution shall be declared or made upon the Common \tShares, Series
A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred \tShares, Series C Preferred Shares,
Series E Preferred \tShares, Series G Preferred Shares and Series
H \tPreferred Shares or any other shares of beneficial interest of \tthe
Trust ranking junior to or on a parity with Series F \tPreferred Shares as to
distributions or amounts upon \tliquidation, nor shall any Common Shares,
Series A Preferred \tShares, Series B Preferred Shares, Series C
Preferred \tShares, Series E Preferred Shares, Series G Preferred \tShares
and Series H Preferred Shares or any other shares of \tbeneficial interest of
the Trust ranking junior to or on a \tparity with Series F Preferred Shares
as to distributions \tor amounts upon liquidation be redeemed, purchased or
otherwise \tacquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or
made \tavailable for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such \tshares
of beneficial interest) by the Trust (except by \tconversion into or exchange
for other shares of beneficial \tinterest of the Trust ranking junior to
Series F Preferred \tShares as to distributions and amounts upon
liquidation).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(f) Any distribution payment made on Series
F \tPreferred Shares shall first be credited against the earliest \taccrued
but unpaid distribution due with respect to \tSeries F Preferred Shares which
remains payable.  
    

  (4) _Liquidation Rights._  

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(a) Subject to the rights of series of Preferred
Shares \twhich are or may from time to time come into existence, upon
any \tvoluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up \tof
the affairs of the Trust, then, before any distribution or \tpayment shall be
made to the holders of any Common Shares or  ---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tany other class or series of shares of beneficial interest
of \tthe Trust ranking junior to Series F Preferred Shares in \tthe
distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or \twinding up of
the affairs of the Trust, the holders of \tSeries F Preferred Shares shall be
entitled to receive out \tof assets of the Trust legally available for
distribution to \tshareholders, liquidation distributions in the amount of
the \tliquidation preference of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal \tto
all distributions accrued and unpaid thereon. After payment \tof the full
amount of the liquidating distributions to which \tthey are entitled, the
holders of Series F Preferred Shares \twill have no right or claim to any of
the remaining assets of \tthe Trust. In the event that, upon any such
voluntary or \tinvoluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the \taffairs of the Trust, the available assets of the Trust
are \tinsufficient to pay the amount of the liquidation distributions \ton
all outstanding Series F Preferred Shares and the \tcorresponding amounts
payable on all shares of other classes or \tseries of shares of beneficial
interest of the Trust ranking on \ta parity with Series F Preferred Shares in
the distribution \tof assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the \taffairs of the Trust ("Parity Shares"), then the \tholders of
Series F Preferred Shares and Parity Shares \tshall share ratably in any such
distribution of assets in \tproportion to the full liquidating distributions
to which they \twould otherwise be respectively entitled.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(b) A consolidation or merger of the Trust with or
into \tany other entity or entities, or a sale, lease, conveyance
or \tdisposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the \tTrust or
the effectuation by the Trust of a transaction or \tseries of related
transactions in which more than 50% of the \tvoting power of the Trust is
disposed of, shall not be deemed to \tbe a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the affairs of \tthe Trust within the meaning of this Section
4.  
    

  (5) _Redemption._  

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(a) Series F Preferred Shares are not
redeemable \tprior to October 10, 2002. On and after October 10, \t2002, the
Trust at its option upon not less than 30 nor more \tthan 90 days written
notice may redeem outstanding \tSeries F Preferred Shares, in whole or in
part, at any time \tor from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of
$25.00 \tper share, plus an amount equal to all distributions accrued
and \tunpaid thereon to the date fixed for redemption, without \tinterest.
The redemption price of Series F Preferred Shares \t(other than the portion
thereof consisting of accrued and unpaid \tdistributions) is payable solely
out of proceeds (without giving \teffect to any temporary use of such
proceeds) from the sale of \tother shares of beneficial interest of the
Trust, which may \tinclude Common Shares, Preferred Shares, depositary
shares, \tinterests, participations or other ownership interests in
the \tTrust however designated (other than debt securities converted \tinto
or exchangeable for shares of beneficial interest), and any \trights,
warrants or options to purchase any thereof. Holders of \tSeries F Preferred
Shares to be redeemed shall surrender \tsuch Series F Preferred Shares at the
place designated in \tsuch notice and shall be entitled to the redemption
price and \tany accrued and unpaid distributions payable upon
such \tredemption following such surrender. If fewer than all of
the \toutstanding Series F Preferred Shares are to be redeemed, \tthe number
of shares to be redeemed will be determined by the \tTrust and such shares
may be redeemed pro rata from the holders \tof record of such shares in
proportion to the number of such \tshares held by such holders (with
adjustments to avoid \tredemption of fractional shares) or by lot in a
manner \tdetermined by the Trust.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(b) Unless full cumulative distributions on
all \tSeries F Preferred Shares and Parity Shares shall have been \tor
contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum \tsufficient
for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all \tpast distribution
periods and the then current distribution \tperiod, no Series F Preferred
Shares or Parity Shares shall \tbe redeemed unless all outstanding Series F
Preferred \tShares and Parity Shares are simultaneously redeemed;
provided, \thowever, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase
or \tacquisition of Series F Preferred Shares or Parity Shares \tpursuant to
a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms \tto holders of all
outstanding Series F Preferred Shares or \tParity Shares, as the case may be.
Furthermore, unless full \tcumulative distributions on all outstanding Series
F \tPreferred Shares and Parity Shares have been or \tcontemporaneously are
declared and paid or declared and a sum \tsufficient for the payment thereof
set apart for payment for all \tpast distribution periods and the then
current distribution \tperiod, the Trust shall not purchase or otherwise
acquire \tdirectly or indirectly any Series F Preferred Shares or
Parity \tShares (except by conversion into or exchange for  ---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tshares of beneficial interest of the Trust ranking junior
to \tSeries F Preferred Shares and Parity Shares as to \tdistributions and
amounts upon liquidation).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(c) Notice of redemption will be mailed at
least \t30 days but not more than 90 days before the \tredemption date to
each holder of record of Series F \tPreferred Shares at the address shown on
the stock transfer \tbooks of the Trust. Each notice shall state: (i)
the \tredemption date; (ii) the number of Series F Preferred \tShares to be
redeemed; (iii) the redemption price per \tshare; (iv) the place or places
where certificates for \tSeries F Preferred Shares are to be surrendered for
payment \tof the redemption price; and (v) that distributions on \tSeries F
Preferred Shares will cease to accrue on such \tredemption date. If fewer
than all Series F Preferred \tShares are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to
each such holder \tthereof shall also specify the number of Series F
Preferred \tShares to be redeemed from each such holder. If notice
of \tredemption of any Series F Preferred Shares has been given \tand if the
funds necessary for such redemption have been set \taside by the Trust in
trust for the benefit of the holders of \tSeries F Preferred Shares so called
for redemption, then \tfrom and after the redemption date, distributions will
cease to \taccrue on such Series F Preferred Shares, such \tSeries F
Preferred Shares shall no longer be deemed \toutstanding and all rights of
the holders of such shares will \tterminate, except the right to receive the
redemption price.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(d) The holders of Series F Preferred Shares at
the \tclose of business on a Distribution Record Date will be entitled \tto
receive the distribution payable with respect to such \tSeries F Preferred
Shares on the corresponding Distribution \tPayment Date notwithstanding the
redemption thereof between such \tDistribution Record Date and the
corresponding Distribution \tPayment Date or the Trusts default in the
payment of the \tdistribution due. Except as provided above, the Trust will

trustees then constituting the Board of Trustees \tof the Trust will be
increased by two, and the holders of \tSeries F Preferred Shares, voting

Shares.

   \t  \t|  \t(d) _Remedies for Breach._ If the Board of
Trustees \tor its designees at any time determines in good faith that
a \tTransfer has taken place in violation of Section 9(b) or \tthat a Person

      |   (f) _Owners Required to Provide Information._ Prior  to
the Restriction Termination Date:  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (A) Every holder of Series F Preferred Shares who is  a

not an individual for purposes of Section 542(a)(2) of the Code  (as modified
by Section 856(h) of the Code) or is an  underwriter which participates in a
public offering of the  Series F Preferred Shares for a period of 90 days

the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,  as amended (the "Code"). No Person may 
(1) Beneficially Own or Constructively Own Series F  Preferred Shares in
excess of 9.9% of the value of the  outstanding Equity Shares of the Trust;
or (2) Beneficially  Own Series F Preferred  |   ---|---|--- 
      |   Shares that would result in the Trusts being "closely  held"
under Section 856(h) of the Code. Any Person who  attempts to Beneficially
Own or Constructively Own Series F  Preferred Shares in excess of the above
limitations must  immediately notify the Trust. All capitalized terms in
this  legend have the meanings defined in the Trusts Declaration  of Trust,
as the same may be further amended from time to time,  a copy of which,

  (10) _Series F Preferred Excess Shares._ 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) _Ownership in Trust._ Upon any purported Transfer 
that results in Series F Preferred Excess Shares pursuant  to Section 9(c),
such Series F Preferred Excess Shares  shall be deemed to have been
transferred to the Trust, as  Trustee of the Series F Preferred Excess Share
Trust for  the exclusive benefit of such Beneficiary or Beneficiaries to 
whom an interest in such Series F Preferred Excess Shares may  later be
transferred pursuant to Section 10(e).  Series F Preferred Excess Shares so
held in trust shall be  issued and outstanding shares of the Trust. The
Purported Record  Transferee shall have no rights in such Series F
Preferred  Excess Shares except the right to receive a price for its 
interest in the Equity Shares which were exchanged for  Series F Preferred
Excess Shares. The Purported Beneficial  Transferee shall have no rights in
such Series F Preferred  Excess Shares except as provided in Section 10(e).  
      
      |   (b) _Distribution Rights._ Series F Preferred  Excess
Shares shall not be entitled to any distributions. Any  distribution paid
prior to the discovery by the Trust that the  Series F Preferred Shares have
been exchanged for  Series F Preferred Excess Shares shall be repaid to the 
Trust upon demand, and any distribution declared but unpaid  shall be
rescinded as void _ab initio_ with respect to such  Series F Preferred Excess
Shares.  
      
      |   (c) _Rights Upon Liquidation._ In the event of any 
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up  of, or any
distribution of the assets of, the Trust, the  Series F Preferred Excess
Shares shall not be entitled to  share in any portion of the assets of the
Trust. At such time as  (i) the Trust has received the necessary
shareholder  approval with respect to a voluntary liquidation of
dissolution  of the Trust, or (ii) the Trust has become the subject of  an
order of a court of competent jurisdiction compelling an  involuntary
liquidation or dissolution of the Trust, such  Series F Preferred Excess
Shares held in trust in the  Series F Preferred Excess Share Trust shall
without further  act be extinguished and each Purported Beneficial
Transferee  whose acquisition of Series F Preferred Shares resulted in  the
Series F Preferred Excess Shares which has been  extinguished pursuant to
this Section 10(c) shall without  further act become a creditor of the Trust.
The amount by which  each such Purported Beneficial Transferee shall become
a  creditor of the Trust with respect to its now-extinguished  interest in
the Trust (representing the number of Series F  Preferred Excess Shares held
by the Trust attributable to a  purported Transfer that resulted in the
Series F Preferred  Excess Shares) will be equal to the lesser of (a) that 
amount of the distributable assets of the Trust to which such  Series F
Preferred Excess Shares would be entitled if such  Series F Preferred Excess
Shares were entitled to share  ratably in the distributable assets of the
Trust as Common  Shares, or (b) as appropriate, either (1) the price  per
share paid by such Purported Beneficial Transferee for the  Series F
Preferred Shares which were exchanged for  Series F Preferred Excess Shares,
or (2) if the  Purported Beneficial Transferee did not give value for such 
Series F Preferred Shares (having received such through a  gift, device or
otherwise), a price per share equal to the  Market Price on the date of the
purported Transfer that resulted  in the Series F Preferred Excess Shares.
Payment to the  Purported Beneficial Transferee shall be without interest
and  shall be due concurrently with the date of first distribution of 
liquidation proceeds to the holders of Equity Shares. If the  Trust causes
such liquidation or dissolution to be revoked or  otherwise rescinded any
Series F Preferred Excess Shares  previously automatically extinguished
pursuant to this Section  10(c) shall be automatically revived and any
Purported  Beneficial Transferees shall without further act cease to be 
creditors of the Trust as otherwise provided above.       \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(d) _Voting Rights._ The holders of Series
F \tPreferred Excess Shares shall not be entitled to vote on any \tmatters
(except as required by the General Laws of the State of \tMaryland).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(e) _Restrictions on Transfers; Designation
of \tBeneficiary._   
   

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(A) Series F Preferred Excess Shares shall not
be \ttransferable. The Trust may designate a Beneficiary of an \tinterest in
the Series F Preferred Excess Share Trust \t(representing the number of
Series F Preferred Excess \tShares held by the Series F Preferred Excess
Share Trust \tattributable to a purported Transfer that resulted in
the \tSeries F Preferred Excess Shares), if the shares of \tSeries F
Preferred Excess Shares held in trust in the \tSeries F Preferred Excess
Share Trust would not be \tSeries F Preferred Excess Shares in the hands of
such \tBeneficiary. The Purported Beneficial Transferee may receive
a \tprice for its interest in the Series F Preferred Shares \twhich were
exchanged for Series F Preferred Excess Shares \tprovided that the Purported
Beneficial Transferee does not \treceive a price that reflects a price per
share for such \tSeries F Preferred Shares that exceeds (i) the price \tper
share such Purported Beneficial Transferee paid for the \tSeries F Preferred
Shares in the purported Transfer that \tresulted in the Series F Preferred
Excess Shares, or \t(ii) if the Purported Beneficial Transferee did not
give \tvalue for such Series F Preferred Shares (through a gift, \tdevise or
otherwise), a price per share equal to the Market \tPrice on the date of the
purported Transfer that resulted in the \tSeries F Preferred Excess Shares.
Upon such transfer of an \tinterest in the Series F Preferred Excess Share
Trust, the \tcorresponding shares of Series F Preferred Excess Shares
in \tthe Series F Preferred Excess Share Trust shall be \tautomatically
exchanged for an equal number of Series F \tPreferred Shares, and such Series
F Preferred Shares shall \tbe transferred of record to the Beneficiary of the
interest in \tthe Series F Preferred Excess Share Trust designated by
the \tTrust as described above if such Series F Preferred Shares \twould not
be Series F Preferred Excess Shares in the hands \tof such Beneficiary.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(B) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a
Purported \tBeneficial Transferee receives a price for its interest in
the \tSeries F Preferred Shares which were exchanged for \tSeries F
Preferred Excess Shares that exceeds the amount \tallowable under
subparagraph (A) of Section 10(e), \tsuch Purported Beneficial Transferee
shall pay, or cause to be \tpaid, such excess to the Trust, or, at the
Trusts sole \telection, such excess shall be offset against any
future \tdistributions payable to such Purported Beneficial Transferee.  
   

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(f) _Purchase Right in Series F Preferred
Excess \tShares._ Shares of Series F Preferred Excess Shares shall
be \tdeemed to have been offered for sale to the Trust, or its \tdesignee at
a price per share equal to the lesser of \t(i) the price per share in the
transaction that created \tsuch Series F Preferred Excess Shares (or, in the
case of \tdevisee or gift, the Market Price at the time of such devise
or \tgift) and (ii) the Market Price on the date the Trust, or \tits
designee, accepts such offer. Subject to the satisfaction of \tany applicable
requirements of the General Laws of the State of \tMaryland, the Trust shall
have the right to accept such offer \tfor a period of ninety days after the
later of (i) the date \tof the Transfer that resulted in such Series F
Preferred \tExcess Shares and (ii) the date the Board of
Trustees \tdetermines in good faith that a Transfer resulting in \tSeries F
Preferred Excess Shares has occurred, if the Trust \tdoes not receive a
notice of such Transfer pursuant to \tSection 10(e).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(g) _Further Authority._ Nothing contained in
this \tSection 10 or in any other provision of these
Articles \tSupplementary or the Declaration of Trust shall limit
the \tauthority of the Board of Trustees to take such other action as \tit
in its sole discretion deems necessary or advisable to \tprotect the Trust
and the interests of the shareholders by \tmaintaining the Trusts
eligibility to be, and preserving \tthe Trusts status as, a qualified REIT
under the Code.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(h) _New York Stock Exchange._ Nothing in
this \tSection 10 precludes the settlement of transactions entered \tinto
through the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange. As \tprovided in this
Section 10, under certain circumstances, a \tTransfer of Series F Preferred
Shares may result in the \tautomatic exchange of the Series F Preferred
Shares for an \tequal number of Series F Preferred Excess Shares.       \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(i) _Non-applicability of Article VII
of \tDeclaration of Trust to Series F Preferred Shares._ The \trestrictions
on transfer and ownership of Shares contained in \tArticle VII of the
Declaration of Trust and the other \tprovisions of such Article VII shall not
apply to the \tSeries F Preferred Shares.  
    

   _SECOND:_ Under a power contained in Article VI of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, the Board by resolution by resolution adopted on  ,  2001, classified 6,000,000 Preferred Shares (as defined in the Declaration of Trust) as Series F Preferred Excess Shares, $.01 par value per share, with the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of shares set forth in Article FIRST and provided for the issuance thereof.  

  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Trust has caused these Articles Supplementary to be executed under seal in its name and on its behalf by its President and attested to by its Secretary on this  day of , 2001.

 FORM OF ARTICLES SUPPLEMENTARY  

 ESTABLISHING AND FIXING THE RIGHTS AND PREFERENCES OF  

 SERIES G PREFERRED SHARES AND SERIES G PREFERRED EXCESS SHARES 

  

  Equity Office Properties Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust (the "Trust"), certifies to the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland that:  

   _FIRST:_ Under a power contained in Article VI of the Trusts Articles of Amendment and Restatement of Declaration of Trust, as amended (the "Declaration of Trust"), the Board of Trustees (the "Board"), by resolution duly adopted on  ,  2001, classified 1,500,000 Preferred Shares (as defined in the Declaration of Trust) as Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (the "Series G Preferred Shares"), with the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of shares as follows and provided for the issuance thereof:  

  (1) _Designation and Number._ The designation of Series G Preferred Shares described in Article FIRST hereof shall be "Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (par value $.01 per share)." The number of Series G Preferred Shares to be authorized shall be 1,500,000.  

  (2) _Rank._ The Series G Preferred Shares shall, with respect to distribution rights and rights upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Trust, rank (a) senior to all classes or series of Common Shares (as defined in the Declaration of Trust) and to all equity securities the terms of which provide that such equity securities shall rank junior to such Series G Preferred Shares; (b) on a parity with all equity securities issued by the Trust, including the 8.98% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (the "Series A Preferred Shares"), the 5.25% Series B Convertible, Cumulative Preferred Shares (the "Series B Preferred Shares"), the 8 5/8% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest (the "Series C Preferred Shares"), Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (the "Series E Preferred Shares"), Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (the "Series F Preferred Shares") and Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (the "Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares") classified pursuant to resolutions duly adopted by the Board, other than those referred to in clauses (a) and (c); and (c) junior to all equity securities issued by the Trust which rank senior to the Series G Preferred Shares. The term "equity securities" shall not include convertible debt securities.  

  (3) _Distributions._  

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) Subject to the rights of series of Preferred
Shares  which may from time to time come into existence, holders of  Series
G Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive,  when and as declared by the
Board of Trustees, out of funds  legally available for the payment of
distributions, cumulative  preferential cash distributions at the rate of
$3.84375 per  annum per share. Such distributions shall be cumulative from
the  last date on which any dividends were paid with respect to  Series D
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock of Spieker  Properties, Inc. for which
Series G Preferred Shares were  exchanged in connection with the merger of
Spieker Properties,  Inc. with and into the Trust and shall be payable
quarterly in  arrears on the last day of March, June, September and
December  or, if not a business day, the next succeeding business day 
(each, a "Distribution Payment Date"). Any  distribution payable on Series G
Preferred Shares for any  partial distribution period will be computed on the
basis of a  360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Distributions 
will be payable to holders of record as they appear in the  records of the
Trust at the close of business on the applicable  record date, which shall be
on such date designated by the Board  of Trustees of the Trust for the
payment of distributions that  is not more than 50 nor less than 10 days
prior to such  Distribution Payment Date (each, a "Distribution Record 
Date"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth  herein, each
Series G Preferred Share shall also accumulate  all accrued and unpaid
distributions, whether or not declared,  up to the exchange date on  ---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tany Series G Preferred Unit (as defined in the
Second \tAmended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of
EOP \tOperating Limited Partnership, as amended (the
"Partnership \tAgreement") and for purposes of these
Articles \tSupplementary such accrued and unpaid distributions on
such \tSeries G Preferred Units shall be deemed to constitute \taccrued and
unpaid distributions with respect to past \tdistribution periods on Series G
Preferred Shares.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(b) Distributions on Series G Preferred Shares
will \taccrue whether or not the Trust has earnings, whether or not \tthere
are funds legally available for the payment of such \tdistributions and
whether or not such distributions are \tdeclared. No interest, or sum of
money in lieu of interest, \tshall be payable in respect of any distribution
payment or \tpayments on Series G Preferred Shares which may be
in \tarrears. Holders of the Series G Preferred Shares will not \tbe
entitled to distributions in excess of the full cumulative \tdistributions as
described above.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(c) If, for any taxable year, the Trust elects
to \tdesignate as "capital gain dividends" (as defined in \tSection 857 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as \tamended, or any successor revenue
code or section (the \t"Code")) any portion (the "Capital Gains \tAmount")
of the total distributions (as determined for \tfederal income tax purposes)
paid or made available for the year \tto holders of all classes of shares of
beneficial interest (the \t"Total Distributions"), then the portion of
the \tCapital Gains Amount that shall be allocable to holders of \tSeries G
Preferred Shares shall be in the same portion that \tthe Total Distributions
paid or made available to the holders of \tSeries G Preferred Shares for the
year bears to the Total \tDistributions.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(d) If any Series G Preferred Shares are
outstanding, \tno distributions shall be declared or paid or set apart
for \tpayment on any class or series of shares of beneficial interest \tof
the Trust ranking, as to distributions, on a parity with or \tjunior to
Series G Preferred Shares for any period unless \tfull cumulative
distributions have been or contemporaneously are \tdeclared and paid or
declared and a sum sufficient for the \tpayment thereof set apart for such
payments on Series G \tPreferred Shares for all past distribution periods and
the then \tcurrent distribution period. When distributions are not paid
in \tfull (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not set \tapart)
upon the Series G Preferred Shares and the shares of \tany other series of
shares of beneficial interest ranking on \tparity as to distributions with
Series G Preferred Shares, \tall distributions declared upon Series G
Preferred Shares \tand any other series of shares of beneficial interest
ranking on \ta parity as to distributions with Series G Preferred
Shares \tshall be declared pro rata so that the amount of
distributions \tdeclared per share on Series G Preferred Shares and
such \tother series of shares of beneficial interest shall in all
cases \tbear to each other the same ratio that accrued distributions
per \tshare on Series G Preferred Shares and such other series of \tshares
of beneficial interest bear to each other.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(e) Except as provided in Section 3(d), unless
full \tcumulative distributions on Series G Preferred Shares have \tbeen or
contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and \ta sum sufficient
for the payment thereof set apart for payment \tfor all past dividend periods
and the then current dividend \tperiod, no distributions (other than in
Common Shares or other \tshares of beneficial interest ranking junior to
Series G \tPreferred Shares as to distributions and amounts
upon \tliquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the \tTrust)
shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment or \tother distribution
shall be declared or made upon the Common \tShares, Series A Preferred
Shares, Series B Preferred \tShares, Series C Preferred Shares, Series E
Preferred \tShares, Series F Preferred Shares and Series H \tPreferred
Shares or any other shares of beneficial interest of \tthe Trust ranking
junior to or on a parity with Series G \tPreferred Shares as to distributions
or amounts upon \tliquidation, nor shall any Common Shares, Series
A \tPreferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares, Series C \tPreferred
Shares, Series E Preferred Shares, Series F \tPreferred Shares and Series H
Preferred Shares or any other \tshares of beneficial interest of the Trust
ranking junior to or \ton a parity with Series G Preferred Shares as
to \tdistributions or amounts upon liquidation, dissolution or \twinding up
of the affairs of the Trust be redeemed, purchased or \totherwise acquired
for any consideration (or any moneys be paid \tto or made available for a
sinking fund for the redemption of \tany such shares of beneficial interest)
by the Trust (except by \tconversion into or exchange for other shares of
beneficial \tinterest of the Trust ranking junior to Series G
Preferred \tShares as to distributions and amounts upon
liquidation, \tdissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Trust).       \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(f) Any distribution payment made on Series
G \tPreferred Shares shall first be credited against the earliest \taccrued
but unpaid distribution due with respect to \tSeries G Preferred Shares which
remains payable.  
    

  (4) _Liquidation Rights._  

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(a) Subject to the rights of series of Preferred
Shares \tranking on a parity or senior to the Series G Preferred \tShares as
to amounts upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up \tof the affairs of
the Trust which may from time to time come \tinto existence, upon any
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, \tdissolution or winding up of the

of the \tliquidation distributions on all outstanding Series G \tPreferred
Shares and the corresponding amounts payable on all \tshares of other classes
or series of shares of beneficial \tinterest of the Trust ranking on a parity
with Series G \tPreferred Shares as to distributions and amounts upon
any \tliquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the \tTrust,

Preferred Shares, Series F \tPreferred Shares, Series G Preferred Shares

or \tdisposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the \tTrust or
the effectuation by the Trust of a transaction or \tseries of related
transactions in which more than 50% of the \tvoting power of the Trust is
disposed of, shall not be deemed to \tbe a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the affairs of \tthe Trust within the meaning of this Section

  (5) _Redemption._  

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(a) Series G Preferred Shares are not
redeemable \tprior to April 20, 2003. On and after April 20, 2003, \tthe
Trust at its option upon not less than 30 nor more than \t60 days written
notice may redeem outstanding \tSeries G Preferred Shares, in whole or in
part, at any time \tor from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of
$50.00 \tper share, plus an amount equal to all distributions accrued
and \tunpaid thereon, whether or not declared, to the date fixed
for \tredemption, without interest. The redemption price of \tSeries G
Preferred Shares (other than the portion thereof \tconsisting of accrued and
unpaid distributions) is payable \tsolely out of proceeds (without giving
effect to any temporary \tuse of such proceeds) from the sale of other shares
of \tbeneficial interest of the Trust, which may include Common \tShares,
Preferred Shares, depositary shares, interests, \tparticipations or other
ownership interests in the Trust however \tdesignated (other than debt
securities converted into or \texchangeable for shares of beneficial
interest), and any rights, \twarrants or options to purchase any thereof.
Holders of \tSeries G Preferred Shares to be redeemed shall surrender \tsuch
Series G Preferred Shares at the place designated in \tsuch notice and shall
be entitled to the redemption price and \tany accrued and unpaid
distributions payable upon such \tredemption following such surrender. If
fewer than all of the \toutstanding Series G Preferred Shares are to be
redeemed, \tthe number of shares to be redeemed will be determined by
the \tTrust and such shares may be redeemed pro rata from the holders \tof
record of such shares in proportion to the number of such \tshares held by
such holders (with adjustments to avoid \tredemption of fractional shares) or
by lot in a manner \tdetermined by the Trust.       \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(b) Unless full cumulative distributions on
all \tSeries G Preferred Shares and Parity Shares shall have been \tor
contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum \tsufficient
for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all \tpast distribution
periods and the then current distribution \tperiod, no Series G Preferred
Shares or Parity Shares shall \tbe redeemed unless all outstanding Series G
Preferred \tShares and Parity Shares are simultaneously redeemed;
provided, \thowever, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase
or \tacquisition of Series G Preferred Shares or Parity Shares \tpursuant to
a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms \tto holders of all
outstanding Series G Preferred Shares or \tParity Shares, as the case may be.
Furthermore, unless full \tcumulative distributions on all outstanding Series
G \tPreferred Shares and Parity Shares have been or \tcontemporaneously are
declared and paid or declared and a sum \tsufficient for the payment thereof
set apart for payment for all \tpast distribution periods and the then
current distribution \tperiod, the Trust shall not purchase or otherwise
acquire \tdirectly or indirectly any Series G Preferred Shares or
Parity \tShares (except by conversion into or exchange for shares
of \tbeneficial interest of the Trust ranking junior to Series G \tPreferred
Shares and Parity Shares as to distributions and \tamounts upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the \taffairs of the Trust).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(c) Notice of redemption will be mailed and
telecopied (if \tpossible) at least 30 days but not more than 60
days \tbefore the redemption date to each holder of record of \tSeries G
Preferred Shares at the address or telecopier \tnumber shown on the stock
transfer books of the Trust. Each \tnotice shall state: (i) the redemption
date; (ii) the \tnumber of Series G Preferred Shares to be redeemed; \t(iii)
the redemption price per share; (iv) the place \tor places where certificates
for Series G Preferred Shares \tare to be surrendered for payment of the
redemption price; and \t(v) that distributions on Series G Preferred
Shares \twill cease to accrue on such redemption date. If fewer than
all \tSeries G Preferred Shares are to be redeemed, the notice \tmailed and
telecopied (if possible) to each such holder thereof \tshall also specify the
number of Series G Preferred Shares \tto be redeemed from each such holder.
If notice of redemption of \tany Series G Preferred Shares has been given and
if the \tfunds necessary for such redemption have been set aside by
the \tTrust in trust for the benefit of the holders of Series G \tPreferred
Shares so called redemption, then from and after the \tredemption date,
distributions will cease to accrue on such \tSeries G Preferred Shares, such
Series G Preferred \tShares shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all
rights of \tthe holders of such shares will terminate, except the right
to \treceive the redemption price.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(d) The holders of Series G Preferred Shares at
the \tclose of business on a Distribution Record Date will be entitled \tto
receive the distribution payable with respect to such \tSeries G Preferred
Shares on the corresponding Distribution \tPayment Date notwithstanding the
redemption thereof between such \tDistribution Record Date and the
corresponding Distribution \tPayment Date or the Trusts default in the
payment of the \tdistribution due.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(e) Series G Preferred Shares will not be subject
to \tany sinking fund or mandatory redemption, except as provided
in \tSection 9.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(f) The redemption price shall be payable to the
holders \tof the Series G Preferred Shares upon surrender of
the \tcertificate evidencing the Series G Preferred Shares by \tsuch holders
at the place designated in the notice of \tredemption. If fewer than all
Series G Preferred Shares \tevidenced by any certificate is being redeemed, a
new \tcertificate shall be issued upon surrender of the
certificate \tevidencing all Series G Preferred Shares, evidencing
the \tunredeemed Series G Preferred Shares without cost to the \tholder
thereof. If any redemption date is not a business day, \tthen payment of the
redemption price payable on such redemption \tdate will be made on the next
succeeding business day (and \twithout any interest or other payment in
respect of any such \tdelay) except that, if such business day falls in the
next \tcalendar year, such payment will be made on the
immediately \tpreceding business day, in each case with the same force
and \teffect as if made on such redemption date. If payment of
the \tredemption price or any accumulated or unpaid distributions
in \trespect of the Series G Preferred Shares is improperly \twithheld or
refused and not paid by the Trust, distributions on \tsuch Series G Preferred
Shares will continue to accumulate \tfrom the original redemption date to the
date of payment, in \twhich case the actual payment date will be considered
the date \tfixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the
applicable \tredemption price and any accumulated and unpaid distributions.   (6) _Voting Rights._

constituting the \tBoard of Trustees of the Trust will be increased by two,

all such \tdistributions have been declared and paid in full or
deposited \tirrevocably in trust for the benefit of holders of Series
G \tPreferred Shares. At any such meeting, the Preferred Share \tTrustees
shall be elected by plurality vote on the basis of one \tvote per $25.00 of

into a share exchange that affects Series G \tPreferred Shares, or
consolidate with or merge the Trust with or \tinto any other entity or
convey, lease or transfer all of its \tassets as an entirety, unless in each
such case each \tSeries G Preferred Share remains outstanding without
a \tmaterial adverse change to its terms, preferences, privileges, \tvoting
powers and rights or is converted into or exchanged for \tpreferred shares of
the surviving entity having preferences, \tconversion and other rights,
voting powers, restrictions, \tlimitations as to distributions,
qualifications and terms or \tconditions of redemption thereof identical to
that of a \tSeries G Preferred Share, or (ii) authorize, \treclassify,
create, or increase the authorized amount of any \tclass of shares of
beneficial interest having rights senior to \tSeries G Preferred Shares with
respect to the payment of \tdistributions or amounts upon liquidation,
dissolution or \twinding up of the affairs of the Trust. However, the Trust
may \tcreate additional classes of Parity Shares and shares of \tbeneficial
interest ranking junior to Series G Preferred \tShares as to distributions or
amounts upon liquidation, \tdissolution or winding up of the affairs of the
Trust \t("Junior Shares"), increase the authorized number of \tParity Shares
and Junior Shares and issue additional series of \tParity Shares and Junior
Shares without the consent of any \tholder of Series G Preferred Shares,
unless, in the case of \tParity Shares, such Parity Shares are created or
increased \tsolely of the purpose of issuance to an affiliate (as defined
in \tRule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933) of the Trust, \twhich
requires the approval of two-thirds of the outstanding \tSeries G Preferred

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(g) _Remedies Not Limited._ Nothing contained in
this \tSection 9 shall limit the authority of the Board of \tTrustees to
take such other action as it deems necessary or \tadvisable to protect the
Trust and the interests of its \tshareholders by preservation of the Trusts
status as a \tREIT and to ensure compliance with the Ownership Limit.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(h) _Ambiguity._ In the case of an ambiguity in
the \tapplication of any of the provisions of this Section 9, \tincluding
any definition contained in subparagraph (a), the \tBoard of Trustees shall
have the power to determine the \tapplication of the provisions of this
Section 9 with \trespect to any situation based on the facts known to it.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(i) _Exception._ The Board of Trustees, upon
receipt \tof a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or an opinion
of \tcounsel in each case to the effect that the restrictions \tcontained in
subparagraph (C) of Section 9(b) and/or \tsubparagraph (D) of Section 9(b)
will not be violated, \tmay exempt a Person from the Ownership Limit if such
Person is \tnot an individual for purposes of Section 542(a)(2) of the
Code \t(as modified by Section 856(h) of the Code) or is an \tunderwriter
which participates in a public offering of the \tSeries G Preferred Shares
for a period of 90 days \tfollowing the purchase by such underwriter of the
Series G \tPreferred Shares and the Board of Trustees obtains
such \trepresentations and undertakings from such Person as are \treasonably
necessary to ascertain that no individuals \tBeneficial Ownership of Series
G Preferred Shares will \tviolate the Ownership Limit and such Person agrees
that any \tviolation or attempted violation will result in such \tSeries G
Preferred Shares being exchanged for Series G \tPreferred Excess Shares in
accordance with Section 9(c) and \tprovided that any exemption of a Person
under this \tSection 9(i) shall not allow the Person to exceed 13.0%
of \tthe value of the outstanding Equity Shares of the Trust.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(j) _Legend._ Each certificate for Series
G \tPreferred Shares shall bear the following legend:  
   

     \t \t|  \t|   
---|---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tThe Series G Preferred Shares represented by
this \tcertificate are subject to restrictions on transfer for the \tpurpose
of the Trusts maintenance of its status as a real \testate investment trust
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, \tas amended (the "Code"). No Person
may \t(1) Beneficially Own or Constructively Own Series G \tPreferred Shares
in excess of 9.9% of the value of the \toutstanding Equity Shares of the
Trust; or (2) Beneficially \tOwn Series G Preferred Shares that would result
in the \tTrusts being "closely held" under \tSection 856(h) of the Code.
Any Person who attempts to \tBeneficially Own or Constructively Own Series G
Preferred \tShares in excess of the above limitations must
immediately \tnotify the Trust. All capitalized terms in this legend have
the \tmeanings defined in the Trusts Declaration of Trust, as \tthe same
may be further amended from time to time, a copy of \twhich, including the
restrictions on transfer, will be sent \twithout charge to each shareholder
who so requests. If the \trestrictions on transfer are violated, the Series G
Preferred \tShares represented hereby will be automatically exchanged
for \tSeries G Preferred Excess Shares which will be held in \ttrust by the
Trust. \t|   
    

  (10) _Series G Preferred Excess Shares._ 

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(a) _Ownership in Trust._ Upon any purported
Transfer \tthat results in Series G Preferred Excess Shares pursuant \tto
Section 9(c), such Series G Preferred Excess Shares \tshall be deemed to have
been transferred to the Trust, as \tTrustee of the Series G Preferred Excess
Share Trust for \tthe exclusive benefit of such Beneficiary or Beneficiaries
to \twhom an interest in such Series G Preferred Excess Shares may \tlater
be transferred pursuant to Section 10(e). \tSeries G Preferred Excess Shares
so held in trust shall be  ---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tissued and outstanding shares of the Trust. The Purported
Record \tTransferee shall have no rights in such Series G Preferred \tExcess
Shares except the right to receive a price for its \tinterest in the Equity
Shares which were exchanged for \tSeries G Preferred Excess Shares. The
Purported Beneficial \tTransferee shall have no rights in such Series G
Preferred \tExcess Shares except as provided in Section 10(e).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(b) _Distribution Rights._ Series G
Preferred \tExcess Shares shall not be entitled to any distributions.
Any \tdistribution paid prior to the discovery by the Trust that
the \tSeries G Preferred Shares have been exchanged for \tSeries G Preferred
Excess Shares shall be repaid to the \tTrust upon demand, and any
distribution declared but unpaid \tshall be rescinded as void _ab initio_
with respect to such \tSeries G Preferred Excess Shares.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(c) _Rights Upon Liquidation._ In the event of
any \tvoluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up \tof,
or any distribution of the assets of, the Trust, the \tSeries G Preferred
Excess Shares shall not be entitled to \tshare in any portion of the assets
of the Trust. At such time as \t(i) the Trust has received the necessary
shareholder \tapproval with respect to a voluntary liquidation of
dissolution \tof the Trust, or (ii) the Trust has become the subject of \tan
order of a court of competent jurisdiction compelling an \tinvoluntary
liquidation or dissolution of the Trust, such \tSeries G Preferred Excess
Shares held in trust in the \tSeries G Preferred Excess Share Trust shall
without further \tact be extinguished and each Purported Beneficial
Transferee \twhose acquisition of Series G Preferred Shares resulted
in \tthe Series G Preferred Excess Shares which has been \textinguished
pursuant to this Section 10(c) shall without \tfurther act become a creditor
of the Trust. The amount by which \teach such Purported Beneficial Transferee
shall become a \tcreditor of the Trust with respect to its now-
extinguished \tinterest in the Trust (representing the number of Series
G \tPreferred Excess Shares held by the Trust attributable to a \tpurported
Transfer that resulted in the Series G Preferred \tExcess Shares) will be
equal to the lesser of (a) that \tamount of the distributable assets of the
Trust to which such \tSeries G Preferred Excess Shares would be entitled if
such \tSeries G Preferred Excess Shares were entitled to share \tratably in
the distributable assets of the Trust as Common \tShares, or (b) as
appropriate, either (1) the price \tper share paid by such Purported
Beneficial Transferee for the \tSeries G Preferred Shares which were
exchanged for \tSeries G Preferred Excess Shares, or (2) if the \tPurported
Beneficial Transferee did not give value for such \tSeries G Preferred Shares
(having received such through a \tgift, device or otherwise), a price per
share equal to the \tMarket Price on the date of the purported Transfer that
resulted \tin the Series G Preferred Excess Shares. Payment to
the \tPurported Beneficial Transferee shall be without interest and \tshall
be due concurrently with the date of first distribution of \tliquidation
proceeds to the holders of Equity Shares. If the \tTrust causes such
liquidation or dissolution to be revoked or \totherwise rescinded any Series
G Preferred Excess Shares \tpreviously automatically extinguished pursuant to
this \tSection 10(c) shall be automatically revived and any \tPurported
Beneficial Transferees shall without further act cease \tto be creditors of
the Trust as otherwise provided above.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(d) _Voting Rights._ The holders of Series
G \tPreferred Excess Shares shall not be entitled to vote on any \tmatters
(except as required by the General Laws of the State of \tMaryland).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(e) _Restrictions on Transfers; Designation
of \tBeneficiary._   
   

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(A) Series G Preferred Excess Shares shall not
be \ttransferable. The Trust may designate a Beneficiary of an \tinterest in
the Series G Preferred Excess Share Trust \t(representing the number of
Series G Preferred Excess \tShares held by the Series G Preferred Excess
Share Trust \tattributable to a purported Transfer that resulted in
the \tSeries G Preferred Excess Shares), if the shares of \tSeries G
Preferred Excess Shares held in trust in the \tSeries G Preferred Excess
Share Trust would not be \tSeries G Preferred Excess Shares in the hands of
such \tBeneficiary. The Purported Beneficial Transferee may receive
a \tprice for its interest in the Series G Preferred Shares \twhich were
exchanged for Series G Preferred Excess Shares \tprovided that the Purported
Beneficial Transferee does not \treceive a price that reflects a price per
share for such \tSeries G Preferred Shares that exceeds (i) the price \tper
share such Purported Beneficial Transferee paid for the \tSeries G Preferred
Shares in the purported Transfer that \tresulted in the Series G Preferred
Excess Shares, or \t(ii) if the Purported Beneficial Transferee did not
give \tvalue for such Series G Preferred Shares (through a  ---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tgift, devise or otherwise), a price per share equal to
the \tMarket Price on the date of the purported Transfer that resulted \tin
the Series G Preferred Excess Shares. Upon such transfer of \tan interest in
the Series G Preferred Excess Share Trust, \tthe corresponding shares of
Series G Preferred Excess \tShares in the Series G Preferred Excess Share
Trust shall \tbe automatically exchanged for an equal number of Series
G \tPreferred Shares, and such Series G Preferred Shares shall \tbe
transferred of record to the Beneficiary of the interest in \tthe Series G
Preferred Excess Share Trust designated by the \tTrust as described above if
such Series G Preferred Shares \twould not be Series G Preferred Excess
Shares in the hands \tof such Beneficiary.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(B) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a
Purported \tBeneficial Transferee receives a price for its interest in
the \tSeries G Preferred Shares which were exchanged for \tSeries G
Preferred Excess Shares that exceeds the amount \tallowable under
subparagraph (A) of Section 10(e), \tsuch Purported Beneficial Transferee
shall pay, or cause to be \tpaid, such excess to the Trust, or, at the
Trusts sole \telection, such excess shall be offset against any
future \tdistributions payable to such Purported Beneficial Transferee.  
   

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(f) _Purchase Right in Series G Preferred
Excess \tShares._ Shares of Series G Preferred Excess Shares shall
be \tdeemed to have been offered for sale to the Trust, or its \tdesignee at
a price per share equal to the lesser of \t(i) the price per share in the
transaction that created \tsuch Series G Preferred Excess Shares (or, in the
case of \tdevisee or gift, the Market Price at the time of such devise
or \tgift) and (ii) the Market Price on the date the Trust, or \tits
designee, accepts such offer. Subject to the satisfaction of \tany applicable
requirements of the General Laws of the State of \tMaryland, the Trust shall
have the right to accept such offer \tfor a period of ninety days after the
later of (i) the date \tof the Transfer that resulted in such Series G
Preferred \tExcess Shares and (ii) the date the Board of
Trustees \tdetermines in good faith that a Transfer resulting in Series
G \tPreferred Excess Shares has occurred, if the Trust does not \treceive a
notice of such Transfer pursuant to Section 10(e).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(g) _Further Authority._ Nothing contained in
this \tSection 10 or in any other provision of these
Articles \tSupplementary or the Declaration of Trust shall limit
the \tauthority of the Board of Trustees to take such other action as \tit
in its sole discretion deems necessary or advisable to \tprotect the Trust
and the interests of the shareholders by \tmaintaining the Trusts
eligibility to be, and preserving \tthe Trusts status as, a qualified REIT
under the Code.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(h) _New York Stock Exchange._ Nothing in
this \tSection 10 precludes the settlement of transactions entered \tinto
through the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange. As \tprovided in this
Section 10, under certain circumstances, a \tTransfer of Series G Preferred
Shares may result in the \tautomatic exchange of the Series G Preferred
Shares for an \tequal number of Series G Preferred Excess Shares.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(i) _Non-applicability of Article VII
of \tDeclaration of Trust to Series G Preferred Shares._ The \trestrictions
on transfer and ownership of Shares contained in \tArticle VII of the
Declaration of Trust and the other \tprovisions of such Article VII shall not
apply to the \tSeries G Preferred Shares.  
    

   _SECOND:_ Under a power contained in Article VI of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, the Board by resolution by resolution adopted on  ,  2001, classified 1,500,000 Preferred Shares (as defined in the Declaration of Trust) as Series G Preferred Excess Shares, $.01 par value per share, with the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of shares set forth in Article FIRST and provided for the issuance thereof.    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Trust has caused these Articles Supplementary to be executed under seal in its name and on its behalf by its President and attested to by its Secretary on this  day of  ,  2001.

 FORM OF ARTICLES SUPPLEMENTARY  

 ESTABLISHING AND FIXING THE RIGHTS AND PREFERENCES OF SERIES H PREFERRED
SHARES AND SERIES H PREFERRED EXCESS SHARES  

  Equity Office Properties Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust (the "Trust"), certifies to the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland that:  

   _FIRST:_ Under a power contained in Article VI of the Trusts Articles of Amendment and Restatement of Declaration of Trust, as amended (the "Declaration of Trust"), the Board of Trustees (the "Board"), by resolution duly adopted on  ,  2001, classified 4,000,000 Preferred Shares (as defined in the Declaration of Trust) as Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (the "Series H Preferred Shares"), with the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of shares as follows and provided for the issuance thereof:  

  (1) _Designation and Number._ The designation of Series H Preferred Shares described in Article FIRST hereof shall be "Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (par value $.01 per share)." The number of Series H Preferred Shares to be authorized shall be 4,000,000.  

  (2) _Rank._ The Series H Preferred Shares shall, with respect to distribution rights and rights upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Trust, rank (a) senior to all classes or series of Common Shares (as defined in the Declaration of Trust) and to all equity securities the terms of which provide that such equity securities shall rank junior to such Series H Preferred Shares; (b) on a parity with all equity securities issued by the Trust, including the 8.98% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (the "Series A Preferred Shares"), the 5.25% Series B Convertible, Cumulative Preferred Shares (the "Series B Preferred Shares"), the 8 5/8% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest (the "Series C Preferred Shares"), Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (the "Series E Preferred Shares"), Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (the "Series F Preferred Shares") and Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (the "Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares") classified pursuant to resolutions duly adopted by the Board, other than those referred to in clauses (a) and (c); and (c) junior to all equity securities issued by the Trust which rank senior to the Series H Preferred Shares. The term "equity securities" shall not include convertible debt securities.  

  (3) _Distributions._  

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) Subject to the rights of series of Preferred
Shares  which may from time to time come into existence, holders of  Series
H Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive,  when and as declared by the
Board of Trustees, out of funds  legally available for the payment of
distributions, cumulative  preferential cash distributions at the rate of
$2.00 per annum  per share. Such distributions shall be cumulative from the
last  date on which any dividends were paid with respect to  Series E
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock of Spieker  Properties, Inc. for which
Series H Preferred Shares were  exchanged in connection with the merger of
Spieker Properties,  Inc. with and into the Trust and shall be payable
quarterly in  arrears on the last day of March, June, September and
December  or, if not a business day, the next succeeding business day 
(each, a "Distribution Payment Date"). Any  distribution payable on Series H
Preferred Shares for any  partial distribution period will be computed on the
basis of a  360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Distributions 
will be payable to holders of record as they appear in the  records of the
Trust at the close of business on the applicable  record date, which shall be
on such date designated by the Board  of Trustees of the Trust for the
payment of distributions that  is not more than 50 nor less than 10 days
prior to such  Distribution Payment Date (each, a "Distribution Record 
Date").       \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(b) Distributions on Series H Preferred Shares
will \taccrue whether or not the Trust has earnings, whether or not \tthere
are funds legally available for the payment of such \tdistributions and
whether or not such distributions are \tdeclared. No interest, or sum of
money in lieu of interest, \tshall be payable in respect of any distribution
payment or \tpayments on Series H Preferred Shares which may be
in \tarrears. Holders of the Series H Preferred Shares will not \tbe
entitled to distributions in excess of the full cumulative \tdistributions as
described above.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(c) If, for any taxable year, the Trust elects
to \tdesignate as "capital gain dividends" (as defined in \tSection 857 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as \tamended, or any successor revenue
code or section (the \t"Code")) any portion (the "Capital Gains \tAmount")
of the total distributions (as determined for \tfederal income tax purposes)
paid or made available for the year \tto holders of all classes of shares of
beneficial interest (the \t"Total Distributions"), then the portion of
the \tCapital Gains Amount that shall be allocable to holders of \tSeries H
Preferred Shares shall be in the same portion that \tthe Total Distributions
paid or made available to the holders of \tSeries H Preferred Shares for the
year bears to the Total \tDistributions.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(d) If any Series H Preferred Shares are
outstanding, \tno distributions shall be declared or paid or set apart
for \tpayment on any class or series of shares of beneficial interest \tof
the Trust ranking, as to distributions, on a parity with or \tjunior to
Series H Preferred Shares for any period unless \tfull cumulative
distributions have been or contemporaneously are \tdeclared and paid or
declared and a sum sufficient for the \tpayment thereof set apart for such
payments on Series H \tPreferred Shares for all past distribution periods and
the then \tcurrent distribution period. When distributions are not paid
in \tfull (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not set \tapart)
upon the Series H Preferred Shares and the shares of \tany other series of
shares of beneficial interest ranking on \tparity as to distributions with
Series H Preferred Shares, \tall distributions declared upon Series H
Preferred Shares \tand any other series of shares of beneficial interest
ranking on \ta parity as to distributions with Series H Preferred
Shares \tshall be declared pro rata so that the amount of
distributions \tdeclared per share on Series H Preferred Shares and
such \tother series of shares of beneficial interest shall in all
cases \tbear to each other the same ratio that accrued distributions
per \tshare on Series H Preferred Shares and such other series of \tshares
of beneficial interest bear to each other.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(e) Except as provided in Section 3(d), unless
full \tcumulative distributions on Series H Preferred Shares have \tbeen or
contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and \ta sum sufficient
for the payment thereof set apart for payment \tfor all past dividend periods
and the then current dividend \tperiod, no distributions (other than in
Common Shares or other \tshares of beneficial interest ranking junior to
Series H \tPreferred Shares as to distributions and amounts
upon \tliquidation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment \tor
other distribution shall be declared or made upon the Common \tShares, Series
A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred \tShares, Series C Preferred Shares,
Series E Preferred \tShares, Series F Preferred Shares and Series
G \tPreferred Shares or any other shares of beneficial interest of \tthe
Trust ranking junior to or on a parity with Series H \tPreferred Shares as to
distributions or amounts upon \tliquidation, nor shall any Common Shares,
Series A Preferred \tShares, Series B Preferred Shares, Series C
Preferred \tShares, Series E Preferred Shares, Series F Preferred \tShares
and Series G Preferred Shares or any other shares of \tbeneficial interest of
the Trust ranking junior to or on a \tparity with Series H Preferred Shares
as to distributions \tor amounts upon liquidation be redeemed, purchased or
otherwise \tacquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or
made \tavailable for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such \tshares
of beneficial interest) by the Trust (except by \tconversion into or exchange
for other shares of beneficial \tinterest of the Trust ranking junior to
Series H Preferred \tShares as to distributions and amounts upon
liquidation).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(f) Any distribution payment made on Series
H \tPreferred Shares shall first be credited against the earliest \taccrued
but unpaid distribution due with respect to \tSeries H Preferred Shares which
remains payable.  
    

  (4) _Liquidation Rights._         \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(a) Subject to the rights of series of Preferred
Shares \twhich may from time to time come into existence, upon
any \tvoluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up \tof
the affairs of the Trust, then, before any distribution or \tpayment shall be
made to the holders of any Common Shares or any \tother class or series of
shares of beneficial interest of the \tTrust ranking junior to Series H
Preferred Shares in the \tdistribution of assets upon any liquidation,
dissolution or \twinding up of the affairs of the Trust, the holders
of \tSeries H Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive out \tof assets
of the Trust legally available for distribution to \tshareholders,
liquidation distributions in the amount of the \tliquidation preference of
$25.00 per share, plus an amount equal \tto all distributions accrued and
unpaid thereon. After payment \tof the full amount of the liquidating
distributions to which \tthey are entitled, the holders of Series H Preferred
Shares \twill have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of \tthe
Trust. In the event that, upon any such voluntary or \tinvoluntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the \taffairs of the Trust, the
available assets of the Trust are \tinsufficient to pay the amount of the
liquidation distributions \ton all outstanding Series H Preferred Shares and
the \tcorresponding amounts payable on all shares of other classes
or \tseries of shares of beneficial interest of the Trust ranking on \ta
parity with Series H Preferred Shares in the distribution \tof assets upon
any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the \taffairs of the Trust
("Parity Shares"), then the \tholders of Series H Preferred Shares and Parity
Shares \tshall share ratably in any such distribution of assets
in \tproportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they \twould
otherwise be respectively entitled.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(b) A consolidation or merger of the Trust with or
into \tany other entity or entities, or a sale, lease, conveyance
or \tdisposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the \tTrust or
the effectuation by the Trust of a transaction or \tseries of related
transactions in which more than 50% of the \tvoting power of the Trust is
disposed of, shall not be deemed to \tbe a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the affairs of \tthe Trust within the meaning of this Section
4.  
    

  (5) _Redemption._  

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(a) Series H Preferred Shares are not
redeemable \tprior to June 4, 2003. On and after June 4, 2003, the \tTrust
at its option upon not less than 30 nor more than \t90 days written notice
may redeem outstanding \tSeries H Preferred Shares, in whole or in part, at
any time \tor from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of
$25.00 \tper share, plus an amount equal to all distributions accrued
and \tunpaid thereon to the date fixed for redemption, without \tinterest.
The redemption price of Series H Preferred Shares \t(other than the portion
thereof consisting of accrued and unpaid \tdistributions) is payable solely
out of proceeds (without giving \teffect to any temporary use of such
proceeds) from the sale of \tother shares of beneficial interest of the
Trust, which may \tinclude Common Shares, Preferred Shares, depositary
shares, \tinterests, participations or other ownership interests in
the \tTrust however designated (other than debt securities converted \tinto
or exchangeable for shares of beneficial interest), and any \trights,
warrants or options to purchase any thereof. Holders of \tSeries H Preferred
Shares to be redeemed shall surrender such \tSeries H Preferred Shares at the
place designated in such \tnotice and shall be entitled to the redemption
price and any \taccrued and unpaid distributions payable upon such
redemption \tfollowing such surrender. If fewer than all of the
outstanding \tSeries H Preferred Shares are to be redeemed, the number
of \tshares to be redeemed will be determined by the Trust and such \tshares
may be redeemed pro rata from the holders of record of \tsuch shares in
proportion to the number of such shares held by \tsuch holders (with
adjustments to avoid redemption of fractional \tshares) or by lot in a manner
determined by the Trust.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(b) Unless full cumulative distributions on
all \tSeries H Preferred Shares and Parity Shares shall have been \tor
contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum \tsufficient
for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all \tpast distribution
periods and the then current distribution \tperiod, no Series H Preferred
Shares or Parity Shares shall \tbe redeemed unless all outstanding Series H
Preferred \tShares and Parity Shares are simultaneously redeemed;
provided, \thowever, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase
or \tacquisition of Series H Preferred Shares or Parity Shares \tpursuant to
a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms \tto holders of all
outstanding Series H Preferred Shares or \tParity Shares, as the case may be.
Furthermore, unless full \tcumulative distributions on all outstanding Series
H \tPreferred Shares and Parity Shares have been or \tcontemporaneously are
declared and paid or  ---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tdeclared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set
apart \tfor payment for all past distribution periods and the then \tcurrent
distribution period, the Trust shall not purchase or \totherwise acquire
directly or indirectly any Series H Preferred \tShares or Parity Shares
(except by conversion into or exchange \tfor shares of beneficial interest of
the Trust ranking junior to \tSeries H Preferred Shares and Parity Shares as
to \tdistributions and amounts upon liquidation).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(c) Notice of redemption will be mailed at
least \t30 days but not more than 90 days before the \tredemption date to
each holder of record of Series H \tPreferred Shares at the address shown on
the stock transfer \tbooks of the Trust. Each notice shall state: (i)

  (10) _Series H Preferred Excess Shares._ 

     \t \t|   
---|---

been transferred to the Trust, as \tTrustee of the Series H Preferred Excess
Share Trust for \tthe exclusive benefit of such Beneficiary or Beneficiaries
to \twhom an interest in such Series H Preferred Excess Shares may \tlater
be transferred pursuant to Section 10(e). \tSeries H Preferred Excess Shares
so held in trust shall be \tissued and outstanding shares of the Trust. The
Purported Record \tTransferee shall have no rights in such Series H
Preferred \tExcess Shares except the right to receive a price for
its \tinterest in the Equity Shares which were exchanged for \tSeries H
Preferred Excess Shares. The Purported Beneficial \tTransferee shall have no
rights in such Series H Preferred \tExcess Shares except as provided in
Section 10(e).

shareholder \tapproval with respect to a voluntary liquidation of
dissolution \tof the Trust, or (ii) the Trust has become the subject of \tan
order of a court of competent jurisdiction compelling an \tinvoluntary
liquidation or dissolution of the Trust, such \tSeries H Preferred Excess
Shares held in trust in the \tSeries H Preferred Excess Share Trust shall
without further \tact be extinguished and each Purported Beneficial
Transferee \twhose acquisition of Series H Preferred Shares resulted
in \tthe Series H Preferred Excess Shares which has been \textinguished
pursuant to this Section 10(c) shall without \tfurther act become a creditor
of the Trust. The amount by which \teach such Purported Beneficial Transferee
shall become a \tcreditor of the Trust with respect to its now-
extinguished \tinterest in the Trust (representing the number of Series
H \tPreferred Excess Shares held by the Trust attributable to a \tpurported
Transfer that resulted in the Series H Preferred \tExcess Shares) will be
equal to the lesser of (a) that \tamount of the distributable assets of the
Trust to which such \tSeries H Preferred Excess Shares would be entitled if
such \tSeries H Preferred Excess Shares were entitled to share \tratably in
the distributable assets of the Trust as Common \tShares, or (b) as
appropriate, either (1) the price \tper share paid by such Purported
Beneficial Transferee for the \tSeries H Preferred Shares which were
exchanged for \tSeries H Preferred Excess Shares, or (2) if the \tPurported
Beneficial Transferee did not give value for such \tSeries H Preferred Shares
(having received such through a \tgift, device or otherwise), a price per
share equal to the \tMarket Price on the date of the purported Transfer that
resulted \tin the Series H Preferred Excess Shares. Payment to
the \tPurported Beneficial Transferee shall be without interest and \tshall
be due concurrently with the date of first distribution of \tliquidation
proceeds to the holders of Equity Shares. If the \tTrust causes such
liquidation or dissolution to be revoked or \totherwise rescinded any Series
H Preferred Excess Shares \tpreviously automatically extinguished pursuant to
this Section \t10(c) shall be automatically  ---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \trevived and any Purported Beneficial Transferees shall
without \tfurther act cease to be creditors of the Trust as
otherwise \tprovided above.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(d) _Voting Rights._ The holders of Series
H \tPreferred Excess Shares shall not be entitled to vote on any \tmatters

   \t  \t|  \t(e) _Restrictions on Transfers; Designation
of \tBeneficiary._   
   

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(A) Series H Preferred Excess Shares shall not
be \ttransferable. The Trust may designate a Beneficiary of an \tinterest in
the Series H Preferred Excess Share Trust \t(representing the number of
Series H Preferred Excess \tShares held by the Series H Preferred Excess
Share Trust \tattributable to a purported Transfer that resulted in
the \tSeries H Preferred Excess Shares), if the shares of \tSeries H
Preferred Excess Shares held in trust in the \tSeries H Preferred Excess
Share Trust would not be \tSeries H Preferred Excess Shares in the hands of
such \tBeneficiary. The Purported Beneficial Transferee may receive
a \tprice for its interest in the Series H Preferred Shares \twhich were
exchanged for Series H Preferred Excess Shares \tprovided that the Purported
Beneficial Transferee does not \treceive a price that reflects a price per
share for such \tSeries H Preferred Shares that exceeds (i) the price \tper
share such Purported Beneficial Transferee paid for the \tSeries H Preferred
Shares in the purported Transfer that \tresulted in the Series H Preferred
Excess Shares, or \t(ii) if the Purported Beneficial Transferee did not
give \tvalue for such Series H Preferred Shares (through a gift, \tdevise or
otherwise), a price per share equal to the Market \tPrice on the date of the
purported Transfer that resulted in the \tSeries H Preferred Excess Shares.
Upon such transfer of an \tinterest in the Series H Preferred Excess Share
Trust, the \tcorresponding shares of Series H Preferred Excess Shares
in \tthe Series H Preferred Excess Share Trust shall be \tautomatically
exchanged for an equal number of Series H \tPreferred Shares, and such Series
H Preferred Shares shall \tbe transferred of record to the Beneficiary of the
interest in \tthe Series H Preferred Excess Share Trust designated by
the \tTrust as described above if such Series H Preferred Shares \twould not
be Series H Preferred Excess Shares in the hands \tof such Beneficiary.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(B) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a
Purported \tBeneficial Transferee receives a price for its interest in
the \tSeries H Preferred Shares which were exchanged for \tSeries H
Preferred Excess Shares that exceeds the amount \tallowable under
subparagraph (A) of Section 10(e), \tsuch Purported Beneficial Transferee
shall pay, or cause to be \tpaid, such excess to the Trust, or, at the
Trusts sole \telection, such excess shall be offset against any
future \tdistributions payable to such Purported Beneficial Transferee.  
   

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(f) _Purchase Right in Series H Preferred
Excess \tShares._ Shares of Series H Preferred Excess Shares shall
be \tdeemed to have been offered for sale to the Trust, or its \tdesignee at
a price per share equal to the lesser of \t(i) the price per share in the
transaction that created \tsuch Series H Preferred Excess Shares (or, in the
case of \tdevisee or gift, the Market Price at the time of such devise
or \tgift) and (ii) the Market Price on the date the Trust, or \tits
designee, accepts such offer. Subject to the satisfaction of \tany applicable
requirements of the General Laws of the State of \tMaryland, the Trust shall
have the right to accept such offer \tfor a period of ninety days after the
later of (i) the date \tof the Transfer that resulted in such Series H
Preferred \tExcess Shares and (ii) the date the Board of
Trustees \tdetermines in good faith that a Transfer resulting in \tSeries H
Preferred Excess Shares has occurred, if the Trust \tdoes not receive a
notice of such Transfer pursuant to \tSection 10(e).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(g) _Further Authority._ Nothing contained in
this \tSection 10 or in any other provision of these
Articles \tSupplementary or the Declaration of Trust shall limit
the \tauthority of the Board of Trustees to take such other action as \tit
in its sole discretion deems necessary or advisable to \tprotect the Trust
and the interests of the shareholders by \tmaintaining the Trusts
eligibility to be, and preserving \tthe Trusts status as, a qualified REIT
under the Code.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(h) _New York Stock Exchange._ Nothing in
this \tSection 10 precludes the settlement of transactions entered \tinto
through the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange. As \tprovided in this
Section 10,  ---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tunder certain circumstances, a Transfer of Series
H \tPreferred Shares may result in the automatic exchange of the \tSeries H
Preferred Shares for an equal number of \tSeries H Preferred Excess Shares.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(i) _Non-applicability of Article VII
of \tDeclaration of Trust to Series H Preferred Shares._ The \trestrictions
on transfer and ownership of Shares contained in \tArticle VII of the
Declaration of Trust and the other \tprovisions of such Article VII shall not
apply to the \tSeries H Preferred Shares.  
    

   _SECOND:_ Under a power contained in Article VI of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, the Board by resolution by resolution adopted on  ,  2001, classified 4,000,000 Preferred Shares (as defined in the Declaration of Trust) as Series H Preferred Excess Shares, $.01 par value per share, with the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of shares set forth in Article FIRST and provided for the issuance thereof.  

  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Trust has caused these Articles Supplementary to be executed under seal in its name and on its behalf by its President and attested to by its Secretary on this  day of , 2001.

 CREATING EQUITY OFFICE PREFERRED OP UNITS 

  

 (FORM OF SERIES E PREFERRED UNITS)  

  In accordance with Sections 4.2.A and 4.2.D of the Agreement, set forth below are the terms and conditions of the Series E Preferred Units hereby established that will be issued by the Partnership to Spieker on  ,  2001, in connection with the merger of Spieker Properties, L.P. ("Spieker Partnership") with and into the Partnership (the "Spieker Partnership Merger"), in exchange for the then outstanding Series B Preferred Interest of Spieker Partnership (all of which will be acquired by the General Partner in the merger of Spieker Properties, Inc. with and into General Partner (the "REIT Merger") immediately following the Spieker Partnership Merger). All capitalized terms used in this Attachment E and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings assigned in the Agreement.  

  A. _Designation and Number._ A series of Partnership Units, designated as Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the "Series E Preferred Units"), is hereby established. The number of Series E Preferred Units shall be 4,250,000.  

  B. _Rank._ The Series E Preferred Units shall, with respect to distribution rights and rights upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership, rank (a) senior to the Class A Units, Class B Units and all Partnership Interests ranking junior to the Series E Preferred Units; (b) on a parity with the Series A Preferred Units, the Series B Preferred Units, the Series C Preferred Units, Series D Preferred Units, Series F Preferred Units, Series G Preferred Units, Series H Preferred Units, and all Partnership Interests issued by the Partnership the terms of which specifically provide that such Partnership Interests rank on a parity with the Series E Preferred Units (each referred to as "Parity Preferred Units"); and (c) junior to all Partnership Interests issued by the Partnership the terms of which specifically provide that such Partnership Interests rank senior to the Series E Preferred Units.  

  C. _Distributions._  

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) Subject to the rights of series of Preferred Units 
which may from time to time come into existence, the holders of  Series E
Preferred Units shall be entitled to receive  distributions, when, as and if
required pursuant to the  Agreement, of Available Cash, prior and in
preference to any  distribution with respect to Class A Units or Class B 
Units, at the rate of $2.3625 per Series E Preferred Unit  per annum. Such
distributions shall be cumulative from the last  date on which any
distributions were paid with respect to  Series B Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Interest of  Spieker Partnership for which Series E Preferred Units
were  exchanged in connection with the merger of Spieker Partnership  with
and into the Partnership and shall be payable quarterly in  arrears on the
last day of March, June, September and December  or, if not a business day,
the next succeeding business day  (each, a "Distribution Payment Date").
Any  distribution payable on Series E Preferred Units for any  partial
distribution period will be computed on the basis of a  360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months. Distributions  will be payable to Series
E Preferred Unitholders at the  close of business on the Partnership Record
Date, which shall be  on such date designated by the General Partner for the
payment  of distributions (each, a "Distribution Record Date").  
      
      |   (b) Distributions on Series E Preferred Units will 
accrue whether or not the Partnership has Available Cash,  whether or not
there are funds legally available for the payment  of such distributions and
whether or not such distributions are  declared. No interest, or sum of money
in lieu of interest,  shall be payable in respect of any distribution payment
or  payments on Series E Preferred Units which may be in  arrears. Holders
of the Series E Preferred Units will not  be entitled to distributions in
excess of the full cumulative  distributions as described above.  
      
      |   (c) If any Series E Preferred Units are outstanding, 
no distributions shall be declared or paid or set apart for  payment on any
Partnership Unit, as to distributions, on a  parity with or junior to Series ---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tPreferred Units for any period unless full
cumulative \tdistributions have been or contemporaneously are paid
or \tdeclared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart \tfor
such payments on Series E Preferred Units for all past \tdistribution periods
and the then current distribution period. \tWhen distributions are not paid
in full (or a sum sufficient for \tsuch full payment is not set apart) upon
the Series E \tPreferred Units and the Partnership Units ranking on parity
as \tto distributions with Series E Preferred Units, all \tdistributions
declared upon Series E Preferred Units and \tany other series of Partnership
Units parity as to distributions \twith Series E Preferred Units shall be
declared pro rata so \tthat the amount of distributions declared per Series
E \tPreferred Units and such other Partnership Units shall in all \tcases
bear to each other the same ratio that accrued \tdistributions per share on
Series E Preferred Units and \tsuch other Partnership Units bear to each
other.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(d) Except as provided in Section 3(c), unless
full \tcumulative distributions on Series E Preferred Units have \tbeen or
contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and \ta sum sufficient
for the payment thereof set apart for payment \tfor all past distribution
periods and the then current \tdistribution period, no distributions (other
than in \tClass A Units or other Partnership Units ranking junior
to \tSeries E Preferred Units as to distributions and amounts \tupon
liquidation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for \tpayment or other
distribution shall be declared or made upon the \tClass A Units, Class B
Units, Series A Preferred \tUnits, Series B Preferred Units, Series C
Preferred \tUnits, Series D Preferred Units, Series F Preferred \tUnits,
Series G Preferred Units and Series H Preferred \tUnits or any other
Partnership Units ranking junior to or on a \tparity with Series E Preferred
Units as to distributions or \tupon liquidation, nor shall any Class A Units,
Class B \tUnits, Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred \tUnits,
Series C Preferred Units, Series F Preferred \tUnits, Series G Preferred
Units and Series H Preferred \tUnits, or any other Partnership Units ranking
junior to or on a \tparity with Series E Preferred Units as to distributions
or \tamounts upon liquidation be redeemed by the Partnership (except \tby
conversion into or exchange for other Partnership Units \tranking junior to
Series E Preferred Units as to \tdistributions and amounts upon
liquidation).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(e) Any distribution payment made on Series
E \tPreferred Units shall first be credited against the earliest \taccrued
but unpaid distribution due with respect to \tSeries E Preferred Units which
remains payable.  
    

  D. _Allocations._   

  Allocations of the Partnerships items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated among the holders of Series E Preferred Units in accordance with Article VI of the Agreement.  

  E. _Liquidation Preference._  

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(a) Subject to the rights of series of Preferred
Units \twhich may from time to time come into existence, upon
any \tvoluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up \tof
the affairs of the Partnership, then, before any distribution \tor payment
shall be made to the holders of any Class A \tUnits, Class B Units, or any
other class or series of \tPartnership ranking junior to Series E Preferred
Units in \tthe distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution
or \twinding up of the affairs of the Partnership, the holders of \tSeries E
Preferred Units shall be entitled to receive out \tof assets of the
Partnership legally available for distribution \tto limited partners,
liquidation distributions in the amount of \tthe liquidation preference of
$25.00 per share, plus an amount \tequal to all distributions accrued and
unpaid thereon. After \tpayment of the full amount of the liquidating
distributions to \twhich they are entitled, the holders of Series E
Preferred \tUnits will have no right or claim to any of the remaining
assets \tof the Partnership. In the event that, upon any such voluntary \tor
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the \taffairs of the
Partnership, the available assets of the \tPartnership are insufficient to
pay the amount of the \tliquidation distributions on all outstanding Series
E \tPreferred Units and the corresponding amounts payable on
all \tPartnership Units ranking on a parity with Series E \tPreferred Units
in the distribution of assets upon any \tliquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the affairs of the \tPartnership ("Parity Units"), then the holders
of \tSeries E Preferred Units and Parity Units shall share \tratably in any
such distribution of assets in proportion to the \tfull liquidating
distributions to which they would otherwise be \trespectively entitled.       \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(b) For the purposes hereof, neither a consolidation
or \tmerger of the Partnership with or into any other partnership, \tlimited
liability company, corporation or any other entity, nor \ta merger of any
other partnership, limited liability company, \tcorporation or any other
entity with or into the Partnership, \tnor a sale or transfer of all or any
part of the Partnership \tassets for cash or securities shall be considered a
liquidation, \tdissolution or winding up of the Partnership.  
    

  F. _Redemption_  

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(a) Series E Preferred Units are not redeemable
prior \tto December 11, 2000. On and after December 11, 2000, \tthe General
Partner may redeem outstanding Series E \tPreferred Units, in whole or in
part, at any time or from time \tto time, for cash at a redemption price of
$25.00 per unit, plus \tan amount equal to all distributions accrued and
unpaid thereon \tto the date fixed for redemption, without interest.
The \tredemption price of Series E Preferred Units (other than \tthe portion
thereof consisting of accrued and unpaid \tdistributions) is payable solely
out of proceeds (without giving \teffect to any temporary use of such
proceeds) from the \tcontributions with respect to other Partnership Units,
which may \tinclude Class A Units, Class B Units, Preferred Units, \tor
other ownership interests in the Partnership however \tdesignated (other than
debt securities converted into or \texchangeable for Partnership Units), and
any rights, warrants or \toptions to purchase any thereof. If fewer than all
of the \toutstanding Series E Preferred Units are to be redeemed, \tthe
number of units to be redeemed will be determined by the \tGeneral Partner
and such units may be redeemed pro rata from the \tholders of such units in
proportion to the number of such units \theld by such holders (with
adjustments to avoid redemption of \tfractional units) or by lot in a manner
determined by the \tGeneral Partner.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(b) Unless full cumulative distributions on
all \tSeries E Preferred Units and Parity Units shall have been \tor
contemporaneously are paid or declared and a sum sufficient \tfor the payment
thereof set apart for payment for all past \tdistribution periods and the
then current distribution period, \tno Series E Preferred Units or Parity
Units shall be \tredeemed unless all outstanding Series E Preferred Units
and \tParity Units are simultaneously redeemed; _provided_ , \t _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not prevent the \tpurchase or acquisition of Series
E Preferred Units or \tParity Units pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer
made on \tthe same terms to holders of all outstanding Series E \tPreferred
Units or Parity Units, as the case may be. \tFurthermore, unless full
cumulative distributions on all \toutstanding Series E Preferred Units and
Parity Units have \tbeen or contemporaneously are paid or declared and a
sum \tsufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment for
all \tpast distribution periods and the then current distribution \tperiod,
the Partnership shall not purchase or otherwise acquire \tdirectly or
indirectly any Series E Preferred Units or \tParity Units (except by
conversion into or exchange for \tPartnership Units ranking junior to Series
E Preferred \tUnits and Parity Units as to distributions and amounts
upon \tliquidation).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(c) The General Partner shall, in its sole
discretion, \tdetermine the form and content of a notice of redemption.
If \tnotice of redemption of any Series E Preferred Units has been \tgiven
and if the funds necessary for such redemption have been \tset aside by the
Partnership in trust for the benefit of the \tholders of Series E Preferred
Units so called for \tredemption, then from and after the redemption
date, \tdistributions will cease to accrue on such Series E \tPreferred
Units, such Series E Preferred Units shall no \tlonger be deemed outstanding
and all rights of the holders of \tsuch units will terminate, except the
right to receive the \tredemption price.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(d) The holders of Series E Preferred Units at
the \tclose of business on a Distribution Record Date will be entitled \tto
receive the distribution payable with respect to such \tSeries E Preferred
Units on the corresponding Distribution \tPayment Date notwithstanding the
redemption thereof between such \tDistribution Record Date and the
corresponding Distribution \tPayment Date or the Partnerships default in the
payment of \tthe distribution due. Except as provided above, the
Partnership \twill make no payment or allowance for unpaid
distributions, \twhether or not in arrears, on Series E Preferred
Units \twhich have been called for redemption.   F. _Status of Redeemed Series E Preferred Units._  

  In the event any Series E Preferred Units shall be redeemed pursuant hereto, the units so redeemed shall revert to the status of authorized but unissued Preferred Units available for future issuance and reclassification by the General Partner.  

  G. _Value._   

  For purposes of the definition of Deemed Value of Partnership Interest, the Value on any date of the Series E Preferred Units shall be the Liquidation Preference of such Series E Preferred Unit.  

  H. _Voting Rights._   

  The holders of Series E Preferred Units shall have no voting rights whatsoever, except for any voting rights to which they may be entitled under the laws of the State of Delaware.   (FORM OF SERIES F PREFERRED UNITS)

All capitalized terms used in this Attachment F and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings assigned in the Agreement.  

  A. _Designation and Number._ A series of Partnership Units, designated as Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the "Series F Preferred Units"), is hereby established. The number of Series F Preferred Units shall be 6,000,000.  

  B. _Rank._ The Series F Preferred Units shall, with respect to distribution rights and rights upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership, rank (a) senior to the Class A Units, Class B Units and all Partnership Interests ranking junior to the Series F Preferred Units; (b) on a parity with the Series A Preferred Units, the Series B Preferred Units, the Series C Preferred Units, Series D Preferred Units, Series E Preferred Units, Series G Preferred Units, Series H Preferred Units, and all Partnership Interests issued by the Partnership the terms of which specifically provide that such Partnership Interests rank on a parity with the Series F Preferred Units (each referred to as "Parity Preferred Units"); and (c) junior to all Partnership Interests issued by the Partnership the terms of which specifically provide that such Partnership Interests rank senior to the Series F Preferred Units.

Spieker Partnership \twith and into the Partnership and shall be payable
quarterly in \tarrears on the last day of January, April, July and October

basis of a 360-day year \tconsisting of twelve 30-day months. Distributions
will be \tpayable to Series F Preferred Unitholders at the close
of \tbusiness on the Partnership Record Date, which shall be on such \tdate
designated by the General Partner for the payment of \tdistributions (each, a
"Distribution Record Date").

will \taccrue whether or not the Partnership has Available Cash, \twhether
or not there are funds legally available for the payment \tof such
distributions and whether or not such distributions are \tdeclared. No
interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, \tshall be payable in respect
of any distribution payment or \tpayments on Series F Preferred Units which
may be in \tarrears. Holders of the Series F Preferred Units will not \tbe
entitled to distributions in excess of the full cumulative \tdistributions as
described above.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(c) If any Series F Preferred Units are
outstanding, \tno distributions shall be declared or paid or set apart
for \tpayment on any Partnership Unit, as to distributions, on a \tparity
with or junior to Series F Preferred Units for any \tperiod unless full
cumulative distributions have been or \tcontemporaneously are paid or

ranking \ton parity as to distributions with Series F Preferred \tUnits, all

declared \tper Series F Preferred Units and such other Partnership \tUnits
shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that \taccrued
distributions per share on Series F Preferred Units \tand such other
Partnership Units bear to each other.

unpaid thereon \tto the date fixed for redemption, without interest.
The \tredemption price of Series F Preferred Units (other than \tthe portion
thereof consisting of accrued and unpaid \tdistributions) is payable solely
out of proceeds (without giving \teffect to any temporary use of such
proceeds) from the \tcontributions with respect to other Partnership Units,
which may \tinclude Class A Units, Class B Units, Preferred Units, \tor
other ownership interests in the Partnership however \tdesignated (other than
debt securities converted into or \texchangeable for Partnership Units), and
any rights, warrants or \toptions to purchase any thereof. If fewer than all
of the \toutstanding Series F Preferred Units are to be redeemed, \tthe
number of units to be redeemed will be determined by the \tGeneral Partner
and such units may be redeemed pro rata from the \tholders of such units in
proportion to the number of such units \theld by such holders (with
adjustments to avoid redemption of \tfractional units) or by lot in a manner
determined by the \tGeneral Partner.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(b) Unless full cumulative distributions on
all \tSeries F Preferred Units and Parity Units shall have been \tor
contemporaneously are paid or declared and a sum sufficient \tfor the payment
thereof set apart for payment for all past \tdistribution periods and the
then current distribution period, \tno Series F Preferred Units or Parity
Units shall be \tredeemed unless all outstanding Series F Preferred Units
and \tParity Units are simultaneously redeemed; _provided_ , \thowever, that
the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or \tacquisition of Series F
Preferred Units or Parity Units \tpursuant to a purchase or exchange offer
made on the same terms \tto holders of all outstanding Series F Preferred
Units or \tParity Units, as the case may be. Furthermore, unless
full \tcumulative distributions on all outstanding Series F \tPreferred
Units and Parity Units have been or contemporaneously \tare paid or declared
and a sum sufficient for the payment \tthereof set apart for payment for all
past distribution periods \tand the then current distribution period, the
Partnership shall \tnot purchase or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly
any \tSeries F Preferred Units or Parity Units (except by \tconversion into
or exchange for Partnership Units ranking junior \tto Series F Preferred
Units and Parity Units as to \tdistributions and amounts upon liquidation).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(c) The General Partner shall, in its sole
discretion, \tdetermine the form and content of a notice of redemption.
If \tnotice of redemption of any Series F Preferred Units has been \tgiven
and if the funds necessary for such redemption have been \tset aside by the
Partnership in trust for the benefit of the \tholders of Series F Preferred
Units so called for \tredemption, then from and after the redemption
date, \tdistributions will cease to accrue on such Series F \tPreferred
Units, such Series F Preferred Units shall no \tlonger be deemed outstanding
and all rights of the holders of \tsuch units will terminate, except the
right to receive the \tredemption price.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(d) The holders of Series F Preferred Units at
the \tclose of business on a Distribution Record Date will be entitled \tto
receive the distribution payable with respect to such \tSeries F Preferred
Units on the corresponding Distribution \tPayment Date notwithstanding the
redemption thereof between such \tDistribution Record Date and the
corresponding Distribution \tPayment Date or the Partnerships default in the
payment of \tthe distribution due. Except as provided above, the
Partnership \twill make no payment or allowance for unpaid
distributions, \twhether or not in arrears, on Series F Preferred
Units \twhich have been called for redemption.

  4. _Distributions._  

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(a) Pursuant to Section 5.1 of the Agreement,
holders \tof the Series G Preferred Units shall be entitled to \treceive on
each Series G Payment Distribution Date, out of \tAvailable Cash, a
cumulative preferential distribution of \tAvailable Cash in an amount equal
to the accrued unpaid Series G \tPreferred Return.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(b) Distributions on the Series G Preferred
Units \twill accumulate whether or not the terms and provisions of
any \tagreement of the Partnership, including any agreement relating \tto
its indebtedness, at any time prohibit the current payment
of \tdistributions, whether or not the Partnership has earnings, \twhether
or not there are funds legally available for the payment \tof such
distributions and whether or not such distributions are \tauthorized.
Distributions on the Series G Preferred Units \tare payable on the Series G
Distribution Payment Date. If \tany date on which distributions are to be
made on the \tSeries G Preferred Units is not a Business Day, then \tpayment
of the distribution to be made on such date will be made \ton the next
succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without \tany interest or other
payment in respect of any such delay) \texcept that, if such Business Day is
in the next succeeding \tcalendar year, such payment shall be made on the
immediately \tpreceding Business Day, in each case with the same force
and \teffect as if made on such date. Distributions on the \tSeries G
Preferred Units on account of arrears for any past \tdistribution periods may
be declared and paid at any time. \tAccumulated and unpaid distributions on
the Series G \tPreferred Units will not bear interest.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(c) So long as any Series G Preferred Units
are \toutstanding, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth \tin
Section 5.1 of the Agreement and any other provision of \tthis Agreement, no
distributions of cash or other property shall \tbe authorized, declared, paid
or set apart for payment on or \twith respect to any Series G Junior Units,
nor shall cash \tor other property be set aside for or applied to the
purchase, \tredemption or other acquisition for consideration of
any \tSeries G Preferred Units, any Series G Parity \tPreferred Units or any
Series G Junior Units, unless, in \teach case, all distributions accumulated
for prior quarterly \tdistribution periods on all Series G Preferred Units
and \tall classes and series of outstanding Series G Parity \tPreferred
Units have been paid in full. The foregoing sentence \twill not prohibit (i)
distributions payable solely in \tSeries G Junior Units, (ii) the conversion
of \tSeries G Junior Units or Series G Parity Preferred \tUnits into
Partnership Interests of the Partnership ranking  ---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tjunior to the Series G Preferred Units as to
distributions, \t(iii) the exchange of Series G Junior Units or \tSeries G
Parity Preferred Units of the Partnership for \tShares of the General Partner
and the corresponding issuance or \tacquisition of Series G Junior Units or
Series G \tParity Preferred Units, as applicable, to or by the
General \tPartner or (iv) the redemption of Partnership
Interests \tcorresponding to any Series G Preferred Shares, Parity \tShares
(as defined in the Articles Supplementary) or Junior \tShares (as defined in
the Articles Supplementary) to be \tpurchased by the General Partner pursuant
Section 9 of the \tArticles Supplementary, _provided_ that such
redemption \tshall be upon the same terms as the corresponding
purchase \tpursuant to Section 9 of the Articles Supplementary.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General
Partner \tmay, in its sole discretion, make one or more
special \tdistributions to itself, alone, for the sole purpose of, and
in \tan amount no greater than such amount as will be used by the \tGeneral
Partner for, the purchase of all or any portion of any \tShares pursuant to
Section 9 of the Articles Supplementary \t(any such distribution shall be
referred to as an "Excess \tShare Purchase Distribution"). There shall be no
adjustment \tof the then current Percentage Interests of the Partners
on \taccount of any Excess Share Purchase Distribution.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(e) Distributions will be payable, in arrears, to
holders \tof record of Series G Preferred Units as they appear on
the \tbooks of the Partnership on each Series G Distribution \tPayment Date.
The amount of distributions payable for the \tinitial distribution period or
any period shorter or longer than \ta full distribution period shall be
calculated on the basis of a \t360-day year of twelve 30-day months (or
actual days for any \tmonth that is shorter than a full monthly period).

The holders of the Series G Preferred Units will not be entitled to receive the Liquidation Preference until the liquidation preference of any other class of Partnership Units of the Partnership ranking senior to the Series G Preferred Units as to rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up shall have been paid (or a sum set aside therefore sufficient to provide for payment) in full. After payment of the full amount of the Liquidation Preference and such distributions, the holders of Series G Preferred Units will not be entitled to any further participation in any distribution of assets by the Partnership. If, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership, the assets of the Partnership, or proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of Series G Parity Preferred Units shall be insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributable among such holders ratably in accordance with the respective amounts which would be payable on such units if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. For the purposes hereof, neither a consolidation or merger of the Partnership with or into any other partnership, limited liability company, corporation or any other entity, nor a merger of any other partnership, limited liability company, corporation or any other entity with or into the Partnership, nor a sale or transfer of all or any part of the Partnership assets for cash or securities shall be considered a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership.    7. _Exchange; Series G Rights_ 

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(a) _Right to Exchange._   
   

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(i) Series G Preferred Units will be exchangeable
in \twhole or in part at anytime on or after April 20, 2008, at \tthe option
of the holders thereof, for authorized but previously \tunissued Series G
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of \tthe General Partner (the "Series
G Preferred \tShares") at an exchange rate of one Series G Preferred \tShare
for one Series G Preferred Unit, subject to \tadjustment as described below
(the "Series G Exchange \tPrice"), _provided_ that the Series G
Preferred \tUnits will become exchangeable at any time, in whole or in
part, \tat the option of the holders of Series G Preferred Units, \tfor
Series G Preferred Shares if (y) at any time full \tdistributions shall not
have been timely made on any \tSeries G Preferred Unit with respect to six
(6) prior \tquarterly distribution periods, whether or not consecutive, \t
_provided, however_ , that a distribution in respect of \tSeries G Preferred
Units shall be considered timely made if \tmade within two (2) Business Days
after the applicable \tSeries G Distribution Payment Date if at the time of
such \tlate payment there shall not be any prior quarterly
distribution \tperiods in respect of which full distributions were not made
or \t(z) upon receipt by a holder or holders of Series G \tPreferred Units
of (A) notice from the General Partner that \tthe General Partner or a
subsidiary of the General Partner has \ttaken the position that the
Partnership is, or upon the \toccurrence of a defined event in the immediate
future will be, a \tPTP and (B) an opinion rendered by a nationally
recognized \tcounsel familiar with such matters addressed to a holder
or \tholders of Series G Preferred Units, that the Partnership \tis or
likely is, or upon the occurrence of a defined event in \tthe immediate
future will be or likely will be, a PTP. In \taddition, the Series G
Preferred Units may be exchanged for \tSeries G Preferred Shares, in whole or
in part, at the \toption any holder prior to April 20, 2008 and
after \tApril 20, 2001 if such holders of Series G Preferred \tUnits shall
deliver to the General Partner either (i) a \tprivate letter ruling addressed
to such holder of Series G \tPreferred Units or (ii) an opinion of counsel
reasonably \tacceptable to the General Partner based on the enactment
of \ttemporary or final Treasury Regulations or the publication of
a \tRevenue Ruling, in either case to the effect that an exchange of \tthe
Series G Preferred Units at such earlier time would not \tcause the Series G
Preferred Units to be considered \t"stock and securities" within the meaning
of Section \t351(e) of the Code for purposes of determining whether
the \tholder of such Series G Preferred Units is an \t"investment company"
under Section 721(b) of the \tCode if an exchange is permitted at such
earlier date. \tFurthermore, the Series G Preferred Units may be
exchanged \tin whole or in part for Series G Preferred Shares, if both \t(1)
the holder concludes based on results or projected \tresults that there
exists (in the reasonable judgment of the \tholder) an imminent and
substantial risk that such holders \tinterest in the Partnership represents
or will represent more \tthan 19.5% of the total profits or capital interests
in the \tPartnership for a taxable year, and (2) the holder
thereof \tdelivers to the Partnership an opinion of a
nationally \trecognized counsel to the effect that there is a
substantial \trisk that such holders interest in the Partnership
will \trepresent more than 19.5% of the total profits or capital \tinterests
in the Partnership (determined in accordance with \tTreasury Regulations
Section 1.731-2(e)(4)); _provided, \thowever_ , in no event shall such a risk
be deemed to exist \tunless such percentage exceeds 15% at such time.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in \tSection 7(a)(i), if a Series G Exercise Notice has
been \tdelivered to the General Partner, then the General Partner may, \tat
its option, elect to redeem or cause the Partnership to \tredeem all or a
portion of the outstanding Series G \tPreferred Units for cash in an amount
equal to the Series G \tPreferred Unit Issue Price per Series G Preferred
Unit and \tall accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon to the date
of \tredemption. The General Partner may exercise its option to \tredeem the
Series G Preferred Units for cash pursuant to \tthis Section 7(a)(ii) by
giving each holder of record of \tSeries G Preferred Units notice of its
election to redeem \tfor cash, within five (5) Business Days after receipt
of \tthe Series G Exercise Notice, by fax (if possible) in \taccordance with
Section 15.1 of the Agreement stating \t(i) the redemption date, which shall
be no later than sixty \t(60) days following the receipt of the Series
G \tExercise Notice, (ii) the redemption price, (iii) the \tplace or places
where the Series G  ---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tPreferred Units are to be surrendered for payment of
the \tredemption price, (iv) that distributions on the \tSeries G Preferred
Units will cease to accrue on such \tredemption date, (v) that payment of the
redemption price \twill be made upon presentation and surrender of
the \tSeries G Preferred Units and delivery of a duly executed \tcertificate
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit 4_ \tand (vi) the aggregate number
of Series G Preferred \tUnits to be redeemed, and if fewer than all of the
outstanding \tSeries G Preferred Units to be redeemed, the number
of \tSeries G Preferred Units to be redeemed held by such \tholder, which
number shall equal such holders pro-rata \tshare (based on the percentage of
the aggregate number of \toutstanding Series G Preferred Units that the total
number \tof Series G Preferred Units held by such holder represents) \t(as
nearly as possible without creating fractional units) of the \taggregate
number of Series G Preferred Units being redeemed.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(iii) In the event an exchange of all or a portion
of \tSeries G Preferred Units pursuant to Section 7(a) \t(i) would violate
the provisions on ownership limitation of \tthe General Partner set forth in
Section 9 of the Articles \tSupplementary, the General Partner shall give
written notice \tthereof to each holder of record of Series G
Preferred \tUnits, within five (5) Business Days following receipt of \tthe
Series G Exercise Notice, by fax (if possible) in \taccordance with Section
15.1 of the Agreement. In such \tevent, each holder of Series G Preferred
Units shall be \tentitled to exchange a number of Series G Preferred
Units \twhich would comply with the provisions on the ownership \tlimitation
of the General Partner set forth in Section 9 of \tthe Articles Supplementary
and any Series G Preferred Units \tnot so exchanged (the "Series G Excess
Units") \tshall be redeemed by the Partnership for cash in an amount
equal \tto the Series G Preferred Unit Issue Price, plus any \taccrued and
unpaid distributions thereon, whether or not \tdeclared, to the date of
redemption. The written notice of the \tGeneral Partner shall state (i) the
number of Series G \tExcess Units held by such holder, (ii) the redemption
price \tof the Series G Excess Units, (iii) the date on which \tsuch Series
G Excess Units shall be redeemed, which date \tshall be no later than sixty
(60) days following the \treceipt of the Series G Exercise Notice, (iv)
the \tplace or places where such Series G Excess Units are to
be \tsurrendered for payment of the redemption price, (v)
that \tdistributions on the Series G Excess Units will cease to \taccrue on
such redemption date and (vi) that payment of the \tredemption price will be
made upon presentation and surrender of \tsuch Series G Excess Units and
delivery of a duly executed \tcertificate in the form attached hereto as \t
_Exhibit 4_. In the event an exchange would result in \tSeries G Excess
Units, as a condition to such exchange, \teach holder of such units agrees to
provide representations and \tcovenants reasonably requested by the General
Partner relating \tto (i) the widely held nature of the interests in
such \tholder, sufficient to assure the General Partner that the \tholders
ownership of Shares of the General Partner \t(without regard to the limits
described above) will not cause \tany individual to own in excess of 9.9% of
the Shares of the \tGeneral Partner; and (ii) to the extent such holder can
so \trepresent and covenant without obtaining information from its \towners,
the holders ownership of tenants of the \tPartnership and its Affiliates.
For purposes of determining the \tnumber of Series G Excess Units under
the \tSection 7.4(a) (iii), the "Ownership Limit" set \tforth in Section 9
of the Articles Supplementary shall be \tdeemed to be 0.8 percentage points
less than the limit set \tforth in such Section 9 of the Articles
Supplementary.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(iv) The redemption of Series G Preferred
Units \tdescribed in Section 7.4(a)(ii) and (iii) shall be subject \tto the
provisions of Section 8(b)(i) and \tSection 8(c)(ii); _provided, however_ ,
that the term \t"Series G Redemption Price" in such Sections \tshall be read
to mean the Series G Preferred Unit Issue \tPrice per Series G Preferred Unit
being redeemed plus all \taccrued and unpaid distributions to the redemption
date.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(v) All exchanges shall be in accordance with the
attached \t _Exhibit 1_.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(vi) In the event of an exchange of Series
G \tPreferred Units into Series G Preferred Shares, the General \tPartner
shall be deemed to have acquired the Series G \tPreferred Units in exchange
for the issuance of the \tSeries G Preferred Shares, provided that neither
the \tGeneral Partner, nor any subsequent transferee of the
General \tPartner, shall have any of the rights in Section 7 with \trespect
to such Series G Preferred Units.   8. _Redemption of Series G Preferred Units._ 

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(a) _Right of Optional Redemption._ The Series
G \tPreferred Units may not be redeemed prior to April 20, \t2003. On or
after such date, the Partnership shall have the \tright to redeem the Series
G Preferred Units, in whole or \tin part, at any time or from time to time,
upon not less than 30 \tnor more than 60 days written notice, at a
redemption \tprice, payable in cash, equal to the Capital Account balance
of \tthe holders of Series G Preferred Units (the \t"Series G Redemption
Price"); _provided, \thowever_ , that no redemption pursuant to this Section
8 \twill be permitted if the Series G Redemption Price does not \tequal or
exceed the Series G Preferred Unit Issue Price \tplus the cumulative Series G
Preferred Return, whether or \tnot declared, to the redemption date to the
extent not \tpreviously distributed. If fewer than all of the
outstanding \tSeries G Preferred Units are to be redeemed, the \tSeries G
Preferred Units to be redeemed shall be selected \tpro rata (based on the
percentage of the aggregate number of \tSeries G Preferred Units that the
total number of \tSeries G Preferred Units held by a holder represents)
(as \tnearly as practicable without creating fractional units).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(b) _Limitation on Redemption._   
   

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(i) The Series G Redemption Price of the \tSeries G
Preferred Units (other than the portion thereof \tconsisting of accumulated
but unpaid distributions) will be \tpayable solely out of the sale proceeds
(without giving effect \tto any temporary use of such proceeds) of Shares of
the General \tPartner, which will be contributed by the General Partner to
the \tPartnership as an additional Capital Contribution, or out of
the \tsale of Partnership Interests and from no other source. For \tpurposes
of this Attachment G, "Shares" means any \tequity securities (including
Common Shares and Preferred Shares \t(as such terms are defined in the
Declaration of Trust)), \tdepositary shares, participations or other
ownership interests \t(however designated) and any rights (other than debt
securities \tconvertible into or exchangeable for equity
securities), \twarrants or options to purchase any of the foregoing.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(ii) The Partnership may not redeem fewer than all of
the \toutstanding Series G Preferred Units unless all accumulated \tand
unpaid distributions have been paid on all Series G \tPreferred Units for all
quarterly distributions periods \tterminating on or prior to the date of
redemption.  
   

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(c) _Procedures for Redemption._   
   

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(i) Notice of redemption will be given by mail and
fax (if \tpossible) in accordance with Section 15.1 of the Agreement, \tnot
less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the \tredemption date, addressed
to the respective holders of record \tof the Series G Preferred Units at
their respective \taddresses as they appear in the records of the
Partnership. No \tfailure to give or defect in such notice shall affect
the \tvalidity of the proceedings for the redemption of any \tSeries G
Preferred Units except as to the holder to whom \tsuch notice was not given.
In addition to any information \trequired by law, each such notice shall
state: (i) the \tredemption date, (ii) the Series G Redemption
Price, \t(iii) the aggregate number of Series G Preferred Units \tto be
redeemed and if fewer than all of the outstanding \tSeries G Preferred Units
are to be redeemed, the number of \tSeries G Preferred Units to be redeemed
held by such \tholder, which number shall equal such holders pro
rata \tshare (based on the percentage of the aggregate number
of \toutstanding Series G Preferred Units that the total number \tof Series
G Preferred Units held by such holder represents) \tof the aggregate number
of Series G Preferred Units to be \tredeemed, (iv) the place or places where
such Series G \tPreferred Units are to be surrendered for payment of
the \tSeries G Redemption Price, (v) that distributions on \tthe Series G
Preferred Units to be redeemed will cease to \taccumulate on such redemption
date and (vi) that payment of the \tSeries G Redemption Price will be made
upon presentation \tand surrender of such Series G Preferred Units and a
duly \texecuted certificate in the form attached hereto as \t _Exhibit
4._  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(ii) The redemption price shall be payable to the
holders \tof the Series G Preferred Units upon presentation and \tsurrender
of the Series G Preferred Units by such holders \tand delivery of a duly
executed certificate in the form attached \thereto as _Exhibit 4_ at the
place designated in the \tnotice of redemption. If the Series G Preferred
Units are \tevidenced by a certificate and if fewer than all  ---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tSeries G Preferred Units evidenced by any certificate
are \tbeing redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued upon surrender \tof
the certificate evidencing all Series G Preferred Units, \tevidencing the
unredeemed Series G Preferred Units without \tcost to the holder thereof. On
and after the date of redemption, \tdistributions will cease to accumulate on
the Series G \tPreferred Units or portions thereof called for
redemption, \tunless the Partnership defaults in the payment thereof. If
any \tdate fixed for redemption of Series G Preferred Units is \tnot a
Business Day, then payment of the Series G Redemption \tPrice payable on such
date will be made on the next succeeding \tday that is a Business Day (and
without any interest or other \tpayment in respect of any such delay) except
that, if such \tBusiness Day falls in the next calendar year, such payment
will \tbe made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each
case \twith the same force and effect as if made on such date fixed
for \tredemption. If payment of the Series G Redemption Price
is \timproperly withheld or refused and not paid by the
Partnership, \tdistributions on such Series G Preferred Units
will \tcontinue to accumulate from the original redemption date to
the \tdate of payment, in which case the actual payment date will
be \tconsidered the date fixed for redemption for purposes of \tcalculating
the applicable Series G Redemption Price.  
    

  9. _Voting Rights._ The Series G Limited Partners shall have no voting or consent rights except for such matters as are required by Delaware law or as set forth below. So long as any Series G Preferred Units remain outstanding, the Partnership shall not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Series G Preferred Units outstanding at the time (excluding for this purpose any Series G Preferred Units acquired by the General Partner pursuant to Section 7) (i) authorize or create, or increase the authorized or issued amount of, any class or series of Partnership Interests ranking senior to the Series G Preferred Units with respect to payment of distributions or rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up or reclassify any Partnership Interests of the Partnership into any such Partnership Interest, or create, authorize or issue any obligations or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such Partnership Interests, (ii) authorize or create, or increase the authorized or issued amount of any Series G Parity Preferred Units or reclassify any Partnership Interest of the Partnership into any such Partnership Interest or create, authorize or issue any obligations or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such Partnership Interests, but only to the extent such Series G Preferred Units are authorized, created or increased solely for the purpose of issuance to an Affiliate of the Partnership, other than the General Partner to the extent the issuance of such interests was to allow the General Partner to issue corresponding preferred Shares to persons who are not Affiliates of the Partnership, (iii) amend any provision of this Section 9(d) or (iv) amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Agreement, whether by merger, consolidation, sale or lease of all the Partnerships assets as an entirety or otherwise, that would materially and adversely affect the powers, special rights, preferences, privileges or voting power of the Series G Preferred Units or the holders thereof;  _provided, however_ , that with respect to the occurrence of a merger, consolidation or a sale or lease of all the Partnerships assets as an entirety, so long as (a) the Partnership is the surviving entity and the Series G Preferred Units remain outstanding with the terms thereof unchanged, or (b) the resulting, surviving or transferee entity is a partnership, limited liability company or other pass-through entity organized under the laws of any state and substitutes the Series G Preferred Units for other interests in such entity having substantially the same terms and rights as the Series G Preferred Units, including with respect to distributions, voting rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, then the occurrence of any such event shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, privileges or voting powers of the holders of the Series G Preferred Units; and _provided further_ that any increase in the amount of Partnership Interests or the authorization, creation or issuance of any other class or series of Partnership Interests, in each case ranking (a) junior to the Series G Preferred Units with respect to payment of distributions or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or (b) on a parity to the Series G Preferred Units with respect to payment of distributions or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up to the extent such Partnership Interest are not authorized, created or increased solely for the purpose of issuance to an Affiliate of the Partnership, other than the General Partner to the extent the issuance of such interests was to allow the General Partner to issue corresponding preferred Shares to persons who are not Affiliates of the Partnership, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers.    10. _Admission to the Partnership._ Pursuant to Articles IV and XII of the Agreement, each Initial Series G Limited Partner is hereby admitted to the Partnership as a Limited Partner, and the name of each Initial Series G Limited Partner is hereby recorded in the books and records of the Partnership, effective as of the closing date of the Spieker Merger.

The General Partner also hereby consents to any Pledgees assignment of their respective rights as secured party to any person each may designate upon the occurrence of an event of default (as defined in the Securities Account Agreement). Such pledge shall not give any Pledgee any rights as a holder of Series G Preferred Units until the Pledgee provides written notice to the General Partner that an event of default has occurred under the Securities Account Agreement and, in such event, as set forth in Section 11.5 of the Agreement, such Pledgee shall be deemed an Assignee with respect to such Series G Preferred Units. Neither the Partnership nor the General Partner shall have any liability or obligation, matured, contingent or otherwise, to the Pledgees (i) under the Securities Account Agreement or (ii) with respect to the value or liquidity of the Series G Preferred Units or the Series G Preferred Shares.  

  12. _Survival of Certain Prior Obligations._ To the extent that the Belair Contribution Agreement provides that the parties; obligations thereunder shall survive the Closing (as defined in the Belair Contribution Agreement), such provisions of the Belair Contribution Agreement and the parties obligations thereunder were not merged into the provisions of the partnership agreement of Spieker Partnership, and shall not be merged into the provisions of the Agreement (including this _Attachment G_ ) and shall survive the designation of the Series G Preferred Units.

G \tLimited Partners and any claims, disputes and controversies \tbetween
any one or more Series G Limited Partners) arising \tin any way out of or in

this \tSection 13 shall be conducted in accordance with the \tfollowing
procedures:  
   

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(i) The Partnership or any Series G Limited
Partner \t(the "Requesting Party") may demand arbitration \tpursuant to
Section 13(a) at any time by giving written \tnotice of such demand (the
"Demand Notice") to any \tother Series G Limited Partner with respect to
which a \tclaim, dispute or controversy exists hereunder and (if
the \tRequesting Party is not the Partnership) to the Partnership, \twhich
Demand Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the \tnature of the claim,
dispute or controversy.       \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(ii) Within fifteen (15) days after the giving of
a \tDemand Notice, the Requesting Party, on the one hand, and each \tof the
other Series G Limited Partners and/or the \tPartnership against whom the
claim has been made or with respect \tto which a dispute has arisen
(collectively, the \t"Responding Party"), on the other hand, shall
select \tand designate in writing to the other party one
reputable, \tdisinterested individual (a "Qualified Individual") \twilling
to act as an arbitrator of the claim, dispute or \tcontroversy in question.
Each of the Requesting Party and the \tResponding Party shall use its best
efforts to select a present \tor former partner of a national accounting firm
that is not then \tcurrently employed by such party as its respective
Qualified \tIndividual. Within fifteen (15) days after the
foregoing \tselections have been made, the arbitrators so selected
shall \tjointly select a present or former partner of a
national \taccounting firm that is not then currently employed by any
of \tthe parties as the third Qualified Individual willing to act as \tan

the \tAmerican Arbitration Association shall promptly select and \tappoint a
present or former partner of a national accounting \tfirm that is not
currently employed by any of the parties as the \tQualified Individual to act
as the Third Arbitrator in \taccordance with the terms of the Arbitration

the \tarbitration panel pursuant to subsection (b) above, and
the \tarbitration panel shall render its decision in writing within \tthirty
(30) days after the completion of such \tpresentations. Any decision
concurred in by any two (2) of \tthe arbitrators shall constitute the
decision of the arbitration \tpanel, and unanimity shall not be required. If
a decision \tconcurred in by at least two (2) of the arbitrators is
not \trendered within such thirty (30) day period, then each of \tthe
parties shall select a new Qualified Individual willing to \tact as an
arbitrator and a new arbitration proceeding shall \tcommence in accordance
with this Section 13.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(iv) The arbitration panel shall have the discretion
to \tinclude in its decision a direction that all or part of
the \tattorneys fees and costs of the prevailing party or \tparties and/or
the costs of such arbitration be paid by any \tother party or parties. On the
application of a party before or \tafter the initial decision of the
arbitration panel, and proof \tof its attorneys fees and costs, the
arbitration panel \tshall order the other party to make any payments
directed \tpursuant to the preceding sentence.  
   \t

its \tdiscretion to authorize the obtaining of discovery, including \tthe
taking of depositions of witnesses for the purpose of \tdiscovery.  
   \t

shall \tmake and provide to the parties written findings of fact
and \tconclusions of law.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(vii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
provided \therein, the arbitrators shall have no authority to
award \tpunitive damages.  
   

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(c) _Binding Character._ Any decision rendered by
the \tarbitration panel pursuant to this Section 13 shall be \tfinal and
binding on the parties thereto, and judgment thereon \tmay be entered by any
state or federal court of competent \tjurisdiction sitting in the State of
Delaware.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(d) _Exclusivity._ Arbitration shall be the
exclusive \tmethod available for resolution of claims, disputes
and \tcontroversies described in Section 13(a) and the \tPartnership and its
Series G Limited Partners stipulate \tthat the provisions hereof shall be a
complete defense to any \tsuit, action, or proceeding in any court or before
any \tadministrative or arbitration tribunal within respect to any \tsuch
claim, controversy or dispute. The provisions of this \tSection 13 shall

SERIES G RIGHTS TERMS  

  The Series G Rights shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:  

  1. DELIVERY OF SERIES G EXERCISE NOTICES. Any one or more Series G Limited Partners possessing Series G Rights may deliver to the General Partner a Series G Exercise Notice pursuant to which such Series G Limited Partners elect to exercise their Series G Rights to convert all or any portion of their Series G Preferred Units into Series G Preferred Shares.  

  2. TIMING OF EXERCISE. 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) The exchange of Series G Preferred Units, or a 
specified portion thereof, may be effected after the fifth (5th)  Business
Day following receipt by the General Partner of the  Series G Preferred Units
to be exchanged together with a  duly executed certificate in the form
attached hereto as  Exhibit 5 to _Attachment G_ and, if applicable,  written
notice of exchange and a proper assignment of such  Series G Preferred Units
to the principal office of the  General Partner set forth in Section 2.3 of
the Partnership  Agreement. Each exchange will be deemed to have been
effected  immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which 
such Series G Preferred Units to be exchanged (together  with all required
documentation) shall have been surrendered and  notice shall have been
received by the General Partner as  aforesaid and the Series G Exchange Price
shall have been  paid. Any Series G Preferred Shares issued pursuant to
this  _Exhibit 3_ shall be delivered as shares which are  duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable,  free of pledge, lien,
encumbrance or restriction other than  those granted or imposed upon the
holder or provided in the  Declaration of Trust, the Bylaws of the General
Partner, the  Securities Act and relevant state securities or blue sky
laws.  
      
      |   (ii) In the event of an exchange of Series G  Preferred
Units for Series G Preferred Shares, an amount  equal to the accrued and
unpaid distributions, whether or not  declared, to the date of exchange on
any Series G Preferred  Units tendered for exchange shall accumulate on the

distribution out of Available Cash of the Partnership, if such  holder, after
exchange, is entitled to receive a distribution  out of Net Available Cash
with respect to the Series G  Preferred Share for which such Series G
Preferred Unit was  exchanged or redeemed.  
      
      |   (iii) Fractional Series G Preferred Shares are not to 
be issued upon exchange but, in lieu thereof, the General  Partner will pay a
cash adjustment based upon the fair market  value of the Series G Preferred
Shares on the day prior to  the exchange date as determined in good faith by
the Board of  Trustees of the General Partner.  
    

  3. COMPUTATION OF CONSIDERATION. 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) With respect to the exercise of Series G Rights,

(i)  subdivisions, combinations and reclassification of the  Series G
Preferred Shares, and (ii) distributions to  all holders of Series G
Preferred Shares of evidences on  indebtedness of the General Partner or
assets (including  securities, but excluding dividends and distributions paid
in  cash on the Series G Preferred Shares).  
      
      |   (ii) In case the General Partner shall be a party to

General Partners capital stock or  sale of all or substantially all of the
General Partners  assets), in each case as a result of which the Series G 
Preferred Shares will be converted into the right to receive  shares of

securities and  property (including cash or any combination thereof)
receivable  upon the consum-  ---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tmation of such transaction by a holder of that number
of \tSeries G Preferred Shares or fraction thereof into which \tone Series G
Preferred Unit was exchangeable immediately \tprior to such transaction. The
General Partner may not become a \tparty to any such transaction without the
affirmative vote of \tthe holders of at least two-thirds of the Series
G \tPreferred Units outstanding at the time unless the terms thereof \tare
consistent with the foregoing.  
    

  4. CLOSING. The closing of the exercise of the Series G Rights shall, unless otherwise mutually agreed, be held at the principal office of the General Partner.

  6. SERIES G LIMITED PARTNERS COVENANT. Each Series G Limited Partner covenants and agrees with the General Partner that all Series G Preferred Units tendered to the General Partner in accordance with the exercise of Series G Rights herein provided shall be delivered to the General Partner free and clear of all liens, and should any liens exist or arise with respect to such Series G Preferred Units, the General Partner shall be under no obligation to acquire the same.

there are funds legally available for the payment  of such distributions and
whether or not such distributions are  declared. No interest, or sum of money
in lieu of interest,  shall be payable in respect of any distribution payment
or  payments on Series H Preferred Units which may be in  arrears. Holders
of the Series H Preferred Units will not  be entitled to distributions in
excess of the full cumulative  distributions as described above.  
      
      |   (c) If any Series H Preferred Units are outstanding,

When distributions are not paid in  full (or a sum sufficient for such full
payment is not set  apart) upon the  ---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tSeries H Preferred Units and the Partnership Units
ranking \ton parity as to distributions with Series H Preferred \tUnits, all
distributions declared upon Series H Preferred \tUnits and any other series
of Partnership Units parity as to \tdistributions with Series H Preferred
Units shall be \tdeclared pro rata so that the amount of distributions
declared \tper Series H Preferred Units and such other Partnership \tUnits
shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that \taccrued
distributions per share on Series H Preferred Units \tand such other
Partnership Units bear to each other.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(d) Except as provided in Section 3(c), unless
full \tcumulative distributions on Series H Preferred Units have \tbeen or
contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and \ta sum sufficient
for the payment thereof set apart for payment \tfor all past distribution
periods and the then current \tdistribution period, no distributions (other
than in \tClass A Units or other Partnership Units ranking junior
to \tSeries H Preferred Units as to distributions and amounts \tupon
liquidation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for \tpayment or other
distribution shall be declared or made upon the \tClass A Units, Class B
Units, Series A Preferred \tUnits, Series B Preferred Units, Series C
Preferred \tUnits, Series D Preferred Units, Series H Preferred \tUnits,
Series G Preferred Units and Series H Preferred \tUnits or any other
Partnership Units ranking junior to or on a \tparity with Series H Preferred
Units as to distributions or \tupon liquidation, nor shall any Class A Units,
Class B \tUnits, Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred \tUnits,
Series C Preferred Units, Series H Preferred \tUnits, Series G Preferred
Units and Series H Preferred \tUnits, or any other Partnership Units ranking
junior to or on a \tparity with Series H Preferred Units as to distributions
or \tamounts upon liquidation be redeemed by the Partnership (except \tby
conversion into or exchange for other Partnership Units \tranking junior to
Series H Preferred Units as to \tdistributions and amounts upon
liquidation).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(e) Any distribution payment made on Series
H \tPreferred Units shall first be credited against the earliest \taccrued
but unpaid distribution due with respect to \tSeries H Preferred Units which
remains payable.  
    

  D. _Allocations._ Allocations of the Partnerships items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated among the holders of Series H Preferred Units in accordance with Article VI of the Agreement.  

  E. _Liquidation Preference._  

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(a) Subject to the rights of series of Preferred
Units \twhich may from time to time come into existence, upon
any \tvoluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up \tof
the affairs of the Partnership, then, before any distribution \tor payment
shall be made to the holders of any Class A \tUnits, Class B Units, or any
other class or series of \tPartnership ranking junior to Series H Preferred
Units in \tthe distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution
or \twinding up of the affairs of the Partnership, the holders of \tSeries H
Preferred Units shall be entitled to receive out \tof assets of the
Partnership legally available for distribution \tto limited partners,
liquidation distributions in the amount of \tthe liquidation preference of
$25.00 per share, plus an amount \tequal to all distributions accrued and
unpaid thereon. After \tpayment of the full amount of the liquidating
distributions to \twhich they are entitled, the holders of Series H
Preferred \tUnits will have no right or claim to any of the remaining
assets \tof the Partnership. In the event that, upon any such voluntary \tor
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the \taffairs of the
Partnership, the available assets of the \tPartnership are insufficient to
pay the amount of the \tliquidation distributions on all outstanding Series
H \tPreferred Units and the corresponding amounts payable on
all \tPartnership Units ranking on a parity with Series H \tPreferred Units
in the distribution of assets upon any \tliquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the affairs of the \tPartnership ("Parity Units"), then the holders
of \tSeries H Preferred Units and Parity Units shall share \tratably in any
such distribution of assets in proportion to the \tfull liquidating
distributions to which they would otherwise be \trespectively entitled.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(b) For the purposes hereof, neither a consolidation
or \tmerger of the Partnership with or into any other partnership, \tlimited
liability company, corporation or any other entity, nor \ta merger of any
other partnership, limited liability company, \tcorporation or any other
entity with or into the Partnership, \tnor a sale or transfer of all or any
part of the Partnership \tassets for cash or securities shall be considered a
liquidation, \tdissolution or winding up of the Partnership.   F. _Redemption_  

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(a) Series H Preferred Units are not redeemable
prior \tto June 4, 2003. On and after June 4, 2003, the \tGeneral Partner
may redeem outstanding Series H Preferred \tUnits, in whole or in part, at
any time or from time to time, \tfor cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per
unit, plus an \tamount equal to all distributions accrued and unpaid thereon
to \tthe date fixed for redemption, without interest. The redemption \tprice
of Series H Preferred Units (other than the portion \tthereof consisting of
accrued and unpaid distributions) is \tpayable solely out of proceeds
(without giving effect to any \ttemporary use of such proceeds) from the
contributions with \trespect to other Partnership Units, which may
include \tClass A Units, Class B Units, Preferred Units, or \tother
ownership interests in the Partnership however designated \t(other than debt
securities converted into or exchangeable for \tPartnership Units), and any
rights, warrants or options to \tpurchase any thereof. If fewer than all of
the outstanding \tSeries H Preferred Units are to be redeemed, the number
of \tunits to be redeemed will be determined by the General Partner \tand
such units may be redeemed pro rata from the holders of such \tunits in
proportion to the number of such units held by such \tholders (with
adjustments to avoid redemption of fractional \tunits) or by lot in a manner
determined by the General Partner.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(b) Unless full cumulative distributions on
all \tSeries H Preferred Units and Parity Units shall have been \tor
contemporaneously are paid or declared and a sum sufficient \tfor the payment
thereof set apart for payment for all past \tdistribution periods and the
then current distribution period, \tno Series H Preferred Units or Parity
Units shall be \tredeemed unless all outstanding Series H Preferred Units
and \tParity Units are simultaneously redeemed; _provided,_  \thowever, that
the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or \tacquisition of Series H
Preferred Units or Parity Units \tpursuant to a purchase or exchange offer
made on the same terms \tto holders of all outstanding Series H Preferred
Units or \tParity Units, as the case may be. Furthermore, unless
full \tcumulative distributions on all outstanding Series H \tPreferred
Units and Parity Units have been or contemporaneously \tare paid or declared
and a sum sufficient for the payment \tthereof set apart for payment for all
past distribution periods \tand the then current distribution period, the
Partnership shall \tnot purchase or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly
any \tSeries H Preferred Units or Parity Units (except by \tconversion into
or exchange for Partnership Units ranking junior \tto Series H Preferred
Units and Parity Units as to \tdistributions and amounts upon liquidation).  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(c) The General Partner shall, in its sole
discretion, \tdetermine the form and content of a notice of redemption.
If \tnotice of redemption of any Series H Preferred Units has been \tgiven
and if the funds necessary for such redemption have been \tset aside by the
Partnership in trust for the benefit of the \tholders of Series H Preferred
Units so called for \tredemption, then from and after the redemption
date, \tdistributions will cease to accrue on such Series H \tPreferred
Units, such Series H Preferred Units shall no \tlonger be deemed outstanding
and all rights of the holders of \tsuch units will terminate, except the
right to receive the \tredemption price.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(d) The holders of Series H Preferred Units at
the \tclose of business on a Distribution Record Date will be entitled \tto
receive the distribution payable with respect to such \tSeries H Preferred
Units on the corresponding Distribution \tPayment Date notwithstanding the
redemption thereof between such \tDistribution Record Date and the
corresponding Distribution \tPayment Date or the Partnerships default in the
payment of \tthe distribution due. Except as provided above, the
Partnership \twill make no payment or allowance for unpaid
distributions, \twhether or not in arrears, on Series H Preferred
Units \twhich have been called for redemption.  
    

  F. _Status of Redeemed Series H Preferred Units._ In the event any Series H Preferred Units shall be redeemed pursuant hereto, the units so redeemed shall revert to the status of authorized but unissued Preferred Units available for future issuance and reclassification by the General Partner.  

  G. _Value._ For purposes of the definition of Deemed Value of Partnership Interest, the Value on any date of the Series H Preferred Units shall be the Liquidation Preference of such Series H Preferred Unit.  

  H. _Voting Rights._ The holders of Series H Preferred Units shall have no voting rights whatsoever, except for any voting rights to which they may be entitled under the laws of the State of Delaware.   Exhibit I  FORM OF PROPOSED EQUITY OFFICE CHARTER AMENDMENTS

---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(a) The Partnership agrees for the benefit of each
Sale \tRestriction Partner, for the term of the Protected
Period \tapplicable to such Sale Restriction Partner, not to directly
or \tindirectly sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of any
Protected \tProperty.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(b) Notwithstanding the restriction set forth
in \tParagraph 2(a), the Partnership may dispose of a Protected \tProperty
if such disposition qualifies as a like-kind exchange \tunder Section 1031 of
the Code, or an involuntary \tconversion under Section 1033 of the Code, or
other \ttransaction (including, but not limited to, a contribution
of \tproperty to any entity that qualifies for the nonrecognition of \tgain
under Section 721 or Section 351 of the Code, or \ta merger or consolidation
of the Partnership with or into \tanother entity that qualifies for taxation
as a \t"partnership" for federal income tax purposes (a \t"Successor
Partnership")) that does not result in the \trecognition of any taxable
income or gain to a Sale Restriction \tPartner with respect to Protected
Units; _provided, \thowever_ , that: (1) in the event of a disposition
under \tSection 1031 or Section 1033 of the Code, any property that \tis
acquired in exchange for or as a replacement for a Protected \tProperty shall
thereafter be considered a Protected Property for \tpurposes of this
Paragraph 2; (2) if the Protected \tProperty is transferred to another entity
in a transaction in \twhich gain or loss is not recognized, the interest of
the \tPartnership in such entity shall thereafter be considered
a \tProtected Property for Purposes of this Paragraph 2, and if \tthe
acquiring entitys disposition of the Protected \tProperty would cause a Sale
Restriction Partner to recognize \tgain or loss as a result thereof, the
transferred Protected \tProperty still shall be considered a Protected
Property for \tpurposes of this Paragraph 2 and the transferee shall
have \tagreed to be jointly and severally liable for any payments \trequired
under Section 2(c) hereof; (3) in the event \tof a merger or consolidation
involving the Partnership and a \tSuccessor Partnership, the Successor
Partnership shall have \tagreed in writing for the benefit of the Sale
Restriction \tPartners that all of the restrictions of this Paragraph
2 \tshall apply with respect to the Protected Properties, and \t(4) after
the end of the ten (10) year period \tbeginning on the closing date of the
Spieker Merger, the \tPartnership may dispose of a Protected Property in a
transaction \tthat would have qualified as a like-kind exchange
under \tSection 1031 of the Code or as another transaction that \twould not
have resulted in the recognition of any taxable income \tor gain to the
Former Spieker Limited Partner under the federal \tincome tax law in effect
on the closing date of the Spieker \tMerger and prior to the date of such
transaction, even if, as a \tresult of change in law after the closing date
of the Spieker \tMerger, such transaction results in the recognition of
income or \tgain to the Former Spieker Limited Partner at the time of
such \ttransaction.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(c) In the event that the Partnership breaches
its \tobligation set forth in Paragraph 2(a) with respect to a \tSale
Restriction Partner during the Protected Period applicable \tto such Sale
Restriction Partner, the Sale Restriction \tPartners sole right shall be to
receive from the \tPartnership as damages an amount equal to the aggregate
federal, \tstate and local income taxes (computed taking into account
any \tdeduction allowed in computing federal income taxes for state \tincome
taxes payable as a result thereof) incurred by the Sale \tRestriction Partner
as a result of the gain allocated to such \tSale Restriction Partner with
respect to Protected Units by \treason of such disposition, plus an amount
equal to the \taggregate federal, state, and local income taxes payable by
the \tSale Restricted Partner as a result of the receipt of any \tpayment
required under this Section 2(c). In the event that \ta Sale Restriction
Partner shall acquire any additional \tPartnership Units subsequent to the
Spieker Merger by reason of \ta contribution of additional money or property
to the \tPartnership, the gain that be taken into account for purposes
of \tcomputing the damages payable under this Paragraph 2(c) \twould not
exceed the gain that such Sale Restriction Partner \twould have recognized by
reason of the Partnerships breach \tof its obligation set forth in Paragraph
2(a) had such Sale \tRestriction Partner not acquired such additional
Partnership \tUnits. In addition, in no event shall the gain taken
into \taccount for purposes of computing the damages payable under
this \tParagraph 2(c) exceed the amount of gain that would have \tbeen
recognized by the Sale Restriction Partner with respect to \tthe Protected
Units if the Partnership had sold the Protected \tProperty in a fully
taxable

_Exhibit E-9_, the sole and exclusive rights and \tremedies of any Sale
Restriction Partner for a breach or \tviolation of the covenants set forth in

shall be entitled to pursue a claim for specific \tperformance of the
covenant set forth in Paragraph 2(a) or \tbring a claim against any Person
that acquires a Protected \tProperty from the Partnership in violation
of \tParagraph 2(a) (other than a Successor Partnership that has \tagreed in
writing to be bound by the terms of this \tExhibit E-9 or that has otherwise
succeeded to all of the \tassets and all of the liabilities of the
Partnership, but then \tonly for damages computed as set forth in Paragraph
2(c)). \tIf the Partnership has breached or violated the covenant
set \tforth in Paragraph 2(a) (or a Sale Restriction Partner \tasserts that
the Partnership has breached or violated the \tcovenant set forth in
Paragraph 2(a)), the General Partner \tand the Sale Restriction Partner agree
to negotiate in good \tfaith to resolve any disagreements regarding any such
breach or \tviolation and the amount of damages, if any, payable to
such \tSale Restriction Partner under Paragraph 2(c). If any
such \tdisagreement cannot be resolved by the General Partner and
such \tSale Restriction Partner within sixty (60) days after such \tbreach,
the General Partner and the Sale Restriction Partner \tshall jointly retain a
nationally recognized independent public \taccounting firm ("an Accounting
Firm") to act as an \tarbitrator to resolve as expeditiously as possible all
points of \tany such disagreement (including, without limitation, whether
a \tbreach of the covenant set forth Paragraph 2(a) has \toccurred and, if
so, the amount of damages to which the Sale \tRestriction Partner is entitled

  3. _Election by Certain Former Spieker Limited Partners to Enter into Bottom Guarantees of Debt of EOP Partnership._  

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(a) During the Guarantee Protection Period,
the \tPartnership shall make available to each Guarantee Partner
the \topportunity (a "Guarantee Opportunity") to make a \t"bottom guarantee"
of Qualifying Debt of the \tPartnership in the form of the Guaranty Agreement
and in an \tamount at least equal with respect to each Guarantee Partner
to \tthe amount set forth on _Schedule 4_ to this \t _Exhibit E-9_,
determined taking into account all \texisting guarantees of such Guarantee
Partner that are then in \teffect (treating as "bottom guarantees" for
this \tpurpose the guarantees that are in effect with respect to
the \tindebtedness that is guaranteed as of February 17, 2001, by \tthe
Guarantee Partners pursuant to the Guaranty Agreement, as \tset forth on
_Schedule 4_ to this \t _Exhibit E-9_). During the Guarantee
Protection \tPeriod, if Guaranteed Debt is repaid and, immediately after
such \trepayment, (i) the amount remaining outstanding with \trespect to
such Guaranteed Debt would be less than the \tGuaranteed Amount with respect
to such Guaranteed Debt or \t(ii) the Guaranteed Debt no longer would be
treated as \tQualifying Debt, the Partnership shall provide to each
Guarantee \tPartner that had a Guaranteed Amount with respect to
such \tGuaranteed Debt a new Guarantee Opportunity in an amount equal \tto
such Partners Guaranteed Amount with respect to the \tGuaranteed Debt being
repaid or no longer qualifying as \tQualifying Debt, _provided that_ if the
Guaranteed Debt is \tnot being repaid in full, the new Guaranty Opportunity
can be an \toffer to allow a guarantee of a portion of that remaining
debt \tso long as the remaining portion of such debt, after taking
into \taccount the Guaranty Opportunities being offered with
respect \tthereto, would be Qualifying Debt. In the event that
the \tPartnership is required to offer a Guarantee Opportunity \tpursuant to
this Paragraph 3(a), the Partnership will \tprovide the Guarantee Partners
notice of the type, amount and \tother relevant attributes of the Qualifying
Debt with respect to \twhich the Guarantee Opportunity is offered at least
fifteen \t(15) business days, to the extent reasonably practicable, \tbut in
no event less than ten (10) business days prior to \t(a) the earlier of the
closing of the incurrence of such \tdebt and the scheduled repayment of the
existing Guaranteed Debt \tand (b) any

---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tsubsequent date on which the Partnership makes
additional \tGuarantee Opportunities by reason of the repayment of
any \tindebtedness then subject to a Guarantee by the Guarantee \tPartners.
In the event that the Partnership repurchases \toutstanding Guaranteed Debt,
whether or not such debt is \tretired, the repurchase thereof shall be
treated as a repayment \tof the Guaranteed Debt for purposes of this
Paragraph 3.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(b) The Partnership makes no representation or
warranty to \tany Guarantee Partner that any guarantee currently in effect
or \tany "bottom guarantee" entered into pursuant to \tParagraph 3(a) shall
be respected for federal income tax \tpurposes for purposes of causing the
Guarantee Partner to be \tconsidered to bear the "economic risk of loss"
with \trespect to the indebtedness thereby guaranteed by such
Guarantee \tPartner for purposes of either Section 752 or \tSection 465 of
the Code.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(c) In the event that the Partnership breaches
its \tobligation set forth in Paragraph 3(a) with respect to a \tGuarantee
Partner during the Guarantee Protection Period \tapplicable to such Guarantee
Partner, the Guarantee \tPartners sole right shall be to receive from
the \tPartnership as damages an amount equal to the aggregate
federal, \tstate and local income taxes (computed taking into account
any \tdeduction allowed in computing federal income taxes for state \tincome
taxes payable as a result thereof) incurred by the \tGuarantee Partner as a
result of the gain recognized by such \tGuarantee Partner by reason of such
failure, plus an amount \tequal to the aggregate federal, state, and local
income taxes \tpayable by the sale restricted partner as a result of
the \treceipt of payment required under this Section 3(c). In no \tevent
shall the amount taken into account for purposes of \tcomputing the damages
payable under this Paragraph 3(c) \texceed the amount of gain that would have
been recognized by the \tGuarantee Partner if, at the closing of the Spieker
Merger, such \tGuarantee Partner has recognized an amount of gain equal to
the \t"negative capital account" that it had with respect to \tits interest
in the Spieker Partnership at the time of the \tSpieker Merger. The
Partnership shall be considered to have \tsatisfied it obligations under
Paragraph 3(a), and \ttherefore shall have no liability under
this \tParagraph 3(c), if it make an offer to a Guarantee Partner \tof an
opportunity to guarantee Qualifying Debt within the time \tperiods specified
in Paragraph 3(a); the Partnership shall \thave no liability if a Guarantee
Partner fails to join in such \tguarantee of Qualifying Debt.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this \t
_Exhibit E-9_, the sole and exclusive rights and \tremedies of any Guarantee
Partner for a breach or violation of \tthe covenants set forth in Paragraph
3(a), shall be a claim \tfor damages against the Partnership, computed as set
forth in \tParagraph 3(c), and no Guarantee Partner shall be entitled \tto
pursue a claim for specific performance of the covenant set \tforth in
Paragraph 3(a). If the Partnership has breached or \tviolated the covenant
set forth in Paragraph 3(a) (or a \tGuarantee Partner asserts that the
Partnership has breached or \tviolated the covenant set forth in Paragraph
3(a)), the \tGeneral Partner and the Guarantee Partner agree to negotiate
in \tgood faith to resolve any disagreements regarding any such \tbreach or
violation and the amount of damages, if any, payable \tto such Guarantee
Partner under Paragraph 3(c). If any such \tdisagreement cannot be resolved
by the General Partner and such \tGuarantee Partner within sixty (60) days
after such breach, the \tGeneral Partner and the Guarantee Partner shall
jointly retain \tan Accounting Firm to act as an arbitrator to resolve
as \texpeditiously as possible all points of any such
disagreement \t(including, without limitation, whether a breach of the
covenant \tset forth Paragraph 3(a) has occurred and, if so, the \tamount of
damages to which the Sale Restriction Partner is \tentitled as a result
thereof, determined as set forth in \tParagraph 3(c)). All determinations
made by the Accounting Firm \twith respect to the resolution of any breach or
violation of the \tcovenant set forth in Paragraph 3(a) and the amount of
damages \tpayable to the Guarantee Partner under Paragraph 3(c) shall \tbe
final, conclusive and binding on the Partnership and the \tGuarantee Partner.
The fees and expenses of any Accounting Firm \tincurred in connection with
any such determination shall be \tshared equally by General Partner and the
Guarantee Partner.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(e) In addition to the other rights set forth in
this \tParagraph 3, each Guarantee Partner shall have the right, \tbut not
the obligation, upon fifteen (15) business days \tprior written notice to the
Partnership, to enter into an \tadditional "bottom guarantee" of the
Spieker \tPartnership 7.125% Notes due December 1, 2006 (the \t"2006
Notes"), in an amount up to the Available \tAdditional Debt specified for
such Guarantee Partner on \t _Schedule 4_ to this _Exhibit 9_. In

---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tsuch right, the Guaranteed Amount of such Guarantee
Partner \tshall be increased by the amount of such additional
guarantee, \tand the provisions of Paragraphs 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), and
3(d) \tshall thereafter apply with respect to such guarantee as though \tit
were in effect at the closing of the Spieker Merger. The \trights of the
Guarantee Partners pursuant hereto, if not \texercised, shall expire upon the
earlier of the maturity or the \tprior prepayment of the 2006 Notes,
_provided that_ the \tPartnership shall give the Guarantee Partners
thirty \t(30) days prior notice of the prepayment of the 2006 Notes.  
    

  4. _No Obligation of the Partnership to Maintain Debt._ Notwithstanding any obligations of the Partnership referred to in this _Exhibit E-9_, the Partnership shall not be obligated to maintain any level of indebtedness in excess of the amounts specifically required to meet the obligations set forth in Paragraph 3 above or otherwise specifically required to be maintained under the Spieker Tax Protection Agreements assumed by the Partnership pursuant to the Merger Agreement.  

  5. _Section 704(c) Method._ Notwithstanding Paragraph 2.C. of _Exhibit C_, the Partnership shall use the "traditional method" under Regulations Section 1.704-3(b) for purposes of making allocations under Section 704(c) of the Code with respect to each Spieker Property to take into account the Book-Tax Disparities as of the effective time of the Spieker Merger with respect to the Spieker Properties, with no "curative allocations" to offset the effect of the "ceiling rule," except to the extent that the Partnership expressly would be required to use a different method under a Spieker Tax Protection Agreement assumed by the Partnership pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The 704(c) Values of the Spieker Properties shall be as determined by agreement between Spieker Partnership and the Partnership prior to the effective time of the Spieker Merger, or in the absence of such agreement, as determined by the General Partner for purposes of preparing the financial statements of the Partnership and the General Partner reflecting the results of the Spieker Merger so long as the outside accountants of the General Partner and the Partnership have approved such financial statements as being in accordance with generally accepted accounting procedures.  

  6. _Allocations of "Tier 3" Nonrecourse Liabilities Pursuant to Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3)._ 

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t(a) The Partnership shall use commercially
reasonable \tefforts to cooperate with the Former Spieker Limited
Partners \tset forth on _Schedule 1_ to this \t _Exhibit 9_ to determine
the method to be used for \tallocating "excess nonrecourse liabilities" of
the \tPartnership pursuant to Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3) \tfollowing
the Spieker Merger. The Partnership shall not use with \trespect to such
Former Spieker Limited Partners a method that is \tless favorable than the
method used by the Partnership with \trespect to the other Limited Partners
of the Partnership who are \tnot parties to the express agreements in effect
on \tFebruary 17, 2001, specifying a particular method to be \tused for such
purposes, which are set forth on \t _Schedule 5_ to this _Exhibit E-9_.
In \taddition, the Partnership shall not make available after the \tdate of
the Spieker Merger, whether pursuant to an agreement \tentered into after
such date or otherwise, to any other Limited \tPartner a method of allocating
"excess nonrecourse \tliabilities" of the Partnership that is more favorable
than \tthat made available to such Former Spieker Limited Partners \twithout
making such method available to the Former Spieker \tLimited Partners on a
pro rata basis with such other Limited \tPartners (except as, and only to the
extent, required pursuant \tto an agreement in effect on February 17, 2001,
identified \ton _Schedule 5_ to this _Exhibit E-9_). In \tthe case of a
Former Spieker Limited Partner who, prior to the \tSpieker Merger, had been
specially allocated a portion of a \tSpieker Partnership nonrecourse
liability secured by a property \twith respect to which such Spieker Partner
has a built-in gain \tunder Section 704(c) of the Code to take into account
such \tFormer Spieker Limited Partners share of such built-in \tgain that
was not taken into account in making the allocation of \tsuch liability by
Spieker Partnership under Regulations \tSection 1.752-3(a)(2), the
Partnership shall continue such \tmethod of allocating such liability
following the Spieker Merger.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(b) If the amount of debt allocated to a Former
Spieker \tLimited Partner under Section 1.752-3(a)(3) of the Code
is \treduced following the Spieker Merger from the amount allocated \tto
such Former Spieker Limited Partner immediately before the \tSpieker Merger
and such reduction could reasonably be expected \tto cause the Former Spieker
Limited Partner to recognize gain by \treason of a deemed distribution of
cash to it in excess of its \tadjusted basis in its Partnership Interest, the
Partnership \tshall consider in good faith a request from such Former
Spieker \tLimited Partner to become a Protected  
    

E-9 - 6  

* * *

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tPartner and/or to increase its Protected Amount, as
applicable, \tfrom time to time after the Spieker Merger and/or to enter
into \ta guarantee of Qualifying Debt on terms substantially similar
to \tthose set forth in the Guaranty Agreement if such Former
Spieker \tLimited Partner shall provide information from its
professional \ttax advisor satisfactory to the Partnership showing that, in
the \tabsence of such increased Protected Amount or guarantee,
such \tLimited Partner likely would not be allocated from the \tPartnership
sufficient indebtedness under Section 752 of \tthe Code and the at-risk
provisions under Section 465 of \tthe Code to avoid the recognition of gain
(other than gain \trequired to be recognized by reason of actual cash
distributions \tfrom the Partnership). The Partnership and its professional
tax \tadvisors shall cooperate in good faith with such Former
Spieker \tLimited Partner and its professional tax advisor to provide
such \tinformation regarding the allocation of the Partnership \tliabilities
and the nature of such liabilities as is reasonably \tnecessary in order to
determine the Former Spieker Limited \tPartners adjusted tax basis in its
Partnership Interest \tand at-risk amount. In deciding whether or not to
grant such a \trequest, the Partnership shall be entitled to take into
account \tall factors related to the Partnership, including,
without \tlimitation, the existing and anticipated debt structure of
the \tPartnership, the tax situations of all other Partners, including \tthe
General Partner (individually and as a group), and the \teffect that granting
such a request might have on their tax \tsituation, and the anticipated long-
term business needs of the \tPartnership. The Partnerships only obligation
with respect \tto any such request from a Former Spieker Limited
Partner \tpursuant to this Paragraph 6(b) shall be to act in good \tfaith.
In the event the Partnership fails to act in good faith \twith respect to any
such request, the exclusive remedy of the \tFormer Spieker Limited Partner
who made such request shall be an \taction for specific performance, with no
entitlement to monetary \tdamages.  
    

  7. _Effect of Other Agreements With Former Spieker Limited Partners._ Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the General Partner, the Partnership, Spieker, and Spieker Partnership entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, dated as of  ,  2001, pursuant to which the Partnership assumed certain obligations of Spieker Partnership made pursuant to certain tax protection agreements (the "Spieker Tax Protection Agreements") set forth on _Schedule 6_ to this  _Exhibit E-9_.  

  8. _Election by Certain Former Spieker Limited Partners to Undertake Deficit Restoration Obligation._ Each Former Spieker Limited Partner who, prior to February 18, 2001, had entered into an agreement with Spieker Partnership to bear the economic risk of loss as to a portion of Spieker Partnerships recourse indebtedness by undertaking the obligation to restore a portion of its negative capital account balance upon liquidation of such Former Spieker Limited Partners interest in Spieker Partnership was given the opportunity to become a Protected Partner with a Protected Amount in an amount equal to the maximum amount such Former Spieker Limited Partner was obligated to restore to Spieker Partnership on February 17, 2001; _provided, however_ , that no Former Spieker Limited Partner has the right to increase its Protected Amount following the Spieker Merger. The Former Spieker Limited Partners who have elected to become Protected Partners under such provision of the Merger Agreement, along with their specified Protected Amounts as of the closing of the Spieker Merger, are set forth on _Schedule 6_ to this  _Exhibit E-9_. Each such election by a Former Spieker Limited Partner shall become effective upon the later of receipt thereof by the General Partner or the "effective time" of the merger of Spieker Partnership into the Partnership. Upon becoming effective, each such election by a Former Spieker Limited Partner pursuant to this Section 8 or any other provision of this Exhibit E-9 shall be irrevocable, cannot be reduced, and shall be binding upon successive transferees of the Former Spieker Limited Partners, except as provided in Section 13.3.D of the Agreement.

Schedule 3 to Exhibit E-9  

Form of Restriction Agreement  

 [Individuals Name] Restriction Agreement  

  ,  2001  

Equity Office Properties Trust 
  EOP Limited Partnership 
  Two North Riverside Plaza 
  Suite 2100 
  Chicago, Illinois 60606  

 Ladies and Gentlemen:  

  The undersigned understands that Equity Office Properties Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust ("Equity Office"), EOP Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership ("EOP Partnership"), Spieker, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Spieker"), and Spieker, L.P., a California limited partnership ("Spieker Partnership"), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 22, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which (i) Spieker Partnership will be merged with and into EOP Partnership or with a subsidiary of EOP Partnership (the "Partnership Merger") and (ii) Spieker will be merged with and into Equity Office (the "Merger" and, together with the Partnership Merger, the "Mergers").  

  The Merger Agreement contemplates that, in connection with the closing of the Partnership Merger, EOP Partnership will make certain undertakings related to federal income tax matters to certain limited partners of Spieker Partnership, including the undersigned, who contributed assets to Spieker Partnership in connection with its formation in 1993 and will become EOP Limited Partners as a result of the Partnership Merger. The specific undertakings and agreements with respect to these matters will be set forth on _Exhibit E-9_ to the EOP Partnership Agreement pursuant to the [ ] Amendment to the EOP Partnership Agreement, which will be effective as of the Effective Time.  

  Under the terms of _Exhibit E-9_, the term during which certain of these "tax protection" undertakings by EOP Partnership will apply can be extended from ten years to up to twenty years for those Spieker limited partners who agree to and comply with the restrictions set forth in this Restriction Agreement. In order to obtain the benefit of the extended term of the "tax protection" undertakings of EOP Partnership available under _Exhibit E-9_, and for other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the undersigned hereby agrees as follows:  

 1. _Definitions_   

  All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement. As used in herein:  

  "Disposition" shall include any sale (including a grant of any option, contract to sell and any sale of a contract to purchase), assignment, pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation, mortgage, exchange, or any swap agreement or other arrangement that transfers all or a portion of the economic consequences associated with the ownership (regardless of whether any of the transactions described above is to be settled by the delivery of Partnership Units, Shares, or such other securities, in cash or otherwise), _provided that_ a pledge of Partnership Units or Shares to secure bona fide indebtedness that does not exceed sixty percent (60%) of the Value (as defined in the EOP Partnership Agreement) of the Partnership Units or Shares pledged to secure such indebtedness at the time such indebtedness is incurred shall not constitute a Disposition (but a disposition of the Partnership Units or Shares securing such indebtedness pursuant to a foreclosure or in lieu of foreclosure shall constitute a Disposition at the time of such foreclosure or delivery in lieu thereof). "Dispose" shall have the correlative meaning.  

E-9 - 12   

* * *

  

  "Equity Interest" means the total number of Shares and Partnership Units in which the undersigned will acquire a beneficial interest at the Effective Time, computed assuming that the undersigned had not disposed of any Spieker OP Units or shares of Spieker Common Stock after February 17, 2001 and assuming that each share of Spieker Common Stock would be converted into 1.94462 Equity Office Common Shares (that is, that the undersigned would receive only Equity Office Common Shares (and no cash) in the Merger). The undersigneds Equity Interest is set forth on _Schedule 1_ hereto.  

  "Extended Restriction Period" means the period commencing on the day following the second (2nd) anniversary of the Effective Time and ending on the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Effective Time.  

  "Immediate Family" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Article I of the EOP Partnership Agreement.  

  "Initial Restriction Period" means the period commencing on the date hereof and continuing to and including the second (2nd) anniversary of the Effective Time.  

  "Partnership Units" means (a) the EOP "Partnership Units" (as such term is defined in Article I of the EOP Partnership Agreement) in which the undersigned will acquire a beneficial interest in connection with the Partnership Merger at the Effective Time and (b) any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for such Partnership Units in which the undersigned will acquire a beneficial interest in connection with the Partnership Merger at the Effective Time.  

  "Permitted Disposition" means a Disposition to (i) a member of the Immediate Family of the undersigned, (ii) a charitable organization a contribution to which would be deductible pursuant to Section 170 of the Code, or (iii) any partnership or trust, the partners or beneficiaries, as applicable, of which are exclusively the undersigned or members of the Immediate Family of the undersigned and/or a charitable organization a contribution to which would be deductible pursuant to Section 170 of the Code, provided that any such transfer shall not involve a disposition for value; _provided_ that the transferee in any such Disposition described in clause (i), clause (ii) or clause (iii), as applicable, agrees in writing to be bound by the restrictions set forth herein for the term hereof. Any Disposition by a permitted transferee shall be treated as a Disposition by undersigned for purposes of this agreement.  

  "Redemption Rights" means, as applicable, any Redemption Rights pursuant to Section 8.6 of the EOP Partnership Agreement.  

  "Shares" means (a) the Equity Office "Shares" (as such term is defined in Article VI of the Equity Office Declaration of Trust) in which the undersigned would acquire a beneficial interest in connection with the Merger at the Effective Time, assuming that the undersigned were to receive only Equity Office Shares (and no cash) in the Merger and (b) any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Shares in which the undersigned will acquire a beneficial interest in connection with the Merger at the Effective Time.  

 2. _Initial Restriction Period_   

  During the Initial Restriction Period, the undersigned shall not Dispose of Partnership Units and/or Shares if such Disposition, taken together with all prior Dispositions (excluding Permitted Dispositions) since February 17, 2000 of any Shares, Partnership Units, shares of Spieker Common Stock and/or Spieker OP Units, would result in a decrease in the undersigneds Equity Interest on the date hereof by thirty percent (30%) or more; _provided_ that nothing herein shall prevent the undersigned from making a Permitted Disposition pursuant to which the transferee becomes subject to the terms and restrictions of this Restriction Agreement.  

 3. _Extended Restriction Periods_   

  During the Extended Restriction Period, the undersigned shall not Dispose of Partnership Units and/or Shares if such Disposition, taken together with all prior Dispositions (excluding Permitted Dispositions) since February 17, 2000 of any Shares, Partnership Units, shares of Spieker Common Stock and/or Spieker OP  

E-9 - 13  

* * *

 

 

 Units, would result in a decrease in the undersigneds Equity Interest on
the date hereof by an amount equal to or greater than the sum of (x) thirty
five percent (35%) and (y) the product of (a) five percent (5%),
multiplied by (b) number of full years of the Extended Restriction Period
that have expired on the date of such Disposition;  _provided_ that nothing
herein shall prevent the undersigned from making a Permitted Disposition
pursuant to which the transferee becomes subject to the terms
and restrictions of this Restriction Agreement. 

  

 4. _Representation and Acknowledgements_   

  The undersigned now has good and marketable title to the undersigneds units of limited partner interest in Spieker Partnership and shares of capital stock of Spieker, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, and claims whatsoever. The undersigned acknowledges that (a) in the event of a breach of the restriction set forth in Section 2 hereof, the Protected Period for purposes of Section 2 of  _Exhibit E-9_ to the EOP Partnership Agreement with respect to the undersigned will be limited to ten (10) years from the Effective Time and (b) in the event of a breach of the restrictions set forth in Section 3, the Protected Period for purposes of Section 2 of  _Exhibit E-9_ to the EOP Partnership Agreement with respect to the undersigned will not include any period attributable to the year of the Extended Restriction Period in which the breach occurs or any year thereafter. The undersigned further understands that this Restriction Agreement is irrevocable and shall be binding upon the undersigneds heirs, legal representatives, successors, and assigns.  

 5. _Limitation on Remedies._   

  In entering into this agreement, the undersigned is doing so with the understanding the exclusive remedy of EOP Partnership and Equity Office in the event of a breach hereof will be to limit the Protected Period as set forth in  _Exhibit E-9_, and that in no event shall either Equity Office or EOP Partnership have the right to seek specific performance of this agreement or to bring an action for damages hereunder.  

 6.   _Miscellaneous_   

  This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. This agreement is irrevocable and will be binding on the undersigned and the respective successors, heirs, personal representatives, and assigns of the undersigned. The undersigned has carefully read this agreement and discussed its requirements, to the extent the undersigned believed necessary, with his counsel.

Schedule 8-1 to Exhibit E-9  

Form of Guaranty Agreement  For Unsecured Indebtedness  Between Guarantee
Partners, Equity Office and EOP Partnership Pursuant to Section 3(a)
of Exhibit E-9(6)  

GUARANTY AGREEMENT  

  THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT ("Agreement"), dated as of [date] is made and entered into by and among EOP Operating Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (the "Partnership"), Equity Office Properties Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust (the "General Partner"), and those certain undersigned Persons identified on _Schedule 1_ attached hereto (as such Schedule 1 may be amended, modified, supplemented or restated from time to time, the "EOP Limited Partners").  

  WHEREAS, the General Partner is the general partner of the Partnership and each of the EOP Limited Partners is a limited partner in the Partnership.  

  WHEREAS, the Partnership has issued certain unsecured notes (each of those unsecured notes identified on  _Schedule 2_ attached hereto and referred to herein individually as a "Note" and collectively as the "Notes");  

  WHEREAS, it is in the best interests of each of the EOP Limited Partners that the Partnership and the General Partner provide to the EOP Limited Partners an opportunity to guaranty the payment and performance of a portion of the Partnerships present and future indebtedness and obligations under the Notes;  

  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and conditions set forth herein, as well as other valuable consideration, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:  

  1. _Capitalized Terms._ Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings as set forth in the partnership agreement of the EOP Operating Limited Partnership, as such partnership agreement may be amended, modified, supplemented or restated from time to time (the "Partnership Agreement").  

  2. _Partner Assumption of Indebtedness._  

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \ta. The EOP Limited Partners unconditionally guarantee
to \tthe Partnership (and, as third party beneficiaries, the holders \tof
the Notes) the payment and performance of the \tPartnerships present and
future indebtedness and \tobligations under the Notes of at least an amount
equal to \t[TOTAL GUARANTY AMOUNT] (the "Total Guaranty Amount") \t(i.e.,
that the aggregate principal amounts paid under the Notes \tby the
Partnership will at least equal the Total Guaranty \tAmount). In addition,
the EOP Limited Partners unconditionally \tindemnify the General Partner (and
any other partner of the \tPartnership that otherwise may have liability
directly or \tindirectly with respect thereof) from and against
all \tliabilities in respect of the Notes except to the extent
such \tliability exceeds an amount equal to the excess, if any, of \t(i) the
Total Guaranty Amount over (ii) payments of \tprincipal made by the
Partnership on the Notes. The Partnership \tand the General Partner shall
sometimes hereinafter be referred \tto collectively as the "Debtor". The
amounts payable \tby each EOP Limited Partner in respect of the guarantee
and \tindemnification obligations hereunder shall be in the
same \tproportion as the amounts listed next to such EOP Limited \tPartners
name on _Schedule 3_ attached hereto \tbears to the Total Guaranty Amount
provided that, \tnotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this \tParagraph 2, each EOP Limited Partners obligation \tshall be limited
to the amount(s) set forth on \t _Schedule 3_ next to such EOP Limited
Partners \tname (with respect to each EOP Limited Partner, a "EOP \tLimited
Partners Share") and shall be limited to \tguaranteeing the payment and
performance of, and indemnifying \tthe General Partner with respect to, only
the Notes set forth on \t _Schedule 3_. For the purposes of
this \tParagraph 2,    

 6 In the event that Spieker Partnership and EOP Partnership agree prior the
closing of the Spieker Merger, this form of Guaranty Agreement shall be
revised to make it a "master" Guaranty Agreement covering all
unsecured indebtedness of the Partnership at to which there are
guarantees from the Guarantee Partners outstanding.

       |   
---|--- 
     |  Notes that are repurchased by the Partnership but not
retired shall not be treated as having been repaid except to the
extent that, if the repurchased Notes were treated as having been repaid,
the remaining outstanding balance of the Notes would be less than 200% of the
Total Guaranty Amount with respect to such Notes.   
      
      |   b. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in  the Partnership Agreement or the Bylaws or Declaration of Trust  of the
General Partner, as each may be amended, modified,  supplemented or restated
from time to time, any decision by  Debtor hereunder, including a decision to
make a demand on the  EOP Limited Partners under this Paragraph 2, shall
require  the majority vote of the independent directors of the General 
Partner. Each EOP Limited Partner authorizes Debtor at any time  in its
discretion to alter any of the terms of the Notes and to  make such
modifications to the Notes that have the effect of  releasing Debtor from
liability for all or any part of the  Notes; _provided, however_ , that the
Partnership shall have  complied with its obligations under _Exhibit E-9_
of  the Partnership Agreement to offer the EOP Limited Partners the 
opportunity to guarantee other Qualifying Debt or shall have  agreed to make
the payments required under  _Exhibit E-9_ of the Partnership Agreement.
Debtor and  the holders of the Notes or any other parties authorized 
pursuant to the documents executed in connection with such  Notes, and under
all modifications, renewals and extensions of  those instruments
(collectively, the "Loan Documents")  to enforce collection thereof
(collectively, the "Note  Holders") may take any of the foregoing actions
upon any  terms and conditions as Debtor and the Note Holders may elect, 
without giving notice to any EOP Limited Partner or obtaining  the consent of
any EOP Limited Partner and without affecting the  liability of any EOP
Limited Partner under this Paragraph 2.  
      
      |   c. It is understood and agreed by each EOP Limited
Partner  that until an amount with respect to the principal amount of the 
Notes equal to the Total Guaranty Amount is fully paid and until  each and
every term, covenant and condition of this  Paragraph 2 is fully performed,
no EOP Limited Partner  shall be released by any act or event which might,
but for this  provision of this Paragraph 2, be deemed a legal or  equitable
discharge of a surety, or by reason of any waiver,  extension, modification,
forbearance or delay or other act or  omission of any Note Holder or the
Partnerships failure to  proceed promptly or otherwise as against the
General Partner or  Debtors failure to proceed promptly or otherwise as 
against any EOP Limited Partner or any Note Holders  failure to proceed
promptly or otherwise against Debtor, or by  any reason of any action taken
or omitted or circumstance which  may or might vary the risk or affect the
rights or remedies of  any EOP Limited Partner as against Debtor or any Note
Holder, or  by reason of any further dealings between Debtor and any Note 
Holder, whether relating to the Notes or otherwise, and each EOP  Limited
Partner hereby expressly waives and surrenders any  defense to its liability
hereunder based upon any of the  foregoing acts, omissions, things,
agreements, waivers or any of  them; it being the purpose and intent of this
Paragraph 2  that the obligations of each EOP Limited Partner hereunder are 
absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances. Each  EOP Limited
Partners obligations under this  Paragraph 2 are independent of those of
Debtor.  Debtors rights under this Paragraph 2 will not be  exhausted by
any action by it until an amount equal to the Total  Guaranty Amount has been
fully paid and performed with respect  to the Notes and the period of time
has expired during which any  payment made to the Note Holders by Debtor
under the Notes or to  Debtor by each EOP Limited Partner under this
Paragraph 2  may be determined to be a Preferential Payment (as defined 
below) without such determination, in fact, being made. Each EOP  Limited
Partner further agrees that to the extent all or any  part of any payment
made to the Note Holders under the Notes or  by a EOP Limited Partner under
this Paragraph 2 is  subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or 
preferential, set aside or required to be repaid by the  recipient thereof or
paid over to a trustee, receiver or any  other entity, whether under any
bankruptcy act or otherwise (any  such payment is hereinafter referred to as
a "Preferential  Payment"), then this Paragraph 2 shall continue to be 
effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, and, to  the extent of
such payment or repayment, the obligations of the  EOP Limited Partner shall
be revived and continued in full force  and effect as if said Preferential
Payment had not been made.  Each EOP Limited Partner waives: (a) all statutes
of  limitations as a defense to any action brought against any  Limited
Partner pursuant to this Paragraph 2, to the  fullest extent permitted by
law; (b) any defense based upon  any legal disability of Debtor or any
discharge or limitation of  the liability of Debtor to the Note Holders,
whether consensual  or arising by operation or law

   \t  \t|  \tor any bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership,
insolvency, or \tdebtor-relief proceeding, or from any other cause; \t(c)
presentment, demand, protest and notice of any kind, \tprovided that the
foregoing waiver shall not be construed to \twaive any demand or notice to
the EOP Limited Partners expressly \tprovided for in this Paragraph 2; and
(d) any defense \tupon or arising out of any defense which Debtor may have to
the \tpayment or performance of any part of the Notes.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \td. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this \tParagraph 2 to the contrary, each EOP Limited Partner \thereby waives
any claim or other rights which such EOP Limited \tPartner may now have or
hereafter acquire against the General \tPartner, or each of them, or any
other EOP Limited Partner, or \tany other Person (including, without
limitation, any other \tpartner in the Partnership), of all or any of the
Notes that \tarise from the existence or performance of such EOP
Limited \tPartners obligations under this Paragraph 2, the \tNotes or any
of the Loan Documents (all such claims and rights \tare referred to as the
"EOP Limited Partners \tConditional Rights"), including, without limitation,
any \tright of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, \tor
indemnification, any right to participate in any claim or \tremedy of the
Partnership or the Note Holders against the \tGeneral Partner, whether or not
such claim, remedy or right \tarises in equity or under contract, statute or
common law, by \tany payment made hereunder or otherwise, including,
without \tlimitation, the right to take or receive from Debtor,
directly \tor indirectly, in cash or other property or by setoff or in
any \tother manner, payment or security on account of such claim or \tother
rights. If, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, any \tamount shall be
paid to any EOP Limited Partner on account of \tany such EOP Limited
Partners Conditional Rights and \teither (i) such amount is paid to such EOP
Limited Partner \tat any time when the Notes shall not have been paid or
performed \tin a principal amount equal to the Total Guaranty Amount,
or \t(ii) regardless of when such amount is paid to such EOP \tLimited
Partner, any payment made by Debtor to the Note Holders \tor by a EOP Limited
Partner under this Paragraph 2 is at \tany time determined to be a
Preferential Payment such that the \ttotal principal amount received by Note
Holders, less the \tPreferential Payment, is less than the Total Guaranty
Amount, \tthen a portion of the amount paid to such EOP Limited
Partner \tequal to the such EOP Limited Partners proportionate share \tof
the excess of the Total Guaranty Amount over the principal \tamount received
by Note Holders (net of the Preferential \tPayment) shall be held in trust
for the benefit of Debtor and \tthe Note Holders, as their interests may
appear, and shall \tforthwith be paid to the Partnership as a Capital
Contribution \tto be credited and applied upon the Notes, whether matured
or \tunmatured, in such order as Debtor, in its sole and
absolute \tdiscretion, shall determine. To the extent that any of
the \tprovisions of this Paragraph 2 shall not be enforceable, \teach EOP
Limited Partner agrees that until such time as the \tNotes have been paid and
performed in a principal amount equal \tto the Total Guaranty Amount and the
period of time has expired \tduring which any payment made by Debtor to the
Note Holders or \tby a EOP Limited Partner under this Paragraph 2 may
be \tdetermined to be a Preferential Payment, the EOP Limited \tPartners
Conditional Rights to the extent not validly \twaived shall be subordinate to
the Note Holders right to \tpayment and performance of the Notes up to the
Total Guaranty \tAmount, and such EOP Limited Partner shall not enforce such
EOP \tLimited Partners Conditional Rights during such period. \tEach EOP
Limited Partner assumes full responsibility for keeping \tfully informed of
the financial condition of Debtor and all \tother circumstances affecting
Debtors ability to perform \tits obligations under the Loan Documents and
agrees that neither \tDebtor nor the Note Holders will have any duty to
report to any \tEOP Limited Partner any information which Debtor or the
Note \tHolders receive about Debtors financial condition or
any \tcircumstances being on Debtors ability to perform.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \te. Upon a default of the Partnership under the
Loan \tDocuments, the Note Holders may elect to compromise, or adjust \tany
part of the Notes, or make any other accommodation with \tDebtor, or exercise
any other remedy against Debtor. Except as \texpressly provided herein, no
such action by the Note Holders \twill release or limit the liability of any
EOP Limited Partner. \tIn addition to all rights of setoff or lien against
any moneys, \tsecurities or other property of any EOP Limited Partner given
to \tthe Partnership by law, the Partnership shall have a right of \tsetoff
against all distributions to which a EOP Limited Partner \tmay be entitled
from the Partnership, and every such right of \tsetoff may be exercised
without demand upon or notice to any EOP \tLimited Partner (except the notice
expressly provided for \tabove). No right of setoff shall be deemed to have
been waived \tby any act or conduct on the part of the Partnership or

---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tby any neglect to exercise such right of setoff, or by any
delay \tin doing so; and every right of setoff shall continue in
full \tforce and effect until specifically waived or released by
an \tinstrument in writing executed by the Partnership or until a
EOP \tLimited Partner has satisfied in full all of such EOP
Limited \tPartners obligations under this Paragraph 2\. In the \tevent that
any EOP Limited Partner shall advance or become \tobligated to pay any sums
toward the Notes, or in the event that \tfor any reason whatsoever Debtor is
now, or shall hereafter \tbecome, indebted to any EOP Limited Partner, each
EOP Limited \tPartner agrees that the amount of such sums and
such \tindebtedness and all interest thereon shall at all times
be \tsubordinate as to lien, time of payment and in all other \trespects to
the prior repayment to Note Holders of a principal \tamount equal to the
Total Guaranty Amount, and no EOP Limited \tPartner shall be entitled to
enforce or receive payment thereof \tuntil a principal amount equal to the
Total Guaranty Amount \towing to the Note Holders has been paid in full and
the period \tof time has expired during which any payment made by Debtor
to \tthe Note Holders or the EOP Limited Partners pursuant to
this \tParagraph 2 may be determined to be a Preferential Payment. \tAny
payment made by any EOP Limited Partner under this \tParagraph 2 shall be
deemed to be a Capital Contribution by \tsaid EOP Limited Partner to the
Partnership.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \tf. This Paragraph 2 shall be governed by
Delaware \tlaw, and, except to the extent otherwise provided in
this \tParagraph 2, may be amended only by a written instrument \texecuted
by the EOP Limited Partners listed from time to time on \t _Schedule 1_
hereto and Debtor. Notwithstanding \tanything to the contrary provided
herein, in no event shall any \tEOP Limited Partner be entitled to the
issuance of any \tadditional Partnership Units as a result of any
contribution \tmade by such EOP Limited Partner pursuant to this \tParagraph
2, nor shall the Percentage Interests or \tPartnership Interests of the
Partners be adjusted as a result \tthereof. Without limiting any other
similar provision in this \tAgreement, the provisions of this Paragraph 2
shall bind \tand benefit the heirs executors, administrators,
legal \trepresentatives, successors and assigns of each EOP
Limited \tPartner and Debtor.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \tg. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of
the \tEOP Limited Partners to make any payments under this \tParagraph 2
shall terminate as of the earliest date (the \t"Termination Date") that, as a
result of a repayment, \tcompromise or adjustment of a principal amount of
the Notes, the \ttotal principal amount outstanding under the Notes is
reduced by \tan amount equal to or greater than the Total Guaranty Amount,
or \tif the Partnership incurs indebtedness senior to the Notes, \tprovided
that the obligations of the EOP Limited Partners \thereunder shall continue
after the Termination Date to the \textent of any claims that are
attributable fully and solely to \tan event or action that occurred before
the Termination Date, \tand provided further that the Partnership shall offer
the EOP \tLimited Partners a Guarantee Opportunity in replacement of
the \tguarantee provided under this Guaranty Agreement to the
extent \trequired pursuant to _Exhibit E-9_ of the
Partnership \tAgreement.  
    

  3. _Non-Discrimination._ The Partnership and the General Partner agree to exercise all of their rights under Paragraph 2 above in a non-discriminatory manner with respect to the EOP Limited Partners and in a manner that is not disproportionate to any of the EOP Limited Partners Shares of the Indebtedness, provided that the foregoing shall not impair or limit either the Partnerships or the General Partners right to exercise all of their rights under Paragraph 2 above to the fullest extent permitted under this Agreement.  

  4. _Notices._ All notices, offers or other communications required or permitted to be given pursuant to this Agreement shall be given in the manner and to the addresses set forth in the Partnership Agreement and shall be deemed at such time as is set forth in the Partnership Agreement.  

  5. _Effect and Interpretation._ This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in conformity with the laws of the State of Delaware.  

  6. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.

   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t(ii) Within fifteen (15) days after the giving of

GUARANTY AGREEMENT  

  THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT ("Guarantee"), dated as of  ,  2001, is made by those certain undersigned Persons identified on _Schedule 1_ attached hereto ("Guarantors"), in favor of [LENDER] ("Guaranteed Party").  

  WHEREAS, [BORROWER] ("Maker"), is indebted to the Guaranteed Party in the sum of [LOAN], as evidenced by a certain Promissory Note dated [DATE] (the "Note"), which is secured by a Mortgage (the "Mortgage") on certain property of the Maker(the "Properties" and individually, a "Property").  

  WHEREAS, the Guarantors desire to guarantee collection of a portion of the principal amount of the Note not in excess of [Guaranteed Amount] (the "Guaranteed Amount").  

  NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Guarantors agree as follows:  

1. _Guarantee_   

  A. The Guarantors hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee the collection by the Guaranteed Party of, and hereby agree to pay to the Guaranteed Party upon demand (following (1) foreclosure of the Mortgage, exercise of the powers of sale thereunder and/or acceptance by the Guaranteed Party of a deed to a Property in lieu of foreclosures, and (2) the exhaustion of the exercise of any and all remedies available to the Guaranteed Party against Maker, including, without limitation, realizing upon the assets of Maker other than the Properties), an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Guaranteed Amount over the Maker Proceeds (as hereinafter defined). The amounts payable by each Guarantor in respect of the guarantee obligations hereunder shall be in the same proportion as the amounts listed next to such Guarantors name on _Schedule 2_ attached hereto bears to the Guaranteed Amount provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each Guarantors obligation shall be limited to the amount(s) set forth on  _Schedule 2_ next to such Guarantors name. The Guarantors obligations as set forth in this Paragraph 1.A. are hereinafter referred to as the "Guaranteed Obligations."  

  B. For the purposes of this Guarantee, the term "Maker Proceeds" shall mean the aggregate of the Foreclosure Proceeds (as hereinafter defined) plus all amounts collected from the Maker or realized from the sale of assets of the Maker other than the Properties.  

  C. For the purposes of this Guarantee, the term "Foreclosure Proceeds" shall have the applicable meaning set forth below with respect to a Property: 

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \t1. If at least one bona fide third party unrelated to
the \tGuaranteed Party (and including, without limitation, any of
the \tGuarantors) bids for such Property at a sale thereof, conducted \tupon
foreclosure of the related Mortgage or exercise of the \tpower of sale
thereunder, Foreclosure Proceeds shall mean the \thighest amount bid for such
Property by the party that acquires \ttitle thereto (directly or through a
nominee) at or pursuant to \tsuch sale. For the purposes of determining such
highest bid, \tamounts bid for the Property by the Guaranteed Party shall
be \ttaken into account notwithstanding the fact that such bids
may \tconstitute credit bids which offset against the amount due to \tthe
Guaranteed Party under the Note.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t2. If there is no such unrelated third-party at such
sale \tof the Property so that only bidder at such sale is the \tGuaranteed
Party or its designee, the Foreclosure Proceeds shall \tbe deemed to be fair
market value (the "Fair Market \tValue") of the Property as of the date of
the foreclosure \tsale, as such Fair Market Value shall be mutually agreed
upon by \tthe Guaranteed Party and the Guarantor or determined pursuant
to \tsubparagraph 1.D.  
   \t   
   \t  \t|  \t3. If the Guaranteed Party receives and accepts a
deed to \tthe Property in lieu of foreclosure in partial satisfaction
of \tMakers obligations under the Note, the Foreclosure \tProceeds shall be
deemed to  
    

E-9 - 31  

* * *

     \t \t|   
---|--- 
   \t  \t|  \tbe the Fair Market Value of such Property as of the date
of \tdelivery of the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, as such Fair
Market \tValue shall be mutually agreed upon by the Guaranteed Party
and \tthe Guarantor or determined pursuant to subparagraph 1.D.  
    

  D. Fair Market Value of a Property shall be the price at which a willing seller not compelled to sell would sell such Property, and a willing buyer not compelled to buy would purchase the Property, free and clear of all mortgages but subject to all leases and reciprocal easement and operating agreements. If the Guaranteed Party and Guarantor are unable to agree upon the Fair Market Value of a Property in accordance with subparagraphs 1.C.2. or 3. above, as applicable, within twenty (20) days after the date of the foreclosure sale or the delivery of the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, as applicable, relating to a Property, either party may have the Fair Market Value of a Property determined by appraisal by appointing an appraiser having the qualifications set forth below to determine the same and by notifying the other party of such appointment within twenty (20 days after the expiration of such twenty (20) day period. If the other party shall fail to notify the first party, within twenty (20) days after its receipt of notice of the appointment by the first party, of the appointment by the other party of an appraiser having the qualifications set forth below, the appraiser appointed by the first party shall alone make the determination of such Fair Market Value. Appraisers appointed by the parties shall be members of the Appraisal Institute (MAI) and shall have at least ten years experience in the valuation of properties similar to the Property being valued in the greater metropolitan area in which such Property is located. If each party shall appoint an appraiser having the aforesaid qualifications and is such tow appraiser cannot, within thirty (30) days after the appointment of the second appraiser, agree upon the determination hereinabove required, then they shall select a third appraiser which third appraiser shall have the aforesaid qualifications, and if they fail so to do within forty (40) days after the appointment of the second appraiser they shall notify the parties hereto, and either party shall thereafter have the right, on notice to the other, to apply, for the appointment of a third appraiser to the chapter of the American Arbitration Association or its successor organization located in the metropolitan area in which the Property is located or to which the Property is proximate or if no such chapter is located in such metropolitan area, in the metropolitan area closest to the Property in which such a chapter is located. Each appraiser shall render its decision as to the Fair Market Value of the Property in question within thirty (30) days after the appointment of the third appraiser and shall furnish a copy thereof to the Guaranteed Party and Guarantor. The Fair Market Value of the Property shall then be calculated as the average of (i) the Fair Market Value determined by the third appraiser and (ii) whichever of the Fair Market Values determined by the first two appraisers is closer to the Fair Market Value determined by the third appraiser; provided, however, that if the Fair Market Value determined by the third appraiser is higher or lower than both Fair Market Values determined by the first two appraiser, such Fair Market Value determined by the third appraiser shall be disregarded and the Fair Market Value of the Property shall then be calculated as the average of the Fair Market Value determined by the first two appraisers. The Fair Market Value of a Property as so determined shall be binding and conclusive upon the Guaranteed Party and Guarantor. Each party shall bear the cost of its own appraiser and the cost of appointing, and the expenses of, the third appraiser shall be shared equally by the Guaranteed Party and Guarantor.  

2. _Waivers: Other Agreements._   

  The Guaranteed Party is hereby authorized, without notice to demand upon Guarantors, which notice or demand is expressly waived hereby, and without discharging or otherwise affecting the enforceability of the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder (which shall remain absolute and unconditional notwithstanding any such action or omission to act), from time to time to:

guaranteed by others.
