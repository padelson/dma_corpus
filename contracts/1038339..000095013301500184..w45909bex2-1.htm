<P align="center"><B>AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER</B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this &#147;Agreement&#148;),
dated as of February 22, 2001, by and among EQUITY OFFICE
PROPERTIES TRUST, a Maryland real estate investment trust
(&#147;Equity Office&#148;), EOP OPERATING LIMITED PARTNERSHIP,
a Delaware limited partnership (&#147;EOP Partnership&#148;),
SPIEKER PROPERTIES, INC., a Maryland corporation
(&#147;Spieker&#148;), and SPIEKER PROPERTIES, L.P., a
California limited partnership (&#147;Spieker Partnership&#148;).

<P align="center"><I>R E C I T A L S:</I>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A.&nbsp; The Board of Trustees of Equity Office and the Board of
Directors of Spieker deem it advisable and in the best interests
of their respective shareholders, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions contained herein, that Spieker shall merge with
and into Equity Office (the &#147;Merger&#148;).

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
B.&nbsp; Equity Office, as the sole general partner of EOP
Partnership, and Spieker, as the sole general partner of Spieker
Partnership, deem it advisable and in the best interests of
their respective limited partners, subject to the conditions and
other provisions contained herein, that, immediately prior to
the Merger, Spieker Partnership shall merge with and into EOP
Partnership (or such other entity as provided in
Section&nbsp;1.1(a)), with the holders of partnership interests
in Spieker Partnership at the time of the Partnership Merger
receiving in any event units of limited partnership interest in
EOP Partnership, as set forth herein (the &#147;Partnership
Merger&#148; and, together with the Merger, the
&#147;Mergers&#148;).

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
C.&nbsp; Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, immediately prior to the Merger, EOP Partnership and
Spieker Partnership shall execute a Certificate of Merger (the
&#147;Delaware Certificate of Merger&#148;) in substantially the
form attached hereto as <I>Exhibit&nbsp;A</I> and shall file
such Delaware Certificate of Merger in accordance with Delaware
law to effectuate the Partnership Merger.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
D.&nbsp; Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, immediately prior to the Merger, EOP Partnership and
Spieker Partnership shall execute a Certificate of Merger (the
&#147;California Certificate of Merger&#148;) in substantially
the form attached hereto as <I>Exhibit&nbsp;B</I> and shall file
such California Certificate of Merger in accordance with
California law to effectuate the Partnership Merger.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
E.&nbsp; Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, immediately following the effectiveness of the

Articles of Merger (the &#147;Articles of Merger&#148;) in
substantially the form attached hereto as <I>Exhibit&nbsp;C
</I>and shall file such Articles of Merger in accordance with
Maryland law to effectuate the Merger.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
F.&nbsp; For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under
Section&nbsp;368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), and that this Agreement shall
constitute a plan of reorganization under Section&nbsp;368(a) of
the Code.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
G.&nbsp; For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Partnership Merger, regardless of form, be treated as a
contribution by Spieker Partnership of all of its assets to EOP
Partnership in exchange for partnership interests in EOP
Partnership, as provided for herein, under Section&nbsp;721 of
the Code, and a distribution of such partnership interests by
Spieker Partnership to its partners under Section&nbsp;731 of
the Code.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
H.&nbsp; Equity Office, EOP Partnership, Spieker and Spieker
Partnership desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Mergers.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I.&nbsp;&nbsp; Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement
and as an inducement to Equity Office and EOP Partnership to
enter into this Agreement, Messrs. Warren E. Spieker, Jr., John
K. French and Dennis E. Singleton, as owners of voting capital
stock of Spieker Northwest, Inc., a California corporation
(&#147;Spieker TRS&#148;), have entered into a Stock Purchase
Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, relating to the voting
capital stock of Spieker TRS (the &#147;Stock Purchase
Agreement&#148;), providing for the sale of their shares of
outstanding voting capital stock of Spieker TRS to Equity Office
Properties Management Corp. (&#147;Equity Office TRS&#148;) or
its assigns.

<P align="center">

<!-- PAGEBREAK -->
<P><HR noshade><P>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
J.&nbsp; As an inducement to Equity Office to enter into this
Agreement, certain executive officers of Spieker have entered
into a voting agreement (each, a &#147;Spieker Voting
Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which such person has agreed,
among other things, to vote his shares of Spieker Common Stock
and Spieker OP Units (as defined herein) to approve this
Agreement, the respective Mergers and any other matter which
requires his vote in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained
herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

<P align="center">ARTICLE 1

<P align="center">THE MERGERS

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.1&nbsp; <I>The Partnership Merger.</I>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp; Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and in accordance with Title 6, Chapter&nbsp;17 of
the Delaware Code Annotated, as amended (the
&#147;DRULPA&#148;), and Title 2, Chapter&nbsp;3,
Article&nbsp;7.5 of the California Corporations Code, as amended
(the &#147;CRULPA&#148;), immediately prior to the consummation
of the Merger, Spieker Partnership shall be merged with and into
EOP Partnership with EOP Partnership as the surviving limited
partnership (or, at EOP Partnership&#146;s option, with a
limited liability company owned entirely, directly and/or
indirectly, by EOP Partnership, or a limited partnership owned
entirely, directly and/or indirectly, by EOP Partnership, as
determined by Equity Office and EOP Partnership), with the
entity designated by EOP Partnership being the surviving limited
partnership or limited liability company, as applicable,
provided that the alternative structure does not materially
adversely affect any class or series of partnership interests in
Spieker Partnership) (the &#147;Surviving Partnership&#148;),
and with the holders of partnership interests in Spieker
Partnership receiving in any event units of partnership interest
in EOP Partnership, as set forth in Section&nbsp;1.10(a).

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp; Pursuant to Treasury Regulation
&#167;&nbsp;1.708-1(c)(3), EOP Partnership and Spieker
Partnership intend that the Partnership Merger be treated as an
&#147;assets over&#148; form of merger, with the consequences
set forth in Treasury Regulation &#167;&nbsp;1.708-1(c)(3)(i).
In addition, if and to the extent that any transaction entered
into pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise deemed undertaken
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is treated for federal income tax purposes as a direct
or indirect transfer of cash from EOP Partnership to a holder of
Spieker OP Units or Spieker Preferred OP Units that would be
characterized as a sale for federal income tax purposes,
pursuant to Treasury Regulation &#167;&nbsp;1.708-1(c)(4) such
sale shall be treated by all parties as a sale by the former
holder of Spieker OP Units or Spieker Preferred OP Units
receiving (or deemed to receive) such cash of Spieker OP Units
or Spieker Preferred OP Units to EOP Partnership and as a direct
purchase by EOP Partnership of such Spieker OP Units or Spieker
Preferred OP Units from such former holder of Spieker OP Units
or Spieker Preferred OP Units immediately prior to the
Partnership Merger (and not as a transfer of cash from EOP
Partnership to Spieker Partnership as part of the Partnership
Merger). Each holder of Spieker OP Units or Spieker Preferred OP
Units who receives, directly or indirectly, any cash in
connection with the Partnership Merger shall be deemed, by such
holder&#146;s act of receiving and accepting such cash, to have
agreed to the characterization of such transaction set forth in
the immediately preceding sentence for purposes of Treasury
Regulation&nbsp;&#167;&nbsp;1.708-1(c)(4).

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.2&nbsp; <I>The Merger.</I> Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with
Title 3 of the Corporations and Associations Article of the
Annotated Code of Maryland, as amended (&#147;Title 3&#148;),
and Title 8 of the Corporations and Associations Article of the
Annotated Code of Maryland, as amended (&#147;Title 8&#148;),
Spieker shall be merged with and into Equity Office, with Equity
Office surviving as a real estate investment trust (the
&#147;Surviving Trust&#148;).

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.3&nbsp; <I>Closing.</I> The closing of the Mergers (the
&#147;Closing&#148;) will take place commencing at 9:00 a.m.,
local time, on the date to be specified by the parties, which
(subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Article&nbsp;6) shall be no later than the third business day
after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Section&nbsp;6.1 (the &#147;Closing Date&#148;), at the offices
of Hogan &#38; Hartson L.L.P., 885&nbsp;Third Avenue, New York,
NY 10022, unless another date or place is agreed to in writing
by the parties.

<P align="center">2

shall execute and file the Delaware Certificate of Merger,
executed in accordance with the DRULPA, with the Office of the

with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of
California and (ii)&nbsp;Equity Office and Spieker shall then
execute and file the Articles of Merger, executed in accordance

recordings required, with respect to the Partnership Merger,
under the DRULPA and the CRULPA or, with respect to the Merger,
under Title&nbsp;3 and Title&nbsp;8. The Mergers shall become
effective (each an &#147;Effective Time&#148; and collectively

and Spieker shall agree should be specified in the Delaware
Certificate of Merger, the California Certificate of Merger and
the Articles of Merger (not to exceed thirty (30)&nbsp;days
after the Articles of Merger are accepted for record by the
Department). Unless otherwise agreed, the parties shall cause
the Effective Times to occur on the Closing Date, with not less
than one hour between the Effective Time of the Partnership
Merger and the Effective Time of the Merger.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.5&nbsp; <I>Effect of Partnership Merger on Agreements of
Limited Partnership.</I> The Second Amended and Restated

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.6&nbsp; <I>Effect of Merger on Declaration of Trust and

effect as of the Effective Time of the Merger, and if approved
by the Equity Office shareholders, as amended by the Proposed

Merger, who shall continue to serve for the balance of their
unexpired terms or their earlier death, resignation or removal,
together with Mr.&nbsp;Warren E. Spieker, Jr., Craig G. Vought
and John A. Foster, each of whom shall, no later than the third

reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, (i)&nbsp;the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which the shares

commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to
mail (or make available for collection by hand if so elected by
the surrendering holder) such amount to such holder within five
business days after receipt thereof, and (iii)&nbsp;the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Spieker Common
Stock or any series of Spieker Preferred Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of Spieker, payment may be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment either shall pay
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of such payment
being made to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Equity Office
that such tax or taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section&nbsp;1.13,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Merger Consideration, without interest, into which the

Preferred Stock heretofore represented by such Certificate shall
have been converted pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.10, and any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.13(d) and any cash payable

shall be entitled, in its sole and absolute discretion, to

or Equity Office Preferred Shares (as defined herein), or any
combination thereof, that otherwise is payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Spieker Common Stock or any
series of Spieker Preferred Stock such amounts as Equity Office
or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or under
any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. For this
purpose, any Equity Office Common Shares or Equity Office
Preferred Shares deducted and withheld by Equity Office shall be
valued at the last trading price of the Equity Office Common
Shares or the Equity Office Preferred Shares, as applicable, on
the New York Stock Exchange on the Effective Date of the Merger
(or in the event that a series of Equity Office Preferred Shares
does not trade on the New York Stock Exchange, at the
liquidation preference (excluding unpaid dividends) per Equity
Office Preferred Share). To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Equity Office or the Exchange Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Spieker Common
Stock or a series of Spieker Preferred Stock, as applicable, in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Equity Office or the Exchange Agent.

duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of
its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so

not reasonably be expected to have a Spieker Material Adverse
Effect (as defined herein). As used in this Agreement, a
&#147;Spieker Material Adverse Effect&#148; means any
circumstance, event, occurrence, change or effect that is
materially adverse to the business, properties, assets (tangible

estate industry generally which do not affect Spieker or Spieker
Partnership, as the case may be, materially disproportionately
relative to other participants in the real estate industry
similarly situated, or (iii)&nbsp;in and of itself and without
the occurrence of any other Spieker Material Adverse Effect,
changes in the trading prices of Spieker Common Stock or any

previously been delivered or made available to Equity Office,
are listed in <I>Schedule&nbsp;2.11 </I>to the Spieker

&#147;Affiliate&#148; shall have the same meaning as such term
is defined in Rule&nbsp;405 promulgated under the Securities Act.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2.12&nbsp; <I>Employee Benefits.</I> As used herein, the term
&#147;Employee Plan&#148; includes any pension, retirement,
savings, disability, medical, dental, health, life, death
benefit, group insurance, profit sharing, deferred compensation,
stock option, bonus, incentive, vacation pay, tuition
reimbursement, severance pay, or other employee benefit plan,
trust, agreement, contract, agreement, policy or commitment
(including, without limitation, any pension plan, as defined in
Section&nbsp;3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (&#147;ERISA&#148;) (&#147;Pension Plan&#148;), and
any welfare plan as defined in Section&nbsp;3(1) of ERISA
(&#147;Welfare Plan&#148;)), whether any of the foregoing is
funded, insured or self-funded, written or oral,
(i)&nbsp;sponsored or maintained by Spieker, any Spieker
Subsidiary or Spieker TRS (each, a &#147;Controlled Group
Member&#148;) and covering any Controlled Group Member&#146;s
active or former employees (or their beneficiaries),
(ii)&nbsp;to which any Controlled Group Member is a party or by
which any Controlled Group Member (or any of the rights,
properties or assets thereof) is bound or (iii)&nbsp;with
respect to which any current Controlled Group Member may
otherwise have any material liability (whether or not such
Controlled Group Member still maintains such Employee Plan).
Each Employee Plan is listed on <I>Schedule&nbsp;2.12 </I>to the
Spieker Disclosure Letter. Except as disclosed in
<I>Schedule&nbsp;2.12 </I>to the Spieker Disclosure Letter, with
respect to the Employee Plans:

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp; No Controlled Group Member has any continuing
liability under any Welfare Plan which provides for continuing
benefits or coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a
participant after such participant&#146;s termination of
employment, except as may be required by Section&nbsp;4980B of
the Code or Section&nbsp;601 (et seq.) of ERISA, or under any
applicable state law, and at the expense of the participant or
the beneficiary of the participant.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp; Each Employee Plan complies in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of ERISA and any other
applicable law governing such Employee Plan, and, to the
Knowledge of Spieker, each Employee Plan has at all times been
properly administered in all material respects in accordance
with all such requirements of law, and in accordance with its
terms and the terms of any applicable collective bargaining
agreement to the extent consistent with all such requirements of
law. Each Pension Plan which is intended to be qualified is
qualified under Section&nbsp;401(a) of the Code, has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS stating that such
Plan meets the requirements of Section&nbsp;401(a) of the Code
and that the trust associated with such Plan is tax-exempt under
Section&nbsp;501(a) of the Code and, to the Knowledge of
Spieker, no event has occurred which would jeopardize the
qualified status of any such plan or the tax exempt status of
any such trust under Sections&nbsp;401(a) and
Section&nbsp;501(a) of the Code, respectively. No lawsuits,
claims (other than routine claims for benefits) or formal
complaints to, or by, any Person or governmental entity have
been filed, are pending or, to the Knowledge of Spieker,
threatened with respect to any Employee Plan and, to the
Knowledge of Spieker, there is no fact or contemplated event
which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any such
lawsuit, claim (other than routine claims for benefits) or
complaint with respect to any Pension Plan. Without limiting the
foregoing, the following are true with respect to each Employee
Plan:

TRS (A)&nbsp;has filed all Tax returns and reports required to
be filed by it (after giving effect to any filing extension
properly granted by a Governmental Entity having authority to do
so) and all such returns and reports are accurate and complete
in all material respects, (B)&nbsp;has paid (or Spieker has paid
on its behalf) all Taxes (as defined herein) shown on such
returns and reports as required to be paid by it, and
(C)&nbsp;has complied in all material respects with all
applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the payment
and withholding of Taxes (including, without limitation,
withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections&nbsp;1441, 1442, 1445,
1446, 3121, and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under any
foreign laws) and has, within the time period prescribed by law,
withheld and paid over to the proper governmental entities all
amounts required to be so withheld and paid over under
applicable laws and regulations, except, with respect to all of
the foregoing, where the failure to file such tax returns and
reports or failure to pay such Taxes or failure to comply with
such withholding requirements would not reasonably be expected
to have a Spieker Material Adverse Effect. The most recent
audited financial statements contained in the Spieker SEC
Documents reflect an adequate reserve for all material Taxes
payable by Spieker, the Spieker Subsidiaries and Spieker TRS for
all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of
such financial statements. Since the Spieker Financial Statement
Date, Spieker has incurred no liability for Taxes under
Sections&nbsp;857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, including
without limitation any Tax arising from a prohibited transaction
described in Section 857(b)(6) of the Code, and none of Spieker,
any Spieker Subsidiary or Spieker TRS has incurred any material
liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of
business. No event has occurred, and no condition or
circumstance exists, which presents a material risk that any
material Tax described in the preceding sentences will be
imposed upon Spieker, any Spieker Subsidiary, or Spieker TRS.

partnership within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code
that is taxable as a corporation pursuant to Section 7704(a) of
the Code. Each Spieker Subsidiary which is a corporation has

than preliminary material), as of their respective filing dates,
complied in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and, in
each case, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
applicable to such Equity Office SEC Documents. None of the
Equity Office SEC Documents at the time of filing contained, nor
will any report, schedule, form, statement or other document
filed by Equity Office or EOP Partnership after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time contain, any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. The consolidated financial
statements of Equity Office and the Equity Office Subsidiaries
included in the Equity Office SEC Documents complied, or will
comply, as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto, have been or will be prepared

fairly presented, or will fairly present, in all material
respects in accordance with the applicable requirements of GAAP

there have been no Releases of Hazardous Materials at, on, under
or from (A)&nbsp;the Equity Office Properties, or (B)&nbsp;any
real property formerly owned, operated or leased by Equity

(iv)&nbsp; Equity Office and the Equity Office Subsidiaries have
been duly issued, and currently have and will maintain through
the Closing Date, all Environmental Permits except where the
failure to obtain and maintain such Environmental Permits would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to

3.11&nbsp; <I>Taxes.</I>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp; Each of Equity Office and the Equity Office
Subsidiaries (i)&nbsp;has filed all Tax returns and reports
required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any filing
extension properly granted by a Governmental Entity having
authority to do so), and all such returns and reports are
accurate and complete in all material respects, (ii)&nbsp;has
paid (or Equity Office has paid on its behalf) all Taxes shown
on such returns and reports as required to be paid by it and
(iii) has complied in all material respects with all applicable
laws, rules and regulations relating to the payment and
withholding of Taxes (including, without limitation, withholding
of Taxes pursuant to Sections&nbsp;1441, 1442, 1445, 1446, 3121,
and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under any foreign
laws) and has, within the time period prescribed by law,
withheld and paid over to the proper governmental entities all
amounts required to be so withheld and paid over under
applicable laws and regulations, except, with respect to all of
the foregoing, where the failure to file such tax returns or
reports or failure to pay such Taxes or failure to comply with
such requirements would not reasonably be expected to have an
Equity Office Material Adverse Effect. The most recent audited
financial statements contained in the Equity Office SEC
Documents reflect an adequate reserve for all material Taxes
payable by Equity Office and the Equity Office Subsidiaries for
all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of
such financial statements. Since the Equity Office Financial
Statement Date, Equity Office has incurred no liability for
Taxes under Sections&nbsp;857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code,
including without limitation any Tax arising from a prohibited
transaction described in Section&nbsp;857(b)(6) of the Code, and
neither Equity Office nor any Equity Office Subsidiary has
incurred any material liability for Taxes other than in the
ordinary course of business. No event has occurred, and no
condition or circumstance exists, which presents a material risk
that any material Tax described in the preceding sentence will
be imposed upon Equity Office or any Equity Office Subsidiary.
Neither Equity Office nor any Equity Office Subsidiary is the
subject of any audit, examination, or other proceeding in
respect of federal income Taxes, and to Equity Office&#146;s

of federal income Taxes involving any of Equity Office or any

commencing with 1997, which was the first year of its

Code and has qualified as a REIT for all such years,
(ii)&nbsp;has operated since December 31, 2000 to the date of
this representation, and intends to continue to operate, in such
a manner as to qualify as a REIT for the taxable year that
includes the Closing Date and (iii)&nbsp;has not taken or
omitted to take any action which would reasonably be expected to
result in a challenge to its status as a REIT and, to Equity
Office&#146;s Knowledge, no such challenge is pending or
threatened. Each Equity Office Subsidiary which is a
partnership, joint venture or limited liability company either
(A)(i) has been treated since its formation and continues to be
treated for federal income tax purposes either as a partnership
or as an entity that is disregarded for federal income tax
purposes and not as a corporation or as an association taxable

formation or the acquisition by Equity Office of a direct or

conditions set forth in clause (A)(i) and (A)(ii) as of
December&nbsp;31, 2000 and (ii)&nbsp;as of March&nbsp;31, 2001,
will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a corporation
and will qualify as a taxable REIT Subsidiary under
Section&nbsp;856(l) of the Code. EOP Partnership is not a
publicly traded partnership within the meaning of
Section&nbsp;7704(b) of the Code that is taxable as a
corporation pursuant to Section&nbsp;7704(a) of the Code. Each
Equity Office Subsidiary which is a corporation (1)&nbsp;has
been since its formation a qualified REIT subsidiary under
Section&nbsp;856(i) of the Code or (2) as of March&nbsp;31, 2001
will qualify as a taxable REIT subsidiary under Section 856(1)
of the Code. Except as set forth in <I>Schedule&nbsp;3.11 </I>to
the Equity Office Disclosure Letter, neither Equity Office nor
any Equity Office Subsidiary holds any asset (x)&nbsp;the
disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to
Section&nbsp;1374 of the Code as a result of an election under
IRS Notice 88-19 or Temporary Treas. Reg. &#167;1.337(d)-5T or

such Person the material terms of which are (without regard to
the terms of such Acquisition Proposal) in all material respects
no less favorable to Spieker, and no less restrictive to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal, than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement, dated January&nbsp;2, 2001,
between Spieker and Equity Office (the &#147;Confidentiality
Agreement&#148;).

(c)&nbsp; Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
Section&nbsp;4.3(a) or 4.3(b), in the event that an Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Acquisition Proposal (as defined
herein), nothing contained in this Section&nbsp;4.3 shall
prohibit the Board of Directors of Spieker from withdrawing,
modifying, amending or qualifying its recommendation of this
Agreement and the Merger as required under Section&nbsp;5.1(d)
hereof and recommending such Superior Acquisition Proposal to
its stockholders: (i)&nbsp;if but only if, Spieker:
(A)&nbsp;complies fully with this Section&nbsp;4.3 and
(B)&nbsp;provides Equity Office with at least three (3) business
days&#146; prior written notice of its intent to withdraw,
modify, amend or qualify its recommendation of this Agreement or
the Merger, (ii)&nbsp;if, in the event that during such three
(3)&nbsp;business days Equity Office makes a counter proposal to
such Superior Acquisition Proposal (any such counter proposal
being referred to in this Agreement as the &#147;Equity Office
Counter Proposal&#148;), Spieker&#146;s Board of Directors in
good faith, taking into account the advice of its outside
financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation,
determines (A)&nbsp;that the Equity Office Counter Proposal is
not at least as favorable to Spieker&#146;s stockholders as the
Superior Acquisition Proposal, from a financial point of view,
and (B)&nbsp;the Equity Office Counter Proposal is not at least
as favorable generally to Spieker&#146;s stockholders (taking
into account all financial and strategic considerations and
other relevant factors, including relevant legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of such proposals, and the
conditions, prospects and time required for completion of such
proposal), and (iii)&nbsp;Spieker shall have terminated this
Agreement in accordance with Section&nbsp;7.1(h).

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp; For all purposes of this Agreement, &#147;Superior
Acquisition Proposal&#148; means a bona fide written proposal
made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly,
Spieker and/or Spieker Partnership pursuant to a tender or
exchange offer, merger, share exchange, consolidation or sale of
all or substantially all of the assets of Spieker, Spieker
Partnership, and the Spieker Subsidiaries or otherwise
(i)&nbsp;on terms which a majority of the Board of Directors of
Spieker determines in good faith, (A)&nbsp;after consultation
with Spieker&#146;s financial advisors of nationally recognized
reputation, are superior, from a financial point of view, to
Spieker&#146;s stockholders to those provided for in the Merger
and (B)&nbsp;to be more favorable generally to Spieker&#146;s
stockholders (taking into account all financial and strategic
considerations and other relevant factors, including relevant
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such
proposals, and the conditions, prospects and time required for
completion of such proposal), (ii)&nbsp;for which financing, to
the extent required, in the reasonable judgment of the Board of
Directors is capable of being obtained and (iii)&nbsp;which the
Board of Directors of Spieker determines in good faith is
reasonably capable of being consummated.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e)&nbsp; Any disclosure that the Board of Directors of Spieker
may be compelled to make with respect to the receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal in order to comply with its duties to
shareholders imposed by applicable law or Rule&nbsp;14d-9 or
14e-2 of the Exchange Act will not constitute a violation of
this Section 4.3.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(f)&nbsp; Nothing in this Section&nbsp;4.3 shall (i)&nbsp;permit
Spieker to terminate this Agreement (except as expressly
provided in Article&nbsp;7) or (ii)&nbsp;affect any other
obligations of Spieker under this Agreement.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4.4&nbsp; <I>Affiliates.</I> Prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger, Spieker shall cause to be prepared and delivered to
Equity Office a list (reasonably satisfactory to counsel for
Equity Office) identifying all Persons who, at the time of the
Spieker Stockholders Meeting and the Equity Office Shareholders
Meeting, may be deemed to be &#147;affiliates&#148; of Spieker
or Spieker Partnership as that term is used in paragraphs
(c)&nbsp;and (d)&nbsp;of Rule&nbsp;145 under the Securities Act
(the &#147;Rule&nbsp;145 Affiliates&#148;). Spieker shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Person who is
identified as a Rule&nbsp;145 Affiliate in such list to deliver
to Equity Office on or prior to the Effective Time a written
agreement, in the form previously approved by the parties
hereto, that such Rule&nbsp;145 Affiliate will not sell, pledge,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any Equity Office Common
Shares, Equity Office OP Units or Equity Office Preferred OP
Units issued to such Rule&nbsp;145 Affiliate pursuant to the
Merger, except pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act or in compliance with paragraph
(d)&nbsp;of Rule&nbsp;145 or as otherwise permitted by the
Securities Act. Equity Office shall be entitled to place legends
as specified in such written agreements on the certificates
representing any Equity Office Common Shares to be received
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement by such Rule&nbsp;145
Affiliates who have executed such agreements and to issue
appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for
the Equity Office Common Shares, Equity Office OP Units and
Equity Office Preferred OP Units issued to such Rule&nbsp;145
Affiliates, consistent with the terms of such agreements. Each
of Equity Office and EOP Partnership shall timely file the
reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder, and it
will take such further action as any Rule&nbsp;145 Affiliate of
Spieker or Equity Office may reasonably request, all to the
extent required from time to time to enable such Rule&nbsp;145
Affiliate to sell shares of beneficial interest of Equity Office
received by such Rule&nbsp;145 Affiliate in the Merger without
registration under the Securities Act pursuant to
(i)&nbsp;Rule&nbsp;145(d)(1) under the Securities Act, as such
rule may be amended from to time, or (ii)&nbsp;any successor
rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4.5&nbsp; <I>Other Actions.</I> Each of Spieker and Spieker
Partnership, on the one hand, and Equity Office and EOP
Partnership, on the other hand, shall not take, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective
Subsidiaries not to take, any action that would result in
(i)&nbsp;any of the representations and warranties of such party
(without giving effect to any &#147;knowledge&#148;
qualification) set forth in this Agreement that are qualified as
to materiality becoming untrue, (ii)&nbsp;any of such
representations and warranties (without giving effect to any
&#147;knowledge&#148; qualification) that are not so qualified
becoming untrue in any material respect or (iii)&nbsp;except as
expressly required by Section&nbsp;4.3, any of the conditions to
the Merger set forth in Article&nbsp;6 not being satisfied.

5.8&nbsp; <I>Benefit Plans and Other Employee Arrangements.</I>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp; <I>Benefit Plans.</I> After the Effective Time, all
employees of Spieker who are employed by the Surviving Trust
shall be eligible to participate in the same manner as other
similarly situated employees of the Surviving Trust who were
formerly employees of Equity Office in any &#147;employee
benefit plan,&#148; as defined in Section&nbsp;3(3) of ERISA,
sponsored or maintained by the Surviving Trust after the
Effective Time or, if Equity Office determines it is not
practicable for such employees to do so immediately after the
Effective Time, then such employees shall continue to be
eligible to participate in an &#147;employee benefit plan&#148;,
as defined in Section&nbsp;3(3) of ERISA, of Spieker which is
continued by the Surviving Trust until such time as Equity
Office determines it is practicable to include them in its
&#147;employee benefit plans&#148; for similarly situated
employees of the Surviving Trust as contemplated above. With
respect to each such employee benefit plan, service with Spieker
or any Spieker Subsidiary (as applicable) and the predecessor of
any of them shall be included for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting (if applicable) and
determination of the level of entitlement to, benefits under
such employee benefit plan. Equity Office shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Trust and its Subsidiaries to, (i)&nbsp;waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to all employees of Spieker who are employed by the
Surviving Trust under any welfare plan that such employees may
be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, other
than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect
with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied
as of the Effective Time under any welfare plan maintained for
such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
provide each such employee of Spieker who is employed by the
Surviving Trust with credit for any co-payments and deductibles
paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans
that such employees are eligible to participate in after the
Effective Time.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp; <I>Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plans.</I> The
stock option plans or programs of Spieker and the restricted
stock plans or programs of Spieker shall be discontinued as of
the Effective Time.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp; <I>Spieker Stock Options.</I> Immediately prior to the
date on which the Spieker stockholders approve the Merger, each
outstanding Spieker Stock Option shall, effective as of such
time, become fully vested and exercisable to the extent not
already so vested and exercisable and, to the extent not
otherwise provided in the applicable option agreement as
permitted by applicable law, each such Spieker Stock Option
shall be automatically converted at the Effective Time into an
option (a &#147;Substituted Option&#148;) to purchase a number
of shares of Equity Office Common Shares equal to the number of
shares of Spieker Common Stock that could have been purchased
(assuming full vesting) under such Spieker Stock Option
multiplied by 1.94462 (rounded down to the nearest whole number
of shares of Spieker Common Stock) at an exercise price per
share of Equity Office Common Shares equal to the per-share
option exercise price specified in the Spieker Stock Option
divided by 1.94462 (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Such
Substituted Option shall otherwise be subject to the same terms
and conditions as such Spieker Stock Option. For purposes of
expiration and otherwise, the date of grant of the Substituted
Option shall be the date on which the corresponding Spieker
Stock Option was granted. As soon as practicable after the date
hereof and subject to applicable law, Equity Office shall offer
to purchase, subject to consummation of the Mergers, all Spieker
Stock Options outstanding on the date hereof from the holders
thereof for an amount in cash in respect thereof equal to the
product of (i)&nbsp;the excess, if any, of (A) $58.50 over
(B)&nbsp;the exercise price of such Spieker Stock Option and
(ii)&nbsp;the number of shares of Spieker Common Stock subject
thereto. If the holder of any such Spieker Stock Option tenders
such option prior to 11:59&nbsp;p.m., Pacific Time, on the 20th
business day after the purchase offer is made to the holders
thereof, then within three business days after the Effective
Time, Equity

Office shall, subject to reduction for required withholding
taxes, pay to each such tendering former holder of Spieker Stock
Options the purchase price thereof. As promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, Equity Office shall issue
to each holder of an outstanding Spieker Stock Option a document
evidencing the foregoing assumption by Equity Office. In respect
of each Spieker Stock Option assumed by Equity Office, but not
tendered for cash, and converted into a Substituted Option, and
the Equity Office Common Shares underlying such Substituted
Option, Equity Office shall, as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, file and keep current a Registration Statement
on Form&nbsp;S-8 or other appropriate registration statement for
as long as Substituted Options remain outstanding.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp; <I>Restricted Stock.</I> All unvested shares of
restricted stock of Spieker set forth in Schedule&nbsp;5.8(d) of
the Spieker Disclosure Letter shall, by virtue of this Agreement
and without further action of Spieker, Equity Office or the
holder of such shares of restricted stock, to the extent
required in the plan, agreement or instrument pursuant to which
such shares of restricted stock were granted, vest and become
free of all restrictions immediately prior to the date on which
the Spieker shareholders approve the Merger and shall be
converted into the Merger Consideration upon the Effective Time
pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.10.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e)&nbsp; <I>Withholding.</I> To the extent required by
applicable law, Spieker shall require each employee who
exercises a Spieker Stock Option or who receives Spieker Common
Stock pursuant to any existing commitment to pay to Spieker in
cash or Spieker Common Stock an amount sufficient to satisfy in
full Spieker&#146;s obligation to withhold Taxes incurred by
reason of such exercise or issuance (unless and to the extent
such withholding is satisfied pursuant to the provision
regarding withholding in Section&nbsp;1.13(c)).

acknowledges that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be deemed a &#147;Change in Control&#148; for
purposes of the Special Severance Policy, and that severance
payments shall be made in accordance with the Special Severance
Policy to any participant who becomes entitled to such payments
on account of a termination of employment occurring on or after
the Effective Date, unless such termination is for Cause or is a
voluntary resignation without Good Reason in accordance with the
terms of the Special Severance Policy. As of the Effective Time,
there shall not be any additional employees or other service
providers thereafter designated for participation in the Special
Severance Policy.

Equity Office or EOP Partnership shall pay, if earned,
development bonuses to employees identified on
<I>Schedule&nbsp;5.8(g)</I> of the Spieker Disclosure Letter up
to the aggregate amount set forth on <I>Schedule&nbsp;5.8(g)</I>
of the Spieker Disclosure Letter. Equity Office or EOP
Partnership also shall assume the obligations of Spieker to pay
annual bonuses to Spieker employees not covered by the Special
Severance Policy and such bonuses shall be payable to such
employees who are terminated by Equity Office (unless terminated
for inadequate performance) before January&nbsp;1, 2002. Such
bonuses shall be payable to the extent accrued for the year 2001
through the date of termination and shall be calculated based on
actual bonuses paid in 2000 (assuming such bonuses reflected a
full year of employment).

(a)&nbsp; From and after the Effective Time, Equity Office and
EOP Partnership (collectively, the &#147;Indemnifying
Parties&#148;) shall provide exculpation and indemnification for
each individual who is now or has been at any time prior to the
date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger, an officer or director of Spieker or any Spieker
Subsidiary (the &#147;Indemnified Parties&#148;) which is the
same as the exculpation and indemnification provided to the
Indemnified Parties by Spieker and the Spieker Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger in its
charter, Bylaws or in its partnership, operating or similar
agreement, as in effect on the date hereof.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp; In addition to the rights provided in
Section&nbsp;5.9(a) above, in the event of any threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal or administrative, including, without
limitation, any action by or on behalf of any or all security
holders of Spieker or Equity Office, or any Spieker Subsidiary
or Equity Office Subsidiary, or by or in the right of Spieker or
Equity Office, or any Spieker Subsidiary or Equity Office

employee or director of Spieker or any of the Spieker
Subsidiaries or any action or omission by such individual in his
capacity as a director, or (ii)&nbsp;this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether in any case
asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time of the
Merger, the Indemnifying Parties shall, from and after the
Effective Time of the Merger, indemnify and hold harmless, as
and to the full extent permitted by applicable law, each
Indemnification Party against any losses, claims, liabilities,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and
expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in
accordance herewith in connection with any such threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. Any
Indemnification Party proposing to assert the right to be
indemnified under this Section&nbsp;5.9(b) shall, promptly after
receipt of notice of commencement of any action against such
Indemnification Party in respect of which a claim is to be made
under this Section&nbsp;5.9(b) against the Indemnifying Parties,
notify the Indemnifying Parties of the commencement of such

affect the obligations of the Indemnifying Parties except to the
extent such failure to notify materially prejudices the
Indemnifying Parties&#146; ability to defend such claim, action,

however,</I> that, in the case of any action pending at the
Effective Time of the Merger, notification pursuant to this
Section&nbsp;5.9(b) shall be received by Equity Office prior to
such Effective Time. If any such action is brought against any
of the Indemnification Parties and such Indemnification Parties
notify the Indemnifying Parties of its commencement, the
Indemnifying Parties will be entitled to participate in and, to
the extent that they elect by delivering written notice to such
Indemnification Parties promptly after receiving notice of the
commencement of the action from the Indemnification Parties, to
assume the defense of the action and after notice from the
Indemnifying Parties to the Indemnification Parties of their
election to assume the defense, the Indemnifying Parties will
not be liable to the Indemnification Parties for any legal or
other expenses except as provided below. If the Indemnifying
Parties assume the defense, the Indemnifying Parties shall have
the right to settle such action without the consent of the
Indemnification Parties; <I>provided, however,</I> that the
Indemnifying Parties shall be required to obtain such consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) if the

(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), consent to
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not

Indemnification Parties will have the right to employ their own

writing by the Indemnifying Parties, (ii)&nbsp;the
Indemnification Parties have reasonably concluded (based on
written advice of counsel to the Indemnification Parties) that
there may be legal defenses available to them that are different
from or in addition to and inconsistent with those available to
the Indemnifying Parties, (iii)&nbsp;a conflict or potential
conflict exists (based on written advice of counsel to the
Indemnification Parties) between the Indemnification Parties and
the Indemnifying Parties (in which case the Indemnifying Parties
will not have the right to direct the defense of such action on

Indemnifying Parties have not in fact employed counsel to assume
the defense of such action within a reasonable time after
receiving notice of the commencement of the action from the
Indemnification Parties, in each of which cases the reasonable
fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at the
expense of the Indemnifying Parties and shall promptly be paid
by each Indemnifying Party as they become due and payable in
advance of the final disposition of the claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation to the fullest extent and in the
manner permitted by law; <I>provided, however,</I> that in no
event shall any contingent fee arrangement be considered
reasonable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying
Parties shall not be obligated to advance any expenses or costs
prior to receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the
Indemnification Party to repay any expenses advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined that the Indemnification Party is not
entitled to be indemnified against such expense. It is
understood that the Indemnifying Parties shall not, in
connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same

for any settlement effected without their prior written consent

that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable law. In
the event of a final and non-appealable determination by a court
that any payment of expenses is prohibited by applicable law,
the Indemnification Parties shall promptly refund to the
Indemnifying Parties the amount of all such expenses theretofore
advanced pursuant hereto.

acknowledge and agree that each Indemnified Party and
Indemnification Party would suffer irreparable harm and that no
adequate remedy at law exists for a breach of such covenants and
such Indemnified Party or such Indemnification Party shall be
entitled to injunctive relief and specific performance in the

5.10&nbsp; <I>Declaration of Dividends and Distributions.</I>
From and after the date of this Agreement, neither Spieker nor
Equity Office shall make any dividend or distribution to its
respective stockholders or shareholders without the prior
written consent of the other party; <I>provided, however,</I>
the written consent of the other party shall not be required for
the authorization and payment of (a) distributions at their
respective stated dividend or distribution rates with respect to
Equity Office Existing Preferred Shares or any series of Spieker
Preferred Stock, (b)&nbsp;quarterly distributions with respect

severance policy and allowable deductions attributable to the

manner that results in no required Final Spieker Dividend in
order for Spieker, at the Effective Time of the Merger, to
satisfy the requirement of the Section 857(a)(1) for the short
taxable year of Spieker ending at such time (and to avoid the
payment of any tax with respect to any undistributed income or
gain for such year). Such plan shall include the projected
required quarterly dividends per share of Spieker Common Stock
necessary to ensure that no Final Spieker Dividend is required
to be paid, which quarterly dividends shall be not less than
$0.70 per share nor result in a &#147;return of capital&#148;
per share of Spieker Common Stock that exceeds one percent (1%)
of the projected dividends per share. Upon the approval by
Equity Office of such plan, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, Spieker shall be entitled to increase the
quarterly dividend per share of Spieker Common Stock to the
amount shown in such plan, as approved by Equity Office. From
and after the date of this Agreement, Spieker Partnership shall
not make any distribution to the holders of Spieker OP Units
except a distribution per Spieker OP Unit in the same amount as
a dividend per share of Spieker Common Stock permitted pursuant
to this Section&nbsp;5.10, with the same record and payment
dates as such dividend on the Spieker Common Stock. If Spieker
increases any quarterly dividend per share of Spieker Common
Stock to an amount in excess of $0.70 per share in accordance
with this Section&nbsp;5.10, Equity Office shall be entitled to
declare a dividend per share payable to holders of Equity Office
Common Shares (and EOP Partnership shall declare a distribution
per unit payable to holders of Equity Office OP Units if a
dividend has been declared on the Equity Office Common Shares),
the record dates for which shall be the close of the business on
the last business day prior to the Effective Time, in an amount
per Equity Office Common Share and Equity Office OP Unit equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing (x)&nbsp;the aggregate
amount of quarterly dividends per share of Spieker Common Stock
declared or paid by Spieker in excess of $0.70 per share per
quarter in accordance with this Section&nbsp;5.10 by
(y)&nbsp;1.94462 (the &#147;Additional Corresponding Equity
Office Dividends and Distributions&#148;). If, and to the
extent, the terms of any series of Equity Office Preferred
Shares or Equity Office Preferred OP Units require the payment
of a dividend or distribution by reason of the payment of the
Additional Corresponding Equity Office Dividends and
Distributions, Equity Office and EOP Partnership shall declare
and pay any such required dividends and distributions. The
Additional Corresponding Equity Office Dividends and
Distributions (and any dividends payable to holders of Equity
Office Preferred Shares and distributions payable to holders of
Equity Office Preferred OP Units) shall be paid on the last
business day immediately preceding the Closing Date. The
foregoing restrictions shall not apply, however, (i)&nbsp;to
Equity Office to the extent a distribution (or an increase in a
distribution) by Equity Office is necessary for Equity Office to
maintain REIT status, avoid the incurrence of any taxes under
Section&nbsp;857 of the Code, avoid the imposition of any excise
taxes under Section&nbsp;4981 of the Code, or avoid the need to
make one or more extraordinary or disproportionately larger
distributions to meet any of the three preceding objectives (or

Partnership a fee equal to the Break-Up Fee (as defined herein),

Spieker and Spieker Partnership shall pay to EOP Partnership
(provided that Spieker was not entitled to terminate this

Spieker or Spieker Partnership enters into any written agreement

Agreement&#148;), which is subsequently consummated (whether or

Acquisition Proposal which had been received at the time of the
termination of this Agreement), then Spieker and Spieker
Partnership shall pay the Break-Up Fee to EOP Partnership.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The payment of the Break-Up Fee shall be compensation for the
loss suffered by Equity Office and EOP Partnership as a result
of the failure of the Mergers to be consummated (including,
without limitation, opportunity costs and out-of-pocket costs
and expenses) and to avoid the difficulty of determining damages
under the circumstances. The Break-Up Fee shall be paid by
Spieker and Spieker Partnership to EOP Partnership, or the
Break-Up Expenses shall be paid by Spieker and Spieker
Partnership to EOP Partnership or EOP Partnership to Spieker
Partnership (as applicable), in immediately available funds
within two (2)&nbsp;business days after the date the event
giving rise to the obligation to make such payment occurred
(except as otherwise provided in Section&nbsp;7.1(h) or 7.1(i)).
Spieker acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.2 are integral parts of this Agreement; accordingly,
if Spieker and Spieker Partnership fail to promptly pay the
Break-Up Fee or Break-Up Expenses due pursuant to this
Section&nbsp;7.2 and, in order to obtain payment, Equity Office
commences a suit which results in a judgment against Spieker or
Spieker Partnership for any amounts owed pursuant to this
Section&nbsp;7.2, Spieker and Spieker Partnership shall pay to
Equity Office its costs and expenses (including attorneys&#146;
fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount owed at the rate on six-month U.S.
Treasury obligations in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made plus 300 basis points.

As used in this Agreement, &#147;Break-Up Fee&#148; shall be an
amount equal to the lesser of (i) $160,000,000 less Break-Up
Expenses paid or payable under this Section&nbsp;7.2 (the
&#147;Base Amount&#148;) and (ii)&nbsp;the sum of (A)&nbsp;the
maximum amount that can be paid to EOP Partnership without
causing Equity Office to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections&nbsp;856(c)(2) and (3)&nbsp;of the Code determined as
if the payment of such amount did not constitute income
described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) and 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of
the Code (&#147;Qualifying Income&#148;), as determined by
independent accountants to Equity Office, and (B)&nbsp;in the
event Equity Office receives a letter from outside counsel (the
&#147;Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion&#148;) indicating that Equity
Office has received a ruling from the IRS holding that EOP
Partnership&#146;s receipt of the Base Amount would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income of Equity Office within the meaning of
Sections&nbsp;856(c)(2) and (3)&nbsp;of the Code (the &#147;REIT
Requirements&#148;) or that the receipt by EOP Partnership of
the remaining balance of the Base Amount following the receipt
of and pursuant to such ruling would not be deemed
constructively received prior thereto, the Base Amount less the
amount payable under clause (A)&nbsp;above. Spieker&#146;s and
Spieker Partnership&#146;s obligation to pay any unpaid portion
of the Break-Up Fee shall terminate three years from the date of
this Agreement. In the event that EOP Partnership is not able to
receive the full Base Amount, Spieker and Spieker Partnership
shall place the unpaid amount in escrow and shall not release
any portion thereof to EOP Partnership unless and until Spieker
receives one or both of the following: (i)&nbsp;a letter from
Equity Office&#146;s independent accountants indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid at that time to EOP Partnership
without causing Equity Office to fail to meet the REIT
Requirements or (ii)&nbsp;a Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion, in either
of which events Spieker and Spieker Partnership shall pay to EOP
Partnership the unpaid Base Amount or, if less and either there
is no Break-up Fee Tax Opinion or the

ruling described in the Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion does not hold
that the Base Amount either would constitute Qualifying Income
or would be excluded from gross income for purposes of the REIT

to in (i)&nbsp;above. Subject to satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, there is no
limitation on the number of distributions that can be made from
the escrow prior to the third anniversary of the date of this
Agreement.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The &#147;Break-Up Expenses&#148; payable to EOP Partnership or
Spieker Partnership, as the case may be (the
&#147;Recipient&#148;), shall be an amount equal to the lesser
of (i) $7,500,000 or (ii)&nbsp;the Recipient&#146;s
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including,
without limitation, all attorneys&#146;, accountants&#146; and
investment bankers&#146; fees and expenses). If the Break-Up
Expenses payable to the Recipient exceed the maximum amount that
can be paid to the Recipient without causing the Recipient to
fail to meet the requirements of Sections&nbsp;856(c)(2) and
(3)&nbsp;of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount
did not constitute Qualifying Income, as determined by
independent accountants to the Recipient (the &#147;Maximum
Amount&#148;), the amount initially payable to the Recipient
shall be limited to the Maximum Amount. If, however, within the
three-year period commencing on the date of this Agreement, the
Recipient receives a Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion indicating that it
has received a ruling from the IRS holding that the
Recipient&#146;s receipt of the Break-Up Expenses would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income of the Recipient within the meaning of the REIT
Requirements or that receipt by the Recipient of the balance of
the Break-Up Expenses above the Maximum Amount following the
receipt of and pursuant to such ruling would not be deemed
constructively received prior thereto, the Recipient shall be
entitled to have payable to it the full amount of the Break-Up
Expenses. The obligation of Equity Office and EOP Partnership or
Spieker and Spieker Partnership, as applicable
(&#147;Payor&#148;), to pay any unpaid portion of the Break-Up
Expenses shall terminate three years from the date of this
Agreement. In the event that the Recipient is not able to
receive the full Break-Up Expenses, the Payor shall place the
unpaid amount in escrow and shall not release any portion
thereof to the Recipient unless and until the Payor receives
either one or both of the following: (i)&nbsp;a letter from the
independent accountants of Equity Office or Spieker, as the case
may be, indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that
time to the Recipient without causing it to fail to meet the
REIT Requirements or (ii)&nbsp;a Break-Up Expense Tax Opinion,
in either of which events the Payor shall pay to the Recipient
the unpaid Break-Up Expenses or, if less and either there is no
Break-Up Expense Tax Opinion or the ruling described in the
Break-Up Expense Tax Opinion does not hold that the Base Amount
either would constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded
from gross income for purposes of the REIT Requirements, the
maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in
(i)&nbsp;above. Subject to satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in the immediately preceding sentence, there is no
limitation on the number of distributions that can be made from
the escrow prior to the third anniversary of the date of this
Agreement.

7.3&nbsp; <I>Effect of Termination.</I> In the event of
termination of this Agreement by either Spieker or Equity Office
as provided in Section&nbsp;7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no effect, without any liability or
obligation on the part of Equity Office, EOP Partnership,
Spieker or Spieker Partnership, other than the last sentence of
Section&nbsp;5.2, Section&nbsp;7.2, this Section&nbsp;7.3 and
Article&nbsp;8, and except to the extent that such termination
results from a material breach by any party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
7.4&nbsp; <I>Amendment.</I> This Agreement may be amended by the
parties in writing by action of the respective Board of Trustees
or Board of Directors of Equity Office and Spieker at any time
before or after any Shareholder Approvals are obtained and prior
to the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Department;
<I>provided, however,</I> that, after the Shareholder Approvals
and Partner Approvals are obtained, no such amendment,
modification or supplement shall be made which by law requires
the further approval of shareholders or partners without
obtaining such further approval. The parties agree to amend this
Agreement in the manner provided in the immediately preceding
sentence to the extent required to (a)&nbsp;continue the status
of each party as a REIT or (b)&nbsp;preserve the Merger as a
reorganization under Section&nbsp;368(a) of the Code.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
7.5&nbsp; <I>Extension; Waiver.</I> At any time prior to the
Effective Time, the parties may (a)&nbsp;extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
party, (b)&nbsp;waive any inaccuracies in the

agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

        each such Purported Beneficial Transferee shall become a
        creditor of the Trust with respect to its now-extinguished

        Preferred Excess Shares held by the Trust attributable to a
        purported Transfer that resulted in the Series&nbsp;F Preferred
        Excess Shares) will be equal to the lesser of (a)&nbsp;that
        amount of the distributable assets of the Trust to which such
        Series&nbsp;F Preferred Excess Shares would be entitled if such
        Series&nbsp;F Preferred Excess Shares were entitled to share
        ratably in the distributable assets of the Trust as Common
        Shares, or (b)&nbsp;as appropriate, either (1)&nbsp;the price
        per share paid by such Purported Beneficial Transferee for the
        Series&nbsp;F Preferred Shares which were exchanged for
        Series&nbsp;F Preferred Excess Shares, or (2)&nbsp;if the
        Purported Beneficial Transferee did not give value for such
        Series&nbsp;F Preferred Shares (having received such through a
        gift, device or otherwise), a price per share equal to the
        Market Price on the date of the purported Transfer that resulted
        in the Series&nbsp;F Preferred Excess Shares. Payment to the
        Purported Beneficial Transferee shall be without interest and
        shall be due concurrently with the date of first distribution of
        liquidation proceeds to the holders of Equity Shares. If the
        Trust causes such liquidation or dissolution to be revoked or
        otherwise rescinded any Series&nbsp;F Preferred Excess Shares
        previously automatically extinguished pursuant to this Section
        10(c) shall be automatically revived and any Purported
        Beneficial Transferees shall without further act cease to be

	Trust at its option upon not less than 30 nor more than
	90&nbsp;days&#146; written notice may redeem outstanding
	Series&nbsp;H Preferred Shares, in whole or in part, at any time
	or from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of $25.00
	per share, plus an amount equal to all distributions accrued and
	unpaid thereon to the date fixed for redemption, without
	interest. The redemption price of Series&nbsp;H Preferred Shares
	(other than the portion thereof consisting of accrued and unpaid
	distributions) is payable solely out of proceeds (without giving
	effect to any temporary use of such proceeds) from the sale of
	other shares of beneficial interest of the Trust, which may
	include Common Shares, Preferred Shares, depositary shares,
	interests, participations or other ownership interests in the
	Trust however designated (other than debt securities converted
	into or exchangeable for shares of beneficial interest), and any
	rights, warrants or options to purchase any thereof. Holders of
	Series H Preferred Shares to be redeemed shall surrender such
	Series&nbsp;H Preferred Shares at the place designated in such
	notice and shall be entitled to the redemption price and any
	accrued and unpaid distributions payable upon such redemption
	following such surrender. If fewer than all of the outstanding
	Series&nbsp;H Preferred Shares are to be redeemed, the number of
	shares to be redeemed will be determined by the Trust and such
	shares may be redeemed pro rata from the holders of record of
	such shares in proportion to the number of such shares held by
	such holders (with adjustments to avoid redemption of fractional

(the &#147;Liquidation Preference&#148;) plus an amount equal to
all distributions (whether or not earned or declared) accrued
and accumulated and unpaid on the Series&nbsp;G Preferred Units
to the date of final distribution. The holders of the
Series&nbsp;G Preferred Units will not be entitled to receive
the Liquidation Preference until the liquidation preference of
any other class of Partnership Units of the Partnership ranking
senior to the Series&nbsp;G Preferred Units as to rights upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up shall have been paid (or
a sum set aside therefore sufficient to provide for payment) in
full. After payment of the full amount of the Liquidation
Preference and such distributions, the holders of Series&nbsp;G
Preferred Units will not be entitled to any further
participation in any distribution of assets by the Partnership.
If, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Partnership, the assets of the Partnership, or proceeds thereof,
distributable among the holders of Series&nbsp;G Parity
Preferred Units shall be insufficient to pay in full the
preferential amount aforesaid, then such assets, or the proceeds
thereof, shall be distributable among such holders ratably in
accordance with the respective amounts which would be payable on
such units if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. For
the purposes hereof, neither a consolidation or merger of the
Partnership with or into any other partnership, limited
liability company, corporation or any other entity, nor a merger
of any other partnership, limited liability company, corporation
or any other entity with or into the Partnership, nor a sale or
transfer of all or any part of the Partnership assets for cash
or securities shall be considered a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Partnership.

11.&nbsp; <I>Consent to Pledge of Series&nbsp;G Preferred
Units.</I> Pursuant to Section&nbsp;11.3 of the Agreement, the
General Partner hereby consents to the pledge of the
Series&nbsp;G Preferred Units by the Initial Series&nbsp;G
Limited Partner pursuant to the Securities Account Agreement
(the &#147;Securities Account Agreement&#148;), dated as of
February&nbsp;5, 1998, among Merrill Lynch International Bank
Limited, Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. and Investors Bank
&#38; Trust Company (collectively, the &#147;Pledgees&#148;) and
the Initial Series&nbsp;G Limited Partner. The General Partner
also hereby consents to any Pledgee&#146;s assignment of their
respective rights as secured party to any person each may
designate upon the occurrence of an event of default (as defined
in the Securities Account Agreement). Such pledge shall not give
any Pledgee any rights as a holder of Series&nbsp;G Preferred
Units until the Pledgee provides written notice to the General
Partner that an event of default has occurred under the
Securities Account Agreement and, in such event, as set forth in
Section&nbsp;11.5 of the Agreement, such Pledgee shall be deemed
an Assignee with respect to such Series&nbsp;G Preferred Units.
Neither the Partnership nor the General Partner shall have any
liability or obligation, matured, contingent or otherwise, to
the Pledgees (i)&nbsp;under the Securities Account Agreement or
(ii) with respect to the value or liquidity of the Series&nbsp;G
Preferred Units or the Series&nbsp;G Preferred Shares.

12.&nbsp; <I>Survival of Certain Prior Obligations.</I> To the
extent that the Belair Contribution Agreement provides that the
parties&#146;; obligations thereunder shall survive the Closing
(as defined in the Belair Contribution Agreement), such
provisions of the Belair Contribution Agreement and the
parties&#146; obligations thereunder were not merged into the
provisions of the partnership agreement of Spieker Partnership,
and shall not be merged into the provisions of the Agreement
(including this <I>Attachment G</I>) and shall survive the
designation of the Series&nbsp;G Preferred Units.

(&#147;<B>Spieker Partnership</B>&#148;), have entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February&nbsp;22, 2001
(the &#147;<B>Merger Agreement</B>&#148;), pursuant to which
(i)&nbsp;Spieker Partnership will be merged with and into EOP

Merger, the &#147;<B>Mergers</B>&#148;).

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Merger Agreement contemplates that, in connection with the
closing of the Partnership Merger, EOP Partnership will make
certain undertakings related to federal income tax matters to
certain limited partners of Spieker Partnership, including the
undersigned, who contributed assets to Spieker Partnership in
connection with its formation in 1993 and will become EOP

specific undertakings and agreements with respect to these
matters will be set forth on <I>Exhibit&nbsp;E-9</I> to the EOP
Partnership Agreement pursuant to the
[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]
Amendment to the EOP Partnership Agreement, which will be

Under the terms of <I>Exhibit&nbsp;E-9</I>, the term during
which certain of these &#147;tax protection&#148; undertakings
by EOP Partnership will apply can be extended from ten years to
up to twenty years for those Spieker limited partners who agree
to and comply with the restrictions set forth in this
Restriction Agreement. In order to obtain the benefit of the

other good and valuable consideration the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the undersigned
hereby agrees as follows:

on <I>Schedule&nbsp;1</I> attached hereto (as such
Schedule&nbsp;1 may be amended, modified, supplemented or

WHEREAS, the General Partner is the general partner of the
Partnership and each of the EOP Limited Partners is a limited

individually as a &#147;Note&#148; and collectively as the

        shall be released by any act or event which might, but for this
        provision of this Paragraph&nbsp;2, be deemed a legal or
        equitable discharge of a surety, or by reason of any waiver,
        extension, modification, forbearance or delay or other act or
        omission of any Note Holder or the Partnership&#146;s failure to
        proceed promptly or otherwise as against the General Partner or
        Debtor&#146;s failure to proceed promptly or otherwise as
        against any EOP Limited Partner or any Note Holder&#146;s
        failure to proceed promptly or otherwise against Debtor, or by
        any reason of any action taken or omitted or circumstance which
        may or might vary the risk or affect the rights or remedies of
        any EOP Limited Partner as against Debtor or any Note Holder, or
        by reason of any further dealings between Debtor and any Note
        Holder, whether relating to the Notes or otherwise, and each EOP
        Limited Partner hereby expressly waives and surrenders any
        defense to its liability hereunder based upon any of the
        foregoing acts, omissions, things, agreements, waivers or any of
        them; it being the purpose and intent of this Paragraph&nbsp;2
        that the obligations of each EOP Limited Partner hereunder are
        absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances. Each
        EOP Limited Partner&#146;s obligations under this
        Paragraph&nbsp;2 are independent of those of Debtor.
        Debtor&#146;s rights under this Paragraph&nbsp;2 will not be
        exhausted by any action by it until an amount equal to the Total
        Guaranty Amount has been fully paid and performed with respect
        to the Notes and the period of time has expired during which any
        payment made to the Note Holders by Debtor under the Notes or to
        Debtor by each EOP Limited Partner under this Paragraph&nbsp;2
        may be determined to be a Preferential Payment (as defined
        below) without such determination, in fact, being made. Each EOP
        Limited Partner further agrees that to the extent all or any
        part of any payment made to the Note Holders under the Notes or
        by a EOP Limited Partner under this Paragraph&nbsp;2 is
        subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
        preferential, set aside or required to be repaid by the
        recipient thereof or paid over to a trustee, receiver or any
        other entity, whether under any bankruptcy act or otherwise (any
        such payment is hereinafter referred to as a &#147;Preferential
        Payment&#148;), then this Paragraph&nbsp;2 shall continue to be
        effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, and, to
        the extent of such payment or repayment, the obligations of the
        EOP Limited Partner shall be revived and continued in full force
        and effect as if said Preferential Payment had not been made.
        Each EOP Limited Partner waives: (a)&nbsp;all statutes of
        limitations as a defense to any action brought against any
        Limited Partner pursuant to this Paragraph&nbsp;2, to the
        fullest extent permitted by law; (b)&nbsp;any defense based upon
        any legal disability of Debtor or any discharge or limitation of
        the liability of Debtor to the Note Holders, whether consensual
        or arising by operation or law</TD>

	hereby waives any claim or other rights which such EOP Limited
	Partner may now have or hereafter acquire against the General
	Partner, or each of them, or any other EOP Limited Partner, or
	any other Person (including, without limitation, any other
	partner in the Partnership), of all or any of the Notes that
	arise from the existence or performance of such EOP Limited
	Partner&#146;s obligations under this Paragraph&nbsp;2, the
	Notes or any of the Loan Documents (all such claims and rights
	are referred to as the &#147;EOP Limited Partner&#146;s
	Conditional Rights&#148;), including, without limitation, any
	right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution,
	or indemnification, any right to participate in any claim or
	remedy of the Partnership or the Note Holders against the
	General Partner, whether or not such claim, remedy or right
	arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, by
	any payment made hereunder or otherwise, including, without
	limitation, the right to take or receive from Debtor, directly
	or indirectly, in cash or other property or by setoff or in any
	other manner, payment or security on account of such claim or
	other rights. If, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, any
	amount shall be paid to any EOP Limited Partner on account of
	any such EOP Limited Partner&#146;s Conditional Rights and
	either (i)&nbsp;such amount is paid to such EOP Limited Partner
	at any time when the Notes shall not have been paid or performed
	in a principal amount equal to the Total Guaranty Amount, or
	(ii)&nbsp;regardless of when such amount is paid to such EOP
	Limited Partner, any payment made by Debtor to the Note Holders
	or by a EOP Limited Partner under this Paragraph&nbsp;2 is at
	any time determined to be a Preferential Payment such that the
	total principal amount received by Note Holders, less the
	Preferential Payment, is less than the Total Guaranty Amount,
	then a portion of the amount paid to such EOP Limited Partner
	equal to the such EOP Limited Partner&#146;s proportionate share
	of the excess of the Total Guaranty Amount over the principal
	amount received by Note Holders (net of the Preferential
	Payment) shall be held in trust for the benefit of Debtor and
	the Note Holders, as their interests may appear, and shall
	forthwith be paid to the Partnership as a Capital Contribution
	to be credited and applied upon the Notes, whether matured or
	unmatured, in such order as Debtor, in its sole and absolute
	discretion, shall determine. To the extent that any of the
	provisions of this Paragraph&nbsp;2 shall not be enforceable,
	each EOP Limited Partner agrees that until such time as the
	Notes have been paid and performed in a principal amount equal
	to the Total Guaranty Amount and the period of time has expired
	during which any payment made by Debtor to the Note Holders or
	by a EOP Limited Partner under this Paragraph&nbsp;2 may be
	determined to be a Preferential Payment, the EOP Limited
	Partner&#146;s Conditional Rights to the extent not validly
	waived shall be subordinate to the Note Holder&#146;s right to
	payment and performance of the Notes up to the Total Guaranty
	Amount, and such EOP Limited Partner shall not enforce such EOP
	Limited Partner&#146;s Conditional Rights during such period.
	Each EOP Limited Partner assumes full responsibility for keeping
	fully informed of the financial condition of Debtor and all
	other circumstances affecting Debtor&#146;s ability to perform
	its obligations under the Loan Documents and agrees that neither
	Debtor nor the Note Holders will have any duty to report to any
	EOP Limited Partner any information which Debtor or the Note
	Holders receive about Debtor&#146;s financial condition or any
	circumstances being on Debtor&#146;s ability to perform.</TD>

	will release or limit the liability of any EOP Limited Partner.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
WHEREAS, [BORROWER] (&#147;Maker&#148;), is indebted to the
Guaranteed Party in the sum of [LOAN], as evidenced by a certain
Promissory Note dated [DATE] (the &#147;Note&#148;), which is

A.&nbsp; The Guarantors hereby irrevocably and unconditionally

exhaustion of the exercise of any and all remedies available to
the Guaranteed Party against Maker, including, without
limitation, realizing upon the assets of Maker other than the
Properties), an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the
Guaranteed Amount over the Maker Proceeds (as hereinafter

the delivery of the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, as applicable,
relating to a Property, either party may have the Fair Market
Value of a Property determined by appraisal by appointing an
appraiser having the qualifications set forth below to determine
the same and by notifying the other party of such appointment
within twenty (20&nbsp;days after the expiration of such twenty
(20)&nbsp;day period. If the other party shall fail to notify
the first party, within twenty (20)&nbsp;days after its receipt
of notice of the appointment by the first party, of the
appointment by the other party of an appraiser having the
qualifications set forth below, the appraiser appointed by the
first party shall alone make the determination of such Fair
Market Value. Appraisers appointed by the parties shall be
members of the Appraisal Institute (MAI)&nbsp;and shall have at
least ten years&#146; experience in the valuation of properties
similar to the Property being valued in the greater metropolitan
area in which such Property is located. If each party shall
appoint an appraiser having the aforesaid qualifications and is
such tow appraiser cannot, within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after
the appointment of the second appraiser, agree upon the
determination hereinabove required, then they shall select a
third appraiser which third appraiser shall have the aforesaid
qualifications, and if they fail so to do within forty
(40)&nbsp;days after the appointment of the second appraiser
they shall notify the parties hereto, and either party shall
thereafter have the right, on notice to the other, to apply, for
the appointment of a third appraiser to the chapter of the
American Arbitration Association or its successor organization
located in the metropolitan area in which the Property is
located or to which the Property is proximate or if no such
chapter is located in such metropolitan area, in the
metropolitan area closest to the Property in which such a
chapter is located. Each appraiser shall render its decision as
to the Fair Market Value of the Property in question within
thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the appointment of the third
appraiser and shall furnish a copy thereof to the Guaranteed
Party and Guarantor. The Fair Market Value of the Property shall
then be calculated as the average of (i)&nbsp;the Fair Market
Value determined by the third appraiser and (ii)&nbsp;whichever
of the Fair Market Values determined by the first two appraisers
is closer to the Fair Market Value determined by the third
appraiser; provided, however, that if the Fair Market Value
determined by the third appraiser is higher or lower than both
Fair Market Values determined by the first two appraiser, such
Fair Market Value determined by the third appraiser shall be
disregarded and the Fair Market Value of the Property shall then
be calculated as the average of the Fair Market Value determined
by the first two appraisers. The Fair Market Value of a Property
as so determined shall be binding and conclusive upon the
Guaranteed Party and Guarantor. Each party shall bear the cost
of its own appraiser and the cost of appointing, and the
expenses of, the third appraiser shall be shared equally by the
Guaranteed Party and Guarantor.

A.&nbsp; This Guarantee is irrevocable as to any and all of the
Guaranteed Obligations until the earliest date (the
&#147;Termination Date&#148;) that, as a result of a repayment,
compromise or adjustment of a principal amount of the Note, the
total principal amount outstanding under the Note is reduced by
an amount equal to or greater than the Total Guaranty Amount, or
if the Borrower incurs indebtedness senior to, or pari passu
with the Note, provided that the obligations of the Guarantors
hereunder shall continue after the Termination Date to the
extent of any claims that are attributable fully and solely to
an event or action that occurred before the Termination Date,
and provided further that the EOP Operating Limited Partnership
shall offer the Borrower a Guarantee Opportunity,(as defined in
<I>Exhibit&nbsp;E-9</I> of the Partnership Agreement) in
replacement of the guarantee provided under this Guaranty
Agreement to the extent required pursuant to
<I>Exhibit&nbsp;E-9.</I>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
B.&nbsp; This Guarantee is binding on the Guarantors and their
successors and assigns, and insures to the benefit of the
Guaranteed Party.

C.&nbsp; No delay on the part of the Guaranteed Party in the
exercise of any right or remedy shall operate as a waiver
thereof, and no single or partial exercise or waiver by the
Guaranteed Party of any right or remedy shall preclude any
further exercise thereof, nor shall any modification or waiver
of any of the provisions of this Guarantee be binding upon the
Guaranteed Party, except as expressly set forth in a writing
duly signed or delivered by the Guaranteed Party or on the
Guaranteed Party&#146;s behalf by an authorized officer or agent
of the Guaranteed Party. The Guaranteed Party&#146;s failure at
any time or times hereafter to require strict performance by
Maker, Guarantors or any other person of any of the provisions,
warranties, terms and conditions contained in any security
agreement, agreements, guarantee, instrument or document now or
at any time or times hereafter executed by Maker or Guarantors
or delivered to the Guaranteed Party shall not waive, affect or
diminish any right of the Guaranteed Party at any time or times
hereafter to demand strict performance thereof and such right
shall not be deemed to have been waived by any act or knowledge
of the Guaranteed Party, its agents, officers, or employees,
unless such waiver is contained in an instrument in writing
signed by an officer or agent of the Guaranteed Party and
directed to Maker or Guarantors, or either of them (as the case
may be) specifying such waiver. No waiver by the Guaranteed
Party of any default shall operate as a waiver of any other

affect or impair the Guaranteed Party&#146;s rights or the
