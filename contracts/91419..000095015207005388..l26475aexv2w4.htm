ARTICLE 2: THE MERGER 

   

 2.1 _The Merger_. 

  

 Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company, as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), shall by virtue of the Merger continue its corporate existence under, and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware. 

    ##### 

  

     

 2.2 _Effective Time of the Merger_. 

  

 The Merger shall become effective at the date and time (the " _Effective Time_ ") a properly executed Certificate of Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The parties shall cause the Certificate of Merger to be executed and filed as aforesaid on the Closing Date upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions contained in Article 6. 

   

 2.3 _Effect of the Merger_. 

  

 The Merger shall have the effects as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and Section 251 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 2.4 _Certificate of Incorporation_. 

  

 The Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect at the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time, and thereafter may be amended as provided therein or by Law. 

   

 2.5 _Bylaws_. 

  

 The Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect at the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time, and thereafter may be amended as provided by Law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or such Bylaws. 

   

 2.6 _Board of Directors; Officers_. 

  

 The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or until their death, resignation or removal in accordance with the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

ARTICLE 3: CONVERSION OF SECURITIES 

   

 3.1 _Conversion of Shares_. 

  

 At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any Shares: 

   

 (a) Each Share that is owned, directly or indirectly, by an Acquired Company or by Parent shall automatically be retired, shall cease to be outstanding, without payment of any consideration therefore, and shall cease to exist (" _Excluded Shares_ "). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Each Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (the " _Preferred Share Merger Consideration_ ") equal to a number, the numerator of which is the Series I Liquidation Value and the denominator of which is the number of Preferred Shares, other than Excluded Shares, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) Each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (the " _Common Share Merger Consideration_ "; collectively, with the Preferred Share Merger Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ") equal to a number, the numerator of which is: 

  

 (i) Two Hundred Forty Eight Million Dollars ($248,000,000); 

  

 (ii) _plus_ an amount equal to the Closing Cash; 

  

 (iii) _plus_ an amount equal to the Tail Insurance Amount; 

  

 (iv) _minus_ an amount equal to the Closing Indebtedness; 

  

 (v) _plus_ the amount, if any, by which the Closing Working Capital exceeds the Working Capital Target, or _minus_ the amount, if any, by which the Working Capital Target exceeds the Closing Working Capital; 

  

 (vi) _minus_ the Closing Selling Expenses; and 

  

 (vii) _minus_ the Series I Liquidation Value; 

 

and the denominator of which is the number of Common Shares, other than
Excluded Shares, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock in the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding Common Shares held by a Person (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who duly demands appraisal of such Persons Common Shares pursuant to the DGCL and complies with all the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of holders of Common Shares to demand appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted as described in Section 3.1(c) but shall become the right to receive such cash consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder as provided in the DGCL. If, however, such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws such Persons demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses such Persons right of appraisal, in any case pursuant to the DGCL, his shares shall be deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable Common Share Merger Consideration without interest. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) At the Effective Time, all Shares (other than Dissenting Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares shall, to the extent such certificate represents such Shares, cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except, in all cases, the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration. 

  

 3.2 _Closing Deliveries; Payment of Estimated Merger Consideration_. 

  

 (a) On the Closing Date, each Stockholder shall deliver to Parent a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") which shall, without limitation (i) provide that the applicable Shares are beneficially owned by the Stockholder, and (ii) include instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates in exchange for the applicable Estimated Merger Consideration. 

   

 (b) At the Closing, Parent shall pay and deliver the Estimated Merger Consideration  _less_ the Escrowed Funds to the Stockholders by means of a wire transfer of immediately available cash funds to the account or accounts as directed by the Stockholders Representative prior to the Closing (the " _Stockholders  Accounts_"). The payment by Parent of the Estimated Merger Consideration _less_ the Escrowed Funds into the Stockholders Accounts shall constitute payment by Parent to each Stockholder and satisfaction of Parents obligation to pay such amounts in connection with the Merger. After such payment by Parent, the Stockholders Representative shall be solely responsible for allocating and distributing to each Stockholder his, her or its portion of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement. 

   

 3.3 _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. 

  

 At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Shares shall be made thereafter. In the event that, after the Effective Time, certificates representing Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled against delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration as provided in this Article 3. 

   

 3.4 _Estimated Merger Consideration; Payment of Indebtedness_. 

  

 3.4.1. _Estimated Merger Consideration_. Three (3) Business Days before the Closing, the Company shall estimate in good faith the amount of the Closing Cash, Closing Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Selling Expenses, as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date in accordance with Section 3.5.1, and deliver to Parent and Merger Sub a certificate executed by the Company setting forth such estimates (the " _Closing Certificate_ "). As used herein, " _Estimated Closing Cash_ ," " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ ," " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ " and " _Estimated Selling Expenses_ ," mean the estimates of the Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Working Capital and the Closing Selling Expenses, respectively, set forth in the Closing Certificate, and " _Estimated Merger Consideration_ " means an amount equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration calculated as set forth in Section 3.1 assuming that the Closing Cash is equal to the Estimated Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness is equal to the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, the Estimated Closing Working Capital is equal to the Closing   ##### 

  

  

  

Working Capital, and the Closing Selling Expenses are equal to the Estimated
Selling Expenses. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub shall pay and deliver the Estimated Merger
Consideration _less_ the Escrowed Funds in accordance with Section 3.2. 

   

 3.4.2. _Payment of Indebtedness and other Settlements_. At the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) on behalf of the Acquired Companies, cause the Estimated Closing Indebtedness to be repaid in full to the party or parties entitled thereto pursuant to the Payoff Letters, (ii) on behalf of the Company and the Stockholders, pay the Estimated Selling Expenses to the parties entitled thereto as set forth on a certificate delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub at Closing, and (iii) deposit the Escrowed Funds into an escrow account to be held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Company shall, and shall cause the other Acquired Companies to use commercially reasonable efforts to exercise the covenant defeasance option set forth in Article VIII of the Indenture immediately prior to the Closing. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Acquired Companies in satisfying the conditions to the exercise of such covenant defeasance option and shall, immediately prior to the Closing, deposit with the Trustee (as defined in the Indenture) in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Indenture cash in U.S. Dollars, U.S. Government Obligations (as defined in the Indenture) or a combination thereof as will be sufficient to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 8.02(1) of the Indenture. Any interest received by any Acquired Company after the Closing with respect to the amount deposited with the Trustee pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be a reduction in Indebtedness hereunder and, if any such amount is received after the post-Closing adjustment is finalized pursuant to Section 3.5 hereof, such Acquired Company shall pay such amount to the Stockholders Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders, within two (2) business days after such receipt of same. 

   

 3.5 _Post-Closing Adjustment_. 

  

 3.5.1. _Adjustment Statement Preparation_. Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be prepared and delivered to the Stockholders Representative an adjustment statement setting forth the amount of the Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Working Capital and the Closing Selling Expenses, each on a consolidated basis as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date (the " _Preliminary Adjustment Statement_ "), and Parents written calculation of the aggregate Merger Consideration, and the adjustment necessary to reconcile the Estimated Merger Consideration to the aggregate Merger Consideration (the " _Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment_ "). The Preliminary Adjustment Statement shall be prepared as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date in accordance with GAAP and in accordance with the principles and policies used in preparing interim financial statements. The computation of Closing Working Capital is intended to show the change in Working Capital from Working Capital Target, and such change can only be measured if the calculation is done in the same way and using the same methods. In furtherance of the foregoing, any reduction that is specifically identifiable (other than from the sale of inventory or the receipt of payments in respect of accounts receivable) in finished goods inventory, raw materials, work in process or accounts receivable set forth in the Preliminary Adjustment Statement will be reviewed to determine if a corresponding adjustment should be made to such entries with respect to the months included in the computation of the Working Capital Target as set forth on Exhibit B (and   ##### 

  

  

  

the Working Capital Target shall be equitably adjusted therefor). In such
preparation: (a) any and all effects on the assets or liabilities of any of
the Acquired Companies of any financing or refinancing arrangements entered
into by Parent and Merger Sub at any time at or after the Effective Time
shall be entirely disregarded; (b) it shall be assumed that the Acquired
Companies and their respective lines of business shall be continued as a
going concern; and (c) there shall not be taken into account the closing of
the transaction or any of the plans, transactions or changes that Parent
intends to initiate or make or cause to be initiated or made at or after
the Effective Time with respect to any of the Acquired Companies or its
respective business or assets, or any facts or circumstances that are unique
or particular to Parent or Merger Sub or any assets or liabilities of Parent
or Merger Sub, or any obligation for the payment of the Merger Consideration
hereunder. Furthermore, the value of the inventory of the Acquired Companies
set forth on the Preliminary Adjustment Statement shall be based on a
physical count performed as of the Closing Date, at which the Stockholders
Representative or his delegate may be present. The Stockholders
Representative shall reasonably cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub in
the preparation of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement. 

   

 3.5.2. _Adjustment Statement Review_. The Stockholders Representative shall review the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment and shall notify Parent in writing of any dispute it has with respect to the preparation and content of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment no later than the thirtieth (30th) day after the Stockholders Representatives receipt thereof, setting forth in such notice the Stockholders Representatives objections to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement or the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment with particularity and the specific changes or adjustments which the Stockholders Representative claims are required to be made thereto. Parent shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, cooperate with all representatives of Stockholders Representative in the review of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall cause the books and records of the Acquired Companies to be made available during normal business hours to such representatives, and shall cause the necessary personnel of the Acquired Companies to assist such representatives in their review of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement, including granting such persons access to the facilities and other assets of the Acquired Companies, in each case, upon reasonable advance notice. 

   

 3.5.3. _Adjustment Statement Dispute Resolution_. If the Stockholders Representative timely notifies Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with Section 3.5.2 of an objection by the Stockholders Representative to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement or the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment, and if the Stockholders Representative and Parent are unable to resolve such dispute through good faith negotiations within fifteen (15) days after the Stockholders Representatives delivery of such notice of objection, then the parties shall mutually engage and submit such dispute to, and the same shall be finally resolved in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement by such accounting firm of national reputation as shall be mutually acceptable to Parent and the Stockholders Representative (the " _Independent Accountants_ "). The Independent Accountants shall determine and report in writing to Parent and the Stockholders Representative as to the resolution of all disputed matters submitted to the Independent Accountants and the effect of such determinations on the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment within twenty (20) days after such submission or such longer period as the Independent Accountants may reasonably require, and   ##### 

  

  

  

such determinations shall be final, binding and conclusive as to Parent and
the Stockholders Representative and their respective Affiliates. The fees
and disbursements of the Independent Accountants shall be shared equally
between Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholders Representative, on the
other hand. 

   

 3.5.4. _Final Adjustment Statement and Post-Closing Adjustment_. The Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment shall become the " _Final Adjustment Statement_ " and the " _Final Post-Closing Adjustment_ ," respectively, and as such shall become final, binding and conclusive upon all Persons for all purposes of this Agreement, upon the earliest to occur of the following: 

   

 (a) the mutual acceptance by Parent and the Stockholders Representative of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment, respectively, with such changes or adjustments thereto, if any, as may be proposed by the Stockholders Representative and consented to by Parent; 

  

 (b) the expiration of thirty (30) days after the Stockholders Representatives receipt of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment, respectively, without timely written objection thereto by Parent in accordance with Section 3.5.2; or 

  

 (c) the delivery to Parent and the Stockholders Representative by the Independent Accountants of the report of their determination of all disputed matters submitted to them pursuant to Section 3.5.3. 

  

 3.5.5. _Adjustment of Merger Consideration_. If the aggregate Merger Consideration, as finally determined in accordance with this Section 3.5, is greater than the Estimated Merger Consideration, then Parent shall pay the amount of such difference to the Stockholders Representative for the benefit of the Stockholders by means of a wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Stockholders Representative. If the aggregate Merger Consideration, as finally determined in accordance with Section 3.5, is less than the Estimated Merger Consideration, the Stockholders Representative and Parent shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay from the Unspecified Escrowed Funds the amount of such difference to Parent by means of a wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent. For Tax purposes, any payment by Parent or from the Escrowed Funds to Parent under this Agreement, including pursuant to Article 9, shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration unless a contrary treatment is required by Law. Any payments due and payable pursuant to this Section 3.5.5 shall be paid no later than two (2) Business Days after the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment become the Final Adjustment Statement and the Final Post-Closing Adjustment, respectively, pursuant to Section 3.5.4. 

   

 3.6 _Escrows_. 

  

 At the Closing, Parent, the Stockholders Representative and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") shall enter into two escrow agreements, substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ and _Exhibit C_ hereto (the " _Escrow Agreements_ "). The   ##### 

  

  

  

first escrow shall be created for the purpose of securing payment related to a
specific listing of liabilities which the Stockholders have agreed to bear
responsibility (the " _Specific Indemnity Matters_ "), and shall be for an
amount equal to Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) (the " _Specified Escrow
Funds_ "). The second escrow shall be created for the purpose of securing the
indemnification provisions of this Agreement as well as any adjustment to the
Merger Consideration or other obligations to Parent pursuant to this
Agreement, and shall be for an amount equal to Seven Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000) (the " _Unspecified Escrowed Funds_ " and
together with the Specified Escrow Funds, the " _Escrowed Funds_ ").

connection therewith and a duly executed affidavit of non-foreign status as

 8.3 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

   

 (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, in which any Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the Closing, a director or officer of any Acquired Company (the " _Indemnified D andO Parties_") is, or is threatened to be, made a party thereto based in whole or in part on the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of an Acquired Company, whether in any case asserted or arising before, on or after the Closing (each, a " _Proceeding_ "), the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, indemnify and hold harmless such Person from and against such Proceeding as provided in this Section 8.6. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in no event shall the indemnification under this Section 8.6 in any way limit any claim for Losses of the Parent Indemnitees arising under this Agreement or any agreement or document delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall retain in the Organizational Documents of each of the Acquired Companies any indemnification provision or provisions, including provisions respecting the advancement of expenses, in effect on the Closing Date for the benefit of the Indemnified DandO Parties as of Closing, and shall not thereafter amend the same as it relates to such indemnified parties (except to the extent that such amendment preserves or broadens the indemnification or other rights theretofore available to such Indemnified DandO Parties). 

   

 (c) After the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall and shall cause the other Acquired Companies to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each Indemnified DandO Party from and against any and all Losses, (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Proceeding to each Indemnified DandO Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with or arising out of any Proceedings. 

   

 (d) An Indemnified DandO Party shall notify Parent of the existence of a Proceeding for which such Indemnified DandO Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder as promptly as reasonably practicable after such Indemnified DandO Party learns of such Proceeding; _provided_ that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations under this Section 8.6 except to the extent such failure to notify actually prejudices Parent, the Surviving Corporation or another Acquired Company. The Indemnified DandO Party, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the other Acquired Companies shall cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense of any Proceeding. No settlement of a Proceeding may be made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the other Acquired Companies without the Indemnified DandO Partys consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, except for a settlement which requires no more than a monetary payment for which the Indemnified DandO Party is fully indemnified.

On the Closing Date, Parent agrees to pay, as part of the Merger Consideration, an amount not to exceed One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000) to offset the cost to the Company in obtaining such tail coverage (the " _Tail Insurance Amount_ "). 

   

 (f) The provisions of this _Section 8.6_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each Indemnified DandO Party and such Indemnified DandO Partys estate, administrators, executors, heirs and representatives, and nothing herein shall affect any indemnification rights that any such Person may have under any charter, bylaws, Contract, applicable law or otherwise. The obligations of the Surviving Corporation and the other Acquired Companies under this  _Section 8.6_ shall continue in full force and effect for a period commencing as of the Closing and ending as of the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim for indemnification under this _Section 8.6_ asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such claim. 

   

ARTICLE 9: INDEMNIFICATION 

   

 9.1 _Indemnification of Parent and Merger Sub_. 

  

 9.1.1 From and after the Closing, only to the extent of the Unspecified Escrowed Funds, Parent and the Acquired Companies and their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, stockholders, agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Parent Indemnitees_ "), shall be entitled to be indemnified for and held harmless from: 

   

 (a) any Losses based upon, resulting from, arising out of, caused by or in connection with the failure of, any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any of the representations and warranties in Article 4 (other than the representations in _Section 4.7_ which are covered in Section 9.1(c) below) to be true and correct on the date hereof or the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , for purposes of calculating Losses for any breach of or inaccuracy in such representations and warranties, any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications in such representations and warranties shall be disregarded; 

  

 (b) any Losses based upon, resulting from, arising out of, caused by or in connection with any breach or nonperformance of any covenant, agreement or obligation of the Company or the Stockholders Representative in this Agreement; 

  

 (c) notwithstanding any disclosure contained herein or otherwise known to any of the Parent Indemnitees, any Losses based on, resulting from, arising out of, caused by or in connection with any (1) Taxes payable by any Acquired Company with respect 

   ##### 

  

    

to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or for the Straddle Period to the extent
allocable or attributable to the portion of such period prior to the Closing
(except to the extent such Taxes are reflected in the Final Adjustment
Statement), or (2) breaches of the representations or warranties in Section
4.7 hereof. For purposes of this paragraph 9.1(c), in the case of
any Straddle Period, (i) real, personal and intangible property Taxes ("
_Property Taxes_ ") of the Acquired Companies allocable to the period prior
to the Closing shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in such period up to
and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the Straddle Period; and (ii) the Taxes of the Acquired Companies
(other than Property Taxes) allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period
prior to the Closing shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of
the close of business at the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to any indemnification pursuant to
this Agreement for any Loss relating to a liability for Taxes (i) for any Tax
period beginning after the Closing Date or the portion of any Straddle Period
that is not allocable or attributable to the portion of such period prior to
the Closing pursuant to the preceding sentence of this Section 9.1(c), (ii)
attributable to any action (including any election made or deemed made under
Code Section 338 with respect to any Acquired Company) taken after the
Closing by Parent, any of Parents Affiliates (including any
Acquired Company) or any transferee of Parent or any of its Affiliates (other
than any such action expressly required by applicable law or by this
Agreement) (a " _Buyer Tax Act_ ") or (iii) attributable to a breach by
Parent of its obligations under this Agreement; 

  

 (d) any Losses based upon, arising out of or caused by the disallowance or unavailability of a deduction or the failure to withhold any amounts required to be withheld pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code, with respect to any "excess parachute payment" made by any of the Acquired Companies within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code made on or prior to the Closing Date; and 

  

 (e) any Losses based upon, arising out of or caused by (i) any failure to properly and successfully exercise the covenant defeasance option in accordance with the terms of the provisions of the Indenture; (ii) any failure to comply with the terms and provisions of the Indenture with respect to the redemption of the Securities (as defined in the Indenture); and (iii) any failure to otherwise satisfy the obligations of any of the Acquired Companies under or with respect to the Indenture or the Securities. 

  

 9.1.2. Notwithstanding any disclosure contained herein or otherwise known to any of the Parent Indemnitees, from and after the Closing, only to the extent of the Specified Escrowed Funds, the Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to be indemnified for and held harmless from any Losses based upon the Specified Indemnity Matters. The Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1.1 for the Specified Indemnity Matters. 

   

 9.2 _Limitations on Indemnification of Parent and Merger Sub; Escrow Sole Remedy_. 

  

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the indemnification of the Parent Indemnitees provided for in this Agreement, except for the Specified Indemnity   ##### 

  

  

  

Matters for which clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 9.2 shall not apply,
shall be subject to the following limitations and conditions set forth in
this Section 9.2: 

   

 (a) any claim by a Parent Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1.1 of this Agreement shall be required to be made by delivering a notice to the Company in accordance with Section 9.3 no later than the expiration of the second anniversary of the Closing Date; 

  

 (b) except for claims for indemnification with respect to Section 9.1.1(a) based upon, resulting from, arising out of, caused by or in connection with any breach of any representation or warranty contained in Section 4.2 [Capital Stock], Section 4.20 [Indebtedness; Selling Expenses] or Section 4.25 [Brokerage], the Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1.1(a) or (c) until the aggregate amount of all of the Parent Indemnitees claims for indemnification pursuant to such Section 9.1.1(a) or (c) exceeds Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) (the " _Indemnification Threshold_ ") and thereafter the Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification only for amounts in excess of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the " _Indemnification Deductible_ "); and 

  

 (c) any indemnification obligations to Parent and Merger Sub will be drawn solely from the Escrowed Funds, and each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that, whether pursuant to this Article 9 or otherwise, the Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification solely out of the Escrowed Funds pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreements. 

  

 9.3 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_. 

  

 9.3.1. _Third-Party Claims_. 

   

 (a) In order for a party (the " _indemnitee_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of, or involving a claim or demand made by any Person against the indemnitee (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such indemnitee must notify the party from whom indemnification hereunder is sought (the " _indemnitor_ ") in writing of the Third-Party Claim no later than thirty (30) days after such claim or demand is first asserted (a " _Third-Party Claim Notice_ "). A Third-Party Claim Notice shall state in reasonable detail the amount or estimated amount of such claim, and shall identify the specific basis (or bases) for such claim, including the representations, warranties or covenants in this Agreement alleged to have been breached. Failure to give a Third-Party Claim Notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnitor shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure or except to the extent such Claim Notice is given later than the date set forth in Section 9.2 for making such claim. Thereafter, the indemnitee shall deliver to the indemnitor, without undue delay, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers received by the indemnitee) relating to the Third-Party Claim so long as any such disclosure could not reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the attorney-client or any other privilege that may be available to the indemnitee in connection therewith. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) If a Third-Party Claim is made against an indemnitee, the indemnitor shall be entitled to participate, at its expense, in the defense thereof. In addition, if (i) no claim for injunctive relief is being made against indemnitee, and (ii) it is reasonably likely that indemnitee will not suffer a Loss in excess of indemnitors indemnification obligation hereunder, the indemnitor may elect to assume and control the defense of a Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by the indemnitor that is reasonably acceptable to indemnitee. In the event that indemnitor cannot assume defense of the Third-Party Claim because (1) such claim is for injunctive relief against indemnitee, or (2) it is reasonably likely that indemnitee will suffer a Loss in excess of indemnitors indemnification obligation hereunder, then, in such instances, the indemnitee shall not, without the written consent of the indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, enter into any settlement, compromise or discharge which imposes any expense, obligation or restriction upon the indemnitor (including payments out of the Escrowed Funds) or requires the indemnitor to admit or acknowledge to any fact or event, including any violation of Law.
