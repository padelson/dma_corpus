and shall remain responsible (by payment, through the adjustments to the
Consideration hereunder or otherwise) for all Property Expenses, in each
case, attributable to the Assets for the period of time prior to the Effective

storage facilities into which they are run or, if there are no such storage
facilities, when they pass through the LACT meters or similar meters at the
point of entry into the pipelines through which they are transported from
the field, and (b) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or
attributable to" the Assets when they pass through the delivery point sales
meters on the pipelines through which they are transported. Likewise, as used
herein, the terms "earned" and "incurred" shall be interpreted in accordance
with GAAP and Council of Petroleum Accountants Society standards.

 

ARTICLE III

 

CONSIDERATION

 

3.1 _Consideration_.

 

(a) The aggregate consideration for the Assets shall consist of (i) an
amount in cash determined by Parent in its sole discretion upon written
notice to Contributors prior to the Closing (provided that in no event shall
such amount be less than the Minimum Cash Consideration) (such amount as
determined by Parent, the "Cash Consideration"), (ii) an aggregate number of
shares of newly-issued Parent Class A Common Stock and/or Parent Class B
Common Stock (allocated in accordance with the Contributors Representative
Allocation) calculated by dividing (A) the excess of (x) $2,090,820,090 less
(y) the Cash Consideration, by (B) a per share issue price of $10.00 (the
"Stock Consideration"), and (iii) a number of Company Units equal to the
number of shares of Parent Class B Common Stock, if any, included in the
Stock Consideration (the "Unit Consideration" and, together with the Stock
Consideration, the "Equity Consideration" and together with the
Cash Consideration, the "Consideration"), adjusted in accordance with this
Agreement (the "Adjusted Consideration"); _provided_ that all such adjustments
at Closing shall be made by adjusting the Equity Consideration by (A) an
aggregate number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock and/or Parent Class
B Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest number of whole shares) calculated
by dividing (x) the amount of such adjustment by (y) $10.00 and (B) a number
of Company Units equal to the number of shares of Parent Class B Common Stock,
if any, included in such adjustment. In addition, the Contributors may be
entitled to additional consideration for the Assets as set forth on, and
subject to the terms and conditions of, _Exhibit Q_ (the "Earnout Payments").

 

(b) At the Closing, Parent shall contribute and issue, as applicable, the
Adjusted Consideration (other than the Unit Consideration) to Company, and in
exchange therefor (and in exchange for any cash or other property contributed
by Parent to Company in connection with the Giddings Transaction, the Ironwood
Transaction or otherwise), the outstanding membership interests in Company
shall be converted into a number of Company Units equal to the number of
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock outstanding after giving effect to the
Transactions (including the shares issued upon the conversion of the Founder
Shares and as the Stock Consideration) (such units, the "Acquired Units").
Concurrently with the contribution by Parent of the Adjusted Consideration,
Parent shall be admitted as the managing member of Company pursuant to the
terms of the Company AandR LLC Agreement. In addition, Company shall issue to
Parent a number of warrants exercisable for Company Units in an amount equal
to the number of warrants exercisable for shares of Parent Class A Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance of warrants.

 



6 (c) Immediately following the receipt thereof from Parent, Company
shall transfer and issue, as applicable, the Adjusted Consideration (less the
Defect Holdback Amount) to Contributors to the accounts designated by
Contributors in the Preliminary Settlement Statement. Any shares or units
issued as part of the Equity Consideration shall be made via book entry
issuance bearing customary legends noting that such securities constitute
restricted securities under the Securities Act.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no fractional Company Units
and no certificates or scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership
thereof, will be issued in the Transactions. In lieu thereof, Company shall
pay or cause to be paid to each Person who otherwise would receive a
fractional Company Unit, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a share, an
amount of cash (without interest and rounded to the nearest whole cent)
determined by multiplying the fractional Company Unit interest to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled by $10.00.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no fractional shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Class B Common Stock and no
certificates or scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will
be issued in the Transactions. Any such fractional share of Parent Class A
Common Stock or Parent Class B Common Stock shall be cancelled, and such
holder thereof shall not be entitled to any additional consideration in
exchange for such fractional share of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent
Class B Common Stock. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any such
fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Class B Common
Stock have no fair value for purposes of Section 155 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL").

 

3.2 _Adjustments to Consideration_. All adjustments to the Consideration
shall be (x) made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and, to the
extent not inconsistent with this Agreement, in accordance with GAAP, (y) made
without duplication (in this Agreement or otherwise), and (z) to the extent
practicable, allocated among the Assets in a manner consistent with _Section_
__ _ 3.6_. Without limiting the foregoing, the Consideration shall be
adjusted as follows:

 

(a) The Consideration shall be adjusted upward by the following amounts
(without duplication):

(i) an amount equal to, to the extent that such amount has been received
by Company (or Company Merger Sub) and not remitted or paid to Contributors,
the value of all Hydrocarbons from or attributable to the Assets in storage or
existing in pipelines, plants and tanks (including inventory and line fill)
and upstream of the sales meter as of the Effective Time, the value to be
based upon the contract price in effect as of the Effective Time (or the sales
price, if there is no contract price, in effect as of the Effective Time);

 

(ii) an amount equal to all Property Expenses paid by Contributors that are
attributable to the Assets during the period from and after the Effective
Time, whether paid before or after the Effective Time;

(iii) the Overhead Amount for the Interim Period;

 



7 (iv) subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.8_, to the extent that Contributors or,
prior to Closing, Company Merger Sub, either (x) are underproduced for
Hydrocarbons or (y) have overdelivered any Hydrocarbons, in each case, as of
the Effective Time, as complete and final settlement of all
Imbalances attributable to the Assets, an amount equal to the product of the
underproduced and/or overdelivered volumes times $3.00/Mcf for gaseous
Hydrocarbons;

 

(v) the amount of all Asset Taxes allocated to Company in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 16.2_ _ _ but paid or payable by Contributors (for the
avoidance of doubt, without duplication of any Asset Taxes that were withheld
or deducted from the gross amount paid or payable to Contributors in
connection with a transaction to which  _Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)(_ _i_ _)_
applies and were taken into account in determining the adjustment pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)(_ _i_ _))_ ;

 

(vi) the 2018 Lease Acquisition Costs: and

 

(vii) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or
otherwise agreed upon in writing by Contributors and Company.

(b) The Consideration shall be adjusted downward by the following amounts
(without duplication):

 

(i) an amount equal to, to the extent that such amount has been received by
Contributors and not remitted or paid to Company or Parent or Company Merger
Sub, all proceeds actually received by Contributors attributable to the
ownership or operation of the Assets, including the sale of Hydrocarbons
produced from or allocable to the Assets during the period following the
Effective Time, net of Burdens (other than Property Expenses taken into
account pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_);

 

(ii) if Contributors make the election under _Section_ __ _ 12.2(d)(i)_
with respect to a Title Defect, the Title Defect Amount with respect to such
Title Defect if the Title Defect Amount has been determined as of or prior to
the Closing;

 

(iii) if Contributors make the election under _Section_ __ _ 13.1(c)(i)_
with respect to an Environmental Defect, the Remediation Amount with respect
to such Environmental Defect if the Remediation Amount has been determined as
of or prior to the Closing;

 

(iv) the Allocated Value of the Assets excluded from the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 11.1(b)(iv)_, _Section_ __ _
12.3(b)(ii)(y)_, _Section_ __ _ 12.4(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 12.5(a)_, _Section_
__ _ 12.5(b)_, or  _Section_ __ _ 13.1(c)(ii)_;

(v) subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.7(a)_, to the extent that Contributors
or, prior to Closing, Company Merger Sub, either (x) are overproduced for
Hydrocarbons or (y) have underdelivered any Hydrocarbons, in each case, as of
the Effective Time as set forth in  _Schedule_ __ _ 4.11_, as complete and
final settlement of all Imbalances attributable to the Assets, an amount equal
to the product of the overproduced and/or underdelivered volumes set forth on
_Schedule 4.11_ times $3.00 Mcf for gaseous Hydrocarbons;

 



8 (vi) the amount of all Asset Taxes allocated to Contributors in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 16.2_ but paid or payable by Company (without duplication
of any Asset Taxes that were withheld or deducted from the gross amount paid
or payable to Contributors in connection with a transaction to which
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)(i)_ applies and were taken into account in determining
the adjustment pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)(i)_);

 

(vii) an amount equal to all proceeds from sales of Hydrocarbons relating
to the Assets and payable to owners of Working Interests, royalties,
overriding royalties, and other similar interests (in each case) that are held
by Contributors in suspense as of the Closing Date; and

 

(viii) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or
otherwise agreed upon in writing by Contributors and Company.

3.3 _Preliminary Settlement Statement_. Not less than five (5)
Business Days prior to Closing, Contributors shall prepare and submit to
Company for review a draft settlement statement (the "Preliminary Settlement
Statement") that shall set forth Contributors good faith estimate of
the Adjusted Consideration, reflecting each adjustment made in accordance
with this Agreement as of the date of preparation of such Preliminary
Settlement Statement and the calculation of the adjustments used to determine
such amount, together with the designation of Contributors account for the
wire transfer of funds as required by _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ and _Section_ __ _
10.3(c)_ and the issuance of the Equity Consideration, including
the Contributors Representative Allocation with respect to the Equity
Consideration. Within two (2) Business Days after Companys receipt of the
Preliminary Settlement Statement, Company shall deliver to Contributors a
written report containing all changes that Company proposes to be made to the
Preliminary Settlement Statement together with the explanation therefor and
the supporting documents thereof. The Parties shall in good faith attempt to
agree in writing on the Preliminary Settlement Statement as soon as possible
after Contributors receipt of Companys written report. The Preliminary
Settlement Statement, as agreed upon in writing by the Parties, will be used
to adjust the Consideration at Closing; _provided_ that if the Parties do not
agree in writing upon any or all of the adjustments set forth in the
Preliminary Settlement Statement, then the amount of such un-agreed adjustment
or adjustments used to adjust the Consideration at Closing shall be that
amount set forth in the draft Preliminary Settlement Statement delivered by
Contributors to Company pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_; _provided_ , 
_further_ , the Title Defect Amounts and Remediation Amounts claimed by
Company in any applicable Title Defect Notices and/or Environmental Defect
Notices shall be used to determine the Defect Holdback Amount.

 

3.4 _Remittance of Cash; Final Settlement Statement_.

 

(a) On or before one hundred twenty (120) days after Closing, a final
settlement statement (the "Final Settlement Statement") will be prepared by
Contributors and delivered to Company taking into account all final
adjustments made to the Consideration and showing the resulting final
Consideration (the "Final Consideration"). The Final Settlement Statement
shall set forth the actual proration of the amounts required by this
Agreement. As soon as practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days
after Companys receipt of the Final Settlement Statement, Company shall
return to Contributors a written report containing any proposed changes to the
Final Settlement Statement and an explanation of any such changes and the
reasons therefor (the "Dispute Notice"). Contributors shall make available to
Company such information and records of Contributors to the extent reasonably
necessary for Company to verify and audit the adjustments

 



9  set forth (or that should have been set forth) in Contributors draft Final
Settlement Statement. Any changes not so specified in the Dispute Notice shall
be deemed waived, and Contributors determinations with respect to all such
elements of the Final Settlement Statement that are not addressed specifically
in the Dispute Notice shall prevail. If Company fails to timely deliver a
Dispute Notice to Contributors containing changes Company proposes to be made
to the Final Settlement Statement, the Final Settlement Statement as delivered
by Contributors will be deemed to be correct and will, without limiting
payments made from one Party to the other in respect of Asset Taxes pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 16.2(d)_ or the Parties respective rights to indemnity
under _Article_ __ _ XIV_, be final and binding on the Parties and not
subject to further audit or arbitration. If the Final Consideration set forth
in the Final Settlement Statement is mutually agreed upon in writing by
Contributors and Company, the Final Settlement Statement and the Final
Consideration, shall, without limiting payments made from one Party to the
other in respect of Asset Taxes pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 16.2(d)_ or the
Parties respective rights to indemnity under _Article_ __ _ XIV_, be final
and binding on the Parties and not subject to further audit or arbitration.
Any difference in the Adjusted Consideration as paid at Closing pursuant to
the Preliminary Settlement Statement and the Final Consideration shall be paid
by the owing Party within ten (10) Business Days after final determination of
such owed amounts in accordance herewith to the owed Party. All amounts paid
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ shall be made by issuing to the
Contributors (with respect to any amount paid to the Contributors) or
surrendering to Company or Parent (with respect to any amount paid by the
Contributors), as applicable, (1) an aggregate number of shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock and/or Parent Class B Common Stock (rounded down to the
nearest number of whole shares) calculated by dividing (x) such amounts by (y)
$10.00, and (2) a number of Company Units equal to the number of shares of
Parent Class B Common Stock determined in clause (1) above. The allocation in
clause (1) above between shares of Parent Class A Common Stock and Parent
Class B Common Stock shall be based on the Contributors Representative
Allocation.

 

(b) If, after the Closing (whether before or after delivery of the Final
Settlement Statement), Contributors receive monies (including proceeds of
production) belonging to the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ or
otherwise, then such monies shall, within five (5) Business Days after the end
of the month in which they were received, be paid over by Contributors to the
Company. In addition, if, after delivery of the Final Settlement Statement
pursuant to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3.4(a)_, either Party
(including, in the case of Company, Company Merger Sub) receives monies
(including proceeds of production) belonging to the other Party pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.3_ or otherwise, then such monies shall, within five (5)
Business Days after the end of the month in which they were received, be paid
over by the receiving Party to the owed Party.

3.5 _Disputes_. Contributors and Company shall work together in good
faith to resolve any matters addressed in the Dispute Notice. If Contributors
and Company are unable to resolve all of the matters addressed in the Dispute
Notice within ten (10) Business Days after the delivery of such Dispute
Notice by Company to Contributors, either Party may, upon notice to the other
Party, submit all unresolved matters addressed in the Dispute Notice to
arbitration in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_. Within ten (10)
Business Days of a matter being submitted to arbitration by a Party in
accordance with the preceding sentence, each of Company and Contributors shall
(a) summarize their position with regard to such dispute in a
written document of 20 pages or less and (b) submit such summaries to a
nationally-recognized independent accounting firm as selected by mutual
agreement of the Parties (the "Accounting Arbitrator"), together with the
Dispute 

 



10  Notice, the Final Settlement Statement and any other documentation such
Party may desire to submit. If the Parties cannot agree on an Accounting
Arbitrator within ten (10) Business Days after a Partys election to submit
such matters to arbitration under this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, then either such
Party may request the Houston, Texas office of the American Arbitration
Association (the "AAA") (or, if there is no such office, the office of the
AAA serving Houston, Texas) to select the Accounting Arbitrator. Within ten
(10) Business Days after receiving the Parties respective submissions, the
Accounting Arbitrator shall render a decision choosing either Contributors
position or Companys position with respect to each matter addressed in any
Dispute Notice, based on the materials described above. Any decision rendered
by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive, and
binding on the Parties and enforceable against any of the Parties in any court
of competent jurisdiction. The costs of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be
borne equally between the Contributors, on the one hand, and Parent and
Company, on the other hand.

3.6 _Allocated Values_. The Parties agree that the Consideration shall be
allocated among the Assets as set forth on _Exhibit C_ and _Exhibit D_ (the
"Allocated Values"). The Parties agree that such allocation is reasonable and
shall not take any position inconsistent therewith. Contributors, however,
make no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of such values.

 

3.7 _Tax Treatment and Consideration Allocation_.

 

(a) For U.S. federal income and any applicable state and local tax
purposes, the Parties agree to treat the transactions described in _Article_
__ _ II_ and _Article_ __ _ III_ (along with the Ironwood Transaction unless
otherwise agreed by the Parties), to the extent Contributors provide Company
with sufficient documentation, as determined by Company, to support such
characterization, as follows:

(i) where the Equity Consideration received by a Contributor includes
solely Parent Class A Common Stock, the transfer of Assets (and Units (as
defined in the Ironwood MIPA), where applicable) by such Contributor shall be
treated as a taxable sale of property to Company for Class A Common Stock and
Cash Consideration (and the assumption of any related Assumed Obligations);
and

(ii) where the Equity Consideration received by a Contributor includes
solely Unit Consideration (and corresponding Class B Common Stock):

 

(A) the transfer of Assets (and Units (as defined in the Ironwood MIPA),
where applicable) by such Contributor shall be treated as a contribution of
property to Company under Section 721(a) of the Code (except to the extent of
any Cash Consideration that does not constitute a reimbursement of capital
expenditures as described below in clause (C) of this  _Section_ __ _
3.7(a)(ii)_);

(B) each related Assumed Obligation shall be treated as a "qualified
liability," as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section
1.707-5(a)(6); and

 

(C) to the extent applicable, the receipt of Cash Consideration by such
Contributor shall be treated as a reimbursement of such Contributors
preformation capital expenditures within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.707-4(d).

 



11 (b) The Parties shall file all income Tax Returns consistent with the
tax treatment characterizations described in _Section_ __ _ 3.7(a)_, and no
Party hereto shall take any position inconsistent with such tax treatment
characterization unless otherwise required by a final "determination"
(as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code).

(c) The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree to an
allocation of the Adjusted Consideration, the consideration under the Ironwood
MIPA (if applicable), and any other items properly treated as consideration
for U.S. federal income Tax purposes among the Assets and the rights and
interests transferred pursuant to the Ironwood MIPA (if applicable) in a
manner consistent with the principles of Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and, to the extent allowed under
applicable federal income Tax Law, in a manner consistent with the Allocated
Values, within thirty (30) days after the date that the Final Settlement
Statement is finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ (or if
applicable,  _Section_ __ _ 3.5_). If the Parties do not reach an agreement
with respect to such an allocation, the Parties shall submit any such
remaining disputed items to an Independent Accounting Firm who shall act as an

their officers, employees, and representatives with access to the Records
during normal business hours for review and copying at Contributors expense
for Tax and accounting purposes, and (c) provide Contributors and their

expense. At the end of such seven year period and prior to destroying any of
the Records, Parent and Company shall notify Contributors in advance of any
such destruction and provide Contributors an opportunity to copy such Records
at Contributors sole cost and expense.

 

6.5 _Knowledge of Breach; Right to Cure_ _; Schedule Supplements_.

 

(a) Each Party will notify the other promptly and in reasonable detail
after such first Party obtains actual knowledge that any representation or
warranty of the other Party contained in this Agreement is, becomes, or will
be untrue in any material respect on or before the Closing Date. If, prior to
the Closing, a Party has actual knowledge that any representation or warranty
herein of the other Party is untrue in a manner that causes such first Partys
obligation to Close pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.1_,
as applicable, not to be satisfied but such first Party nevertheless elects
to Close, then such first Party will be deemed to have waived such breaches of
such representations and warranties with respect to its obligation to Close
and shall not be entitled to make a claim under this Agreement with respect
to any such breach.

(b) If any of Contributors, Companys or Parents representations or
warranties are untrue or shall become untrue in any material respect between
the Execution Date and the Closing, or if any of Contributors, Companys or
Parents covenants or agreements to be 

 



32  performed or observed prior to or on the Closing Date shall not have been so
performed or observed in any material respect, but if such breach of
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement is cured by the Closing (or,
if the Closing does not occur, cured prior to the termination of this
Agreement), then such breach shall be considered not to have occurred for all
purposes of this Agreement.

 

(c) Prior to Closing, each Contributor shall have the right to supplement
its Schedules relating to the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article_ __ _ IV_ with respect to any matters discovered (if Contributors
applicable representation or warranty is qualified by Contributors Knowledge)
or occurring subsequent to the Execution Date and such supplements shall, if
the Closing occurs, be deemed to have been included in such Contributors
representations and warranties for purposes of such Contributors
indemnification obligations under  _Article_ __ _ XIV_. However, all such
supplements shall be disregarded for all purposes of this Agreement, including
determining whether the condition to Parents or Companys obligation to close
the transaction pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ has been satisfied;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if based solely on the matters relating to such
supplements Companys and Parents obligation to Close the transaction
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ has not been satisfied but Company and
Parent nevertheless elect to Close, Company and Parent will be deemed to have
waived the matters relating to such supplements in regard to Companys and
Parents obligation to Close and shall not be entitled to make a claim under
this Agreement with respect to any such matter.

 

6.6 _Regulatory Matters_ _._ Unless HSR Act notification is not required
because an exemption applies, the Parties shall (a) make or cause to be made
an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act") or any other
filings or notifications required by applicable Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby promptly following the Execution Date, and
the Parties shall bear their own costs and expenses incurred in connection
with such filings,  _provided_ __ that any filing fees in connection
therewith shall be borne equally by the Parties, and (b) use their
commercially reasonable efforts to (x) promptly respond to any requests for
additional information made by the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice (the "DOJ"), the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), or any other
Governmental Authority, (y) take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the
waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other applicable Laws to terminate
or expire at the earliest possible date, and (z) resist in good faith, at each
of their respective cost and expense, any assertion that the transactions
contemplated hereby constitute a violation of applicable Laws, all to the end
of expediting consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. In
connection with this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Parties shall, to the extent permitted by Laws, (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing,
submission, investigation, or inquiry, (ii) promptly inform the other Party of
any communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the
DOJ or the FTC, or any other Governmental Authority and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case, regarding the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii)
have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall
consult the other on, any filing made with or written materials to be
submitted to, the DOJ, the FTC, or any other Governmental Authority or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, any other Person, in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv) consult with
each other in advance of any meeting, discussion, telephone call or conference
with the DOJ, the FTC, or any other Governmental Authority or, in connection
with

 



33  any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the extent
not expressly prohibited by the DOJ, the FTC, or any other Governmental
Authority or person, give the other Party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences, in each case, regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby.

assignment contemplated in  _Section_ __ _ 6.20(c)(ii)_, Contributors shall
cause any other Affiliate of Contributors that holds any asset, property or
interest that, if owned by Contributors as of the Execution Date would
constitute an Asset (including any net profits interests or similar interests
in the Leases or Wells and including any interest in a 2018 New Lease acquired
on or after March 16, 2018) (each an "Affiliate Asset"), to convey all such
Affiliate Assets to Contributors pursuant to a form of conveyance in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Company, and Contributors shall deliver
executed originals of such conveyances to Company on or prior to the Closing.
Any Affiliate Asset that is so conveyed to Contributors (and subsequently
conveyed to Company (or Company Merger Sub) at Closing) shall be treated as an
Asset that is owned by Contributors as of all times that such Affiliate Asset
was owned by such Affiliate for purposes of (a) Contributors
representations, warranties, covenants, and indemnities hereunder and (b) for
purposes of determining the existence of any Title Defect or any breach of the
special warranty of title in the Assignment. For the avoidance of doubt, this
_Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall not apply to any of the Excluded Assets.

 

6.8 _Contributors_ __ _Indebtedness_. Contributors shall negotiate
and obtain on or prior to the Closing Date, (a) releases of all Encumbrances
securing borrowed monies or payment obligations incurred by a Contributor or
any of their Affiliates under any Indebtedness that is secured by the
Assets, (b) authorizations to file UCC-3 termination statements releases in
all applicable jurisdictions to evidence the release of all such Encumbrances
on the Assets securing due and payable obligations under any Indebtedness,
and (c) all instruments and agreements reasonably requested by, and in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to, Company to effect and file of record
the release of all Encumbrances in connection therewith as of the Closing.
Each Contributor shall use the proceeds from the Cash Consideration paid by
Company to such Contributor at the Closing to pay off in full all Indebtedness
of such Contributor pertaining to the Assets.

 

6.9 _Transaction Litigation_. Each Party shall give the other Party the
opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement, or prosecution of any
proceeding commenced following the Execution Date related to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby at such Partys sole cost and expense.
Prior to the Closing Date, no Party shall compromise, settle, come to an
arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle, or come to an
arrangement regarding any such litigation or consent to the same unless the
other Party shall have consented in writing (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

6.10 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to do, or
cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to
arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in
the Debt Commitment Letter (subject to any "flex" provisions applicable
thereto), including using commercially reasonable efforts to (i)

 



34  maintain in effect the commitment for the Debt Financing set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate, execute, and deliver definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing having terms and conditions
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including any flex terms in the
Debt Commitment Letter) and on such other terms that would not (A) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing such that Parent and Company would not
have sufficient funds at Closing to pay all obligations of Parent and the
Company hereunder or (B) impose new or additional conditions to the receipt of
the Debt Financing, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions, to
the receipt of the Debt Financing, in each case, in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (1) materially delay the timing of the Debt
Financing, (2) make the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of
the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing) materially less likely to
occur or (3) adversely affect in any material respect (x) the ability of
Parent and the Company to enforce their rights against the other parties to
the Debt Commitment Letter or (y) the ability of Parent and the Company to
consummate the transactions hereunder (any such event described in (A) or (B),
an "Adverse Effect on Financing"), and (iii) satisfy and cause to be
satisfied, on a timely basis, all conditions applicable to Parents
Subsidiaries in such Debt Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements
related thereto.

 

(b) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any
related flex terms), Parent and the Company shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain alternative debt financing on terms in
the aggregate not materially less favorable to Company in the reasonable
judgment of Company than the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such alternative
financing will not, without the prior written consent of the Contributors (not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), reasonably be expected
to have an Adverse Effect on Financing. Without the prior written consent of
Contributors (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent
and the Company shall not amend or modify the Debt Commitment Letter in a
manner that could reasonably be expected to have an Adverse Effect on
Financing (it being understood the Debt Financing may be replaced so long as
such replacement does not have an Adverse Effect on Financing); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that additional Financing Sources may be added to any Debt
Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms thereof, if the addition of
such additional parties, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the availability of the
Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment Letter or the consummation of the
transactions described herein.

 

(c) To the extent that the Debt Financing is available to Parent and
Company, Parent shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to) incur Indebtedness
under the definitive documentation with respect the Debt Financing in an
amount not to exceed $500,000,000 to the extent necessary to cause the
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ to be satisfied.

herein will require such cooperation to the extent it unreasonably interferes
with the business or operations of any Contributor or its Affiliates.

 

(b) Company shall promptly, upon request by Contributors, reimburse
Contributors for all documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
Contributors in connection with their cooperation contemplated by Section
6.11(a)(x), and all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses

respects with the requirements of the United States federal securities laws
and the rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE promulgated thereunder
or otherwise (the "Federal Securities Laws"). Contributors shall provide to
Parent as promptly as practicable all information concerning the
Contributors, their Affiliates, the Assets (including, for avoidance of doubt,

Ironwood MIPA that may be required by the Federal Securities Laws for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement (collectively, the "Required Proxy

extent that the use of such information is required in connection with the
Parents Debt Financing.

 

(b) Each of Contributors and Parent shall cooperate with each other in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement (including the preliminary Proxy
Statement) and any amendment or supplement to the preliminary Proxy Statement,
any Offer Documents and any other filing required by the Federal Securities
Laws to be filed by Parent in connection with the Transaction; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall furnish such preliminary Proxy Statement, any
other Offer Documents or such filing to Contributors and give Contributors and
its legal counsel a reasonable opportunity to review such preliminary Proxy
Statement, Offer Documents or such filing prior to filing with the SEC and
shall accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by

Contributors of the receipt of any comments of the SEC staff with respect to
the preliminary Proxy Statement or any Offer Documents and of any requests by
the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information
and shall provide to Contributors as promptly as reasonably

 



38  practicable copies of all written correspondence between Parent or any
representative of Parent and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and
Offer Documents. If comments are received from the SEC staff with respect to
the preliminary Proxy Statement or Offer Documents, Parent and Contributors
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to the comments of the SEC. Parent shall provide
Contributors and its legal counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review any
amendment or supplement to the preliminary Proxy Statement or Offer Documents
prior to filing with the SEC and shall accept all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested by Contributors in connection therewith.
Contributors and Parent shall cooperate to promptly provide such information
as may be required to be included in the Proxy Statement or Offer Documents or
as may be reasonably required to respond to any comment of the SEC staff.
After all the comments received from the SEC have been cleared by the SEC
staff and all information required to be contained in the Proxy Statement and
Offer Documents has been included therein by Parent and Contributors, Parent
shall file the definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC and cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed, at Parents expense (including by electronic delivery
if permitted) as promptly as practicable thereafter to its stockholders of
record, as of the record date established by the board of directors of Parent
(the "Parent Board"); _provided_ that Parent shall not be required to mail the
Proxy Statement if (i) the financial statements included in the Required
Proxy Information would be required to be updated pursuant to the age of
financial statement requirements of Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X under the
Securities Act on any day during the 15 Business Day period following the date
the of the proposed Stockholder Approval to the extent such financial
statements were included in a filing with the SEC or (ii) any day during the
15 Business Day period following the date of the proposed Stockholder
Approval would be a Blackout Date until, in the case of (i), the financial
statements meet such requirement or, in the case of (ii) immediately after
such Blackout Date. If at any time prior to receipt of Stockholder Approval,
any information in the Proxy Statement or Offer Documents should be discovered
by Contributors or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement or Offer Documents, so that such Proxy
Statement or Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
included in the Proxy Statement or Offer Documents.

6.13 _Stockholders Meeting_ _._ Parent shall: (i) take all
action necessary under applicable Law and its Organizational Documents to
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the
"Stockholders Meeting") to seek the Stockholder Approval and approval of the
Transaction Proposals, which Stockholders Meeting will be held as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date that the Proxy Statement is mailed
to Parents stockholders; and (ii) submit the Transaction Proposals to, and
use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit proxies in favor of such
Transaction Proposals from, such holders at the Stockholders Meeting. Parent
shall, through the Parent Board, recommend to its stockholders that they vote
in favor of the Transaction Proposals (the "Parent Board Recommendation"),
and, subject to the following sentence, Parent shall include the Parent Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. The Parent Board shall not (and no duly
authorized committee thereof shall) change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or
modify, or publicly propose to change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify,
in a manner adverse to Contributors, the Parent Board Recommendation (a
"Change in 

 



39  Recommendation"); _provided_ that the Parent Board may make a Change in
Recommendation if it determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that a failure to make a Change in Recommendation
would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to
Parents stockholders under applicable Law. Any Change in Recommendation shall
not invalidate the approval of this Agreement by the Parent Board. Parent
agrees that it will establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting and submit for the approval of its
stockholders the matters contemplated by the Proxy Statement, regardless of
whether or not there has been any Change in Recommendation. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent may adjourn the
Stockholders Meeting (1) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement or the Offer Documents that the
Parent Board has determined in good faith is required by applicable Law is
provided to Parents stockholders, (2) if as of the time for which
the Stockholders Meeting is scheduled there are insufficient shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute
a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Stockholders Meeting, (3) in
order to solicit additional proxies from stockholders of Parent in favor of
the adoption of each of the Transaction Proposals if the proxies then received
are insufficient to obtain Stockholder Approval, or (4) if the Parent
Stockholder Redemption Amount is such that the condition to closing in
_Section_ __ _ 7.5_ would not be satisfied; _provided_ that, in the event of
an adjournment pursuant to foregoing clauses, the Stockholders Meeting shall
be reconvened as promptly as practicable following such time as the matters
described in such clauses have been resolved.

 

6.14 _NYSE Listing_. Until the Closing, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that Parent remains listed as a public company
on, and for shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to be tradable over, The New
York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE").

Closing (or, if the Closing does not occur, the date that is twelve (12)
months from the Execution Date), each of Company and Parent will not, and will
cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit for
employment or employ any officer or employee of Contributors or their
respective Affiliates with whom Parent, Company and/or their respective
Affiliates have had direct contact as part of its evaluation, negotiation, or
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein without obtaining the
prior written consent of Contributors. The term "solicit for employment" shall
not include general solicitations of employment not specifically directed
towards officers or employees of Contributors or their respective Affiliates.

6.16 _Business Combination Proposals_. Promptly following the Execution
Date, Parent shall promptly notify Contributors of any discussions with any

of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, Parent shall notify Contributors at least twenty-four (24) hours prior

_provided_ that the Parent shall not provide any non-public or confidential
information regarding the Contributors or the Assets to any Person without the
Contributors prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ _further_ that Parent shall
not, shall cause its Affiliates not to and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts

 



40  to cause their respective Representatives not to, deliver any letter of
intent to any Person, or enter into any agreements (other than customary
confidentiality agreements, a copy of which shall be delivered to the
Contributors within twenty-four (24) hours following execution and delivery
thereof by Parent or its applicable Affiliate) with any Person, in each
regarding any Business Combination Proposal with a purchase price in
excess of $200,000,000 without the Contributors prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). From the
Execution Date through the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, Parent shall not, shall cause its
Affiliates not to and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) enter into,
knowingly solicit, initiate or continue any discussions or negotiations with,
or knowingly encourage any inquiries or proposals by, or participate in any

their respective Representatives to, immediately cease any and all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Parent Transaction Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Parties agree that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.16_ by any of Parents Affiliates or any of its or their
respective Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section_
__ _ 6.16_ by Parent.

 

6.17 _Trust Account_. Upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in  _Article_ __ _ VII_, _Article_ __ _ VIII_, and _Article_ __ _
IX_, and provision of notice thereof by Parent to the Trustee in accordance
with the terms of the Trust Agreement, (a) in accordance with and pursuant to
the Trust Agreement, at the Closing, Parent shall cause the documents,
opinions, and notices required to be delivered to the Trustee pursuant to the
Trust Agreement to be so delivered and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Trustee to, and the Trustee shall thereupon be obligated
to (i) pay as and when due all amounts payable to shareholders of Parent, and
(ii) immediately thereafter, pay all remaining amounts then available in the
Trust Account in accordance with this Agreement and the Trust Agreement, and
(b) thereafter, the Trust Account shall terminate, except as otherwise
provided therein.

in and to the oil and gas interests described on _Schedule 2.3(b)_
or otherwise acquired pursuant to Section 6.1 acquired by Sellers or any of
their Affiliates. As such, it is the intent of the Parties that (a) except for
the special warranty of title from Sellers in the Assignments, the right,
title, and interest contributed to Company (or Company Merger Sub) (and the
remedies and protections provided to Company with respect to same) hereunder
in respect of the 2018 Asset Additions be no greater than the right, title,
and interest transferred to Contributors (and the remedies and protections

 



41  provided to the Contributors with respect to same) under, in the case of the
GulfTex Assets, the GulfTex PSA and, in the case of the 2018 New Leases, the
instruments granting such Leases and (b) the Contributors will be reimbursed
on a dollar-for-dollar basis under this Agreement for their acquisition of the
2018 Asset Additions on the Companys behalf as provided in this Agreement.
Accordingly, at Closing, Company and Parent will reimburse the Contributors in
cash in an amount equal to (i) the GulfTex Purchase Price plus, if known as of
such time, the GulfTex True-Up Amount, (ii) pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 16.2_,
the GulfTex Acquisition Costs (all such amounts referred to in clauses (i) and

3.2(a)(vi)_, the actual bonuses, brokers fees, and other out-of-pocket lease
acquisition costs for the 2018 New Leases (not to exceed the amount set forth
on _Schedule 2.3(b)_ for each such 2018 New Lease) (the "2018 Lease
Acquisition Costs"). Further, the term "Assets," as used in  _Article_ __
_ IV_ (other than in _Section_ __ _ 4.7(c)_), _Article_ __ _ XII_, and
_Article_ __ _ XIII_ will not include (or be deemed to include) the 2018
Asset Additions or, as applicable, the GulfTex PSA, and neither Company nor
Parent will have any rights or remedies under _Article_ __ _ IV_ (other than,
as applicable, in respect of _Section_ __ _ 4.7(c)_),  _Article_ __ _ XII_,
and _Article_ __ _ XIII_ in respect of the 2018 Asset Additions; provided
that no interest of Sellers in any of the 2018 Asset Additions shall (x) be
included in the Net Acres, Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest of
Sellers for purposes of _Article_ __ _ XII_ and (y) constitute a Title
Benefit. In a similar regard, the term "Specified Obligations," as it relates
hereunder to the 2018 Asset Additions, will be limited (and deemed limited),
in all cases, to Liabilities to the extent of Contributors ownership or
operation of the 2018 Asset Additions, and the term "Retained Obligations," as
it relates hereunder to the 2018 Asset Additions, will not include
Liabilities to the extent of Contributors ownership or operation of the 2018
Asset Additions. This _Section_ __ _ 6.18_ shall apply (and be deemed to
apply) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary.

6.19 _Mergers_. __

 

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything to the

(ii) Prior to the Closing (but no earlier than 5 Business Days prior to the

facilitate recording in the applicable counties covering the Assets of such

the assumption by such Merger Sub of the Assumed Obligations of such
Contributor relating to such Assets, and (ii) assignments, in appropriate
forms, of federal Leases, state Leases, and Indian Leases included in such
Assets (if any) in sufficient counterparts to facilitate filing with the
applicable Governmental Authority, in each case, in form and substance

42 (c) Contemporaneously with the Closing, each Merger Sub shall merge

Merger Agreement in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.19_. In connection
with each Merger, each Contributor shall cause the applicable Merger Sub to,
and the Company shall cause Company Merger Sub to, with respect to each
Merger, execute and deliver an Agreement and Plan of Merger in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit_ __ _ P_ (each such merger agreement, a "Merger
Agreement"). Other than as set forth in the Merger Agreements, there shall be
no condition to the completion of the Mergers. The Parties shall cause the
Mergers to be consummated at the applicable effective times stated in the

Law to be duly executed by Company Merger Sub with respect to each member. The
Parties shall file such certificates of merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware at Closing.

 

(d) At all times after the formation of each Merger Sub, Contributors shall
cause the Merger Subs not to conduct any business activities or assume or
incur any liabilities other than as required or permitted by this _Section_ __
_ 6.19_. Without limiting the foregoing, other than as required or permitted
by this  _Section_ __ _ 6.19_, with Parents prior consent, or in connection
with the Assignments, Contributors shall cause the Merger Subs not to:

 

(i) amend the Organizational Documents of any Merger Sub;

Person;

 

(iii) issue, split, combine or reclassify any equity interests in any
Merger Sub;

 

(iv) sell or create any lien, security interest, or encumbrance on any

joint operating agreement (the "Joint Operating Agreement") with Contributors
(if prior to the Closing) or the Company Merger Sub (if after the
Closing) consistent with the terms and conditions described in the attached
_Exhibit L_. If the Joint Operating Agreement is entered into prior to the
Closing, then the Joint Operating Agreement shall constitute an Applicable
Contract included in the Assets for all purposes of this Agreement from and
after the date the same is entered into (including that each Contributors
interest therein shall be contributed to the applicable Merger Sub in
connection with the Merger Transactions). Any material deviation or change to
the terms and conditions to be set forth in the Joint Operating Agreement from
those set forth in _Exhibit L_ shall require the prior written approval of
Parent.

 

6.21 _Cooperation_. Except to the extent the Parties obligations are
specifically set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, the Parties shall
cooperate fully with each other and shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated as
promptly as reasonably practicable (including by using commercially

Company and Parent, the conditions set forth in  _Sections 7.1_ , _9.1_ ,
_9.2_ and _9.3_ to be satisfied).

amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, or any replacement of, the Subscription Agreements without the
prior written consent of the Contributors. Parent shall use its commercially

conditions described therein, including maintaining in effect the Subscription
Agreements and using its commercially reasonable efforts to (a) satisfy on a

by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied,
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Subscription Agreements at or
prior to Closing and (c) enforce its rights under the Subscription Agreements
in the event that all conditions in the Subscription Agreements (other than

the Closing) have been satisfied, to cause the applicable Investors to
contribute to Parent the amounts payable by the Investors in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to and in

of Third Parties, including Third Party operators of the Assets (with respect
to which consents Contributors shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, but shall not be obligated to expend any monies, except as may be
agreed to be paid or reimbursed by Company), Contributors shall afford to
Company and its officers, employees, agents, accountants, consultants,
financing sources, attorneys, and other authorized representatives
("Representatives") reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the
Assets and all Records in Contributors possession for the purpose
of conducting a reasonable due diligence review of the Assets. Company shall
abide by Contributors, and any Third Party operators, safety rules,
regulations, and operating policies (including the execution and delivery of
any boarding agreements or similar documentation or paperwork required by any
Contributor and/or Third Party operator) that are posted or otherwise provided
to Company in advance of such activity while accessing the Assets for purposes
of conducting such diligence. All investigations and due diligence conducted
by Company or any of its Representatives shall be conducted at Companys sole
cost, risk, and expense and any conclusions made from any examination done by
Company or any of its Representatives shall result from Companys own
independent review and judgment. Company shall give Contributors reasonable
prior written notice before gaining physical access to or otherwise inspecting
or surveying any of the Assets, whether to conduct a Phase I Environmental
Site Assessment or otherwise, and shall coordinate any such access,
inspections, or surveys with Contributors. Contributors or their designee
shall have the right to accompany Company and its Representatives whenever
they are on-site of the Assets or otherwise inspecting or surveying the

a reputable environmental consulting or engineering firm approved in advance
in writing by Contributors (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed), subject to the following (along with the other
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 11.1_):

(i) No environmental Phase II environmental site assessment or
other environmental sampling or invasive activity or testing or operation of
equipment by Company or its Representatives (a "Phase II ESA") may be
performed without the prior written consent of Contributors (and may only be
performed with respect to a recognized environmental condition or

 



50  potential violation of Environmental Laws that has been identified in a
Phase I Environmental Site Assessment), which consent may be withheld in
Contributors sole discretion, and Contributors or their designee shall have
the right to be present during any stage of the assessment.

(ii) If such consent is granted, (A) in the event that any Phase II ESA
interferes with the normal operations of the Assets or otherwise may cause an
undue risk of harm to the site, Contributors may request an appropriate
modification of such Phase II ESA; (B) any Phase II ESA shall be conducted by
Environmental Resource Management or a reputable environmental consulting or

approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) and, once

Contributors do not have the authority to grant access for such
investigations; _provided_ that Contributors shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts (but without any obligation to expend any monies except as
may be agreed to be paid or reimbursed by Company) to obtain permission from
any Third Party operators for Company to have such access. Company shall
reasonably cooperate with Contributors in attempting to cause any Third Party
operator to provide Company with the requested access.

(iv) If, prior to the Environmental Claim Date, (A) Company is denied
physical access to any Assets in order to perform a Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment or a Phase II ESA or (B) a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment
indicates that a Phase II ESA should be performed, Company requests
authorization to perform such Phase II ESA, including any environmental
sampling or invasive activity or testing or operation, and Contributors deny
such request, then, in either such case, Company shall have the right, in its
sole discretion, to exclude the applicable Assets (as well as any associated
Assets) and such Assets shall not be conveyed at the Closing, in which case,
the Consideration shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Asset and
associated Assets excluded from the Assets conveyed at Closing via the Merger
Transactions.

(v) Company shall (and shall cause its Representative to) coordinate
its environmental assessments and inspections of the Assets with Contributors
and all Third Party operators to minimize any inconvenience to or interruption
of the conduct of business by Contributors or such Third Party operators.
Company shall (and shall cause its Representative to) abide by Contributors,

operating policies while conducting its due diligence evaluation of the
Assets, including any environmental or other inspection, survey, or
assessment of the Assets.

WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A MEMBER OF THE CONTRIBUTOR INDEMNIFIED PARTIES AND (II)
LIABILITIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DISCOVERY OF ANY CONDITION OF THE ASSETS BY
PARENT, COMPANY OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES DURING THE COURSE OF ANY SUCH ACCESS

(d) Company agrees to promptly provide Contributors, but in no event less
than five (5) Business Days after receipt or creation, copies of all final
reports and sampling or test results prepared by Parent, Company, and/or any
of their respective Representatives that contain data collected or generated
from Companys and its Representatives due diligence with respect to the
Assets. Contributors shall not be deemed by their receipt of such documents or
otherwise to have made any representation or warranty, expressed, implied or
statutory as to the condition of the Assets or to the accuracy of said
documents or the information contained therein.

(e) Upon completion of Companys due diligence, Company shall at its sole
cost and expense and without any cost or expense to Contributors (i) repair
all damages to any Assets to the extent caused by Companys or its
Representatives due diligence activities (including due diligence conducted
by Companys environmental consulting or engineering firm), (ii) if Company
performed any sampling or invasive activities as may be permitted hereunder,
restore the affected Assets to the approximate same condition as they were
prior to commencement of any such sampling or invasive activities, and (iii)
remove all equipment, tools, and other property brought onto the Assets in
connection with such due diligence. Any disturbance to the Assets (including
the leasehold associated therewith), to the extent resulting from such due
diligence, will be promptly corrected by Company at Companys sole cost and
expense.

 

(f) Any Representatives of Company (including Companys environmental
consulting or engineering firm) that are provided access to the Assets
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ shall (i) execute a release and
indemnity agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to Contributors or (ii)
maintain, at their sole cost and expense, policies of insurance of the types
and in the amounts that are reasonable and customary for such access;
_provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of
Representatives that are provided site access to any of the Assets described
in _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ through _Section_ __ _ 2.1(g)_, such
Representatives will be required to maintain the insurance described in clause
(ii) which will (A) be primary insurance, (B) list the Contributor
Indemnified Parties as additional insureds, (C) waive subrogation against the
Contributor Indemnified Parties, and (D) provide for thirty (30) days prior
written notice to Contributors in the event of cancellation, expiration, or
modification of the policy or reduction in coverage. Upon request by
Contributors, Company shall provide evidence of such insurance to Contributors
prior to accessing the Assets.

 



52 11.2 _Confidentiality_. Each of Parent and Company acknowledges that,
pursuant to its right of access to the Records or the Assets, Parent, Company,
and their respective Representatives (including Companys environmental
consulting or engineering firm) will become privy to confidential and other
information of Contributors or their respective Affiliates, and each of Parent
and Company shall ensure that such confidential information (but not including
information that (i) is generally available to the public at such disclosure
to Parent, Company or their Representatives or (ii) becomes generally
available to the public at such disclosure other than as a result of
disclosure by Parent, Company or their Representatives in violation of this 
_Section_ __ _ 11.2_) shall be held confidential by Parent, Company, Company
Merger Sub and their Representatives in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that the foregoing and
the Confidentiality Agreement shall not restrict such disclosures to the
extent (w) necessary for Parent, Company or their Affiliates to operate the
properties of which the Assets are a part, (x) necessary for Parent or Company
to perform its obligations under this Agreement (including such disclosure to
any investor of Parent, Company or their Affiliates), (y) required by
applicable securities or other Laws, applicable rules of any stock exchange
having jurisdiction over Parent, Company or their Affiliates or by a
governmental order, decree, regulation, or rule, or (z) related to any dispute
under or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. If
Closing should occur, the foregoing confidentiality restrictions on Parent
and the Company, including the Confidentiality Agreement, shall terminate as
of the Closing (except as to (A) such portion of the Assets that are not
conveyed to Company via the Merger Transactions pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement, (B) the Excluded Assets, and (C) information related to assets
other than the Assets). Each of Parent and Company further agrees that,
notwithstanding termination of the Confidentiality Agreement, if Closing does
not occur then Parent and Company shall continue to maintain as confidential
and shall not disclose to any Third Party the results of any Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment or any other environmental assessment performed
on the Assets under  _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ except as required by Law. If
Closing should occur, notwithstanding termination of the Confidentiality
Agreement, Contributors shall maintain as confidential, shall not disclose to
any Third Party, and shall not use any of the Records, except as required by
Law or as provided in the Transaction Documents.

ARTICLE XII

TITLE MATTERS; CASUALTY; TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

12.1 _Contributors_ __ _ Title_.

(a) _General Disclaimer of Title Warranties and Representations_. Except
for the special warranty of title in the Assignment and without limiting
Companys remedies for Title Defects set forth in this _Article_ __ _ XII_,
Contributors make no warranty or representation, expressed, implied,
statutory, or otherwise with respect to Contributors title to any of the
Assets.

(b) _Special Warranty of Title_. If Closing occurs, then effective as of
the Closing Date until the expiration of the SWT Survival Period, Contributors
shall warrant in the Assignment Defensible Title to the Wells and Leases unto
Company Merger Sub against every Person whomsoever lawfully claims the same
or any part thereof by, through, or under any Contributor and any of its
Affiliates, but not otherwise, subject, however, to Permitted Encumbrances;
_provided_ that Company Merger Sub shall not be entitled to protection
under (or the right to make a claim against) the special warranty of title
provided in the Assignment for (i) any Title Defect reported under this
_Article_ __ _ XII_ and/or (ii) any Excluded Defect. Without limiting
the foregoing, if Company or Parent has actual knowledge of a Title Defect
prior to the Title Claim Date, Company shall only be entitled to assert such
matter as a Title Defect to the extent permitted by this _Article_ __ _ XII_
and, for the avoidance of doubt, Company Merger Sub shall be precluded from
also asserting such matter as the basis of a claim against Contributors
special warranty of title provided in the Assignment. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, the rights and
remedies available to Company under this _Article_ __ _ XII_ in respect of
any Title Defects arising by, through, or under any Contributor or any of its
Affiliates shall not be subject to or limited by the Individual Title Defect
Threshold or the Aggregate Deductible.

 



55 12.2 _Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments_. 

(a) _Title Defect Notices_. Company must deliver no later than 5:00 p.m.
(Central Time) on May 31, 2018 (the "Title Claim Date") claim notices to
Contributors meeting the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 12.2(a)_
(collectively, the "Title Defect Notices" and individually a "Title
Defect Notice") setting forth any matters that, in Companys good faith
opinion, constitute Title Defects and that Company intends to assert as a
Title Defect pursuant to this Agreement. For all purposes of this Agreement
and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (except as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 12.1_), Company and Parent shall be deemed to have waived, and
Contributors shall have no Liability for, any Title Defect that Company fails
to assert as a Title Defect by a properly delivered Title Defect Notice
received by Contributors on or before the Title Claim Date. To be effective,
each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a
description of the alleged Title Defect and the Lease or Well, or portion
thereof, affected by such Title Defect (each a "Title Defect Property"), (ii)
the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (iii) to the extent
available, supporting documents reasonably necessary for Contributors to
verify the existence of such alleged Title Defect, and (iv) the amount by
which Company reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect
Property is reduced by such alleged Title Defect and the computations
upon which Companys belief is based. From the Execution Date until the end
of the Title Claim Date, Company shall also, within a reasonable amount of
time after discovery, furnish Contributors with written notice of any Title
Benefit that is discovered by any of Companys or any of its Affiliates
employees, title attorneys, landmen or other title examiners while conducting
Companys due diligence with respect to the Assets. Further, to give
Contributors an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing alleged Title
Defects, Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
Contributors, on or before the end of every other calendar week prior to the
Title Claim Date, written notices of all matters that may be alleged as Title
Defects which were discovered by Company or any of its Affiliates employees,
title attorneys, landmen, or other title examiners during the preceding
calendar week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented
prior to the Title Claim Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Companys failure
to deliver such notice shall not prejudice Companys ability to assert a Title
Defect pursuant to this  _Article_ __ _ XII_.

(b) _Title Benefit Notices_. Contributors shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to deliver to Company on or before the Title Claim Date with
respect to each Title Benefit a notice (a "Title Benefit Notice") including
(i) a description of the alleged Title Benefit and the Lease or Well, or
portion thereof, affected by such Title Benefit (each a "Title Benefit
Property"), (ii) the Allocated Value of each Title Benefit Property, (iii) to
the extent available, supporting documents reasonably necessary for Company
to verify the existence of such alleged Title Benefit, and (iv) the amount by
which Contributors reasonably believe the Allocated Value of each Title
Benefit Property is increased by such alleged Title Benefit and
the computations upon which Contributors belief is based. Except for Title
Benefits of which Company is required to notify Contributors pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 12.2(a)_, Contributors shall be deemed to have waived all
Title Benefits for which a Title Benefit Notice has not been delivered on or
before the end of the Title Claim Date.

 



56 (c) _Contributors  Right to Cure_.

 

(i) Contributors shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt,
at their sole cost, to cure at any time prior to expiration of the Cure
Period any Title Defect asserted by Company. During the period of time from
Closing to the expiration of the Cure Period, Company and Parent agree to
reasonably cooperate with Contributors, including by giving Contributors
reasonable access during normal business hours to all Records in Companys or
its Affiliates (including Parent) possession or control to the extent
necessary or convenient to facilitate Contributors attempt to cure any such
Title Defects. An election by Contributors to attempt to cure a Title Defect
shall be without prejudice to its rights under _Section_ __ _ 12.2(j)_ and
shall not constitute an admission against interest or a waiver
of Contributors right to dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost
to cure, the alleged Title Defect.

 

(ii) At the Closing, Company shall withhold from the Consideration an
amount (the "Defect Holdback Amount") equal to the sum of, subject to and
after taking into account the limitations, thresholds, and deductibles set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 12.2(_ _i_ _)_ and _Section_ __ _ 13.1(e)_:

 

(A) the aggregate amount of all Title Defect Amounts (as claimed by Company
in its Title Defect Notices) for all Title Defects that Contributors have
elected to cure post-Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.2(d)(ii)_ and/or
dispute pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.2(d)_; plus

 

(B) the aggregate amount of all Remediation Amounts (as claimed by Company
in its Environmental Defect Notices) for all Environmental Defects that
Contributors have elected to cure post-Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _
13.1(b)_ and/or dispute pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 13.1(c)_; plus

 

(C) the aggregate amount of all Title Defect Amounts (as claimed by Company
in its Title Defect Notices) and all Remediation Amounts (as claimed by
Company in its Environmental Defect Notices) for all Title Defects and
Environmental Defects that Contributors attempted to cure prior to Closing but
which Company has elected to dispute such cure pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
12.2(j)_.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Defect Holdback Amount
shall be equal to (A) an aggregate number of shares of Parent Class A Common
Stock and/or Parent Class B Common Stock (allocated in accordance with the
Contributors Representative Allocation) (rounded down to the nearest number
of whole shares) calculated by dividing (x) the amount sum described above by
(y) $10.00, and (B) a number of Company Units equal to the number of shares of
Parent Class B Common Stock determined in clause (A) above.

 

(iii) Upon cure of any Title Defect or Environmental Defect, as applicable,
to Companys reasonable satisfaction prior to the expiration of the Cure
Period or, in the event that a Title Defect or Environmental Defect (including
as to (A) whether such Title Defect or Environmental Defect has been cured
and/or (B) the Title Defect Amount or Remediation Amount therefor) has been
submitted to the Title Arbitrator as a Disputed Title Matter pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 12.2(j)_ or to the Environmental Arbitrator pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 13.1(f)_, as applicable, upon resolution of such Disputed
Title Matter or Environmental Defect (or the

 



57  applicable Remediation Amount) under the process delineated in _Section_ __
_ 12.2(j)_ or _Section_ __ _ 13.1(f)_, as applicable, then Contributors or
Company and Parent, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive or not issue,
as applicable, a portion of the Defect Holdback Amount in accordance with the
resolution of said matter in accordance with this Agreement.

 

(d) _Remedies for Title Defects_. Subject to Contributors continuing
right to dispute the existence of a Title Defect and the Title Defect Amount
asserted with respect thereto, and subject to the rights of the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 15.1(a)_, in the event that any Title Defect
timely and effectively asserted by Company in accordance with _Section_ __ _
12.2(a)_ is not waived in writing by Company or cured prior to Closing,
Contributors shall, at their sole option at least two (2) Business Days prior
to Closing, elect to:

 

(i) subject to the Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Aggregate
Deductible (except as and to the extent provided in _Section_ __ _ 12.2(_
_i_ _)_ ), reduce the Consideration by the Title Defect Amount (not to exceed
the Allocated Value of the applicable Title Defect Property) determined
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 12.2(g)_;

(ii) cure the alleged Title Defect pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 12.2(c)(_
_i_ _)_ ; or

(iii) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
15.1(a)_.

If Contributors fail to make any of the foregoing elections at least two (2)
Business Days prior to Closing, Contributors will be deemed to have elected
the remedy set forth in _Section_ __ _ 12.2(d)(i)_.

 

(e) _Remedies for Title Benefits_. With respect to each Title Benefit
Property timely and effectively reported under _Section_ __ _ 12.2(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 12.2(b)_ for which the Title Benefit Amount exceeds the
Individual Title Defect Threshold, the aggregate of all such Title Benefit
Amounts shall only be used to offset Title Defect Amounts as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 12.2(_ _i_ _)_.

 

(f) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for Companys rights under Contributors
special warranty of title in the Assignment (subject to the limitations set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 12.1_), and Companys rights to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 15.1(a)_, __ the provisions set forth
in  _Section_ __ _ 12.2(d)_ shall be the exclusive right and remedy of
Company and Parent with respect to any defects in Contributors title
(including Contributors failure to have Defensible Title) with respect to
the Leases or Wells.

(g) _Title Defect Amount_. The amount by which the Allocated Value of a
Title Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of a Title
Defect shall be the "Title Defect Amount" and shall be determined in
accordance with the following methodology, terms, and conditions:

 

(i) if Company and Contributors agree in writing on the Title Defect
Amount, then that amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and
liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount
necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect
Property;

 



58 (iii) if, with respect to any Title Defect affecting a Lease or Well,
the Title Defect is the result of Contributors Net Revenue Interest for such
Title Defect Property (for the productive life of such Title Defect Property)
being less than the Net Revenue Interest set forth on _Exhibit_ __ _ D_ for
such Title Defect Property, and the Working Interest set forth on _Exhibit_ __
_ D_ for such Title Defect Property is decreased (for the productive life of
such Title Defect Property) in the same proportion as the decrease in Net
Revenue Interest for such Title Defect Property, then the Title Defect Amount
shall be the product of (A) the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property
multiplied __ by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is such Net
Revenue Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Defect Property on _Exhibit_ __ _ D_;

 

(iv) if, with respect to any Title Defect affecting a Lease (excluding if
such Title Defect affects only a portion of the Target Depths, which shall be
subject to _clause (v)_ below), the Title Defect is the result of
Contributors Net Acres in such Lease being less than the Net Acres
represented by Contributors on _Exhibit C_ for such Lease, then the Title
Defect Amount shall be the product of (A) the Allocated Value of such Lease
multiplied __ by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is such Net Acre
decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Acres set forth for such
Lease on _Exhibit C_ ;

(v) if the Title Defect represents any matter other than described in 
_clauses_ __ _ (_ _i_ _)_ through _(iv)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 12.2(g)_
(including if a Title Defect affects only a portion of the Target Depths),
then the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect
Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect,
the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title
Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Company and
Contributors and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a
proper evaluation;

 

(vi) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall
be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

(vii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article_ __ _
XII_, the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all
Title Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated
Value of such Title Defect Property.

 

(h) _Title Benefit Amount_. The "Title Benefit Amount" resulting from a
Title Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the following
methodology, terms, and conditions:

(i) if Company and Contributors agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then
that amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

(ii) if, with respect to any Title Benefit affecting a Well, the Title
Benefit represents an increase in Contributors Net Revenue Interest for such
Title Benefit Property (for the productive life of such Title Benefit
Property) and the Working Interest set forth on  _Exhibit D_ for such Title
Benefit Property is increased (for the productive life of such Title Benefit
Property) in the same proportion as the increase in Net Revenue Interest for
such Title

 



59  Benefit Property, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of (A)
the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property multiplied __ by (B) a
fraction, (1) the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest increase for
such Title Benefit Property and (2) the denominator of which is the Net
Revenue Interest set forth for such Title Benefit Property on _Exhibit_ __ _
D_;

 

(iii) if, with respect to any Title Benefit affecting a Lease, the Title
Benefit represents an increase in Contributors Net Acres in and to such
Lease over the Net Acres represented by Contributors on _Exhibit C_ for such
Lease, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of (A) the Allocated
Value of such Lease multiplied _ _ by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which
is such Net Acre increase and the denominator of which is the Net Acres set
forth for such Lease on _Exhibit C_ ; and

 

(iv) if the Title Benefit represents any matter other than described in
_clauses_ __ _ (i)_ through  _(iii)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 12.2(h)_, then
the Title Benefit Amount shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property, the portion of such Title
Benefit Property affected by such Title Benefit, the legal effect of the
Title Benefit, the potential economic effect of the Title Benefit over the
life of such Title Benefit Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit
by Company and Contributors and such other reasonable factors as are
necessary to make a proper evaluation.

(i) _Title Defect Threshold and Deductible_. Subject to the last sentence
in _Section_ __ _ 12.1(b)_, but otherwise notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to
the Consideration for any individual Title Defect for which the Title Defect
Amount does not exceed $50,000 (the "Individual Title Defect Threshold"); and
(ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Consideration for any
Title Defect that exceeds the Individual Title Defect Threshold unless (A)
the amount of the sum of (1) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all such
Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold (but excluding
any such Title Defects cured by Contributors) _less_ the aggregate Title
Benefit Amounts of all Title Benefits that exceed the Individual Title Defect
Threshold, plus (2) the aggregate Remediation Amounts of all Environmental
Defects that exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold (but excluding any
Environmental Defect cured by Contributors), exceeds (B) the Aggregate
Deductible, after which point Company shall be entitled to adjustments to the
Consideration only with respect to the amount by which the aggregate amount
of such Title Defect Amounts and Remediation Amounts exceeds the Aggregate
Deductible.

 

(j) _Title Dispute Resolution_. Contributors and Company shall attempt to
agree in writing on matters regarding (i) all Title Defects, Title Benefits,
Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts and (ii) the adequacy of any
curative materials provided by Contributors to cure an alleged Title Defect
(collectively, the "Disputed Title Matters") prior to Closing (or, if
Contributors elect to attempt to cure pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.2(c)(_
_i_ _)_ , then prior to the end of the Cure Period). If Contributors and
Company are unable to agree by Closing (or by the end of the Cure Period if
Contributors elect to attempt to cure a Title Defect after Closing), the
Disputed Title Matters shall be exclusively and finally resolved by
arbitration pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 12.2(j)_. There shall be a
single arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at least fifteen (15)
years experience in oil and gas titles involving properties in the regional
area in which the Title Defect Properties and/or Title Benefit Properties are
located, as selected by mutual agreement of Company and Contributors within
fifteen (15) days after the Closing or the end of the Cure Period, 

 



60  as applicable, and absent such agreement, by the Houston, Texas office of
the AAA (the "Title Arbitrator"). Each of Company and Contributors shall
submit to the Title Arbitrator its proposed resolution of the Disputed Title
Matter in writing. The proposed resolution of the Disputed Title Matter shall
include the best offer of the submitting Party in a single monetary amount
that such Party is willing to pay or accept (as applicable) to settle the
Disputed Title Matter. The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston,
Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the AAA, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of
this _Section_ __ _ 12.2(j)_. The Title Arbitrators determination shall be
made within thirty (30) days after submission of the matters in dispute and
shall be final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal. In
making its determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 12.2(g)_ and _Section_ __ _ 12.2(h)_ and, subject to
the foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title
Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. The Title
Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the
specific Disputed Title Matter submitted by either Party and may not award
damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. The
costs of the Title Arbitrator shall be borne equally between the Parties. To
the extent that the award of the Title Arbitrator with respect to any Title
Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount is not taken into account as an
adjustment to the Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ or _Section_
__ _ 3.4_, then within ten (10) days after the Title Arbitrator delivers
written notice to Company and Contributors of his award with respect to a
Disputed Title Matter and, subject to _Section_ __ _ 12.2(i)_, Company shall,
after giving effect to the limitations provided in this  _Section_ __ _
12.2_ (without duplication), deliver to Contributors from the Defect Holdback
Amount, an amount equal to (1) the sum of the Title Defect Amounts associated
with (x) those Title Defects which Contributors elected to cure pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 12.2(d)(ii)_ which are not subject to an unresolved Disputed
Title Matter and which are fully cured as provided in _Section_ __ _
12.2(c)(i)_, and (y) any Disputed Title Matters determined in favor of
Contributors pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 12.2(j)_, and Company and Parent
shall not be required to issue the remainder of the Defect Holdback Amount,
after giving effect to  _Section_ __ _ 13.1(f)_. All amounts paid pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 12.2_ shall be made by issuing to the Contributors (1)
an aggregate number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock and/or
Parent Class B Common Stock (allocated in accordance with the Contributors
Representative Allocation) (rounded down to the nearest number of whole
shares) calculated by dividing (x) such amounts by (y) $10.00, and (2) a
number of Company Units equal to the number of shares of Parent Class B
Common Stock determined in clause (1) above. For clarity, in no event shall
Company or Parent be required to issue aggregate Company Units, Parent Class A
Common Stock, or Parent Class B Common Stock pursuant to the preceding
sentence in excess of the Defect Holdback Amount. Nothing herein shall operate
to cause Closing to be delayed on account of any unresolved Disputed Title
Matter arbitration conducted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 12.2(j)_ and,
to the extent any adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties in writing as
of Closing, the Consideration shall not be adjusted therefor at Closing and
subsequent adjustments to the Consideration, if any, will be made pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.4_ or this _Section_ __ _ 12.2_.

 

12.3 _Casualty Loss_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the
Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Company shall assume all risk of loss with
respect to production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including
watering out of any well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any well)
and the depreciation of Personal Property due to ordinary wear

 



61  and tear, in each case, with respect to the Assets, and Parent and Company
shall not assert, and shall not be entitled to assert, such matters as
Casualty Losses, Title Defects, Environmental Defects, breaches of this
Agreement, or claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 14.2_.

 

(b) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any Asset
is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in condemnation
or under right of eminent domain (each a "Casualty Loss"), subject to
_Section_ __ _ 7.7_, Company and Parent shall nevertheless be required to
Close. Furthermore, subject to  _Section_ __ _ 7.7_:

(i) If the reasonable estimated losses to the Assets as a result of
all Casualty Losses that occur between the Execution Date and the Closing is
less than $1,000,000, then at Closing (x) Company shall assume all risk and
loss associated with such Casualty Losses as an Assumed Obligation (and
Contributors and their respective Affiliates shall have no Liability for such
Casualty Losses), (y) the Consideration shall not be adjusted downward as a
result of such Casualty Losses and (z) Contributors shall pay to Company all
sums paid to Contributors by Third Parties by reason of any Casualty Losses
insofar as with respect to the Assets and shall assign, transfer, and set over
to Company or subrogate Company to all of Contributors right, title, and
interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards, and other rights, in
each case, against Third Parties arising out of such Casualty Losses insofar
as with respect to the Assets.

 

(ii) If the reasonable estimated losses to the Assets as a result of all
Casualty Losses that occur between the Execution Date and the Closing equals
or exceeds $1,000,000, then, at or prior to Closing, Contributors shall elect
to either (x) adjust the Consideration downward by the amount by which the
reasonable estimated losses to the Assets as a result of such Casualty Losses
exceeds $1,000,000 or (y) exclude the affected Asset(s) from the transaction
contemplated hereby and reduce the Consideration by the Allocated Value of
such excluded Assets. In the event this _clause (b_ _)(_ _ii)_ is applicable,
Contributors shall retain all sums paid by Third Parties by reason of such
Casualty Losses and all rights in and to any insurance claims, unpaid awards,
and other rights, in each case, against Third Parties arising out of such
Casualty Losses.

12.4 _Consents to Assign_. With respect to each Consent set forth on
_Schedule_ __ _ 4.4_, Contributors shall, within a reasonable period of time
after the Execution Date, send to the holder of each such Consent a notice in
material compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such
Consent seeking such holders consent to the transactions contemplated hereby,
and on forms and in substance reasonably acceptable to Company. If prior to
Closing, either Party discovers any Consents that are not set forth on 
_Schedule_ __ _ 4.4_, such Party shall promptly provide written notice to the
other Party of such Consents, whereupon Contributors shall promptly thereafter
seek consent and comply with such Consents in accordance with this  _Section_
__ _ 12.4_.

(a) If Contributors fail to obtain a Consent prior to Closing and
the failure to obtain such Consent would (i) cause the assignment to Company
of the Assets (or portion thereof affected thereby) via the Merger
Transactions to be void or voidable, (ii) give rise to the right to terminate,
or result in the termination of, a Lease or Contract under the express terms
thereof or (iii) be reasonably likely to result in any material Liabilities
that are liquidated in amount to Company after Closing (a consent satisfying
(i), (ii), or (iii), a "Hard Consent"), then subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.7_
and _Article_ __ _ X_, as applicable, (A) the Asset (or portion thereof)
affected by such Hard 

 



62  Consent shall not be conveyed at the Closing (and shall be withheld from the
assignment contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 6.19(b)_), (B) (1) in cases in
which such Asset is a Contract, the Contract shall be held by Contributors
for the benefit of Company until the Hard Consent is satisfied or the Contract
has terminated and Company shall pay all amounts due thereunder, perform all
obligations thereunder and indemnify Contributors against any Liabilities
incurred or suffered by Contributors as a consequence of remaining a party to
such Contract until the Hard Consent is satisfied or the Contract has
terminated or (2) in cases in which the Asset subject to such Hard Consent is
a Lease or Well, all other Assets as may be reasonably necessary to effect the
exclusion of the affected Asset due to any uniformity of interest provisions,
unit agreements or other contractual or operational restrictions on the
transfer of such affected Asset shall not be conveyed at the Closing, (C) the
Consideration shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Asset (or
portion thereof) and associated Assets excluded from the Assets conveyed at
Closing via the Merger Transactions as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 12.4,_
and (D) Contributors and Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the Hard Consent applicable to the transfer of such Asset following
the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall be required to incur
any Liability or pay any money or provide other consideration to any holder of
any such Hard Consent in order to obtain such Hard Consent. In the event that
a Hard Consent (with respect to an Asset excluded pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 12.4(a)_) that was not obtained prior to Closing is obtained within one
hundred twenty (120) days following Closing, then Contributors and Company
shall effect a Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.6_ (and the other terms
and conditions herein) with respect to, and Contributors shall transfer to
Company, the Assets (or interests therein) subject to such Consent and any
associated Assets that were excluded from the Closing as provided in this
_Section_ __ _ 12.4_, and Company shall pay or provide to Contributors an
amount equal to the aggregate Allocated Values of such Assets (as
adjusted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2_).

(b) If Contributors fail to obtain a Consent prior to Closing that is not
a Hard Consent, then the Asset (or portion thereof) subject to such un-
obtained Consent shall nevertheless be assigned by Contributors to Company at
Closing via the Merger Transactions as part of the Assets and Company and
Parent shall have no claim against, and, provided Contributors have complied
with its obligation to seek such Consent as provided in this _Section_ __ _
12.4_, Contributors shall have no Liability to Company or Parent for, the
failure to obtain such Consent.

(c) Prior to Closing, Contributors and Company shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents; _provided_ , _however_
, that no Party shall be required to incur any Liability, pay any money or
provide any other consideration to the holders of any Consent in order to
obtain any such Consent. Subject to the foregoing, Company and Parent agree to
provide Contributors with any information or documentation that may be
reasonably requested by Contributors or the Third Party holder(s) of such
Consents in order to facilitate the process of obtaining such Consents.

12.5 _Preferential Purchase Rights_. With respect to each Preferential
Purchase Right set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 4.9_, Contributors shall, within
a reasonable period of time after the Execution Date, send to the holder of
each such Preferential Purchase Right a notice in material compliance with
the contractual provisions applicable to such Preferential Purchase Right with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and on forms and in substance
reasonably acceptable to Company. If prior to Closing, either Party discovers
any Preferential Purchase Rights that are not set forth on _Schedule_ __ _
4.9_, such Party shall promptly provide written notice to the other Party of
such Preferential Purchase Rights, whereupon Contributors shall promptly
thereafter send notice and comply with such Preferential Purchase Rights in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 12.5_.

 



63 (a) In the event that any holder of a Preferential Purchase
Right exercises such Preferential Purchase Right prior to the Closing, the
Assets subject to such Preferential Purchase Right (as well as all other
Assets as may be reasonably necessary to effect the exclusion of the affected
Asset due to any uniformity of interest provisions, unit agreements, or other
contractual or operational restrictions on the transfer of such affected
Asset) shall be excluded from this Agreement, the Consideration shall be
reduced at Closing by an amount equal to the aggregate Allocated Values of
such affected Assets and, subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ and _Article_ __ _
X_, as applicable, the Closing shall occur as to the remainder of the Assets
(or interests therein).

 

(b) In the event that any holder of a Preferential Purchase Right fails to
exercise such Preferential Purchase Right prior to the Closing and the time
period for exercise or waiver of such Preferential Purchase Right has not yet
expired, the Assets subject to such Preferential Purchase Right (as well as
all other Assets as may be reasonably necessary to effect the exclusion of
the affected Asset due to any uniformity of interest provisions, unit
agreements, or other contractual or operational restrictions on the transfer
of such affected Asset) shall be retained by Contributors (and shall not be
included in the assignment contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 6.19(c)_) and the
Consideration shall be reduced at Closing by an amount equal to the aggregate
Allocated Values of such Assets, and, subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ and
_Article_ __ _ X_, as applicable, the Closing shall occur as to the remainder
of the Assets (or interests therein).

 

(c) If, subsequent to the Closing, any Preferential Purchase Right is
waived, the time period otherwise set forth for exercising such Preferential
Purchase Right expires without exercise by the holders thereof, or such holder
of such Preferential Purchase Right fails to consummate the purchase of the
Assets covered by such Preferential Purchase Right in accordance with the
terms of the Preferential Purchase Right, in each case, within one hundred
twenty (120) days following Closing, then Contributors and Company shall
effect a Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.6_ (and the other terms and
conditions herein) with respect to, and Contributors shall transfer to
Company, the Assets (or interests therein) subject to such Preferential
Purchase Right and any associated Assets that were excluded from the Closing

ARTICLE XIII

 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

 

13.1 _Notice of Environmental Defects_.

 

(a) _Environmental Defects Notice_. Company must deliver no later than
5:00 p.m. (Central Time) on May 31, 2018 (the "Environmental Claim Date")
claim notices to Contributors meeting the requirements of this _Section_ __ _
13.1(a)_ (collectively the "Environmental Defect Notices" and individually an
"Environmental Defect Notice") setting forth any matters that, in Companys
good faith opinion, constitute Environmental Defects and that Company intends
to assert as Environmental Defects pursuant to this Agreement. For all
purposes of this Agreement, but subject to Companys remedy for a breach of
Contributors representation

 



64  contained in _Section_ __ _ 4.15_ and the corresponding representation in
Contributors Certificate, and without limiting Companys rights to indemnity
in respect of the Specified Obligations, Company and Parent shall be deemed
to have waived, and Contributors shall have no Liability for, any
Environmental Defect that Company fails to assert as an Environmental Defect
by a properly delivered Environmental Defect Notice received by Contributors
on or before the Environmental Claim Date; _provided_ that if Company or
Parent has actual knowledge of an Environmental Defect prior to the
Environmental Claim Date, Parent and Company shall only be entitled to assert
such matter as an Environmental Defect to the extent permitted by this
_Article_ __ _ XIII_ and, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Company
shall be precluded from also asserting such matter as the basis of an
indemnity claim in respect of Contributors representation in _Section_ __ _
4.15_. To be effective, each Environmental Defect Notice shall be in writing
and shall include (i) a description of the alleged Environmental Defect
and the Assets affected by such alleged Environmental Defect, (ii) the
Allocated Value of the Assets (or portions thereof) affected by such alleged
Environmental Defect, (iii) to the extent available, supporting documents
reasonably necessary for Contributors to verify the existence of such alleged
Environmental Defect, and (iv) a calculation of the Remediation Amount that
Company asserts is attributable to such alleged Environmental Defect. To give
Contributors an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing alleged
Environmental Defects, Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts
to provide Contributors, on or before the end of every other calendar week
prior to the Environmental Claim Date, written notices of all matters that
may be alleged as Environmental Defects which were discovered by Parent,
Company and/or their Representatives during the preceding calendar week, which
notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the
Environmental Claim Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Companys failure to
deliver such notice shall not prejudice Companys ability to assert an
Environmental Defect pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ XIII_. 

(b) _Contributors_ __ _Right to Cure_. Contributors shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure at any time
during the Cure Period, any Environmental Defects of which it has been advised
by Company. During the period of time from Closing to the expiration of the
Cure Period, Company and Parent agree to reasonably cooperate with
Contributors, including by giving Contributors reasonable access to the
applicable Assets affected by any alleged Environmental Defects, to the extent
necessary to facilitate Contributors attempt to cure any Environmental
Defects. An election by Contributors to attempt to cure an Environmental
Defect shall be without prejudice to its rights under _Section_ __ _ 13.1(f)_
and shall not constitute an admission against interest or a waiver of
Contributors right to dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost to
cure, the alleged Environmental Defect.

 

(c) _Remedies for Environmental Defects_. Subject to Contributors
continuing right to dispute the existence of an Environmental Defect or the
Remediation Amount asserted with respect thereto, and subject to the rights of
the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 15.1(a)_, in the event that any
Environmental Defect timely asserted by Company in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 13.1(a)_ is not waived in writing by Company or cured prior to Closing,
Contributors shall, at their sole option at least two (2) Business Days prior
to Closing, elect to:

 

(i) subject to the Individual Environmental Threshold and the Aggregate
Deductible, reduce the Consideration by the Remediation Amount relating to
such Environmental Defect;

 



65 (ii) in the event that the Remediation Amount equals or exceeds
the Allocated Value for such Environmental Defect, retain the entirety of the
Asset that is subject to such Environmental Defect, together with all
associated Assets (by withholding the same from the assignment contemplated
in  _Section_ __ _ 6.19(b)_), in which event, the Consideration shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Asset and such
associated Assets (without regard to the Aggregate Deductible); or

 

(iii) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
15.1(a)_.

 

If Contributors elect the option set forth in _clause_ __ _ (i)_ above,
Company shall be deemed to have assumed responsibility for all of the costs
and expenses attributable to the Remediation of the Environmental Defect and
all Liabilities with respect thereto and such responsibility of Company shall
be deemed to constitute part of the Assumed Obligations hereunder.
If Contributors fail to make any of the foregoing elections at least two (2)
Business Days prior to Closing, Contributors will be deemed to have elected
the remedy set forth in _Section_ __ _ 13.1(c)(i)_.

 

(d) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for Companys remedy for a breach of
Contributors representation contained in _Section_ __ _ 4.15_ or the
corresponding representation in Contributors Certificates (subject to the
proviso in _Section_ __ _ 13.1(a)_) and Companys rights to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 15.1(a)_, and without limiting
Companys right to indemnity in respect of the Specified Obligations, the
provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 13.1(c)_ shall be the exclusive
right and remedy of Company and Parent with respect to any Environmental
Defect affecting any Asset.

 

(e) _Environmental Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the
Consideration for any individual Environmental Defect for which the
Remediation Amount does not exceed $75,000 (the "Individual Environmental
Threshold"); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the
Consideration for any Environmental Defect for which the Remediation Amount
exceeds the Individual Environmental Threshold unless (A) the amount of the
sum of (1) the aggregate Remediation Amounts of all such Environmental
Defects that exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold (but excluding any
Environmental Defects cured by Contributors), plus (2) the aggregate Title
Defect Amounts of all Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title Defect
Threshold (but excluding any Title Defects cured by Contributors) _less_ the
aggregate Title Benefit Amounts of all Title Benefits that exceed the
Individual Title Defect Threshold, exceeds (B) the Aggregate Deductible, after
which point Company shall be entitled to adjustments to the Consideration,
but only with respect to the amount by which the aggregate amount of such
Remediation Amounts and Title Defect Amounts exceeds the Aggregate Deductible.
For the avoidance of doubt, if Contributors retain any Assets pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 13.1(c)(ii)_, the Remediation Amounts relating to such
retained Assets will not count towards the Aggregate Deductible and the
Consideration will be reduced by the Allocated Value of such retained
Environmental Defect (and associated Assets) without regard to the Aggregate
Deductible.

 

(f) _Environmental Dispute Resolution_. Contributors and Company shall
attempt to agree in writing on all Environmental Defects and Remediation
Amounts prior to Closing. If Contributors and Company are unable to agree by
Closing, the Environmental Defects and/or Remediation Amounts in dispute shall
be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration 

 



66  pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 13.1(f)_. There shall be a single
arbitrator, who shall be an environmental attorney with at least fifteen (15)
years experience in environmental matters involving oil and gas producing
properties in the regional area in which the affected Assets are located, as
selected by mutual agreement of Company and Contributors within fifteen (15)
days after the Closing Date and absent such agreement, by the Houston, Texas
office of the AAA (the "Environmental Arbitrator"). Each of Company and
Contributors shall submit to the Environmental Arbitrator their proposed
resolution of each Environmental Defect and Remediation Amount in writing.
The proposed resolution shall include the best offer of the submitting Party
in a single monetary amount that such Party is willing to pay or accept (as
applicable) as the Remediation Amount for each Environmental Defect. The
arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted
in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA, to the extent
such rules do not conflict with the terms of this  _Section_ __ _ 13.1_. The
Environmental Arbitrators determination shall be made within thirty (30) days
after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon
the Parties, without right of appeal. In making its determination, the
Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 13.1_ and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other
matters as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary or
helpful to make a proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act
as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed
Environmental Defects and Remediation Amounts submitted by either Party and
may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to
any matter. The costs of the Environmental Arbitrator shall be borne equally
between the Parties. To the extent that the award of the Environmental
Arbitrator with respect to any Remediation Amount is not taken into account
as an adjustment to the Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ __ or
_Section_ __ _ 3.4_, then, within ten (10) days after the Environmental
Arbitrator delivers written notice to Company and Contributors of his award
with respect to any disputed Environmental Defects and/or Remediation Amounts
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 13.1(f)_, and subject to  _Section_ __ _
13.1(e)_, Company shall, after giving effect to the limitations provided in
this _Section_ __ _ 13.1_ (without duplication), deliver to Contributors from
the Defect Holdback Amount, an amount equal to the sum of the Remediation
Amounts associated with (x) those Environmental Defects which Contributors
elected to cure pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 13.1(b)_ which are not subject to
an unresolved disputed Environmental Defect and/or Remediation Amounts
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 13.1(f)_ and which are fully cured as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 13.1(b),_ and (y) any disputed Environmental
Defects and/or Remediation Amounts determined in favor of Contributors
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 13.1_, and Company and Parent shall not be
required to issue the remainder of the Defect Holdback Amount, after giving
effect to  _Section_ __ _ 12.2(j)_. All amounts paid pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 13.1_ shall be made by issuing to the Contributors (1) an
aggregate number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock and/or Parent Class
B Common Stock (allocated in accordance with the Contributors Representative
Allocation) (rounded down to the nearest number of whole shares) calculated by
dividing (x) such amounts by (y) $10.00, and (2) a number of Company Units
equal to the number of shares of Parent Class B Common Stock determined in
clause (1) above. For clarity, in no event shall Company or Parent be required
to issue aggregate Company Units, Parent Class A Common Stock, or Parent
Class B Common Stock pursuant to the preceding sentence in excess of the
Defect Holdback Amount. Nothing herein shall operate to cause Closing to be
delayed on account of any unresolved dispute involving Environmental Defects
and/or Remediation Amounts or any arbitration conducted pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 13.1(f)_, and to the extent any adjustments are not agreed
upon by the Parties in writing as of Closing, the Consideration shall not be
adjusted therefor at Closing, and subsequent adjustments to the
Consideration, if any, will be made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ or this
_Section_ __ _ 13.1(f)_.

 



67 13.2 _NORM, Asbestos, Wastes, and Other Substances_. Company and Parent
acknowledge that (a) the Assets have been used for exploration, development,
and production of oil and gas and that there may be petroleum, produced water,
wastes, or other substances or materials located in, on or under the Assets
or associated with the Assets; (b) NORM may affix or attach itself to the
inside of wells, materials, and equipment as scale, or in other forms; (c) the
wells, materials, and equipment located on the Assets or included in the
Assets may contain NORM, asbestos, and other wastes or Hazardous Substances;
(d) NORM containing material and other wastes or Hazardous Substances may have
come in contact with various environmental media, including, water, soils, or
sediment; (e) special procedures may be required for the assessment,
remediation, removal, transportation, or disposal of environmental media,
wastes, asbestos, NORM, and other Hazardous Substances from the Assets; and
(f) notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the presence of NORM or
asbestos-containing materials cannot be claimed as an Environmental Defect,
except to the extent constituting a violation of Environmental Laws.

(a) _In General_. For purposes of _Section_ __ _ 6.3_,  _Section_ __ _
11.1(c),_ and this _Article_ __ _ XIV_, the term "Indemnifying Party" when
used in connection with particular Liabilities shall mean the Party having an
obligation to indemnify any Contributor Indemnified Party or Company
Indemnified Party, as applicable, with respect to such Liabilities pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_, _Section_ __ _ 11.1(c)_ or this _Article_ __ _
XIV_, and the term "Indemnified Party" when used in connection with
particular Liabilities shall mean the Contributor Indemnified Party or Company
Indemnified Party, as applicable, having the right to be indemnified with
respect to such Liabilities by Company or Contributors, as applicable,
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, _Section_ __ _ 11.1(c)_ or this _Article_
__ _ XIV_.

 

(b) _Claims Procedure_. To make a claim for indemnification under
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_,  _Section_ __ _ 11.1(c)_, ___Section_ __ _ 14.2_ or
_Section_ __ _ 14.3_, an Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying
Party of its claim under this  _Section_ __ _ 14.7_, including the specific
details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the "Claim
Notice"). In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a
claim by a Third Party against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim"),
the Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the
Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Third Party Claim and shall
enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Third Party
Claim; _provided_ that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice of
a Third Party Claim as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 14.7(b)_ shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.3_,
_Section_ __ _ 11.1(c)_, ___Section_ __ _ 14.2_ or _Section_ __ _ 14.3_ (as
applicable) except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time
being available to permit the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against
the Third Party Claim or otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying
Partys ability to defend against the Third Party Claim. In the event that
the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Indemnified Party shall
provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual
knowledge of such inaccuracy or breach and shall specify the representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or breached.

 



72 (c) _Third Party Claims_.

 

(i) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt
of the Claim Notice relating thereto to notify the Indemnified Party whether
it admits or denies its Liability to defend the Indemnified Party against such
Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) day
period (or, if earlier, until the Indemnifying Party admits its Liability to
defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim) to file any
motion, answer, or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate
to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not
prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

 

(ii) If the Indemnifying Party admits its Liability to defend the
Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, it shall have the right and
obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Indemnified
Party against such Third Party Claim, and shall have full control of such
defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If
requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate
in contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to
contest. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, at its
own expense, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by
the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 14.7(c_ _)(_ _ii)_. An
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified
Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
(A) settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect thereto which does not include an unconditional written release
of the Indemnified Party from all Liability in respect of such Third Party
Claim or (B) settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect thereto in any manner that may materially and adversely
affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money damages covered
by the indemnity hereunder).

(iii) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its Liability against a
Third Party Claim or admits its Liability to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, but fails to diligently prosecute, indemnify
against or settle the Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to defend against and settle the Third Party Claim at the sole
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (if the Indemnifying Party is
determined to have indemnification Liability with respect to such matter),
with counsel of the Indemnified Partys choosing, subject to the right of the
Indemnifying Party to admit its Liability and assume the defense of the Third
Party Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof.
If the Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its Liability to defend the
Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and
the Indemnifying Party shall have the option for ten (10) days following
receipt of such notice to (A) admit in writing its Liability to indemnify the
Indemnified Party from and against the Liability and if Liability is so
admitted, either (1) consent to such settlement or (2) reject, in its
reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement or (B) deny Liability. Any
failure by the Indemnifying Party to respond to such notice shall be deemed to
be an election under _subsection (B)_ above.

(d) _Direct Claims_. In the case of a claim for indemnification not based
upon a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days
after its receipt of the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Liabilities complained
of, (ii) admit its Liability for such Liability, or (iii) dispute the claim
for such Liabilities. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the
Indemnified Party within such thirty (30) day period that it has cured the
Liabilities or that it disputes the claim for such Liabilities, the
Indemnifying Party shall conclusively be deemed to have denied Liability with
respect to such matter.

 



73 (e) For the avoidance of doubt, any and all payments required to be
made by the Parties pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ XIV_ shall be made in
United States currency by wire transfer of immediately available funds within
three (3) Business Days after the date on which such Party becomes obligated
to make such payment pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the event Contributors are obligated pursuant to this _Article_ __ _
XIV_ to make payments, then Contributors, at their option, may elect to make
all or a part of such payments by surrendering to Company or Parent, as
applicable, for cancellation (1) an aggregate number of Parent Class A Common
Stock and/or Parent Class B Common Stock (with the allocation between
Parent Class A Common Stock and Parent Class B Common Stock being determined
by the Contributors Representative at the time of such election) (rounded
down to the nearest number of whole shares) calculated by dividing (x) the
amount of such payment by (y) the VWAP for one share of Parent Class A Common
Stock for the 10 Trading Days ending immediately prior such payment date, and
(2) a number of Company Units equal to the number of shares of Parent Class
B Common Stock so surrendered. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Parent and Company shall have the right to setoff against,
offset, recoup, or withhold from the Earnout Payments, if payable, in respect
of Contributors indemnification obligations hereunder (1) an aggregate
number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock and/or Parent Class B Common
Stock (and Company Units) (with the allocation between Parent Class A Common
Stock and Parent Class B Common Stock being proportionate with the Earnout
Payments otherwise payable without application of this sentence) (rounded down
to the nearest number of whole shares) calculated by dividing (x) the amount
of such indemnification payment by (y) the VWAP for one share of Parent Class
A Common Stock for the 10 Trading Days ending immediately prior such payment
date, and (2) a number of Company Units equal to the number of shares of
Parent Class B Common Stock so surrendered, if any.

pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 16.2(f)_ (the "Entitled Party"), such
Recipient Party shall forward to the Entitled Party the amount of such refund
within thirty (30) days after such refund is received, net of any costs
or expenses incurred by such Recipient Party in procuring such refund.

(g) All required documentary, filing, and recording fees and expenses in
connection with the filing and recording of the assignments, conveyances, or
other instruments required to convey title to the Assets to Company shall be
borne by Company. To the extent that any sales, use, transfer (including real
property transfer or gains), stamp, documentary, filing, recordation or
similar Taxes are incurred or imposed with respect to the transactions
described in this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), such Transfer
Taxes shall be borne by Company. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to
minimize, to the extent possible under applicable Laws, the amount of any such
Transfer Taxes. Each Party will provide and make available to each other Party
any resale certificates and other exemption certificates or information
reasonably requested by such other Party. Any Tax Returns that must be filed
with respect to Transfer Taxes shall be

 



79  prepared and filed when due by the Party primarily or customarily
responsible under the applicable local Laws for filing such Tax Returns, and
such Party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide drafts of
such Tax Returns to the other Parties least ten (10) days prior to the
expected filing date for such Tax Returns.

 

(h) The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
and any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes relating
to the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon another
Partys reasonable request) the provision of records and information that are
relevant to any such Tax Return or audit, litigation, or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided under
this Agreement. The Parties agree to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Assets relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the respective taxable periods and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority.

 

(i) Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
otherwise payable or deliverable to Contributors hereunder such amounts as
may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code, under any
Tax Law or pursuant to any other applicable Laws ___provided_ , _however_ ,
that Company shall provide at least ten (10) Business Days written notice to
Contributors if Company intends to withhold any amounts under this _Section_
__ _ 16.2(_ _i_ _)_. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid absent such
deduction or withholding.

 

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Contributors shall retain responsibility for, and shall bear and pay, all
Income Taxes incurred by or imposed on Contributors with respect to any period
prior to or including the Closing Date, any of their direct or indirect owners
or Affiliates, or any combined, unitary or consolidated group of which any of
the foregoing is or was a member, and no such Taxes shall be taken into
account as adjustments to the Consideration under _Section_ __ _ 3.2_.

 

16.3 _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned, in whole or in
part, by either Party without prior written consent of the other Party;
_provided_ that (x) each of Parent and Company shall have the right to assign
this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any Affiliate and (y) each of Parent
and Company may, after the Closing Date, collaterally assign its rights under
this Agreement to any Financing Source without the prior written consent of
the other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment shall
relieve Parent or the Company of their respective obligations under this
Agreement; _provided_ further that EV XIV-C shall have the right to assign a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement prior to Closing to
an Affiliate so long as such Affiliate agrees in writing to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement in all respects as a Contributor hereunder, and
provided that no such assignment shall relieve EV XIV-C of its obligations
under this Agreement (it being understood that EV XIV-C shall reasonably
consult with Parent and Company (A) regarding any restructuring related to any
such proposed assignment and (B) prior to initiating communications with the
limited partners of EV XIV-C in connection with any such restructuring). In
the event the non-assigning Party consents to any such assignment, 

 



80  or Parent or Company assigns this Agreement to an Affiliate, such assignment
shall not relieve the assigning Party of any obligations and responsibilities
hereunder, including obligations and responsibilities arising following such
assignment.

16.4 _Preparation of Agreemen_ _t_. Each Party and its counsel
participated in the preparation of this Agreement. In the event of any
ambiguity in this Agreement, no presumption shall arise based on the identity
of the draftsman of this Agreement.

will consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the

AND SCHEDULES HERETO, THE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT, AND THE TRANSACTION

PERTAINING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF AND SUPERSEDE ALL PRIOR AGREEMENTS,
UNDERSTANDINGS, NEGOTIATIONS, AND DISCUSSIONS, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OF THE
PARTIES PERTAINING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF. THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES,
REPRESENTATIONS, OR OTHER AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES RELATING TO THE
SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT,
CONTRIBUTORS CERTIFICATES, OR THE COMPANYS CERTIFICATE, AND NEITHER
CONTRIBUTORS, COMPANY NOR PARENT SHALL BE BOUND BY OR LIABLE FOR ANY
ALLEGED REPRESENTATION, PROMISE, INDUCEMENT, OR STATEMENTS OF INTENTION NOT
SO SET FORTH. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF ANY SCHEDULE OR EXHIBIT HERETO,
THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL GOVERN AND CONTROL;
_PROVIDED_ , ___HOWEVER_ , THAT THE INCLUSION IN ANY OF THE SCHEDULES AND
EXHIBITS HERETO OF TERMS AND PROVISIONS NOT ADDRESSED IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL
NOT BE DEEMED A CONFLICT, AND ALL SUCH ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS SHALL BE GIVEN
FULL FORCE AND EFFECT, SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS _SECTION_ __ _
16.9_.

 

16.10 _Parties in Interest_. The terms and provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Contributors, Parent and
Company, and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any Person
other than the Parties or their successors and permitted assigns or the
Parties respective related Indemnified Parties hereunder any rights,
remedies, obligations, or Liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement; 
_provided_ that only a Party and its successors and assigns will have the
right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement on its own behalf or on
behalf of any of its related Indemnified Parties (but shall not be obligated
to do so). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Financing Sources (and solely
in the case of this _Section_ __ _ 16.10_, _Section_ __ _ 16.13_ and
_Section_ __ _ 16.22_, the Financing Persons) shall be express third party
beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to enforce, this _Section_ __ _
16.10_, _Section_ __ _ 16.11_, _Section_ __ _ 16.12_, _Section_ __ _
16.13,_ and  _Section_ __ _ 16.22_.

16.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended only by an instrument in
writing executed by the Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , (x) following the
receipt of Stockholder Approval, no amendment shall be made which by Law would
require the further approval by the stockholders of Parent without first
obtaining such further approval and (y) _ Section_ __ _ 16.10_, this
_Section_ __ _ 16.11_, _Section_ __ _ 16.12_, _Section_ __ _ 16.13_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 16.22_ (and any related definitions that would affect these
sections) may not be amended in a manner that adversely impacts any Financing
Person without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

 



83 16.12 _Waiver; Rights Cumulative_. Any of the terms, covenants,
representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only by a
written instrument executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving compliance;
provided, however, that any waiver of _Section 16.10,_  _Section 16.11,_
this Section 16.12, _Section_ __ _ 16.13_ and _Section_ __ _ 16.22_ (and any
related definitions that would affect these sections) may not be given without
the prior written consent of the Financing Sources if such waiver would
adversely impact any Financing Person. No course of dealing on the part of
Contributors, Parent, or Company or their respective officers, employees,
agents, or representatives and no failure by Contributors, Parent or Company
to exercise any of their rights under this Agreement shall, in each case,
operate as a waiver thereof or affect in any way the right of such Party at a
later time to enforce the performance of such provision. No waiver by any
Party of any condition, or any breach of any term, covenant, representation,
or warranty contained in this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall
be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any
such condition or breach or a waiver of any other condition or of any breach
of any other term, covenant, representation, or warranty. The rights of
Contributors and Company under this Agreement shall be cumulative, and the
exercise or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude the
exercise of any other right.

NEW YORK OR ANY COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SITTING IN THE BOROUGH OF
MANHATTAN IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK, AND AGREE THAT THE WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL SET
FORTH IN THIS _SECTION 6.13_ SHALL BE APPLICABLE TO ANY SUCH PROCEEDING. THE
PARTIES FURTHER AGREE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THAT A FINAL AND
NONAPPEALABLE JUDGMENT AGAINST A PARTY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING
CONTEMPLATED ABOVE SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY OTHER
JURISDICTION WITHIN OR OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT,
A CERTIFIED OR EXEMPLIFIED COPY OF WHICH SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF THE
FACT AND AMOUNT OF SUCH JUDGMENT.

 

(c) TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY PARTY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS ACQUIRED, OR
HEREAFTER MAY ACQUIRE, ANY IMMUNITY FROM JURISDICTION OF ANY COURT OR FROM
ANY LEGAL PROCESS (WHETHER THROUGH SERVICE OR NOTICE, ATTACHMENT PRIOR TO
JUDGMENT, ATTACHMENT IN AID OF EXECUTION, EXECUTION, OR OTHERWISE) WITH

DEBT FINANCING CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

 



85 16.14 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any adverse manner to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

16.15 _Removal of Name_. As promptly as practicable, but in any case
within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Company shall, at its sole
cost and expense, eliminate the name "EnerVest" and any variants thereof from
the Assets and, except with respect to such grace period for eliminating
existing usage, shall have no right to use any logos, trademarks, or trade
names belonging to Contributors or any of their respective Affiliates.

 

16.16 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, and each such counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an
original instrument, but all of such counterparts shall constitute for all
purposes one agreement. Any signature hereto delivered by a Party by facsimile
or other electronic transmission shall be deemed an original signature
hereto. No Party shall be bound until such time as all of the Parties have
executed counterparts of this Agreement.

 

16.17 _Specific Performance_. Each Party hereby acknowledges and agrees
that the rights of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby are special, unique, and of extraordinary character and that, if any
Party violates or fails or refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made
by it herein, the non-breaching Party may be without an adequate remedy at
Law. If any Party violates or fails or refuses to perform any covenant or
agreement made by such Party herein to be performed, including any obligation
to consummate the Closing, the non-breaching Party, subject to the terms
hereof and in addition to any remedy at Law for damages or other relief
permitted under this Agreement, may institute and prosecute an action in any
court of competent jurisdiction to enforce specific performance of such
covenant or agreement or seek any other equitable relief, without the
necessity of proving actual damages or posting of a bond.

 

16.18 _Joint and Several_ _Liability_. For clarity, and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Contributor shall be jointly
and severally liable for all duties, obligations and Liabilities of each other
Contributor under this Agreement and the Transaction Documents, except that
the Fund Contributors (collectively), on the one part, EV XIV-2A, on the
second part, and EV-XIV-3A, on the third part, will be severally, and
not jointly, liable for Contributors obligations hereunder based on the
ownership interests of each Contributor set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 16.18_
(the "Contributor Ownership Interests"), including obligations herein related
to Title Defects, Environmental Defects, and representations, warranties, and
covenants of the Contributors, in each case, with respect to which all
thresholds, deductibles, caps, and similar limitations herein shall be
reduced, and apply separately, for Fund Contributors (collectively), on the
one part, EV XIV-2A, on the second part, and EV-XIV-3A, on the third part, on
a pro rata basis based on the Contributor Ownership Interests; _provided_
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the determination of whether the
conditions to closing set forth in _Article_ __ _ VII_ and  _Article_ __ _
IX_ have been satisfied will be determined on a joint (and not several) basis
among the Contributors.

 



86 16.19 _Contributors  Representative_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, each Contributor hereby appoints EV XIV-A ("Contributors
Representative") to serve as its representative hereunder, and agrees
that Contributors Representative shall be authorized on such Contributors
behalf and be responsible hereunder, to, among other things, (a) deliver and
receive all notices, statements, reports, and other information given by or
addressed hereunder to Contributors, (b) receive all amounts payable
hereunder to Contributors, (c) make, on a joint basis, all elections that any
Contributor is entitled hereunder to make, and (d) otherwise perform (to the
extent practicable) all of the administrative obligations hereunder of the
Contributors. Moreover, Contributors Representative shall be responsible for
disbursing to the other Contributors their respective proportionate shares of
all amounts received hereunder by Contributors Representative on their
behalf. At any time a determination is to be made regarding an allocation
among the Contributors, including allocations between shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock and/or Parent Class B Common Stock, with respect to any payment,
issuance or surrender, (i) such allocation shall be made in good faith by the
Contributors Representative and (ii) such allocation shall be reflected in a
written instrument prepared by the Contributors Representative and delivered
to the Company and Parent (each a "Contributors Representative Allocation").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Contributors
Representative Allocation, each Contributor shall either receive all shares
of Parent Class A Common Stock or all shares of Parent Class B Common Stock
(together with a corresponding number of Company Units). The Company and
Parent shall be entitled to rely upon any Contributors Representative
Allocation for all purposes and shall have no Liability arising from or
relating to, and each Contributor hereby waives and releases the Company and
Parent for any and all claims, duties and Liabilities that the Company or
Parent have or may have in respect of, the use or reliance by the Company and
Parent upon any Contributors Representative Allocation. Additionally, the
Company and Parent shall not be obligated to make any payment or issuance to
the Contributors until the Company and Parent receive a Contributors
Representative Allocation with respect to such payment or issuance.

 

16.20 _No Recourse_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding the fact that Company may be a partnership or limited
liability company, Contributors, by their acceptance of the benefits of this
Agreement, covenant, agree and acknowledge that, except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement or any Transaction Document or in the case of
fraud, no Persons other than Parent, Company or any of their respective
Affiliates to whom this Agreement is validly assigned pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 16.3_ (and their respective successors and assigns, collectively, the
"Company Recourse Parties") shall have any obligation hereunder and that they
have no rights of recovery hereunder against, and no recourse hereunder or
under any Transaction Document or in respect of any oral representations made
or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith against (i) any
former, current, or future director, officer, agent, Affiliate, manager,
incorporator, controlling Person, fiduciary, representative, or employee of
Parent or Company (or any of the foregoing Persons successors or
permitted assignees), (ii) any former, current, or future general or limited
partner, owner, manager, stockholder, or member of Parent or Company (or any
of the foregoing Persons successors or permitted assignees) or any Affiliate
thereof, or (iii) any former, current, or future director, owner, officer,
agent, employee, Affiliate, manager, incorporator, controlling Person,
fiduciary, representative, general or limited partner, stockholder, manager,
or member of any of the foregoing, but, in each case, not including Parent,
Company or any of their respective Affiliates to whom this Agreement is
validly assigned pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 16.3_ (each, but excluding for
the

 



87  avoidance of doubt, the Company Recourse Parties, a "Company Party
Affiliate"), whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil,
by or through a claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) by or on
behalf of Parent or Company or any of their respective Affiliates to whom this
Agreement is validly assigned pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 16.3_ against the
Company Party Affiliates, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any
legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or
other Law, or otherwise; it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no
personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on, or otherwise be
incurred by any Company Party Affiliate, as such, for any obligations of
Parent or Company (or any of their respective Affiliates to whom this
Agreement is validly assigned pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 16.3_) under this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, under any Transaction
Document, in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith or therewith, or for any claim (whether in tort, contract
or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations, or
their creation.

(b) Notwithstanding the fact that each Contributor may be a partnership or
limited liability company, each of Company and Parent, by its acceptance of
the benefits of this Agreement, covenants, agrees, and acknowledges that,
except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any Transaction
Document or in the case of fraud, no Persons other than Contributors (and
their respective successors and assigns, collectively, the "Contributor
Recourse Parties") shall have any obligation hereunder and that it has no
rights of recovery hereunder against, and no recourse hereunder or under any
Transaction Document or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged
to be made in connection herewith or therewith against (i) any former,
current or future director, officer, agent, Affiliate, manager, incorporator,
controlling Person, fiduciary, representative, or employee of any Contributor
(or any of the foregoing Persons successors or permitted assignees), (ii) any
former, current, or future general or limited partner, owner, manager,
stockholder, or member of any Contributor (or any of the foregoing Persons
successors or permitted assignees) or any Affiliate thereof, or (iii) any
former, current, or future director, owner, officer, agent, employee,
Affiliate, manager, incorporator, controlling Person, fiduciary,
representative, general or limited partner, stockholder, manager, or member of
any of the foregoing, but, in each case, not including any Contributor (each,
but excluding for the avoidance of doubt, the Contributor Recourse Parties, a
"Contributor Party Affiliate"), whether by or through attempted piercing of
the corporate veil, by or through a claim (whether in tort, contract, or
otherwise) by or on behalf of any Contributor against the Contributor Party
Affiliates, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable
proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other Law, or
otherwise; it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal
liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on, or otherwise be incurred
by any Contributor Party Affiliate, as such, for any obligations of any
Contributor under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
under any Transaction Document, in respect of any oral representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, or for any claim
(whether in tort, contract, or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, such obligations or their creation.

16.21 _Trust Account Waiver_. Contributors acknowledge that Parent is a
blank check company with the powers and privileges to effect a Business
Combination. Contributors further acknowledge that substantially all of
Parents assets consist of the cash proceeds of Parents initial public
offering and private placements of its securities and substantially all of
those proceeds have been deposited in the Trust Account for the benefit of
Parent, certain of its public stockholders and 

 



88  the underwriters of Parents initial public offering. For and in
consideration of Parent and Company entering into this Agreement, the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Contributors hereby
irrevocably waives any right, title, interest, or claim of any kind they have
or may have in the future in or to any monies in the Trust Account and agrees
not to seek recourse against the Trust Account or any funds distributed
therefrom as a result of, or arising out of, this Agreement and any
negotiations, contracts, or agreements with Parent and Company; _provided_ ,
that (a) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit Contributors
right to pursue a claim against Company pursuant to this Agreement for legal
relief against monies or other assets of Company held outside the Trust
Account or, subject to _Section_ __ _ 16.17_, for specific performance or
other equitable relief in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby or for fraud and (b) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit
any claims that Contributors may have in the future pursuant to this Agreement
against Parents assets or funds that are not held in the Trust Account.

16.22 _Lenders_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Contributors agree, on behalf of themselves and their respective former,
current or future Affiliates, limited partners or other equityholders and
Representatives (collectively, the "Contributor Related Parties") that
neither the Contributors nor the Contributor Related Parties shall have any
claim against any Financing Person, nor shall any Financing Person have any
liability whatsoever to any Contributor Related Party, in connection with the
Debt Financing or in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether at law, in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, in each case, whether arising, in whole or in part, out of
comparative, contributory or sole negligence by any Financing Person.

16.23 _Time is of the Essence_. This Agreement contains a number of dates
and times by which performance or exercise of rights is due, and the Parties
intend that each and every such date and time be the firm and final date and
time, as agreed. For this reason, each Party hereby waives and relinquishes
any right it might otherwise have to challenge its failure to meet any
performance or rights election date and time applicable to it on the basis
