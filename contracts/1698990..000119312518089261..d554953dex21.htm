absent such agreement, by the Houston, Texas office of the AAA (the &#147;<B>Environmental Arbitrator</B>&#148;). Each of Company and Contributors shall submit to the Environmental Arbitrator their proposed resolution of each Environmental Defect
and Remediation Amount in writing. The proposed resolution shall include the best offer of the submitting Party in a single monetary amount that such Party is willing to pay or accept (as applicable) as the Remediation Amount for each Environmental
Defect. The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this
<U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;13.1</U>. The Environmental Arbitrator&#146;s determination shall be made within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal.
In making its determination, the Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;13.1</U> and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental
Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Environmental Defects and Remediation Amounts submitted by either
Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. The costs of the Environmental Arbitrator shall be borne equally between the Parties. To the extent that the award of the Environmental Arbitrator
with respect to any Remediation Amount is not taken into account as an adjustment to the Consideration pursuant to <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;3.3</U><I> </I>or <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;3.4</U>, then, within ten (10)&nbsp;days after the
Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to Company and Contributors of his award with respect to any disputed Environmental Defects and/or Remediation Amounts pursuant to this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;13.1(f)</U>, and subject to
<U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;13.1(e)</U>, Company shall, after giving effect to the limitations provided in this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;13.1</U> (without duplication), deliver to Contributors from the Defect Holdback Amount, an amount equal
to the sum of the Remediation Amounts associated with (x)&nbsp;those Environmental Defects which Contributors elected to cure pursuant to <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;13.1(b)</U> which are not subject to an unresolved disputed Environmental Defect
and/or Remediation Amounts pursuant to this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;13.1(f)</U> and which are fully cured as provided in <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;13.1(b),</U> and (y)&nbsp;any disputed Environmental Defects and/or Remediation Amounts
determined in favor of Contributors pursuant to this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;13.1</U>, and Company and Parent shall not be required to issue the remainder of the Defect Holdback Amount, after giving effect to
<U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;12.2(j)</U>. All amounts paid pursuant to this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;13.1</U> shall be made by issuing to the Contributors (1)&nbsp;an aggregate number of shares of Parent Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and/or Parent
Class&nbsp;B Common Stock (allocated in accordance with the Contributors&#146; Representative Allocation) (rounded down to the nearest number of whole shares) calculated by dividing (x)&nbsp;such amounts by (y) $10.00, and (2)&nbsp;a number of
Company Units equal to the number of shares of Parent Class&nbsp;B Common Stock determined in clause (1)&nbsp;above. For clarity, in no event shall Company or Parent be required to issue aggregate Company Units, Parent Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, or
Parent Class&nbsp;B Common Stock pursuant to the preceding sentence in excess of the Defect Holdback Amount. Nothing herein shall operate to cause Closing to be delayed on account of any unresolved dispute involving Environmental Defects and/or
Remediation Amounts or any arbitration conducted pursuant to this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;13.1(f)</U>, and to the extent any adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties in writing as of Closing, the Consideration shall not be adjusted
therefor at Closing, and subsequent adjustments to the Consideration, if any, will be made pursuant to <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;3.4</U> or this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;13.1(f)</U>. </P>
