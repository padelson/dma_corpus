time to allow their review and approval and completion of the items set forth
in such closing memorandum prior to the Closing Date. 

---|--- 

Purchase Price Adjustments \t\t

 \t\t\t. \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (h) \t\t\tNot more than seven (7) Business Days nor less than
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall deliver
to Buyer a statement showing the Sellers' good faith estimate of the Estimated
Working Capital, including the calculation thereof in reasonable detail
calculated using the same methodology as the calculation set forth on Schedule
1.4. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tPrior to the Closing on the Closing Date (at such time
as mutually agreed by Buyer and the Sellers or as otherwise dictated by
applicable Gaming Authorities), the Sellers shall conduct a cash count and the
drop of each Company's gaming device "hoppers" as well as a count of each
Company's liability for all outstanding chips, tokens, tickets and similar
cash equivalents ("Seller's Chips"). A Representative of Buyer may, subject
to applicable Gaming Laws, be present to observe such cash count, hopper drop
count, and Seller's Chips liability count if it so elects. Such cash count,
hopper drop, and Seller's Chips count shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Sellers and Buyer, absent manifest error, and shall be used in the preparation
of Closing Working Capital that is contained in the Post-Closing Statement (it
being understood that the aggregate value of all outstanding Seller's Chips
will constitute a current liability of such Company in connection with the
calculation of Closing Working Capital). Within three (3) Business Days after
the Closing Date, each Seller shall provide Buyer a list of all outstanding
such  \t\t
 Seller's Chips in sufficient detail for Buyer to determine the type, number,
and denomination of each of Seller's Chips. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (j) \t\t\tWithin forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date,
Buyer will prepare (or cause to be prepared) and deliver to the Sellers a
statement (the "Post-Closing Statement") showing Buyer's calculation of
Closing Working Capital, including the calculation thereof in reasonable
detail calculated using the same methodology as the calculation set forth on
Schedule 1.4. The parties acknowledge that the purpose of preparing the Post-
Closing Statement and determining the Closing Working Capital and the related
purchase price adjustment contemplated by this Section 1.4 is to measure
changes in the Adjusted Working Capital, and such processes are not intended
to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting methods,
policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or estimation
methodologies for the purpose of preparing the Post-Closing Statement or
determining Adjusted Working Capital. Buyer shall promptly provide to the
Sellers such backup or supporting data relating to the preparation of the
Post-Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital
reflected thereon as the Sellers may request. Buyer shall also provide the
Sellers and their Representatives with such reasonable access to the books,
records and personnel of each Purchased Company, at reasonable times and upon
reasonable notice, as the Sellers may request for the purposes of evaluating
the Post-Closing Statement and Buyer's calculation of Closing Working Capital. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (k) \t\t\tThe Sellers shall, within the forty-five (45) day period
(the "Acceptance Period") following receipt of such Post-Closing Statement,
notify Buyer of its acceptance or non‑acceptance (as the case may be) of the
Post-Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital
reflected thereon; provided, however, that in the event that any backup or
supporting data has been requested by the Sellers in accordance with Section
1.4(c) but not provided to the Sellers by the end of the Acceptance Period,
then the Acceptance Period shall automatically be extended until the date that
is ten (10) Business Days following the date such backup or supporting data is
received by the Sellers. If no such notice is delivered to Buyer by the
Sellers within the Acceptance Period, the Post-Closing Statement and the
calculation of Closing Working Capital reflected thereon shall be deemed to
have been accepted by the Sellers and shall be binding thereon for all
purposes of this Agreement. If the Post-Closing Statement and the calculation
of Closing Working Capital reflected thereon are accepted or deemed to have
been accepted by the Sellers, then payment of any related amounts, as
contemplated by this Section 1.4(d), shall be made pursuant to Section 1.4(f).
If the Sellers give notice (a "Dispute Notice") to Buyer within the Acceptance
Period that the Sellers do not agree with or otherwise do not accept the
calculation of Closing Working Capital reflected on the Post-Closing
Statement, the Sellers shall describe in such Dispute Notice the nature of any
disagreement so asserted. Buyer and the Sellers shall endeavor in good faith
to resolve all such disagreements within the thirty (30) day period (the
"Negotiating Period") following the delivery by the Sellers of such Dispute
Notice. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (l) \t\t\tIf Buyer and the Sellers are unable to resolve any
disagreements regarding the Post-Closing Statement and the calculations
reflected thereon within the Negotiating Period, then all such disputes shall
be promptly referred to a nationally recognized independent accounting firm as
is mutually acceptable to Buyer and the Sellers (the "Neutral Accounting
Firm"). The Neutral Accounting Firm shall be instructed only to resolve all
outstanding disagreements relating to the Post-Closing Statement and the
calculation of Closing Working Capital reflected thereon, and shall be
instructed not to otherwise investigate such matters independently or
introduce different judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles,
practices, procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies in
connection therewith. The Neutral Accounting Firm shall investigate only
those items that are in dispute and shall not assign a value to any item that
is (A) greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either of
Buyer or the Sellers or (B) lower than the lowest value for such item claimed
by either of Buyer or the Sellers. The Neutral Accounting Firm's
determination shall be based only upon written submissions by Buyer and the
Sellers, and not upon an independent review by the Neutral Accounting Firm.
The parties shall instruct the Neutral  \t\t
 Accounting Firm, acting as experts and not as arbitrators, to render its
determination within thirty (30) Business Days of the referral of such matter
thereto, and the determination of the Neutral Accounting Firm shall be final
and binding upon Buyer and the Sellers for all purposes of this Agreement.
Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Neutral Accounting Firm
in any court having jurisdiction over the party against which such
determination is to be enforced. Neither Buyer nor the Sellers shall have any
ex parte communications or meetings with the Neutral Accounting Firm without
the prior consent of Buyer (in the case of the Sellers) or the Sellers (in the
case of Buyer). The fees and expenses of the Neutral Accounting Firm shall be
borne one-half by Buyer, on the one hand, and one-half by the Sellers, on the
other hand. The fees and expenses of the Sellers and their respective
Representatives incurred in connection with the Post-Closing Statement and any
Dispute Notice shall be borne by the Sellers, and the fees and expenses of
Buyer and its Representatives in connection with the Post-Closing Statement
and any Dispute Notice shall be borne by Buyer. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (m) \t\t\tNo more than five (5) Business Days following the final
determination of Closing Working Capital, (A) if the finally determined
Closing Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Working Capital (such amount,
the "Actual Surplus"), then Buyer shall pay to the Sellers, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to such account or accounts as may be
designated by the Sellers to Buyer in writing, an amount equal to such Actual
Surplus, or (B) if the finally determined Closing Working Capital is less than
the Estimated Working Capital (such amount, the "Actual Deficiency"), then the
Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to such Actual Deficiency by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such account or accounts as may be
designated by Buyer to the Sellers in writing. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (n) \t\t\tFor the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed
that PropCo shall not be obligated to pay any amount or be subject to any
liability to Sellers, Buyer or any other Person with respect to the
calculation of Closing Working Capital as set forth in this Section 1.4 or for
any amounts to be paid to Buyer or Sellers as the Actual Surplus or Actual
Deficiency pursuant to Section 1.4(f). 

---|--- 

Allocation of Purchase Price \t\t

 \t\t\t. Within ninety (90) days following the final determination of
Closing Working Capital, Buyer shall deliver to the Sellers a schedule (the
"Allocation Schedule") allocating the Purchase Price among the assets of the
Purchased Companies and their Subsidiaries (including any Liabilities of the
Purchased Companies and their Subsidiaries properly taken into account as part
of the Purchase Price for U.S. federal income tax purposes) after giving
effect to the Real Estate Purchase (the "Proposed Allocation"). The
Allocation Schedule shall be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and the allocation of the Base
Purchase Price among the Company Interests as set forth in Schedule I attached
hereto. The Sellers shall accept and agree to the Proposed Allocation unless
any one or more of the Sellers, acting in good faith, object to the Allocation
Schedule, in which case such Seller or Sellers (as the case may be) shall,
within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of the Allocation Schedule,
deliver written notice to Buyer of such objection. Such notice shall specify
in reasonable detail the items in the Allocation Schedule to which the Sellers
object and the basis for such objection. If within such fifteen (15)-day
period the Sellers so notify Buyer, the Sellers and Buyer shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve the disputed matters. If the Sellers and Buyer are able
to resolve the disputed matters within thirty (30) days following Buyer's
receipt of the Sellers' notice of objection, the Sellers and Buyer shall
revise the Allocation Schedule to reflect such resolution, and the revised
Allocation Schedule shall be final and binding upon the parties to this
Agreement. Buyer and the Sellers agree to (a) be bound by any final and
binding Allocation Schedule established in accordance with this Section 1.5
(the "Final Allocation Schedule"), (b) act in accordance with the Final
Allocation Schedule in the filing of all Tax Returns and in the course of any
Tax audit, Tax examination or Tax litigation relating thereto, and (c) take no
position and cause their Affiliates to take no position inconsistent with the
Final Allocation Schedule for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by a
change in Law or pursuant to the good faith resolution of a Tax contest. If
the Sellers and Buyer fail to reach agreement despite their good faith efforts
within thirty (30) days following Buyer's receipt of the  \t\t Sellers' notice of objection, then the Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on
the other hand, shall each be entitled to determine in their sole discretion
the allocation of the Purchase Price among the assets of the Purchased
Companies and their Subsidiaries in any manner, and the Sellers, on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall have no liability to the other with
respect to such determination or allocation. \t\t

Withholding \t\t

 \t\t\t. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each
Acquiror shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted and
withheld) from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement or the Real
Estate Purchase Agreement such amounts as such Acquiror has reasonably
determined it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
any such payment under the Code or any applicable provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld,
such deducted and withheld amounts are to be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement and the Real Estate Purchase Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. As of the
date hereof and assuming that the Acquirors receive at or prior to the Closing
the documents described in Section 1.3(d)(v), no Acquiror is aware of any
withholding Taxes that may become due and payable in connection with the
Transactions. If an Acquiror intends to deduct or withhold any Tax as
required by Law from any payment made to the Sellers in connection with the
Transactions, such Acquiror shall (i) provide the Sellers at least five (5)
Business Days advance notice of its intent to withhold such amounts, (ii)
provide the legal basis for such withholding, (iii) provide a reasonable
opportunity for the Sellers or other recipient to provide forms, documents or
other evidence that would mitigate, reduce or eliminate such deduction or
withholding and (iv) use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the
Sellers or other recipient and the advisors thereof, as applicable, to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate such deduction or withholding; provided,
however, that if the Sellers have delivered to the Acquirors the Non-Foreign
Certificate, no Acquiror shall withhold from any payment hereunder any amounts
pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code. To the extent that any party deducts
and withholds any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, such party shall
provide reasonable evidence to the other parties of payment of such amounts to
the applicable Governmental Entity. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tBuyer represents and warrants to each of the Sellers, that the
following representations and warranties are true and correct as of the time
of the execution of this Agreement, except as set forth herein and in the

other sections of this Agreement to the extent it is reasonably apparent from
the face of the statement that it is applicable thereto): \t\t

Organization \t\t

 \t\t\t. Buyer is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing

and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted. Buyer is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each

nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing

Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents \t\t

 \t\t\t. \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tBuyer has all requisite power and authority to enter

equity. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tThe execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer
does not, and the consummation by Buyer of the Transactions to which it is
party will not, (i) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of,
any provision of the certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational document of Buyer, (ii) result in any violation or breach of,
or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) a default (or
give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
obligation or loss of any material benefit) under, or require a consent or
waiver under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease, Contract or obligation to which Buyer is a party
or by which it or any of its properties or assets may be bound, or (iii)
subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in Section
3.2(c), conflict with or violate any permit, concession, franchise, license,
judgment, or Law applicable to Buyer or any of its or their properties or
assets, except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) for any such conflicts,
violations, defaults, terminations, cancellations or accelerations that would
not materially impair or delay the Closing. |  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tNo consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required
by or with respect to Buyer in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Buyer or the consummation by Buyer of the Transactions,
except for (i) the filing of a pre-merger notification report under the HSR
Act, (ii) those required under the Gaming Laws (including all Gaming
Approvals), (iii) such petitions, consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
permits, filings, declarations or registrations related to, or arising out of,
compliance with statutes, rules or regulations regulating the consumption,
sale or serving of alcoholic beverages or tobacco or the renaming or
rebranding of the operations at the Properties, (iv) such other filings,
consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, permits, registrations and
declarations as may be required under the Laws of any jurisdiction in which
Buyer conducts any business or owns any assets, the failure of which to make
or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to
materially impair or materially delay the Closing, (v) such filings as
necessary to comply with the applicable requirements of any applicable federal
or state securities or "blue sky" laws and (vi) any petitions, consents,
approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, permits, declarations or

Brokers \t\t

 \t\t\t. Neither Buyer nor any of its Representatives has employed any
broker, financial advisor or finder other than Stifel Financial Corp., the
fees and expenses of which will be paid by Buyer. \t\t

Capital Resources \t\t

 \t\t\t. Buyer will have on the Closing Date internal funds or available
lines of credit currently in place in an amount sufficient to satisfy all of
its obligations under this Agreement, including payment of the Purchase Price
and all associated costs and expenses (including all costs and expenses
necessary to obtain all Governmental Approvals and Gaming Approvals required
to consummate the Transactions); provided, however, that it shall not be a
condition precedent to the Closing in favor of Buyer that Buyer have obtained
any financing and the only conditions precedent to the Closing are set forth
in Article VI. \t\t

Licensability \t\t

 \t\t\t. Neither Buyer, nor, to its knowledge, any of its officers,
directors, managers, members, stockholders, principals or controlled
Affiliates that may reasonably be considered in the process of determining the
suitability of Buyer (any such Persons, including Buyer, the "Buyer Licensing
Affiliates") has ever had an application for a Gaming Approval be denied,
terminated, suspended, limited, revoked or withdrawn with prejudice by a
Governmental Entity or Gaming Authority. Buyer and each of its Licensing
Affiliates that are licensed (collectively, the "Buyer Licensed Parties") are
in good standing with the Gaming Authority in each of the jurisdictions in
which the Buyer Licensed Parties own or operate gaming facilities. Buyer
represents that there are no facts, that if known to a Gaming Authority would,
under the Gaming Laws, (a) be reasonably likely to result in the denial,
revocation, limitation or suspension of a Gaming Approval or license, or (b)
result in a negative outcome to any finding of suitability investigation
currently pending, or under the suitability investigation of any of the Buyer
Licensed Parties necessary for the consummation of this Agreement. \t\t

Compliance with Gaming Laws \t\t

 \t\t\t. \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tBuyer, and, to Buyer's knowledge, each of the Buyer
Licensed Parties, holds all permits, registrations, findings of suitability,
licenses, variances, exemptions, certificates of occupancy, orders and
approvals of all Governmental Entities, including under the Gaming Laws,
necessary to conduct the business and operations of Buyer, each of which is in
full force and effect in all material respects (the "Buyer Permits"), except
for such Buyer Permits, the failure of which to hold would not, individually
or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to materially impair or materially
delay the Closing. No event has occurred that permits, or upon the giving of
notice or passage of time or both would permit, revocation, non-renewal,
modification, suspension, limitation or termination of any Buyer Permit that
currently is in  \t\t
 effect, other than such Buyer Permits, the revocation, non-renewal,
modification, suspension, limitation or termination of which, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to materially
impair or materially delay the Closing. Buyer, and, to the knowledge of
Buyer, each of the Buyer Licensed Parties is in compliance with the terms of
the Buyer Permits, except for such failures to comply, that, individually or
in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to materially impair or
materially delay the Closing. Neither Buyer nor, to Buyer's knowledge, any of
its Buyer Licensing Affiliates, has received a written notice of any
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity under any Gaming Law with
respect to Buyer or any of its Buyer Licensing Affiliates that is pending,
and, to the knowledge of Buyer, no investigation or review is threatened, nor
has any Governmental Entity indicated in writing any intention to conduct the
same, other than those the outcome of which would not be reasonably likely to
materially impair or materially delay the Closing. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tNone of Buyer or, to Buyer's knowledge, any Licensing
Affiliate, has received any written claim, demand, notice, complaint, court
order or administrative order from any Governmental Entity in the past three
(3) years under, or relating to any violation or possible violation of any
Gaming Laws other than as would not be reasonably likely, individually or in
the aggregate, to materially impair or materially delay the Closing. To the
knowledge of Buyer, there are no facts applicable to Buyer or the Buyer
Licensed Parties that if known to the Gaming Authorities could, under the
Gaming Laws, reasonably be likely to materially impair or materially delay the
Closing. 

---|--- 

Litigation \t\t

 \t\t\t. There are no actions, claims, suits or legal, administrative or
arbitratorial proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened
against Buyer before any Governmental Entity, that, if determined adversely,
be reasonably likely to (a) materially and adversely affect Buyer's
performance under this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions or
(b) seek to materially impair or materially delay the Closing. \t\t

No Implied Representations \t\t

 \t\t\t. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, (i) except as expressly set
forth in Article II, none of the Sellers, nor any of their respective
subsidiaries, Affiliates, Representatives or purported Representatives has
made, representations or warranties pertaining to the businesses or properties
of the Companies or the Sellers, or any part thereof and (ii) all other
representations and warranties of any kind or nature are specifically
disclaimed and Buyer did not rely on any representation or warranty not
contained in Article II or any certificate delivered by the Companies or any
officer thereof pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof when making its decision to
enter into this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no Seller
(a) has made any representations or warranties with respect to financial
projections, financial models or forecasts regarding the Companies or (b) is
making any implied warranty or representation as to condition, merchantability
or suitability as to any of the assets or properties of the Companies. The
Sellers hereby acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Section 3.8 will
limit in any way the representations and warranties of the Sellers made in
Article II or Buyer's rights to indemnification or other remedies for any
breach of the same as contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 3.8 shall limit any
rights or remedies of Buyer in the case of Fraud by any Seller. \t\t

No Distribution \t\t

 \t\t\t. The Company Interests being acquired by Buyer hereunder are being
acquired for Buyer's own account, for investment only and not with a view to
any public distribution thereof, and Buyer shall not offer to sell or
otherwise dispose of the Company Interests so acquired by it in violation of
any of the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. Buyer acknowledges that the Sellers have
informed it that the Company Interests have not been registered under the
Securities Act and may not be sold until they have been registered or an
exemption from such registration is available. \t\t  \t\t\t. Buyer has such knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment as contemplated by this Agreement and the related documents to
which it is a party, and is able to bear the economic risk of such investment
for an indefinite period of time. Buyer has been furnished access to such
information and documents as it has requested and has been afforded an
opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from Representatives of
the Sellers concerning the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
related documents to which it is a party and the purchase of the Company
Interests contemplated hereby. Buyer is an "accredited investor" within the
meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. \t\t

 \t\t\t. \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tFor a period of not less than three (3) months following
the Closing (the "Continuation Period"), Buyer shall, or shall cause one of
its Subsidiaries (including the Purchased Companies) to, provide each employee
of a Purchased Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries as of
immediately prior to the Closing who remains employed by a Purchased Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries immediately following the Closing
(each, a "Continuing Employee") with compensation and employee benefits that
are no less favorable in the aggregate than those for which the applicable
Continuing Employee was receiving from Parent, the Sellers or their
Affiliates, or any Purchased Company or any of their respective Affiliates
immediately prior to the Closing. Nothing herein shall require the Acquirors
or their respective Subsidiaries to retain the services of any particular
individual for any particular length of time, including for a period of three
(3) months after Closing. A Continuing Employee's employment may be
terminated at any time for any reason or no reason. Continuing Employees will
receive compensation and benefits as described herein only for the portion of
the Continuation Period the Continuing Employee remains employed. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tTo the extent permitted by applicable Law and allowed
under Buyer's and its Subsidiaries' plans, programs, policies and
arrangements, Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall provide credit for each
Continuing Employee's length of service with the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates for all purposes (including eligibility and vesting) under each
plan, program, policy or arrangement of Buyer and its Subsidiaries to the same
extent such service was recognized under a similar plan, program, policy or
arrangement of the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates, except that
such prior service credit shall not be required to the extent that it results
in a duplication of benefits. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (g) \t\t\tTo the extent permitted by applicable Law and allowed
under Buyer and its Subsidiaries' plans, programs, policies and arrangements,
Buyer shall cause each benefit plan of Buyer and its Subsidiaries in which any
Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible to participate that is a health or
welfare benefit plan (collectively, "Buyer Welfare Plans") to (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and service conditions
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
Continuing Employees, other than limitations that were in effect with respect
to such Continuing Employees as of the Closing Date under the corresponding
plans of the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) honor any
payments, charges and expenses of such Continuing Employees (and their
eligible dependents) that were applied toward the deductible and out-of-pocket
maximums under the corresponding plans of the Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates in satisfying any applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket
maximums or co-payments under a corresponding Buyer Welfare Plan during the
same plan year in which such payments, charges and expenses were made, and
(iii) with respect to any medical plan, waive any waiting period limitation or
evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a
Continuing Employee to the extent such employee had satisfied any similar
limitation under the corresponding plan of the Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates. |  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (h) \t\t\tTo the extent permitted by applicable Law and allowed
under Buyer and its Subsidiaries' plans, programs, policies and arrangements,
Buyer or its Subsidiaries shall cover each Continuing Employee who has elected
to participate in a flexible spending account plan maintained by the Sellers
or one of their respective Affiliates for the plan year during which the
Closing occurs ("Seller's FSA") under a flexible spending account plan
maintained by Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries ("Buyer's FSA") at the same
level of coverage elected under Seller's FSA. Each Continuing Employee shall
be treated as if his or her participation in Buyer's FSA had been continuous
from the beginning of the plan year under Seller's FSA in which the Closing
occurs and each existing salary reduction election shall be taken into account
for the remainder of the plan year under Buyer's FSA in which the Closing
occurs, as if made under Buyer's FSA. Buyer's FSA shall provide reimbursement
for medical care expenses and dependent care expenses incurred by Continuing
Employees at any time during the plan year under Seller's FSA in which the
Closing occurs (including claims incurred before the Closing), up to the
amount of such Continuing Employees' elections and reduced by amounts
previously reimbursed by Seller's FSA. Within 30 days following the Closing
Date, the Sellers shall (i) provide to Buyer an accounting of the amounts
elected, deducted and paid in respect of claims under Seller's FSA in respect
of the Continuing Employees during the plan year in which the Closing occurs
and before the Closing and (ii) pay to Buyer the net amount, if any, of the
excess of the aggregate amount deducted over the aggregate amount paid in
respect of claims under Seller's FSA in respect of each Continuing Employee
during the plan year in which the Closing occurs (or, if amounts paid in
respect of claims under Seller's FSA exceeded amounts deducted in respect of
each Continuing Employee during the plan year in which the Closing occurs,
then Buyer shall instead pay to the Sellers such net excess). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tEffective as of the Closing, Buyer and its Subsidiaries
shall assume and be responsible for (i) all Liabilities with respect to all
Continuing Employees and all current and former employees of each Company, and
all of their respective eligible dependents, in respect of the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended; (ii) all Liabilities
with respect to all Continuing Employees, all other current and former
employees of each Company, and all of their respective eligible dependents in
respect of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,
Sections 601, et seq. and Sections 701 et seq. of ERISA, Section 4980B and
Sections 9801 et seq. of the Code and applicable state or similar Laws; and
(iii) to the extent applicable, all Liabilities in respect of workers'
compensation benefits payable to or on behalf of the Continuing Employees, all
other current and former employees of each Company, and all of their
respective eligible dependents.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (j) \t\t\tUpon the Closing, Buyer or its applicable Subsidiary
shall abide by all legal obligations concerning any applicable Labor
Agreements. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (k) \t\t\tFollowing the Closing, Buyer and its Subsidiaries
(including the Purchased Companies) shall be solely responsible for complying
with the WARN Act with respect to Continuing Employees for time periods
following the Closing. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Closing, the Sellers shall notify Buyer of any employment loss experienced by
any employee of the Sellers, such Purchased Company or any of their respective
Affiliates at any relevant location during the ninety (90) days prior to the
Closing. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (l) \t\t\tNo provision of this Section 5.2 shall create any third
party beneficiary rights in any person, including any Parent employee,
Continuing Employee or other current or former service provider of the
Sellers, Acquirors or any of their respective Affiliates, any beneficiary or
dependent of any of the foregoing, or any collective bargaining representative
thereof, including with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of
employment or benefits that may be provided. In addition, nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to constitute an amendment or other modification of
any benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement of the Sellers, Acquirors or
any of their respective Affiliates, or shall  \t\t
 otherwise limit the right of the Sellers, Acquirors and their respective
Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any benefit plan, program,
policy or arrangement. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (m) \t\t\tFor the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, the Parties acknowledge that PropCo shall have no
liability or obligation whatsoever with respect to any Continuing Employee or
Company Benefit Plan.

such Inspection or the satisfaction of either Acquiror therewith be a

Sellers herein. Each Acquiror shall promptly discharge any mechanics' liens

with the Confidentiality Agreements; provided, however, that subsequent to

transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Law, each of
the Sellers and Buyer shall use their reasonable best efforts to avoid or
eliminate any impediment under the HSR Act or any antitrust, competition or
trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity or any
other Person with respect to the Closing so as to enable the Closing to occur
as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside
Date), including implementing, contesting or resisting any litigation before
any court or administrative tribunal seeking to restrain or enjoin the
Transactions. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
reasonable best efforts for purposes of this Section 5.4 shall not require
Buyer to litigate or defend any suit or proceeding brought by the Federal
Trade Commission or Department of Justice, whether judicial or administrative
except to the extent that there is a reasonable prospect of success in
relation to such litigation. Furthermore, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, neither of Buyer nor PropCo nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall have any obligation to take any action or refrain
from taking any action as required by this Section 5.4 to the extent that such
action or inaction would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to (x) (i) result in PropCo not acquiring the Real Property, or (ii)

Property (or the leasehold rights therein) or any of PropCo's or its
Affiliates' other facilities, properties or other assets (or leasehold rights

existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations with respect to
any real property including any real property lease or any tenant, or (z)
otherwise have a material and adverse impact on PropCo or its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries. Further, no party shall be required to take any action with
respect to any order, judgment or applicable Law or in order to obtain any
approval or resolve any objection or impediment under any applicable Law that
is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Closing.

 \t\t\t\t (z) \t\t\tFrom the date of this Agreement until the Closing, each
party shall promptly notify all other parties hereto in writing of any pending
or, to the knowledge of Buyer, PropCo or the Sellers, as appropriate,
threatened action, suit, arbitration or other proceeding or investigation by
any Governmental Entity or any other Person (i) challenging or seeking damages
in connection with the Closing of any Transactions or (ii) seeking to restrain
or prohibit the consummation of the Closing or subject the consummation to any
condition not set forth herein. No actions taken pursuant to this Section 5.4
shall be considered for purposes of determining whether a Material Adverse
Effect has occurred.

 \t\t\t\t (aa) \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, PropCo shall have no obligation to (i) take any action or refrain
from taking any action pursuant to this Section 5.4, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any action or inaction requested by Governmental Entities,
including Gaming Authorities, if PropCo obtains a legal opinion from a
nationally recognized law firm that such action or inaction would be
reasonably likely to materially impair PropCo or its direct or indirect owner
from continuing to be treated as a real estate investment trust under the
Code; (ii) assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
PropCo set forth in Section 4.2(c), file or cause to be filed premerger
notification or take any action under or related to the HSR Act; or (iii)
seek, request or obtain approval from any Governmental Entity in connection
with the operation or ownership of the business conducted at the Real Property
as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date; provided, further, that (x)
PropCo may not be compelled to take any action or refrain from taking any
action under any other provision of this Agreement to the extent that PropCo
is excused from taking such action or refraining from taking such action by
this sentence and (y) PropCo will not be deemed to be in breach of this
Agreement solely due to its failure to take or refrain from taking such
action. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.4 shall be
 \t\t
 deemed to limit any obligation the Acquirors may have to pay the applicable
Acquiror Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3.

Transactions. \t\t

Supplement to Disclosure Schedules \t\t

 \t\t\t. From time to time prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall have the
right (but not the obligation) to supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules
hereto with respect to any matter hereafter arising or of which it becomes
aware after the date hereof in order to add or amend information as a result
of events or circumstances occurring subsequent to the date hereof and which
does not result from a breach by Seller of this Agreement. No such
supplement, amendment or addition shall be evidence, in and of itself that the
representations and warranties in the corresponding Section are no longer true
and correct in all material respects. It is specifically agreed that the
Disclosure Schedules may be supplemented, amended and/or added to, to add
immaterial, as well as material, items thereto. Any disclosure in any such
supplement shall not be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, including for
purposes of the indemnification or termination rights contained in this
Agreement or of determining whether or not the conditions set forth in Section
6.2 have been satisfied; provided, however, that, solely to the extent that
(a) the facts, circumstances events or actions (i) set forth in any such
supplement first occurred or arose after the date of this Agreement, (ii) do
not result from Fraud, willful misconduct and/or breach of any covenant of any
Company, any Seller, or Parent and (iii) would render a condition precedent to
Buyer's obligations to consummate the Closing set forth in Section 6.2 or a
condition precedent to PropCo's obligations to consummate the RE Closing (as
defined in the Real Estate Purchase Agreement) set forth in Section 5.2 of the
Real Estate Purchase Agreement, in each case incapable of being satisfied (and
such supplement specifically indicates that such condition is no longer
capable of being satisfied) and (b) the representations and warranties to
which the subject matter of such supplement relates were, as of the date of
this Agreement (1) true and correct in all material respects or (2) in the
case of a representation or warranty that is already subject to qualifications
as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect, true and correct in all
respects, then, if the Acquirors do not elect to terminate this Agreement
within fifteen (15) Business Days of its receipt of such supplement, then the
Acquirors shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to terminate
this Agreement with respect to such matter (it being understood that (A) the
Acquirors shall have no obligation to consummate the Transactions during such
fifteen (15) Business Day period and (B) if such supplement is received by the
Acquirors within fifteen (15) Business Days of the Outside Date, the Outside
Date shall be deemed to occur on the fifteenth (15th) Business Day after the
delivery of such supplement). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 5.16, nothing in this Section 5.16 shall impair or otherwise
affect PropCo's or Buyer's rights  \t\t hereunder in the case of the occurrence of a Material Casualty Event or a
Material Condemnation Event, which such rights shall be governed by Section
6.2(e) and Section 7.1(h). \t\t

Buyer, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Fidelity National Title

respect to the Mountaineer Property, $66,773,876.00 with respect to the IOC-
Caruthersville Property and $114,254,614.00 with respect to the IOC-CG
Property in the form of the pro forma title policies attached hereto as
Exhibit C in the same amounts (which title policies shall include the
endorsements the Buyer or PropCo reasonably require), together with such
co‑insurance as Buyer or PropCo shall reasonably require, and otherwise in the
condition required by this Agreement (collectively, the "Title Policies"). In
addition, Buyer and PropCo each shall have the right to obtain, at such
party's sole expense, as applicable, ALTA surveys or zip maps or updates of
existing surveys or zip maps of the Owned Real Property (and in connection
therewith the Sellers shall, and shall cause the Companies to provide
surveyors with reasonable access to the Real Property for such purpose),
provided that obtaining such survey shall (x) be at no cost to, and shall
impose no additional liability on, the Sellers and (y) not be a condition to
Closing hereunder or otherwise delay Closing hereunder so long as Seller
complies with its obligations in this Section 5.17.

Caruthersville Property and IOC-CG Property, the cost of the title commitments
and the costs of the base premiums for any Title Policy shall be borne by the
Sellers and the costs related to premiums for incremental, extended title
insurance coverage and any endorsements (except for any affirmative coverage
endorsements required to remove any exception to title that the Sellers have
agreed to remove, the cost of which shall be paid by the Sellers) shall be
paid by PropCo or Buyer, as the case may be. With respect to any Title Policy
for the Mountaineer Property, the cost of the title commitments, the costs of
the base premiums for any Title Policy, and the costs related to the premiums
for incremental, extended title insurance coverage and any endorsements
(except for any affirmative coverage endorsements required to remove any
exception to title that the Sellers have agreed to remove, the cost of which
shall be paid by the Sellers) shall be paid by PropCo or Buyer, as the case
may be. All other costs and expenses (if any) with respect to any Real
Property shall be allocated between the Acquirors and the Sellers in
accordance with the customary practice of the county in which any such Real
Property is located.

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (rr) \t\t\tSellers agree to reasonably cooperate with the
Acquirors, the Title Company and surveyor such that the Title Policy for
Caruthersville shall include as an insured interest the interest created by
the Caruthersville Right-of-Way Lease, as the same may be extended, renewed
and/or replaced prior to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, the
insuring of the interests created by the Caruthersville Right-of-Way Lease
shall not be a condition to closing the Transactions.

5.18(a) shall not apply to any consolidated, combined, unitary or similar Tax
Return that includes any Company and Parent or its Affiliates, which shall be
prepared and filed by Parent and subject to the sole control of Parent and its
Affiliates and as to which Buyer shall have no review or approval rights.

or (b) shall be resolved by the Neutral Accounting Firm. The fees and
expenses of the Neutral Accounting Firm shall be borne one-half by Buyer and
one-half by the Sellers. If any dispute with respect to a Tax Return is not

described in Section 5.18(a)) deems correct without prejudice to the other
party's rights hereunder.

 \t\t\t\t (vv) \t\t\tThe amount of any Taxes attributable to a Straddle

depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be apportioned on a per diem
basis; provided, further, that for income Taxes, the pre-Closing portion of
any Straddle Period shall end on the Closing Date and that for non-income

assessment, audit, examination or other administrative or court proceeding,
suit, dispute or other claim with respect to Taxes of any Company is received
by Buyer, such Company or any of their Affiliates (a "Notified Party") for
which the Sellers would be expected to be liable pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (a
"Tax Claim"), the Notified Party shall give the Sellers prompt notice of such
Tax Claim. After the Closing, the Sellers shall represent the interests of
such Company in any Tax Claim relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (and such
Company shall provide the Sellers with any necessary powers of attorney in
connection therewith), and Buyer shall  \t\t
 have the right to represent the interests of such Company in any Tax Claim

without the prior written consent of the non‑controlling party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the event of a
conflict between the provisions of this Section 5.18(e), on the one hand, and
the provisions of Section 8.3, on the other, the provisions of this Section
5.18(e) shall control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 5.18(e) shall not apply to any
Tax Claim relating to any consolidated, combined, unitary or similar Tax group
that includes any Company, which Tax Claim shall be subject to the sole
control of the Sellers and their respective Affiliates and as to which Buyer
shall have no rights set forth in this Section 5.18(e) or Section 8.3.

Taxes otherwise payable by Buyer or any Company in respect of a Post-Closing
Tax Period or the post-Closing portion of a Straddle Period, net of any out-
of-pocket costs or Taxes attributable to such refunds; provided, however,
that the Sellers shall not be entitled to any Tax refunds or overpayments that
are taken into account in the calculation of Closing Working Capital. Buyer
shall cause each Company to make all filings and take all actions necessary to
secure such refunds or overpayments as promptly as possible and to pay to the
Sellers any such amount within fifteen (15) days after the actual receipt of

the extent not taken into account in the calculation of Closing Working
Capital, Buyer shall promptly pay to the Sellers the amount of any Tax

 \t\t\t\t (iii) \t\t\tThe Acquirors acknowledge that the right of the
Sellers to receive the applicable Acquiror Termination Fee shall not limit or
otherwise affect the Sellers' right to pursue a grant of specific performance
as provided in Section 9.3 prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.1 and that the Sellers may pursue both a grant of specific
performance under Section 9.3 and the payment of the Buyer Termination Fee
under this Section 7.3; provided that the Sellers shall not be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and any Acquiror
Termination Fee.

Effect of Termination \t\t

 \t\t\t. \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (n) \t\t\tLiability. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall immediately become
void and there shall be no Liability on the part of Buyer or PropCo, on the
one hand, or the Sellers, on the other hand, or their respective Affiliates or
Representatives, other than pursuant to Section 7.3, this Section 7.4 and
Article IX, which provisions shall survive such termination. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, except as set forth in Section 7.3(e)(ii), nothing in Section
7.3 shall be deemed to release any party from any liability or damages arising
from Fraud in the making of the representations and warranties set forth in
Article II, Article III or Article IV (as applicable) or for willful
misconduct with respect to such party's obligations under this Agreement. The
phrase "willful misconduct" shall be interpreted to mean that the party who
engaged in such conduct acted purposely with the conscious object of breaching
the terms or provisions of this Agreement or otherwise causing the failure of
a condition to such party's obligations to consummate the Transactions. In no
event shall (i) Buyer be obligated to pay (x) both the Buyer Termination Fee
and the Partial Buyer Termination Fee or (y) any Acquiror Termination Fee on
more than one occasion, (ii) PropCo be obligated to pay (x) both the PropCo
Termination Fee and the Partial PropCo Termination Fee or (y) any Acquiror
Termination Fee on more than one occasion or (iii) Sellers be entitled to
receive Acquiror Termination Fees in excess of $13,475,000 (or $9,047,500 if a
Mountaineer Termination occurs) plus the costs and expenses and interest
described in Section 7.3(d). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (o) \t\t\tFees and Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the Transactions (i) by the Sellers shall be paid by the
Sellers, (ii) by Buyer shall be paid by Buyer, and (iii) by PropCo shall be
paid by PropCo, in each case whether or not the Closing is consummated. |  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\tArticle VIII \t\t\t 

SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION 

---|--- 

Survival \t\t

 \t\t\t. Subject to the limitations and other provisions of this Agreement,
the representations and warranties contained herein shall survive the Closing
and shall remain in full force and effect until the date that is one (1) year
after the Closing Date; provided, however, that (a) the representations made
in Section 2.6 (Real Property) and Section 2.10 (Environmental Matters) shall
survive until the eighteen (18) month and third (3rd) anniversaries of the
Closing Date, respectively, and (b) the representations made in Sections 2.1
(Organization), 2.2(a) (Authority), 2.3 (Capitalization), 2.5 (Taxes), 2.14

subject to ERISA), 2.21 (Brokers) (the foregoing collectively, the "Seller
Fundamental Representations"), 3.1 (Organization), 3.2(a) (Authority), 3.3
(Brokers), 3.8 (No Implied Representations), 3.9 (No Distribution) and 3.10

Closing pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be the "Survival Period" with
respect to such representation or warranty. The parties intend for the
preceding two sentences to alter the otherwise applicable statute of
limitations and agree that, subject to the last sentence of this Section 8.1,
no claim may be brought based upon, directly or indirectly, any of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement after the Survival
Period with respect to such representation or warranty. Except as otherwise
specifically set forth herein, the covenants and agreements of the parties
hereto in this Agreement to be performed prior to or at the Closing shall
terminate at Closing. The covenants and agreements of the parties hereto in
this Agreement to be performed following the Closing shall survive the Closing
without any contractual limitation on the period of survival (other than those
covenants and agreements that are expressly required to remain in full force
and effect for a specified period of time). The termination of the
representations and warranties provided herein shall not affect a party (i) in
respect of any claim made by such party in reasonable detail in writing
received by an Indemnifying Party prior to the expiration of the applicable
Survival Period provided herein, or (ii) in respect of any claim grounded in
Fraud in the making of the representations and warranties of the Indemnifying
Party set forth in Article II, Article III and Article IV (as
applicable). \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tSubject to the other Sections of this Article VIII, the
Sellers shall jointly and severally indemnify Acquirors and their respective

 \t\t\t\t (iii) \t\t\tany Taxes imposed on or payable by any Company (A) for
or attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or pre-Closing portion of any
Straddle Period (determined as provided in Section 5.18(d)), (B) by reason of
the Liability of any Company pursuant to Treasury Regulation section 1.1502-6
(or any predecessor or successor thereof or any analogous or similar provision
under state, local or foreign Law) for any Taxes of any member of a
consolidated,  \t\t
 combined, unitary or similar group of which any Company is or was a member
prior to the Closing, (C) as a transferee or successor, by Contract or
otherwise (other than pursuant to any agreements with customers, vendors,
lessors, lenders or the like the primary purpose of which does not relate to
Taxes), in each such case, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction
occurring before the Closing, or (D) as a result of the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections; 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (iv) \t\t\tany and all Losses arising or resulting, directly or
indirectly, from the litigation matters set forth on Schedule 8.2(a)(iv). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (v) \t\t\tany and all Losses arising or resulting, directly or
indirectly, from the matter set forth on Schedule 8.2(a)(v). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tSubject to the other Sections of this Article VIII,
Buyer shall indemnify the Sellers and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives, successors and assigns (each a "Seller Indemnified Party" and
collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") in respect of, and hold them
harmless from and against, any and all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained
by them to which they becomes subject, resulting from, arising out of or
relating to: 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\t any breach of representation or warranty made by Buyer
in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to Section
6.3(a)(i) or 6.3(b)(i); and 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tany breach, nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer contained in this Agreement.

by them to which they become subject, resulting from, arising out of or
relating to: 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tAny breach of representation or warranty made by PropCo
in this Agreement, the Real Estate Purchase Agreement or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to Section 6.3(a)(i) or Section 6.3(b)(ii) hereunder or
Section thereunder, and 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tAny breach, nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of PropCo contained in this Agreement or the
Real Estate Purchase Agreement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the term Losses shall not include any consequential, exemplary,
punitive or similar damages, damages based on diminution in value, loss of
business opportunity or damages calculated using a "multiple of profits,"
multiple of earnings" or similar methodology, except (i) where such damages
are actually awarded to a third party pursuant to a Third Party Claim or (ii)
solely in the case of consequential damages, to the extent any such damages
are a natural, probable and reasonably foreseeable result. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that nothing contained in
the foregoing sentence shall limit, alter, or waive in any manner or respect
any defenses available to any Person or any burdens of proof or legal
standards required to be met by any Person under applicable Law. For purposes
of determining the dollar amount of Losses with respect to any claim resulting
from any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty, all "material",
"materiality", "in all material respects", or "Material Adverse Effect"
qualifications or exceptions in such representation or warranty shall be
disregarded (but such qualifications shall not be so disregarded for purposes
of the determination of the underlying breach or inaccuracy); provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not apply to the representations and
warranties contained in the second sentence of  \t\t
 Section 2.4(a), Section 2.4(b) and Section 2.8 and, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not apply to, or otherwise affect, the definitions of "Material
Contracts" and "Material Adverse Effect". 

--- 

Procedure for Claims between Parties \t\t

 \t\t\t. If a claim for Losses is to be made by an Acquiror Indemnified
Party or Seller Indemnified Party (each, an "Indemnified Party" and
collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") entitled to indemnification
hereunder, such party shall give written notice describing the claim in
reasonable detail and, to the extent then ascertainable, the monetary damages
sought (each, a "Notice") to the indemnifying party hereunder (the
"Indemnifying Party" and collectively, the "Indemnifying Parties") as soon as
reasonably practicable after such Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact,
condition or event which may give rise to Losses for which indemnification may
be sought under this Article VIII. Any failure to submit any such Notice to
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of any
Liability hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party was
actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. \t\t

Defense of Third Party Claims \t\t

 \t\t\t. \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tIf any lawsuit, action, proceeding, investigation, claim
or enforcement action is initiated against an Indemnified Party by any third
party (each, a "Third Party Claim") for which indemnification under this
Article VIII may be sought, Notice thereof, together with copies of all
notices and communication relating to such Third Party Claim, shall be given
to the Indemnifying Party as promptly as reasonably practicable. The failure
of any Indemnified Party to give timely Notice hereunder shall not affect
rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party was actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tIf it so elects at its own cost, risk and expense, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to: 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\ttake control of the defense and investigation of such
Third Party Claim if the Indemnifying Party so notifies the Indemnified Party
in writing; 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\temploy and engage attorneys of its own choice to handle
and defend the same, unless the named parties to such action or proceeding
include both one or more Indemnifying Parties and an Indemnified Party, and
the Indemnified Party has reasonably concluded that there may be one or more
legal defenses or defense strategies available to such Indemnified Party that
are different from or additional to those available to an applicable
Indemnifying Party or that there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a
conflict of interest, in which event such Indemnified Party shall be entitled,
at the Indemnifying Parties' reasonable cost, risk and expense, to one
separate counsel (provided that such counsel is reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party); and 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (iii) \t\t\tcompromise or settle such Third Party Claim, which
compromise or settlement shall be made (x) with the written consent of the
Indemnified Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, or (y) without the consent of the Indemnified Party if such
compromise or settlement contains an unconditional release of the Indemnified
Party in respect of such claim, without any cost, liability or admission of
wrongdoing of any nature whatsoever to or by such Indemnified Party, and
provides only for monetary damages that will be paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (g) \t\t\tIf the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense
of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all
reasonable respects with the Indemnifying Party and its attorneys in the
investigation, trial and defense of such Third Party Claim and any appeal
arising therefrom; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may, at its
own cost, participate in the investigation, trial and defense  \t\t
 of such lawsuit or action and any appeal arising therefrom. The parties shall
cooperate with each other in any notifications to insurers. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (h) \t\t\tIf the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the
Notice, the Indemnified Party against which such Third Party Claim has been
asserted will have the right to undertake, at the Indemnifying Parties'
reasonable cost, risk and expense (but only to the extent that it is finally
determined that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification from the
Indemnifying Party under this Article VIII), the defense, compromise or
settlement of such Third Party Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk
of the Indemnifying Parties (but only to the extent that it is finally
determined that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification from the
Indemnifying Party under this Article VIII); provided, however, that such
Third Party Claim shall not be compromised or settled without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tIf the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of the
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will keep the Indemnifying Party
reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or
settlement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (j) \t\t\tIf the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
that it does not dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party with respect
to the Third Party Claim or fails to notify the Indemnified Party whether the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Third Party Claim within sixty (60) days of the Notice of such
Third Party Claim having been provided to the Indemnifying Party, the Losses
arising from such Third Party Claim will be conclusively deemed a liability of
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such
Losses to the Indemnified Party on demand following the final determination
thereof. 

---|--- 

Limitations on Indemnity \t\t

 \t\t\t. \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (k) \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, no amounts of indemnity shall be payable as a result of any
claim in respect of a Loss arising under Section 8.2(a) (other than Section
8.2(a)(iv) and Section 8.2(a)(v) and other than with respect to a breach or
inaccuracy of a Seller Fundamental Representation or any claim grounded in
Fraud in the making of the representations and warranties of the Sellers)
except to the extent the aggregate claims for Losses of the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties for which indemnification is sought pursuant to Section
8.2(a) hereof exceed $5,775,000 (or $3,877,500 if a Mountaineer Termination
occurs) (the "Deductible"), in which case the Acquiror Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to recover, subject to the other limitations in this Article
VIII, only to the extent such Losses in the aggregate exceed the Deductible. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (l) \t\t\tNo Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover under
Section 8.2 unless a claim has been asserted by written notice, specifying the
details of the alleged breach with reasonable particularity, the sections of
this Agreement alleged to have been breached, a good faith estimate of the
Losses claimed, and all the relevant facts with respect thereto, delivered to
the Sellers or Acquirors (as the case may be) on or prior to the expiration of
the applicable Survival Period (in which case the applicable survival period
shall be deemed to extend until such claim has been finally resolved). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (m) \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement (but subject to the other limitations contained herein), in no
event shall any Seller's aggregate liability (i) for all indemnifiable claims
for Losses pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (other than Section 8.2(a)(iv) and other
than with respect to a breach or inaccuracy of a Seller Fundamental
Representation or any claim grounded in Fraud in the making of the
representations and warranties of the Sellers) exceed $38,500,000 (or
$25,850,000 if a Mountaineer Termination occurs) and (ii) for all
indemnifiable claims for Losses pursuant  \t\t
 to Section 8.2(a) with respect to Section 8.2(a)(iv) or a breach or inaccuracy
of a Seller Fundamental Representation or any claim grounded in Fraud in the
making of the representations and warranties of the Sellers exceed the
aggregate Purchase Price received by such Seller. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (n) \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement (but subject to the other limitations contained herein), in no
event shall Buyer's aggregate liability for all indemnifiable claims for
Losses pursuant to Section 8.2(b) (other than with respect to a claim grounded
in Fraud in the making of the representations and warranties of Buyer) exceed
$19,250,000 (or $12,925,000 if a Mountaineer Termination occurs). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (o) \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement (but subject to the other limitations contained herein), in no
event shall PropCo's aggregate liability for all indemnifiable claims for
Losses pursuant to Section 8.2(c) (other than with respect to a claim grounded
in Fraud in the making of the representations and warranties of PropCo) exceed
$19,250,000 (or $12,925,000 if a Mountaineer Termination occurs). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (p) \t\t\tNotwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, no Seller shall be liable under this Article VIII for any Losses
or alleged Losses to the extent such Losses or alleged Losses are taken into
account in the calculation of the Closing Working Capital (including any
component thereof). Notwithstanding anything expressed or implied herein to
the contrary, no Acquiror Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification with respect to any Taxes (i) for any taxable period, or
portion thereof, beginning after the Closing Date, except with respect to a
breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 2.5(c) or (ii)
that are attributable to a transaction involving Buyer or any Company
occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing outside the ordinary course of
business of any Company that is not caused by Seller. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (q) \t\t\tIn calculating the amount of any Losses payable to an
Acquiror Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party hereunder, the amount
of the Losses (i) shall not be duplicative of any other Losses for which an
indemnification claim has been paid and (ii) shall be computed net of any
amounts actually recovered by such Indemnified Party under any insurance
policy (including the Title Policy) with respect to such Losses (net of any
out‑of‑pocket costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such insurance
proceeds). Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to recover from any applicable insurance policy (including the Title Policy)
in respect of any Losses that are the subject of indemnification under this
Article VIII. If an Indemnified Party actually recovers an amount from an
insurance policy in respect of Losses that are the subject of indemnification
under this Article VIII after all or a portion of such Losses have been paid
by or at the direction of the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article
VIII, the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party the
excess (if any) of (i) the amount paid by or at the direction of the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Losses, plus the amount received from
the insurance policy in respect thereof, less (ii) the full amount of such
Losses, plus the amount of any out‑of‑pocket costs, fees or expenses incurred
to procure such proceeds and the amount of any increased insurance premiums,
retentions or other out-of-pocket costs related to or arising therefrom. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (r) \t\t\tNothing herein shall waive any party's common law duty
to mitigate any such claim or liability upon and after becoming aware of any
event or condition which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Losses that are indemnifiable under this Article VIII. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (s) \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, nothing in this Section 8.5 shall limit any rights or remedies
of Acquirors in the case of the Sellers' Fraud. 

---|--- 

Payment of Losses \t\t

 \t\t\t. An Indemnified Party shall be paid in cash by an Indemnifying Party
the amount to which such Indemnified Party may become entitled by reason of
the provisions of this  \t\t Article VIII, within ten (10) Business Days after such amount is determined
either by mutual agreement of the Acquirors on the one hand and the Sellers
(or a Seller, as applicable) on the other hand or on the date on which both
such amount and an Indemnified Party's obligation to pay such amount have been
determined by a final non‑appealable judgment of a court or administrative
body having jurisdiction over such proceeding. \t\t

Exclusivity \t\t

 \t\t\t. After the Closing, to the extent permitted by Law, the indemnities
set forth in this Article VIII shall be the exclusive remedies of the
Acquirors, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other, and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents and Affiliates for any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or nonfulfillment or failure to be
performed of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or the Real
Estate Purchase Agreement, and the parties shall not be entitled to a
rescission of this Agreement or to any further indemnification rights or
claims of any nature whatsoever in respect thereof, all of which the parties
hereto hereby waive. \t\t

Tax Treatment for Indemnity Payments \t\t

 \t\t\t. All indemnity payments made pursuant to this Article VIII shall be
deemed to be, and each of the Sellers, PropCo and Buyer shall treat such
payments as, an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all federal, state, local
and foreign income Tax purposes except as otherwise required by applicable
Law. \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tThis Agreement and the Transactions, and all disputes
between the parties under or related to this Agreement or the facts and
circumstances leading to its execution, whether in Contract, tort or
otherwise, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of New York, applicable to Contracts executed in and to be performed

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tSubject to the provisions of Section 7.2 of the Real
Estate Purchase Agreement, each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
court of the State of New York, or Federal court of the United States of
America, sitting in New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
agreements delivered in connection herewith or the Transactions or thereby or
for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of
the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (A) agrees not to commence
any such action or proceeding except in such courts, (B) agrees that any claim
in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in
such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such Federal
court, (C) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so,
any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such action or proceeding in any such New York State or Federal court, (D)
waives, to the fullest extent  \t\t
 permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action or proceeding in any such New York State or Federal court, and (E)
to the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of process in the
State of New York, appoints Corporation Service Company as such party's agent
in the State of New York for acceptance of legal process and agrees that
service made on any such agent shall have the same legal force and effect as
if served upon such party personally within such state. Each of the parties
hereby hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in Section 9.4. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party
to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tEACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF
THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
(A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tNotwithstanding the foregoing, each party agrees (i)
(except as otherwise expressly provided in any document relating to any
Financing) that it will not bring or support or permit any of its Affiliates
to bring or support anyone else in bringing any claim or cause of action
(whether at Law, in contract or in tort or otherwise) against any Financing
Party relating to this Agreement, any Financing, the Commitment Letter, any
document relating to any Financing, the Transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, other than in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of
New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York (and the appellate courts thereof), (ii) any such claim or cause of
action shall (except as otherwise expressly provided in any document relating
to any Financing) be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without
giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof, and (iii) to
waive any right to trial by jury in respect of any such claim, suit, action or
proceeding.

Specific Performance \t\t

 \t\t\t. Except as provided in Section 7.3, the parties hereby acknowledge
and agree that (i) irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached and (ii) money damages would be both
incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any such failure to perform or any
breach of this Agreement. Accordingly, the parties agree that each party
shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
the provisions of this Agreement and to seek to enforce specifically this
Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy
to which they may be entitled, at law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or the Real Estate Purchase
Agreement, (1) if, for any reason, Buyer shall fail to consummate the Company
Interests Sale then (x) the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.3 shall be
void and of no force or effect, and (y) Sellers shall not be entitled to
specific performance or any other equitable relief or remedy as against
PropCo, and Sellers' sole and exclusive remedy shall be as set forth in
Article VII hereof, and (2) if (a) Buyer pays the Buyer Termination Fee, (b)
PropCo pays the PropCo Termination Fee or  \t\t (c) Buyer pays the Partial Buyer Termination Fee and PropCo pays the Partial
PropCo Termination Fee, in each case in accordance with Section 7.3 hereof,
then the Buyer Termination Fee, the PropCo Termination Fee, the Partial Buyer
Termination Fee and the Partial PropCo Termination Fee, as the case may be,
shall be Sellers' sole and exclusive remedy for the applicable Acquiror's
failure to consummate the Company Interests Sale and/or the Real Estate
Purchase Transaction, as applicable. In no event shall the Sellers, each of
the Companies or any of their respective Affiliates be entitled to, or
permitted to seek, specific performance in respect of any Financing Parties
under the terms of this Agreement, and nor shall there be any right of the
Sellers, each of the Companies or any of their respective Affiliates, or any
obligation of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates to enforce specifically any
of Buyer's and its Affiliates' respective rights under the Commitment Letter
or any other agreements of the Acquirors relating to the Financing; provided,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall anything in this
Agreement limit the rights of Buyer under the Commitment Letter. \t\t

Notices \t\t

 \t\t\t. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing
and shall be deemed given (i) when delivered personally, (ii) when transmitted
via confirmed electronic mail; provided that if such email is delivered after
5:00 p.m. local time of the recipient, or on a day other than a Business Day,
then on the next following Business Day, or (iii) the day following the day
(except if not a Business Day, then the next Business Day) on which the same

service, to the parties at the following addresses (or at such other address
for a party as shall be specified by like notice): \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (j) \t\t\tWhen a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections,
Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section or Exhibit or
Schedule of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. All Exhibits and
Schedules of this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference. The table
of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The word "or" shall be disjunctive but not exclusive.
The phrase "made available" in this Agreement shall mean that the information
referred to has been made available if requested by the party to whom such
information is to be made available. The posting of any document, agreement,
instrument or other information to the online "data room" hosted by Merrill
DataSite will constitute "delivery" of such document, agreement, instrument or
other information to Buyer or PropCo, as applicable within the meaning of this
Agreement. Each of the Acquirors and each Seller will be referred to herein
individually as a "party" and collectively as "parties" (except where the
context otherwise requires).

 \t\t\t\t (k) \t\t\tThe Disclosure Schedules shall be construed with and as
an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set
forth verbatim herein. Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in the Disclosure Schedules is intended to vary the
definition of "Material Adverse Effect" or to imply that such amount, or
higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are
not material, and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such
amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between
the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein
or included in the Disclosure Schedules is or is not material for purposes of
this Agreement. Unless this Agreement specifically provides otherwise,
neither the specification of any item or matter in any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
the Disclosure Schedules is intended to imply that such item or matter, or
other items or matters, are or are not  \t\t
 in the Ordinary Course of Business, and no party shall use the fact of the
setting forth or the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described herein or included in the Disclosure Schedules is or is not in
the Ordinary Course of Business for purposes of this Agreement. Unless
otherwise specified, each reference in this Agreement to any numbered schedule
is a reference to the corresponding numbered schedule which is included in the
Disclosure Schedules. Each numbered schedule in the Disclosure Schedules
shall be deemed to qualify the corresponding Section of this Agreement and any
other Section to which the application of such disclosure is reasonably
apparent on its face. It is specifically acknowledged that the Disclosure
Schedules may expressly provide exceptions to a particular Section of Article
II notwithstanding that the Section does not state "except as set forth on
Schedule '__'"and, unless otherwise indicated, each reference to "Schedule
'__'" in this Agreement shall be deemed be a reference to the corresponding
schedule in the Disclosure Schedules.

Entire Agreement \t\t

 \t\t\t. This Agreement and all documents and instruments referred to herein
constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof; provided that the Confidentiality Agreements shall
remain in full force and effect after the Closing in accordance with Section
5.3(a) and Section 5.24. Each party hereto hereby agrees that, except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the certificates
and other agreements delivered in accordance with this Agreement and the
respective Disclosure Schedules, none of the Sellers, Buyer nor PropCo, makes
any other representations or warranties, and each such party hereby disclaims
any other representations and warranties made by itself or any of its
respective Representatives or other Representatives, with respect to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Transactions, notwithstanding
the delivery or disclosure to any of them or their respective Representatives
of any documentation or other information with respect to any one or more of
the foregoing. \t\t

Severability \t\t

 \t\t\t If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect, and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other
jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible. \t\t

Assignment \t\t

 \t\t\t. Without the prior written consent of all of the parties hereto,
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by operation of Law (including by merger or
consolidation) or otherwise, except that (x) Buyer may assign its rights (but
not its obligations) under this Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates and
(y) PropCo may assign all or a portion of its rights (but not its obligations)
under this Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates. Any attempted
assignment in violation of this Section 9.9 shall be void. \t\t

Parties of Interest; No Third Party Beneficiaries \t\t

 \t\t\t. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each party hereto and its permitted successors and assigns, and
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied is intended to or shall confer
upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement, except the Financing Parties may enforce
(and the Financing Parties are intended third party beneficiaries of) the
provisions of  \t\t Section 7.3(e) (solely to the extent that it relates to the Financing
Parties), Section 9.2(d), Section 9.3 (solely to the extent that it relates
to the Financing Parties), this Section 9.10 (solely to the extent that it
relates to the Financing Parties), the proviso in the first sentence of
Section 9.13, and Section 9.19. In addition, the Sellers agree on behalf of
themselves and their Affiliates that none of the Financing Parties or any of
their respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
shareholders, managers, members, controlling person, Representatives or
Affiliates shall have any liability or obligation to the Sellers or any of
their Affiliates relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions
(including any Financing) whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise. \t\t

Counterparts \t\t

 \t\t\t. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by
the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or PDF file
(portable document format file) shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement. \t\t

Mutual Drafting \t\t

 \t\t\t. Each party hereto has participated in the drafting of this
Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of extensive
negotiations between the parties. In the event any ambiguity or question of
intent arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement. \t\t

Amendment \t\t

 \t\t\t. This Agreement may not be amended other than by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of the parties hereto provided, that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, Section 7.3(e) (solely to the
extent that it relates to the Financing Parties), Section 9.3 (solely to the
extent that it relates to the Financing Parties), Section 9.10 (solely to the
extent that it relates to the Financing Parties), this proviso of Section
9.13, Section 9.19, Section 9.2(d) and the definition of "Material Adverse
Effect" (and any related definition to the extent an amendment of such
definition would modify the substance of any of the foregoing provisions) may
not be amended in a manner that is materially adverse to the Financing Parties
without the prior written consent of the Financing Parties. \t\t

Extension; Waiver \t\t

 \t\t\t. At any time prior to the Closing, Acquirors, on the one hand, and
the Sellers, on the other hand, may, to the extent legally allowed (i) extend
the time for or waive the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant herein and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party. No failure or delay on the part of
any party hereto in the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder shall impair
such right or remedy or be construed as a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any
breach hereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or any other right. \t\t

Attorney-Client Privilege \t\t

 \t\t\t. Recognizing that Milbank LLP has acted as legal counsel to the
Sellers and each Company, and that such law firm intends to act as legal
counsel to the Sellers and their respective Affiliates (other than the
Companies) after the consummation of the Closing, Buyer agrees that, as to all
communications among Milbank LLP, the Companies or the Sellers or their
respective representatives that (i) relate to the period prior to the
consummation of the Closing or (ii) otherwise relate to the negotiations of,
or the Transactions, the attorney-client privilege, the work product
privilege, the expectation of client confidence and any other legal privileges
or immunities belong to the Sellers and their respective Affiliates and may be
controlled by the Sellers and their respective Affiliates and shall not pass
to or be claimed by Buyer, the Companies or any of their Affiliates or
Subsidiaries or be waived by Buyer, the Companies or any of their Affiliates
or Subsidiaries. The Sellers and their respective Affiliates may  \t\t assert the attorney-client privilege, the work product privilege, the
expectation of client confidence and any other legal privilege or immunity
against Buyer, the Companies or any of their Affiliates or Subsidiaries to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that a dispute arises between Buyer, the Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates and a third party (other than a party to this
Agreement or any of their respective Affiliates) after the Closing, the
Companies may assert the attorney-client privilege, the work product privilege
or any other applicable privilege or immunity from disclosure to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by Milbank LLP to such third party;
provided that neither the Companies nor any of their Affiliates or
Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the
Sellers. \t\t

Representation \t\t

 \t\t\t. Buyer hereby agrees that, notwithstanding the fact that such law
firm may be deemed from time to time to have acted as legal counsel to the
Sellers and each Company prior to the Closing, following the Closing, Milbank
LLP may act as legal counsel to the Sellers or their Affiliates, including in
connection with any dispute relating to this Agreement or the Transactions or
any other disputes that may arise between any of the parties hereto following
the Closing, and Buyer shall not, and shall not cause, suffer or permit any
Company, have or seek to have Milbank LLP disqualified from representing any
of the Sellers or their respective Affiliates. \t\t

Parent Guarantee \t\t

 \t\t\t. \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (l) \t\t\tParent irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to
Acquirors the full and timely payment by the Sellers when due of any
obligation of the Sellers to pay any amount or amount due to any Indemnified
Party pursuant to Section 8.2(a) hereof to the extent the same is required to
be paid by the Sellers pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions and
limitations thereof (the "Obligations"). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, Acquirors acknowledge and agree on behalf of
themselves and each Indemnified Party that (i) to the extent the Sellers are
relieved of any of the Obligations for any reason (including pursuant to any
limitation arising out of the terms and conditions of Article VIII), Parent
shall be similarly relieved of such Obligations for all purposes hereunder,
and (ii) Parent may assert, as a defense to, or release or discharge of, any
payment or performance by Parent hereunder, any claim, set-off, deduction,
defense or release that the Sellers could assert against Acquirors or any
Indemnified Party, in each case, under the terms of this Agreement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (m) \t\t\tParent hereby represents and warrants to the Acquirors
as of the date hereof and as of the Closing as follows: 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tParent has all requisite power and authority to enter
into this Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance by Parent of its
obligations under this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary
action on the part of Parent. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Parent and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of
Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance with its terms, subject, as
to enforcement, to (A) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar Laws now or hereinafter in effect affecting creditors'
rights generally and (B) general principles of equity; and 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tThe execution and delivery of this Agreement does not,
and the performance by Parent of its obligations under this Agreement will
not, (A) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, any provision
of the organizational documents of Parent, (B) conflict with or violate any
Law applicable to the Parent or (C) require any material notices, reports or
other filings by Parent with, nor any material consents by any Governmental
Entity, except for any notice, report or other filing by Parent with, or any
consent by, any Governmental Entity where the failure to make such notice,
report or other filing with, or obtain such consent of, such Governmental
 \t\t
 Entity would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
impair or delay Parent's performance of its obligations hereunder. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (n) \t\t\tParent shall not assign its rights, interests or
obligations hereunder to any other Person without the prior written consent of
Acquirors. Any attempted assignment in violation of this section shall be
null and void; provided, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, nothing shall restrict Parent from the sale,
transfer, exchange, assignment or other disposition by any means of a majority
of its equity securities, or all or substantially all of its assets. 

---|--- 

Unitary Transaction \t\t

 \t\t\t. Sellers and Acquirors hereby agree that if the Closing is to occur,
it must be in respect of all Company Interests and all Transferred Real Estate
Assets, and, except as otherwise provided herein with respect to a Mountaineer
Termination or unless the parties hereafter otherwise agree, Acquirors shall
not have the right to acquire, and Sellers shall not have the right to require
Acquirors to acquire, fewer than all of the Company Interests and all
Transferred Real Estate Assets. \t\t

Non-Recourse \t\t

 \t\t\t. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each of
the Companies and the Sellers (in each case on behalf of itself and any of its
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) hereby
waives any rights or claims against any Financing Party for the Financing in
connection with this Agreement, any Financing or in respect of any other
document or theory of law or equity (whether in tort, contract or otherwise)
or in respect of any oral or written representations made or alleged to be
made in connection herewith or therewith, and each of the Companies and the
Sellers (in each case on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) agrees not to
commence any action or proceeding against any Financing Party for the
Financing in connection with this Agreement, any Financing or in respect of
any other document or theory of law or equity and agrees to cause any such
action or proceeding asserted by each of the Companies or the Sellers (in each
case, on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives) in connection with this Agreement, any
Financing or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity
against any Financing Party for the Financing to be dismissed or otherwise
terminated. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it
is acknowledged and agreed that no financing source for the Financing shall
have any liability for any claims or damages to the Companies, the Sellers or
any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives in connection with this Agreement, any Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. \t\t

Releases \t\t

 \t\t\t. \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (o) \t\t\tEffective as of the Closing, Buyer, on behalf of itself
and each of the Companies (collectively, the "Buyer Releasing Parties"), each
hereby unconditionally and irrevocably and forever releases and discharges
each of the Sellers and each of their respective successors and assigns, and
any present or former direct and indirect investors, partners, shareholders,
equity holders, directors, managers, officers, employees, agents, lenders,
principals, members or managers of any of the foregoing Persons (each, a
"Seller Released Party"), of and from, and hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably waives, any and all claims, debts, losses, expenses, proceedings,
covenants, liabilities, suits, judgments, damages, actions and causes of
action, obligations, accounts, and liabilities of any kind or character
whatsoever, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, in contract, direct or
indirect, at law or in equity (collectively, the "Acquiror Party Released
Claims") that any Buyer Releasing Party ever had, now has or ever may have or
claim to have against any Seller Released Party, arising in connection with
the management, ownership and operation of any of the Companies; provided,
however, that this release does not extend to claims relating to any breach or
alleged breach of this Agreement or the Real Estate Purchase Agreement or any
of the provisions set forth herein or therein or release or waive any rights
to be indemnified, reimbursed and held harmless that the Acquirors are
entitled to under Article VIII. Each Buyer Releasing Party expressly waives
all rights afforded by any statute which limits the effect of a release with
respect to unknown claims. Each  \t\t
 Buyer Releasing Party covenants that it will not (and that each Acquiror will
cause all other Persons who may seek to claim as, by, through or in relation
to any of the Buyer Releasing Parties or any of the matters released by or on
behalf of the Buyer Releasing Parties in this Section 9.20(a) not to) sue any
of the Seller Released Parties on the basis of any of the Acquiror Party
Released Claims herein released and discharged. Each Buyer Releasing Party
understands the significance of this release of unknown claims and waiver of
statutory protection against a release of unknown claims, and acknowledges and
agrees that this waiver is an essential and material term of this Agreement.
Each Buyer Releasing Party acknowledges that the Sellers will be relying on
the waiver and release provided in this Section 9.20(a) in connection with
entering into this Agreement and that this Section 9.20(a) is intended for the
benefit of, and to grant third party rights to, each Seller Released Party to
enforce this Section 9.20(a). 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (p) \t\t\tEffective as of the Closing, the Sellers each hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably and forever releases and discharges each of
the Companies and each of their respective successors and assigns, and any
present or former direct and indirect investors, partners, shareholders,
equity holders, directors, managers, officers, employees, agents, lenders,
principals, members or managers of any of the foregoing Persons (each, a
"Company Released Party"), of and from, and hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably waives, any and all claims, debts, losses, expenses, proceedings,
covenants, liabilities, suits, judgments, damages, actions and causes of
action, obligations, accounts, and liabilities of any kind or character
whatsoever, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, in contract, direct or
indirect, at law or in equity (collectively, the "Seller Released Claims")
that such Seller ever had, now has or ever may have or claim to have against
any Company Released Party, arising in connection with the management,
ownership and operation of any of the Companies; provided, however, that this
release does not extend to claims relating to any breach or alleged breach of
this Agreement or the Real Estate Purchase Agreement or any of the provisions
set forth herein or therein or release or waive any rights to be indemnified,
reimbursed and held harmless that the Sellers are entitled to under Article
VIII. Sellers each expressly waive all rights afforded by any statute which
limits the effect of a release with respect to unknown claims. Sellers
covenant that they will (and that they will cause all other Persons who may
seek to claim as, by, through or in relation to Sellers or any of the matters
released by or on behalf of Sellers in this Section 9.20(b) not to) sue any of
the Company Released Parties on the basis of any of the Seller Released Claims
herein released and discharged. Sellers understand the significance of this
release of unknown claims and waiver of statutory protection against a release
of unknown claims, and acknowledges and agrees that this waiver is an
essential and material term of this Agreement. Sellers acknowledge that the
Acquirors will be relying on the waiver and release provided in this Section
9.20(b) in connection with entering into this Agreement and that this Section
9.20(b) is intended for the benefit of, and to grant third party rights to,
each Company Released Party to enforce this Section 9.20(b).

 \t\t\tSection 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), provides that a transferee of a U.S. real property interest must
withhold tax if the transferor is a foreign person. For U.S. tax purposes
(including Section 1445), the owner of a disregarded entity (which has legal
title to a U.S. real property interest under local law) will be the transferor
of the property and not the disregarded entity. To inform Century Casinos,
Inc. a Delaware corporation that withholding of tax is not required upon the
disposition of a U.S. real property interest by [_______________], a
[____________] ("Transferor"), Transferor hereby certifies as follows:  \t\t

 \t\t|

 \t\t\tTransferor is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign
trust or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Code and Treasury
Regulations).
