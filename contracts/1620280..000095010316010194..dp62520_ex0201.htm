21

 



    

Consideration, that the amounts proposed in this Section 2.12(a) are not
objected to by the Unitholders' Representative or otherwise determined to be
a different amount pursuant to this Section 2.12) (the "Closing Statement").

  



  

  (b)  If the Unitholders' Representative disagrees with the Surviving
Company's calculation of any of the amounts set forth on the Closing
Statement, the Unitholders' Representative may, within 90 days after receipt
of the Closing Statement, deliver a written notice to the Surviving Company
disagreeing with such calculation(s) and setting forth the
Unitholders' Representative's calculation of such amount(s). Any such notice
of disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to which the
Unitholders' Representative disagrees, and the Unitholders' Representative
shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in
the Closing Statement. If the Unitholders' Representative fails to
deliver such a written notice within such 90 day period, the Surviving
Company's calculations set forth in the Closing Statement shall be binding
upon the parties.

  



  

  (c)  If a notice of disagreement is duly delivered pursuant to Section
2.12(b), the Unitholders' Representative and the Surviving Company shall,
during the 30 days following such delivery, use reasonable best efforts to
reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as
may be required, the Final Amounts. If, after the expiration of such
period or any mutually agreed extension thereof, the Unitholders'
Representative and the Surviving Company are unable to reach such agreement,
they shall promptly thereafter submit the disputed items to an independent
accounting firm of nationally recognized standing (the "Accounting Referee")
for resolution of any and all matters included in the Closing Statement that
remain in dispute. The Accounting Referee shall be Deloitte or, if such firm
is unable or unwilling to act, such other independent accounting firm of
nationally recognized standing as shall be mutually agreed upon in writing by
the Surviving Company and the Unitholders' Representative. In resolving the
matters submitted to it pursuant to Section 2.12(b), the Accounting
Referee shall review this Section 2.12, the disputed calculations in the
Closing Statement, the Unitholders' Representative's notice of disagreement
and the definitions related hereto and thereto, as applicable. In making such
determination, the Accounting Referee (i) shall consider only those items or
amounts in the Closing Statement as to which the Unitholders'
Representative has disagreed and which have not been resolved prior to
submission to the Accounting Referee, (ii) shall not be entitled to hold any
hearings or take or order the taking of depositions or other testimony under
oath and (iii) with respect to each matter submitted to it, shall not resolve
such matter in a manner that is more favorable to the Surviving Company than
the Closing Statement or more favorable to the Unitholders' Representative
than the notice of disagreement. The Accounting Referee is not authorized to,
and shall not, make any other determination including (A) any determination
with respect to any matter included in the Closing Statement or the
Unitholders' Representative's notice of disagreement that was not submitted
for resolution to the Accounting Referee or (B) any determination as to
compliance by the Company, any Unitholder, Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub
or the Surviving Company with any of its covenants in this Agreement. Any
disputes not within the scope of the disputes to be resolved by the
Accounting Referee pursuant to this Section 2.12(c) (as well as any disputes
about the scope of disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Referee pursuant
to this Section 2.12(c)) shall be resolved pursuant to Section 13.07.

  



    

22

 



    

(d)  The Accounting Referee shall deliver to the Unitholders' Representative
and the Surviving Company, as promptly as practicable and no later than 90
days after its appointment, a report setting forth such determination which
shall be final and binding upon the Unitholders' Representative, the
Unitholders and the Surviving Company absent fraud, bad faith or
manifest error. The dispute resolution by the Accounting Referee under this
Section 2.12 shall constitute an expert determination and shall not
constitute an arbitration. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee
shall be borne one-half by the Surviving Company, on the one hand, and one-
half by the Unitholders' Representative (for the account of the Unitholders),
on the other hand.

  



  

(e)  The Unitholders' Representative and the Surviving Company agree that
they will cooperate and assist in the preparation and review of the Closing
Statement and the determination of the Final Amounts, including the making
available of books, records, work papers and personnel.

  



  

Section 2.13  _Updated Allocation Schedule; Adjustment of the Cash Merger
Consideration._ (a) Within five Business Days after the final determination
of the Final Amounts, the Unitholders' Representative shall deliver to the
Surviving Company an updated Allocation Schedule, which shall be updated
solely to reflect the determination of the Final Cash Merger Consideration
and shall otherwise include the same calculations and follow the same
methodologies set forth on the initial Allocation Schedule. Such updated
Allocation Statement shall also include a calculation of any Underpayment
Amount (as defined below) to be paid in respect of each Company Unit.

  



  

(b)  Within five Business Days of receipt of such updated Allocation
Schedule, if (x) the Closing Cash Payment exceeds (y) the Final Cash Merger
Consideration (the amount of the excess of (x) over (y) being referred to as
the "Overpayment Amount"), then the Purchaser and the Unitholders'
Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to (i) if the Overpayment Amount exceeds the
Escrow Amount, disburse to the Purchaser the entire Escrow Amount and (ii) if
the Overpayment Amount is less than the Escrow Amount, (A) disburse to the
Purchaser a portion of the Escrow Amount equal to the Overpayment Amount and
(B) to an account designated by the Unitholders' Representative, in trust for
the benefit of the Unitholders entitled thereto, any funds remaining in the
Escrow Account; _provided_ that, in the event the Overpayment Amount exceeds
the Escrow Amount, the Unitholders' Representative (for the account of the
Unitholders) shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Purchaser an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the difference between the Overpayment Amount
and the Escrow Amount.

  



  

(c)  Within five Business Days of receipt of such updated Allocation
Schedule, if (x) the Closing Cash Payment is less than (y) the Final Cash
Merger Consideration (the amount by which (x) is less than (y) being referred
to as the "Underpayment Amount"), then the Purchaser shall pay, or cause to
be paid, to the Unitholders' Representative, in trust for the benefit of the
Unitholders entitled thereto, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the Underpayment Amount, and shall, with the Unitholders' Representative,
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing to the
Escrow Agent to disburse the entire Escrow Amount to an account designated by
the Unitholders' Representative in trust for the benefit of the Unitholders
entitled thereto.

  



    

23

 



    

Section 2.14  _Fractional Shares_. No fractional Convertible Preferred Shares
or shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and, in lieu thereof, the party entitled to
receive such a fractional share shall receive an amount in cash, without
interest, determined by multiplying (i) in the case of Convertible Preferred
Shares, (A) the fraction of a Convertible Preferred Share to which such
holder would otherwise have been entitled by (B) the Liquidation Preference
or (ii) in the case of Parent Common Stock, (A) the fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled
by (B) the Market Price.

  



  

Section 2.15  _Withholding Rights._ Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, each of Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company, the
Escrow Agent and the Unitholders' Representative shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant
to this Agreement or any Transaction Document such amounts as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. Any amounts so
deducted and withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

Section 2.16  _Closing of the Company 's Transfer Books_. At the Effective
Time, holders of certificates representing the Company Units that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights as Members (as defined in the Operating Agreement) of the Company. The
unit transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all Company
Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and no further
transfer of any such Company Units shall be made on such unit transfer books
after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate
previously representing any of the Company Units (a "Company Unit
Certificate") is presented to the Surviving Company, such Company Unit
Certificate shall be canceled and, if applicable, shall be exchanged as
provided in Section 2.17.

  



  

Section 2.17  _Surrender of Certificates_. (a) As promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, the Unitholders' Representative shall mail
to each holder of record of Company Units a letter of transmittal in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit H (the "Letter of
Transmittal"), to be completed and delivered by each Unitholder to effect the
exchange of such Unitholder's Company Units for the payment of the portion of
the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.08(b)(i) and the
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08(b)(ii), in each case, in respect of
each Company Unit represented thereby, without any interest thereon. Upon
completion and delivery of a duly executed Letter of Transmittal and such
other documents as the Unitholders' Representative shall reasonably require
and surrender of the applicable Company Unit Certificate(s), following the
Effective Time, the Unitholder shall be entitled to receive from the
Unitholders' Representative in exchange therefor a check or wire transfer
and, if applicable, delivery of Convertible Preferred Shares or shares of
Parent Common Stock, in the aggregate amounts equal to the applicable portion
of the Merger Consideration payable to such Unitholder pursuant to Section

exchanged by such Unitholder pursuant to this Section 2.17.

  



  

(b)  Following the Effective Time, each holder of a Company Unit Certificate

of the Merger Consideration

  



    

24

Unitholders' Representative, the Surviving Company and Parent, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Unitholders' Representative and
Parent, with respect to, that fact by the person claiming such Company Unit
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Unitholders' Representative
shall, following the Effective Time, issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Company Unit Certificate, the payment deliverable in respect
thereof determined in accordance with this Article 2.

  



  

 (d)  Except as required by Applicable Law, no dividends or other
distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Company with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
Company Unit Certificate (whether surrendered or unsurrendered).

Company Units in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Units. If, after
the Effective Time, Company Unit Certificates are presented to the Surviving

Unitholders' Representative for exchange as provided in this Section 2.17.

Article 7 
 Covenants of PEG Holdings

  



  

Section 7.01  _Tax Matters_. (a) The parties intend that, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes and in accordance with Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1991-1 C.B.
432, the Merger shall be treated (A) with respect to the Unitholders, as a
sale of their Company Units and (B) with respect to Purchaser, as a purchase
of all of the assets and assumption of all of the liabilities of the Acquired
Companies (other than PEG Bandwidth NY I, Inc.) and a purchase of the stock
of PEG Bandwidth NY I, Inc. Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Company, each of the Acquired Companies and each Unitholder agree
to prepare and file their income Tax Returns consistently with the foregoing
treatment.

  



    

55

 



    

 (b)  The Tax Consideration shall be allocated among the underlying assets
of the Acquired Companies in accordance with the rules of Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the "Purchase Price
Allocation"). No later than 120 days following the Closing Date, Parent shall
deliver a draft Purchase Price Allocation to the Unitholders'
Representative for its review and comment. If, within 30 days after the
delivery of the draft Purchase Price Allocation, the
Unitholders' Representative notifies Parent in writing that the Unitholders'
Representative objects to any allocation set forth thereon, Parent and the
Unitholders' Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
objection. In the event that Parent and the Unitholders' Representative are
unable to resolve such dispute within 20 days following the Unitholders'
Representative's notification of such objection, Parent and the Unitholders'
Representative shall submit the disputed items to the Accounting Referee for
resolution. Upon resolution of the disputed items, the allocation reflected on
the Purchase Price Allocation shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution.
The fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne one-half by
Parent, on the one hand, and one-half by the Unitholders' Representative (for
the account of the Unitholders), on the other hand. Parent, the Unitholders,
the Acquired Companies and their respective Affiliates shall file all Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with the final Purchase Price Allocation. Any
adjustments to the Tax Consideration shall be allocated in a manner that is
consistent with the final Purchase Price Allocation.

  



  

 (c)  Parent shall cause all Transfer Taxes to be remitted to the
appropriate Taxing Authority when due, and shall cause all necessary Tax
Returns to be filed with respect to all such Taxes, and, if required by
Applicable Law, the Unitholders will, and will cause their respective
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns. One half of all
Transfer Taxes shall be borne by Parent, and the other half shall be borne by
the Unitholders' Representative (for the account of the Unitholders).

  



  

(d)  (i) The Unitholders' Representative shall cause to be prepared, and
Parent agrees to promptly cause the Surviving Company to file when so
directed by the Unitholders' Representative, all U.S. federal and state
partnership income Tax Returns for the Company that solely relate to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period and are filed after the Closing Date. All costs and
expenses of preparing and filing such Tax Returns shall be borne by the
Unitholders' Representative (for the account of the
Unitholders). Unitholders' Representative shall (1) provide Parent with a
copy of each such Tax Return at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the
earlier of (x) the date such Tax Return is filed and (y) the due date for
filing such return (taking into account any extensions thereof) and (2)
promptly deliver such additional information regarding such Tax Return as may
be reasonably be requested by Parent. Unitholders' Representative shall
reasonably and in good faith consider any revisions to such Tax Returns as
are requested by Surviving Company, provided that such revisions are requested
no more than 15 days after such Tax Return is delivered to Parent. The
Unitholders shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction or other Tax items
for such periods on their Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the
Schedules K-1 furnished by the Surviving Company to the Unitholders for such
periods.

  



  

(ii)  Except as set forth in Section 7.01(d)(i), Parent shall prepare or
cause to be prepared and cause to be filed all Tax Returns of the Acquired
Companies required to be filed following the Closing Date. To the extent that
any such Tax Return includes a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Parent shall (A)
provide the Unitholders' Representative with a copy of each such draft Tax
Return at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the earlier of

  



    

56

 



    

(x) the date such Tax Return is filed and (y) the due date for filing such
return (taking into account any extensions thereof) and (B) promptly deliver
such additional information regarding such Tax Return as may reasonably be
requested by the Unitholders' Representative. Parent shall reasonably and in
good faith consider any revisions to such Tax Returns as are requested by the
Unitholders' Representative, provided that such revisions are requested no
more than 15 days after such Tax Return is delivered to the
Unitholders' Representative. Any Covered Taxes for any Tax Period with
respect to which such Tax Returns were filed shall be borne by the
Unitholders' Representative (for the account of the Unitholders) as provided
in Article 10\. To the extent permitted under Applicable Law, Parent and the
Unitholders agree to cause the Acquired Companies to file all Tax Returns for
the periods including the Closing Date on the basis that the relevant Tax
period ended on the Closing Date.

  



  

(iii)  Parent shall not, and shall not cause any of the Acquired Companies
to, (A) amend any Tax Returns of any of the Acquired Companies with respect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (B) make any Tax election in respect of any
of the Acquired Companies that has retroactive effect to any Tax Return for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each such case, except (1) if such action
would have no effect on the liability of the Unitholders' Representative (for
the account of the Unitholders) to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties
hereunder, (2) with the prior written consent of the Unitholders'
Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned) or (3) if such amended Tax Return relates to a property Tax and
the amount of such property Tax shown as due on such amended Tax return is
consistent with the accruals for such property Tax that were taken into
account in the calculation of Final Closing Working Capital, Parent shall be
permitted to file original Tax returns relating to a property Tax for Pre-
Closing Tax Periods; provided that the amount of such property Tax shown as
due on such original Tax Returns is consistent with the accruals for such
property tax that were taken into account in the calculation of Final
Closing Working Capital..

  



  

 (e)  Parent and the Unitholders and their respective Affiliates shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes of any of the Acquired Companies. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party's reasonable
request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such audit or other proceeding and within such
party's possession or obtainable without material cost or expense, and making
employees or other representatives available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder.

  



  

 (f)  For purposes of the determination of Covered Taxes in respect of a
Straddle Tax Period, (x) in the case of any Taxes other than escheat, gross
receipts, sales or use Taxes and Taxes based upon or related to income,
Covered Taxes shall be deemed to include the amount of such Tax for the
entire Straddle Tax Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Straddle Tax Period ending on and including the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Straddle Tax Period, and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to
income and any escheat, gross receipts, sales or use Tax, the definition of
Covered Taxes shall be deemed to include the amount that would be payable if
the relevant Straddle Tax Period ended on and included the Closing Date. The
amount of any item

  



    

57

 



    

that is taken into account only once for each taxable period (e.g., the
benefit of graduated Tax rates, exemption amounts, etc.) shall be
allocated between the two portions of the Straddle Tax Period in proportion
to the number of days in each portion.

  



  

 (g)  Parent shall have the right to control the conduct of any Tax audit or
administrative or judicial proceeding or of any demand or claim on the
Surviving Company or any of the Acquired Companies relating to Taxes
(collectively, a "Tax Contest") which could give rise to an indemnification
claim under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the
Unitholders' Representative shall be entitled to participate in such Tax
Contest at its sole expense (including having the opportunity to consult with
Parent regarding significant actions and the opportunity to review and comment
on significant written materials furnished in connection with such actions)
and (ii) Parent shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Contest
without obtaining the prior written consent of the Unitholders'
Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

  



  

 (h)  To the extent that any obligation or responsibility pursuant to
Article 11 may conflict with any obligation or responsibility pursuant to
this Section 7.01, the provisions of this Section 7.01 shall control.

  



  

 (i)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
provisions of this Section 7.01 shall survive for the full period of all
applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or
extension thereof).

  



  

Section 7.02  _Exclusivity_. From the date hereof until the Closing, except
for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and PEG
Holdings shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, enter into
any contract, or encourage or entertain the submission of any proposal or
offer from any Person relating to the direct or indirect acquisition of any
of PEG Holdings' or the Company's equity or any Company Units or all or any
material portion of the capital stock or other equity interests or the assets
of the Company (other than the acquisition of inventory in the ordinary
course of business) or PEG Holdings, any of the Acquired Companies (including
any acquisition structured as a merger, consolidation, or exchange or
otherwise by operation of law) or participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, furnishing any information with respect to, assisting
or participating in, or knowingly facilitating in any other manner any
effort or attempt by any Person to do or seek any of the foregoing. Each of
the Company and PEG Holdings shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Parent, Purchaser and
Merger Sub) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the matters addressed
in this Section 7.02.

  



  

Section 7.03  _Confidentiality_. PEG Holdings acknowledges that the success
of the Acquired Companies after the Closing depends upon the continued
preservation of the confidentiality of information regarding the business,
operations and affairs of the Acquired Companies (including trade secrets,
confidential information and proprietary materials, which may include the
following categories of information and materials: methods, procedures,
computer programs and architecture, databases, customer information, lists and
identities, employee lists and identities, pricing information, research,
methodologies, contractual forms,

  



    

58

 



    

and other information, whether tangible or intangible, which is not publicly
available generally) (collectively, "Confidential Information") accessed or
possessed by PEG Holdings and its Affiliates and that the preservation of the
confidentiality of such Confidential Information by PEG Holdings and its
Affiliates is an essential premise of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Accordingly, PEG Holdings hereby agrees that from and after the
Closing Date, PEG Holdings will not, and will not permit its Affiliates
or its and their Representatives to, disclose or use (other than for or on
behalf of Parent, the Surviving Company or their respective Affiliates,
including the Acquired Companies), any Confidential Information of the
Acquired Companies; _provided_ , _however_ , that Confidential Information
shall not include (i) any information generally available to, or known by, the
public (other than as a result of disclosure in violation hereof), (ii)
information lawfully acquired after the Closing Date by PEG Holdings or
its Affiliates or its and their Representatives from sources other than
Parent, the Surviving Company and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives (including the Acquired Companies) (provided that such sources
are not known by such party to be bound by a confidentiality agreement or
other known restriction on disclosing the information), (iii) information
independently developed by PEG Holdings or its Affiliates without reliance
on, or reference to, the Acquired Companies' Confidential Information, (iv)
information the disclosure of which is required by Applicable Law (but only to
the extent that such information is required by Applicable Law to be
disclosed and subject to the requirement that the disclosing party use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek a protective order causing such
information so disclosed to be kept confidential) or (v) financial and tax
related financial information to the extent related to any period prior to
Closing (to the extent used or disclosed for a bona fide business purpose of
the disclosing party). The covenant set forth in this Section 7.03 shall
terminate five years after the Closing Date.

obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in

 (b)  From the date hereof until the Closing, the provisions set forth in
Section 7(c)(i) of the Certificate of Designations shall apply as though the

Section 8.02  _Employee Matters._ (a) For a period of one year following the
Closing Date (or such shorter period of employment, as the case may be),
Parent shall provide (or cause to be provided) to each Acquired Company
Employee who is employed by the Acquired Companies on the Closing Date (each,
a "Covered Employee"): (i) base salary and short-term cash incentive
opportunities (including such opportunities under sales and commission plans
and programs), in each case, that are no less favorable than the base salary
and short-term cash incentive opportunities (including such opportunities
under sales and commission plans and programs) in effect immediately prior to
the Closing Date (excluding, in each case, transaction based bonus
opportunities or other similar extraordinary compensation arrangements under
the Employee Plans) and (ii) employee benefits that are substantially

individuals who are currently or formerly employed or engaged by AP Service
Company, LLC in the Employee Plans.

  



  

 (b)  With respect to any employee benefit plan of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in which any Covered Employee becomes a participant following
the Closing, such employee shall receive full credit for such employee's
service with the Acquired Companies to the same extent that such service was
recognized under an analogous plan of the Acquired Companies in which
such Covered Employee participated as of immediately prior to the Closing for
vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes,
except for vacation and severance, as applicable); provided that the foregoing
shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits.

  



  

 (c)  In the event of any change in the welfare benefits provided to an
Acquired Company Employee following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions and all waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
each Acquired Company Employee under any welfare benefit plan in which an
Acquired Company Employee is eligible to participate on or after the Closing
Date to the same extent as such conditions and waiting periods have been
waived under the applicable Employee Plans and (ii) credit each Acquired
Company Employee for any co-payments, deductibles and other out-of-pocket
expenses paid prior to the Closing Date under the terms of any corresponding
Employee Plan in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-
pocket requirements for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs under
any welfare benefit plan in which the Acquired Company Employee participates
on and after the Closing Date.

  



  

 (d)  Nothing in this Section 8.02 shall (i) be treated as an amendment of,
or undertaking to amend, any Employee Plan, (ii) prohibit Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries from amending any Employee Plan, (iii) require Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries to continue the employment of any Acquired Company
Employee for any period of time or, subject to any applicable arrangement
covering such employee, to provide such employee with any payments or
benefits upon any termination of such employee's employment or (iv) confer
any rights or benefits on any Person other than the parties to this Agreement.

acts, omissions, transactions, matters, causes or events occurring prior to,
contemporaneously with or up to and including the Closing Date, (ii) the
approval or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or by any
Transaction Document or any other agreement contemplated herein or therein,

contrary, this Unitholder Release and related covenant not to sue will not be
effective so as to benefit a particular Parent Released Party in connection
with any matter or event that would otherwise constituted released matter, but
involved fraud or criminal behavior on the part of such Parent Released
Party.

  



  

 (b)  From and after the Closing, subject to the proviso set forth below in
this Section 9.05(b), each of the Parent and the Surviving Company, on behalf
of itself, its Affiliates and any of their respective successors, assigns,

"Released Parties"), from any and all Liability that any of the Unitholder
Released Parties may have to any of the Parent Releasing Parties, in any

foregoing Parent Release shall limit in any manner any rights (w) in
respect of performance obligations after the Closing Date under any
employment, consulting or other similar arrangements with a
Unitholder Released Party, (x) to enforce Parent's or the Surviving Company's
rights under this Agreement or any Transaction Document and (y) to
indemnification under Article 11\. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, this Parent Release and related covenant not to sue will not be

and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all Damages incurred or
suffered by any of the Parent Indemnified Parties arising out of or resulting
from

  



  

 (A)  any breach of any Fundamental Representation made by PEG Holdings

Agreement; and

  



  

(iii)  any costs, fees and expenses (including any Taxes) incurred by such
Unitholder and its Affiliates or any Acquired Company or any of their
respective Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by
Section 6.05;

  



  

 _ _provided__ ;  _ _however__ , that only such Unitholders and their
Affiliates and their respective successors and assignees who
receive Convertible Preferred Shares and/or Parent Common Stock under Article
2 of this Agreement shall be indemnified for breaches of any representation
or warranty in Section 5.10 (such breaches, "Parent Warranty Breaches") made
by Parent, Purchaser or Merger Sub; __provided__ , __further__ , that in the
case of indemnification for Parent Warranty Breaches (1) Parent shall not be
liable for any Damages related to a Parent Warranty Breach unless the
aggregate amount of Damages with respect to such Parent Warranty Breach
exceeds $1,500,000 (the "Basket Amount") and then only to the extent such
aggregate amount exceeds the Basket Amount; and (2) Parent's maximum liability
for all such Parent Warranty Breaches shall not exceed $106,000,000;

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Unitholders'
Representative shall have the sole right to enforce the indemnity set forth
in Section 11.02(b) on behalf of the Unitholders.

  



  

Section 11.03  _Procedures._ (a) The party seeking indemnification under
Section 11.02 (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give prompt notice in
writing to the party against whom indemnity is to be sought (or to the
Unitholders' Representative in the case of an indemnification claim pursuant
to Section 11.02(a)) (the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim
or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding ("Claim") in respect of
which indemnity may be sought under such Section 11.02. Such notice shall set
forth in reasonable detail such Claim and the basis for indemnification
(taking into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party).
The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such
failure shall have materially and adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying
Party.

  



  

 (b)  The Indemnifying Party (or the Unitholders' Representative in the case
of an indemnification claim pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(i)) shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of any Claim asserted by any third
party ("Third Party Claim") and, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 11.03, shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for such
defense, in each case at its own expense.

  



  

 (c)  If the Indemnifying Party (or the Unitholders' Representative in the
case of an indemnification claim pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(i)) desires to
assume the control of the defense of any Third Party Claim in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 11.03, the Indemnifying Party shall give
written notice to the Indemnified Party within twenty days after the
Indemnified Party has given written notice to the Indemnifying Party (or the
Unitholders' Representative in the case of an indemnification claim pursuant
to Section 11.02(a)(i)) of the Third Party Claim. If such notice is timely
given, the Indemnifying Party (or the Unitholders'

  



    

71

 



    

Representative in the case of an indemnification claim pursuant to Section
11.02(a)(i)) shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for such
defense so long as (i) the Third Party Claim involves primarily a claim for
monetary damages and any claim for an order, injunction or other equitable
relief or relief for other than monetary damages against the Indemnified Party
as part of such claim is a frivolous or de minimis aspect of such claim (
_provided_ that if the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or other
equitable relief or relief for other than monetary Damages against the
Indemnified Party that are more than frivolous or de minimis and the
Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after conferring with its outside
counsel, that the portion of such claim relating to the order, injunction or
other equitable relief or relief for other than monetary Damages can be
readily separated from any related claim for monetary Damages, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the control of the defense of
the portion relating to monetary Damages), (ii) the Indemnifying Party
provides the Indemnified Party with (x) evidence reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party will have adequate financial
resources to defend against the Third Party Claim and fulfill its
indemnification obligations hereunder and (y) a statement that, based on the
facts set forth in the notice required by Section 11.03, the Indemnifying
Party would have an indemnity obligation for the Damages resulting from such
Third Party Claim, and (iii) the Third Party Claim does not relate to or
otherwise arise in connection with any criminal or regulatory enforcement
action.

  



  

 (d)  If the Indemnifying Party (or the Unitholders' Representative in the
case of an indemnification claim pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(i)) is
controlling the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party before entering
into any settlement, compromise or discharge of such Third Party Claim;
_provided _ that the Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement,
compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party
may recommend and that by its terms (i) obligates the Indemnifying Party to
pay the full amount of the Damages in connection with such Third Party Claim
and the Indemnifying Party has the financial ability to pay the full amount of
such Damages and which releases in full the Indemnified Party completely in
connection with such Third Party Claim, (ii) does not impose injunctive or
equitable relief or require an admission of liability or wrongdoing on behalf
of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates and (iii) contains a full and
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from all
Damages and obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim.

  



  

 (e)  If the Indemnifying Party does not timely deliver the notice
contemplated by Section 11.03(c), or if such notice is given on a timely
basis but any of the other conditions in Section 11.03(c) is unsatisfied, the
Indemnified Party may defend, and may consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to, the Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.03 to the contrary,
whether or not the Indemnifying Party controls the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to,
or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
Indemnifying Party's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ that the
Indemnified Party may admit liability with respect to, or settle, compromise
or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior
written consent so long as the Indemnified Party releases, to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Indemnifying Party, any claims to indemnification with
respect to such Third Party Claim pursuant to this Article 11.

  



    

72

 



    

 (f)  In circumstances where the Indemnifying Party is controlling the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim and to employ separate
counsel of its choice for such purpose, in which case the fees and expenses
of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified Party; _provided_
 that in such event the Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees and expenses of
such separate counsel (1) incurred by the Indemnified Party prior to the date
the Indemnifying Party assumes control of the defense of the Third Party Claim
(other than during any period in which the Indemnified Party failed to give
notice of the Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 11.03(a)), (2)
if representation of both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by
the same counsel would create a conflict of interest or (3) if counsel chosen
by the Indemnifying Party requests a conflict wavier or other waiver from the
Indemnified Party with respect to such matter.

  



  

 (g)  Each of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense
or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall promptly furnish or cause to
be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  



  

Section 11.04  _Calculation of Damages._ The amount of any Damages payable
under Section 11.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any amounts
recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies (net of
any costs or expenses incurred in the collection thereof, including
deductibles and net of any applicable premium adjustments).

  



  

Section 11.05  _Characterization of Indemnification Payments._ Any amount
paid by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party in respect of any Claim
pursuant to this Article 11 shall be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment
to the Tax Consideration.

  



  

Section 11.06  _Exclusivity of Remedy_. Subject to Section 13.12, the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing, the
indemnification provisions in this Article 11 shall be the sole and exclusive
monetary remedy of any party with respect to any and all claims arising out
of or in connection with breaches of representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, other than claims for fraud.

  



  

Section 11.07  _Mitigation_. Parent, the Surviving Company and PEG Holdings
shall cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim for
Damages with respect to which one party is obligated to indemnify the other
party hereunder, including by making commercially reasonably efforts to
mitigate or resolve any such claim for Damages; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no party shall be required to make such efforts if they would be detrimental
in any material respect to such party. In the event that Parent,
the Surviving Company or PEG Holdings shall fail to make such commercially
reasonably efforts to mitigate or resolve any claim or liability, then
(unless the proviso to the foregoing sentence shall be applicable)
notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, the other
party shall not be required to indemnify any person for any Damages to the
extent that such Damages would reasonably be expected to have been avoided if
Parent, the Surviving Company or PEG Holdings, as the case may be, had
made such commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate. __

Section 11.08  _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify
and hold harmless any party (i) pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(i)(A), Section
11.02(a)(ii)(A) or Section 11.02(b)(i) shall terminate when the applicable
representation or warranty terminates pursuant to Section 11.01, (ii)
pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(i)(B), Section 11.02(a)(ii)(B) or Section
11.02(b)(ii) shall terminate when the applicable covenant terminates pursuant
to Section 11.01; and (iii) pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(i)(C), Section

 Termination

shall not have been consummated on or before the date that is five months
after the date hereof (such date, as it may be extended by the second proviso
below, the "End Date"); _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 12.01(b) shall not be available to Merger Sub, if
the Merger Sub's or Parent's, or to the Unitholders' Representative, if PEG
Holdings' or the Company's, breach of any provision of this Agreement results
in the failure of the Closing to occur by such time;  _provided, further_ ,
that if on the date that is five months after the date hereof, any of the
conditions set forth in Article 10 are not satisfied due solely to any
Required Governmental Approvals not having been obtained, and all of the other
conditions set forth in Article 10 are satisfied (other than the Closing Date
Conditions, _provided_ that the Closing Date Conditions would reasonably be
expected to be satisfied at Closing if Closing were to occur on the date that
is five months after the Closing Date), then either the Unitholders'
Representative or Merger Sub shall have the right, in its sole discretion, by
providing written notice to the other party, to extend the date referred to
above in this clause (b) for a period not to exceed 120 days;

  



  

(c)  by either the Unitholders' Representative or Merger Sub if there shall
be any Applicable Law that makes consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby

  



    

76

 



    

illegal or otherwise prohibited or if consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby would violate any nonappealable final order, decree or
judgment of any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction; and

  



  

(d)  by either the Unitholders' Representative or Merger Sub if there has
been a misrepresentation or breach of warranty or breach of covenant or other
agreement set forth in this Agreement by Parent or the Merger Sub (in the case
of termination by the Unitholders' Representative) or by PEG Holdings or the
Company (in the case of termination by Merger Sub) that would cause the
condition set forth in Section 10.03(a) or Section 10.03(b) (in the case of
termination by the Unitholders' Representative) or Section 10.02(a), Section
10.02(b) or Section 10.02(c) (in the case of termination by Merger Sub) not
to be satisfied, and either (A) the relevant party is not using its reasonable
best efforts to cure such misrepresentation or breach as promptly as
practicable or (B) such condition is incapable of being satisfied by the End
Date.

permitted by Section 12.01, such termination shall be without liability of
any party (or any equityholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant

breach by any party hereto of any representation or warranty or agreement

incurred or suffered by any other party as a result of such failure or breach.
The provisions of this Section 12.02 and Article 13 (other than Section
13.12) shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 12.01.
