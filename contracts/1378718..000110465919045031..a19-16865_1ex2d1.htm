performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, and
(y) approved the Support Agreement and the execution, delivery and performance
thereof.

has guaranteed payment of certain of Parents and Merger Subs obligations
under this Agreement, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
the Guaranty.

 



 

G. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to enter
into this Agreement, certain of the Companys stockholders are entering into a
support agreement with Parent in respect of the Shares beneficially owned by
such stockholders (the " _Support Agreement_ ").

 



 

 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and the covenants,
premises, representations and warranties and agreements contained in this
Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound,

ARTICLE 1 ** 
THE MERGER**

 



 

1.1 _The Merger_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ")
and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger shall be effected pursuant
to the DGCL and shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at the Effective Time all of the property, rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the necessity
of further action by the Company or any other Person, the certificate of
incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.
In addition, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall take all
necessary action such that, at the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall
take all necessary action such that the directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time or such other individuals designated by Parent as
of the Effective Time shall become the directors of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold office, from and after the Effective Time, in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.
The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and
after the Effective Time, shall continue as the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

1.2 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the
" _Closing_ ") will take place at 9:00 a.m., local time, on the third (3rd)
Business Day after satisfaction or waiver by the party entitled to such waiver
of all of the applicable conditions set forth in _Article 6_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver by the party entitled to such waiver of
those conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 555
Eleventh Street, Washington, District of Columbia 20004 (it being understood
and agreed that the Closing may take place by conference call and/or
electronic delivery (e.g., email/PDF) of signatures), unless another time,
date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Parent shall not be required to consummate the Transactions prior to the
earlier of (i) a date during the Marketing Period specified by Parent on no
less than two (2) Business Days notice to the Company and (ii) the third
(3rd) Business Day after the end of the Marketing Period. The date on which
the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ". On the
Closing Date, or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree to,
Merger Sub or the Company shall cause a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ "), to be executed and filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the DGCL and shall make all other filings required under the DGCL. The Merger
shall become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger shall have been
duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later
date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (such date and time at which the Merger becomes
effective hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

ARTICLE 2 ** 
CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER**

 



 

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled pursuant to
_Section 2.1(b)_ or Dissenting Shares, shall be converted automatically into
the right to receive $11.05 per Share in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_
"), without interest, subject to any

 



     

 

 



 

withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law as provided in _Section 2.5_,
upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
_Section 2.2_. As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall
automatically cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with _Section 2.2_
without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable
Law as provided in _Section 2.5_.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. Each Share held
by the Company as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or Merger Sub (or
any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub), in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect
thereof.

 



 

(c) _Merger Sub Equity Interests_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be converted into and become one newly and validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
a reputable institution with experience as a paying agent to act as the paying
agent (the identity and terms of designation and appointment of which shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Company) for purposes of effecting the payment of
the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger in accordance with this
_Article 2_ (the " _Paying Agent_ "). Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid,
the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the
aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares (other than Company
Restricted Shares which will be treated in accordance with _Section 2.4(e)_)
shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. In the
event such deposited funds are insufficient to make the payments contemplated
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent such additional funds to ensure that the
Paying Agent has sufficient funds to make such payments. Such funds shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent, pending payment thereof by
the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares in accordance with this _Article
2_; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such investments shall be in obligations
of, or guaranteed by, the United States government or rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moodys Investor Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive
property of the Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall
accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares.

 



 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 



 

(i) _Certificates_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that
was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares
formerly represented by certificates (the

 



     

 

 



 

" _Certificates_ "), which Shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (A) a
letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as
provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in
such customary form and have such other provisions as Parent, the Company and
the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree prior to the Effective Time; and (B)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) to the
Paying Agent in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as
provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) to the Paying Agent, together with delivery of
a letter of transmittal and such other customary documents as may reasonably
be requested by the Paying Agent, duly executed and in proper form, with
respect to such Certificates, the holder of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly represented by such Certificates (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.5_), and any Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not recorded in the transfer books of the Company,
payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered if, as a
condition precedent of payment, the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and be
accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such
transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid to Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent (as directed by Parent) any
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
required to be paid. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable
upon due surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated
hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as
contemplated by this Agreement, except for Certificates representing Shares
that are Dissenting Shares, which shall be deemed to represent the right to
receive payment of the fair value of such Shares in accordance with and to the
extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.

 



 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, except as provided otherwise in _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_ in
respect of Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares, no holder of non-certificated Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall be required to
deliver a Certificate or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held
through The Depository Trust Company, an executed letter of transmittal to the
Paying Agent, to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled
to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. In lieu thereof, (A) Parent and the
Company shall cooperate to establish, prior to the Closing, procedures with
the Paying Agent and The Depository Trust Company to ensure that the Paying
Agent will transmit to The Depository Trust Company or its nominee as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, upon surrender of such Book-Entry Shares
held of record by The Depository Trust Company or its nominee in accordance
with The Depository Trust Companys customary surrender procedures, the Merger
Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 2.5_) for each such Book-Entry Share and (B) each holder
of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust
Company whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall

 



     

 

 



 

automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver to The Depository Trust Company or
its nominee as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of
each such Book-Entry Share a cash amount in immediately available funds equal
to the Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.5_), and such Book-Entry Shares of
such holder shall be cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration with
respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name
such Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest will be paid or accrued on
any amount payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Shares. Until paid or
surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, except for
Book-Entry Shares representing Shares that are Dissenting Shares, which shall
be deemed to represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such
Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL.

 



 

(iii) _Non-DTC Book Entry Shares._ As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time (and in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
holder of record of Book-Entry Shares not held through The Depository Trust
Company (" _Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares_ ") a notice advising such holders of
the effectiveness of the Merger. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Non-DTC
Book-Entry Shares by book-receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent,
the holder of each such Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the
Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 2.5_), and each such Book-Entry Share shall at the
Effective Time be cancelled.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. From and after
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or acceptable evidence of Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason (including, without
limitation, with respect to any Dissenting Shares which cease to be Dissenting
Shares), they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as
provided in this Agreement. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender
of Certificates (or receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message", in
the case of Book-Entry Shares) in accordance with the terms of this _Article
2_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. Any portion of
the funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made
available to the Paying Agent that was not disbursed to or remains unclaimed
by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the nine (9) month
anniversary of the Effective Time will be returned to the Surviving
Corporation or an affiliate thereof designated by the Surviving Corporation,
upon demand, and any such holder who has not tendered his, her or its
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares

 



     

 

 



 

for the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_ prior to
such time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for delivery of the Merger
Consideration as general creditors thereof, without interest and subject to
any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law as provided in _Section
2.5_, in respect of such holders surrender of their Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_. Any
Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity will, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation or an affiliate thereof designated by the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective affiliates will be
liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section
2.2(a)_, to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected
shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand.

 



 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation) of that fact by the holder thereof (together with the
delivery of the other applicable items referred to in _Section 2.2(b)_), the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_.
Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the
payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in a reasonable sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect
to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary (but subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.3_), Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares
cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_) and held by a holder who has
neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who
shall have properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights in respect of
such Shares pursuant to and in full compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL
and has not effectively withdrawn such demand (such Shares, the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the
Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be
cancelled and cease to exist, and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall only
be entitled to the rights granted to them under Section 262 of the DGCL. If
any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his,
her or its right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other
applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed
to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be
exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be
paid in accordance with _Section 2.2_, without interest and subject to any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law as provided in _Section 2.5_.
The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of Shares and

 



     

 

 



 

any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
relating to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or
compromise, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands,
or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

2.4 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time, each option to purchase
Shares (each a " _Company Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof or the Company,
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (without interest) an
amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject
to the Company Option _multiplied by_ (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the per-share exercise price of such Company Option;
_provided_ that any such Company Option with respect to which the per-share
exercise price subject thereto is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration shall be canceled for no consideration.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding award of Company restricted stock units (" _Company RSUs_ ") shall
become fully vested and shall, automatically and without any required action
on the part of the holder thereof or the Company, be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to (x)
the total number of Shares underlying such award of Company RSUs, _multiplied
by_ (y) the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
unvested restricted Share (each a " _Company Restricted Share_ ") shall become
fully vested and non-forfeitable and converted into a right to receive
(without interest) an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(d) _Treatment of Performance Share Units_. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding award of Company performance share units (" _Company PSUs_ ") that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
converted into a fully vested right to receive a cash amount (without
interest) equal to the Merger Consideration _multiplied by_ the Applicable
Percentage of the target number of Shares underlying such Company PSUs. The "
_Applicable Percentage_ " shall be 100%, except that in the case of the
tranches of Company PSUs outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that were granted in connection with the Companys fiscal year 2018 and 2019
annual grants for which the applicable performance periods end prior to the
Effective Time, the Applicable Percentage shall be such percentage as
determined by the Company Board (in good faith) based on actual performance
pursuant to the terms of the applicable award agreement governing such
applicable Company PSUs (but in no case shall such percentage be less than
100% or exceed 200%) (and, in making such determination, the Company Board
shall not exercise any upward discretion).

 



 

(e) _Payment by Surviving Corporation_. The Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holders of Company
Options,

 



     

 

 



 

Company RSUs, Company Restricted Shares and Company PSUs the amounts described
in _Sections 2.4(a)_ through _2.4(d)_ , less Taxes required to be withheld
with respect to such payments, as soon as practicable following the Closing
Date, through the Surviving Corporations payroll system, but not later than
the first payroll date that is at least ten (10) Business Days following the
Closing Date.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Company Equity Plans_. As of the Effective Time, the
Companys 2011 Equity Incentive Award Plan and 2014 Incentive Award Plan
(together, the " _Company Equity Plan_ ") shall be terminated and no further
Shares, Company Options, Company RSUs, Company Restricted Shares, Company
PSUs, Equity Interests or other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted
thereunder. Following the Effective Time, no such Company Option, Company RSU,
Company Restricted Share, Company PSU or Equity Interest that was outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and each
former holder of any such Company Option, Company RSU, Company Restricted
Share, Company PSU or Equity Interest shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration set forth in
this _Section 2.4_.

 



 

(g) _Board Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and
take such other actions as are reasonably necessary and appropriate (including
using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any required consents) (after
review by Parent of, and incorporation of Parents reasonable comments with
respect to, the forms thereof) to effect the transactions described in this
_Section 2.4_.

 



 

2.5 _Withholding Rights_. The Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder or any other provision of applicable
Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 



 

2.6 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
in the event that, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
any change in the number of outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis shall
occur as a result of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of Equity Interests convertible into
or exchangeable for Shares), recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other similar event, the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such event and to provide to holders of Shares
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.6_ shall be deemed to
permit or authorize the Company to take any such action or effect any such
change that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to take pursuant to
_Section 5.1_.

 



      

 

 



 

ARTICLE 3 ** 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

Except (a) as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to
Parent and Merger Sub (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") prior to the
execution of this Agreement (with specific reference to the representations
and warranties in this _Article 3_ to which the information in such schedule
relates; _provided_ , that, disclosure in the Company Disclosure Letter as to
a specific representation or warranty shall qualify any other representation
or warranty contained in this _Article 3_ to the extent (notwithstanding the
absence of a specific cross reference) it is reasonably apparent on its face
that such disclosure relates to such other representation or warranty), and
(b) as otherwise disclosed or identified in the Company SEC Documents (other
than the "Forward Looking Statements" or "Risk Factors" sections of the
Company SEC Documents or any other language contained in any section of any
Company SEC Document that is predictive or forward-looking), filed and
publicly available at least two Business Days prior to the date of this
Agreement, without giving effect to any subsequent amendment or supplement to
any Company SEC Document, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent
and Merger Sub as follows:

 



 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 



 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The
Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires such licensing or
qualification, except where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in
good standing, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
copies of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company
Charter_ ") and Bylaws of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), as most
recently filed with the Company SEC Documents, are true, complete and correct
copies of such documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and
the Company has made such copies available to Parent. The Company is not in
violation of any of the provisions of the Company Charter or the Company
Bylaws.

organized, validly existing and, to the extent such concept is recognized in
the applicable jurisdiction, in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite corporate or other
entity power and authority to own, lease and operate all of its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each
Subsidiary of the Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is,

good standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation
of its properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires such
licensing or qualification, except where the failure to be so licensed,
qualified or in good standing, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

3.2 _Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of nine hundred and
fifty million (950,000,000) Shares and fifty million (50,000,000) shares of
the

 



     

 

 



 

Companys preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (" _Company Preferred
Stock_ "). As of the close of business on August 7, 2019, (i) 99,749,063
Shares (other than treasury shares and excluding Company Restricted Shares)
were issued and outstanding, all of which were duly authorized and validly
issued in compliance with all applicable Law and are fully paid, nonassessable
and free of preemptive rights, (ii) no Shares were held in the treasury of the
Company or by its Subsidiaries, (iii) 2,502,996 Shares were subject to
outstanding Company Options, 915,671 Shares were subject to outstanding
Company RSUs, 83,322 Company Restricted Shares were outstanding, and a target-
level amount of 856,149 Shares were subject to Company PSUs and (iv) no shares

Options, Company RSUs, Company Restricted Shares and Company PSUs set forth on
the list delivered by the Company to Parent pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)_ of
this Agreement, there are no outstanding or existing (i) stock appreciation
rights, options, warrants, calls, subscriptions or other rights, convertible
securities, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is bound relating to the issued or unissued capital
stock or other Equity Interests of the Company, or securities convertible into
or exchangeable for such capital stock or other Equity Interests, or
obligating the Company to issue or sell any shares of its capital stock or
other Equity Interests, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
such capital stock of, or other Equity Interests in, the Company, (ii)
agreements or obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any capital stock or other Equity
Interests of the Company, or (iii) voting trusts or similar agreements to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the
voting of any shares of capital stock or other Equity Interests of the
Company. Since the close of business on August 7, 2019, the Company has not
issued any shares of its capital stock or other Equity Interests (including
Company Restricted Shares), or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
such capital stock or other Equity Interests (including Company Restricted
Shares), and has not subjected any shares of its capital stock or other Equity
Interests to any Company Options, Company RSUs or Company PSUs) other than
those shares of capital stock reserved for issuance described in this _Section
3.2(a)_. Since the close of business on August 7, 2019, there have been no
declared or unpaid dividends or dividend equivalents with respect to any
outstanding Shares, Company Options, Company RSUs, Company Restricted Shares
or Company PSUs.

 



 

(b) _Section 3.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the
close of business on August 7, 2019, with respect to each outstanding Company
Option, Company RSU, Company Restricted Share and Company PSU, the date of
grant, the governing Company Equity Plan, the type of award, the number of
Shares subject to the award (and, if applicable, assuming achievement at both
target and maximum levels of performance), the vesting terms, the number of
underlying Shares vested and unvested, the scheduled distribution date for the

the exercise price and expiration date thereof. The maximum number of Shares
that may be earned with respect to the Company PSUs that are outstanding as of
the date of this Agreement is 200% of the target number of Shares underlying
such Company PSUs, except that in the case of the outstanding Company PSUs
granted in connection with the Companys Wesco2020 program, the maximum number
of Shares that may be earned is uncapped. The Company Board determined that
200% of Shares were earned with respect to the tranche of outstanding Company
PSUs granted in connection with the Companys fiscal year 2018 annual grant
for which the performance period ended on September 30, 2018. All Shares
subject to issuance under the Company Equity Plan,

specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly
authorized, validly issued in compliance with all applicable Law and the

on which stockholders of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may vote.

 



 

(d) _Section 3.2(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of all of the Subsidiaries of the Company (including the name,
the jurisdiction of organization and the Companys direct and indirect
ownership percentage in respect of each such Subsidiary) and the issued and
outstanding Equity Interests of each such Subsidiary. None of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries holds an Equity Interest in any other Person that is
not a Subsidiary. Each outstanding share of capital stock of or other Equity
Interest in each Subsidiary of the Company is duly authorized, validly issued
in compliance with all applicable Law, fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights and is owned, beneficially and of record, by the Company or
one or more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens other
than Permitted Share Liens. There are no options, warrants or other rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character to which any
Subsidiary of the Company is a party or by which any Subsidiary of the Company
is bound relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or other Equity
Interests of such Subsidiary, or securities convertible into or exchangeable
for such capital stock or other Equity Interests, or obligating any Subsidiary
of the Company to issue or sell any shares of its capital stock or other
Equity Interests, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such

to provide funds to, or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in, any Subsidiary of the Company or any other

obligations of any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company.

Governmental Entity before which any Proceeding seeking enforcement may be

takeover or similar Law (collectively, " _Anti-Takeover Law_ ") in effect on
the date hereof applies or purports to apply to this Agreement, the Support
Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions. The only vote of holders of
any class or series of shares of capital stock of the Company necessary to
adopt this Agreement is the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a
majority of the Shares outstanding and entitled to vote thereon at the Company
Meeting (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "). No other vote of the holders
of shares of capital stock of the Company is necessary to consummate the
Transactions. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has not waived or
amended (as applicable) any provisions of any confidentiality or standstill
agreement (or any similar agreement) to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party relating to any Acquisition Proposal or proposal that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal.

right of termination, modification, vesting, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any Contract or Permit
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is party (or by which any of
their respective properties or assets are bound), except, with respect to
clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults
or other occurrences which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

and Disclosure Controls; Off Balance Sheet Arrangements_.

 



 

(a) Since January 1, 2017, the Company has timely filed with or furnished to

Rule 15d-15 designed to ensure that all material information concerning the

processed, summarized and reported by, the individuals responsible for the

in accordance with GAAP, including policies and procedures that provide

detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys
and its Subsidiaries assets that could have a material effect on the
Companys financial statements. To the Companys Knowledge, since January 1,
2017, the Company has disclosed to the Companys auditors and the audit
committee of the Company Board any fraud or allegation of fraud known to the
Company, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company who have a significant role
in the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to

are defined in Rule 1-02(a)(4) of Regulation S-X) identified in managements

ended September 30, 2018 (nor has any such deficiency or weakness been

arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the

ARTICLE 4 ** 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB**

 



 

Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

 



 

4.1 _Corporate Organization_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation
or other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite

properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted.

 



 

4.2 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform and comply with each of its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Transactions applicable to such party. The
execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement, the
performance and compliance by each of Parent and Merger Sub with each of its
obligations herein and the consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of
the Transactions applicable to it have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, and other than, as of
the date of this Agreement, the adoption of this Agreement by Parent (or a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent) as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub and no
stockholder votes are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement or the consummation by
Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions to which it is a party. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub has duly and validly executed and delivered this
Agreement and, assuming the due and valid authorization, execution and
delivery by the Company of this Agreement, this Agreement constitutes Parents
and Merger Subs legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against each
of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, except as limited by
Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally, by general
equitable principles or by the discretion of any Governmental Entity before
which any Proceeding seeking enforcement may be brought (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

 



 

4.3 _No Conflicts; Required Filings and Consents_.

 



 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub,
does not and will not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub and the consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the
Transactions to which it is a party (including consummation of the Funds
Financing and the Pattonair Refinancing (as defined in the Debt Commitment
Letter)) will not, (i) conflict with or violate any provision of the
certificate of

 



     

 

 



 

incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational or governing documents of
Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals,
authorizations and permits described in _Section 4.3(b)_ have been obtained
and all filings and notifications described in _Section 4.3(b)_ have been
made and any waiting periods thereunder have terminated or expired, conflict
with or violate any Law applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Subsidiary of Parent (each a " _Parent Subsidiary_ " and, collectively, the "
_Parent Subsidiaries_ "), or by which any property or asset of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary is bound or affected or (iii) require any consent or
approval under, result in any breach of or any loss of any benefit under, or
constitute a default (or an event which with or without notice or lapse of
time or both would become a default) under any Contract or Permit to which
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party (or by which any of their
respective properties or assets are bound), except, with respect to clauses
(ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or
other occurrences which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
in _Section 3.4_, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by Parent and Merger Sub does not and will not, and the consummation by Parent
and Merger Sub of the Transactions (including consummation of the Funds
Financing and the Pattonair Refinancing (as defined in the Debt Commitment
Letter)) and compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with any of the terms or
provisions hereof will not (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both),
require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing or
registration with or notification to, any Governmental Entity, except (i)
under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the NYSE, (ii) any
applicable requirements of any Competition Laws listed in _Section
3.4(b)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter or French Foreign Investment
Regulations, (iii) the filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger as
required by the DGCL and (iv) where failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings, registrations
or notifications would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.4 _Litigation_. There is no Proceeding pending, or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and neither
Parent nor Merger Sub is subject to any outstanding Order that, individually
or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.5 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy
of the executed Debt Commitment Letter and Funds Commitment Letter. Neither of
the Commitment Letters has been amended or modified in any manner since Parent
provided, on or prior to the date of this Agreement, a fully executed copy of
such Commitment Letters dated as of the date hereof. Neither Parent nor any of
its affiliates has entered into any agreement, side letter or other
arrangement with respect to the Debt Financing relating to the Debt Commitment
Letter among the parties thereto that would add any condition precedent to
funding of the Debt Financing, reduce the amount of the Debt Financing below
an amount necessary (together with the Funds Financing) to fund all of the
amounts required to be provided by Parent or Merger Sub for the consummation
of the Transactions (including the payment of the Merger Consideration),
adversely affect the availability of the Debt Financing or delay or prevent
the Closing or make the funding of the Debt Financing less likely to occur.
Assuming the satisfaction of the closing

 



     

 

 



 

conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ and that the
Financing is funded in accordance with the Commitment Letters (including any
"market flex" provisions related thereto), the aggregate net proceeds of the
Financing (both before and after giving effect to the exercise of any or all
"market flex" provisions related thereto) when funded in accordance with the
terms of the Commitment Letters will be sufficient to consummate the
Transactions contemplated hereby, including the payment of the Merger
Consideration on the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, the respective
commitments contained in the Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn,
rescinded or repudiated in any respect. As of the date hereof, the Commitment
Letters are in full force and effect and represent a valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each other
party thereto, to provide the financing contemplated thereby subject only to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Commitment
Letters and except as limited by Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors
rights generally, by general equitable principles or by the discretion of any
Governmental Entity before which any Proceeding seeking enforcement may be
brought (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or
in equity). Parent has fully paid (or caused to be fully paid) any and all
commitment fees and other amounts that are due and payable by Parent on or
prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the Financing. As of
the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a material
breach or default on the part of Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any
other party thereto under any of the Commitment Letters. Assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_
and compliance by the Company with _Section 5.11_, Parent has no reason to
believe that it or any Financing Source or source of the Funds Financing or
any other party thereto will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term
or condition of the Commitment Letters required to be satisfied by it. As of
the date hereof, the only conditions precedent or other contingencies related
to the funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date that will be included
in the Debt Financing Documents shall be the conditions set forth in the
Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof. Parent understands and
acknowledges that under the terms of this Agreement, Parents obligation to
consummate the Merger is not in any way contingent upon or otherwise subject
to Parents consummation of any financing arrangements, Parents obtaining of
any financing or the availability, grant, provision or extension of any
financing to Parent.

 



 

4.6 _Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Guarantor has delivered to the Company the Guaranty dated as of the date
hereof. The Guaranty is in full force and effect and is a valid and binding
obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance
with its terms, except as limited by Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally, by general equitable principles or by the
discretion of any Governmental Entity before which any Proceeding seeking
enforcement may be brought (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding at law or in equity). No event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of
Guarantor under the Guaranty.

 



 

4.7 _Proxy Statement; Other Information_. None of the information supplied or
to be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the time that the Proxy Statement or
any amendment or supplement thereto is filed with the SEC, at the date that
the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto is mailed to
holders of Shares and at the time of the Company Meeting (as applicable),
contain

 



      

 

 



 

any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading
(except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub to
such portions thereof that relate to statements made or incorporated by
reference therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of Company for
inclusion).

 



 

4.8 _Ownership of Company Capital Stock_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any
Parent Subsidiary beneficially owns any Shares as of the date hereof. Other
than as a result of this Agreement and the Support Agreement, Parent nor
Merger Sub is, nor at any time during the last three years has it been, an
"interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL
(other than as contemplated by this Agreement).

 



 

4.9 _Solvency_. Assuming (i) the representations and warranties of the Company
are true and correct in all material respects (disregarding any references to
"Knowledge of the Company," "Company Material Adverse Effect," "materiality",
"in all material respects" or similar qualifications contained in such
representations or warranties), (ii) any estimates, projections or forecasts
of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been prepared by them in good faith
based upon assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable and (iii) all
material liabilities of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries are
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or in the Company SEC Documents
filed prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding "risk factors" sections
or any language in the Company SEC Documents that is predictive or forward-
looking or that is not factual information but merely cautionary language),
after giving effect to the payment of all amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions, payment of all related
fees and expenses and consummation of the Transactions (including the
Financing), Parent and its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub (taken as a
whole), will be Solvent as of the Effective Time. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ ," when used with respect to any Person, means
that, as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable
value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (i) the
value of all "liabilities of such person, including contingent and other
liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined
in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency
of debtors and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of such Person as such debts become absolute and mature, (b) such
Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital
for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged, and (c) such
Person will be able to pay its liabilities as they mature; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this definition shall take into account such Persons ability
to generate cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a
combination thereof, or raise additional capital by other means to meet its
obligations as they become due.

 



 

4.10 _Ownership of Parent and Merger Sub_. All of the outstanding Equity
Interests of Parent and Merger Sub have been duly authorized and validly
issued. All of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of Merger Sub are,
and at the Effective Time will be, owned directly or indirectly by Parent.
Merger Sub was formed solely for purposes of the Merger and, except for
matters incident to formation and execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the performance of the transactions contemplated hereby, has not prior to the
date hereof engaged in any business or other activities.

 



     

 

 



 

4.11 _No Stockholder and Management Arrangements_. Except for this Agreement
and the Support Agreements, or as expressly authorized by the Company Board,
neither Parent or Merger Sub, nor Platinum Equity Capital Partners
International IV (Cayman), L.P., a limited partnership under the laws of the
Cayman Islands or any of its controlled affiliates, is a party to any
Contracts, or has made or entered into any formal or informal arrangements or
other understandings (including as to continuing employment), with any
stockholder, director or officer of the Company relating to this Agreement,
the Merger or any other Transactions, or the operations of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its controlled affiliates, businesses or operations from
and after the Effective Time.

 



 

4.12 _Foreign Ownership and Control_. Consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not result in foreign control of the Company and/or
its Subsidiaries (within the meaning of the Foreign Investment Risk Review
Modernization Act of 2018 and the regulations promulgated hereunder) or the
consummation of any pilot program covered investment (within the meaning of
the regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Treasury
relating to the Pilot Program to Review Certain Transactions Involving Foreign
Persons and Critical Technology).

 



 

4.13 _Broker s Fees_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission for which the Company could
be responsible in connection with the Transactions based on arrangements made
by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates,
other than those that become payable by the Surviving Corporation following
the consummation of the Merger.

 



 

4.14 _Certain Subsidiaries of Parent_. The investment funds named in the Funds
Commitment Letter have the ability to cause the contribution of the "operating
entities of Pioneer Holdings, LLC" (within the meaning of the Debt Commitment
Letter) to Borrower (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter).

 



 

4.15 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Without limiting the
representations and warranties contained in _Article 3_ and any certificate
delivered by the Company pursuant to _Section 6.3_, each of Parent and Merger
Sub has conducted its own independent review and analysis of the business,
operations, assets, Intellectual Property, technology, liabilities, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company and each of them
acknowledges that it and its Representatives have received access to such
books and records, facilities, equipment, contracts and other assets of the
Company that it and its Representatives have requested to review, and that it
and its Representatives have had full opportunity to meet with the management
of the Company and to discuss the business and assets of the Company. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that neither the Company nor any Person on
behalf of the Company makes, and none of Parent or Merger Sub has relied upon,
any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information provided
to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Transactions including the
accuracy or completeness thereof other than the representations and warranties
contained in _Article 3_ and any certificate delivered by the Company
pursuant to _Section 6.3_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and
agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, except with
respect to common law fraud (with the element of scienter) and the
representations and warranties contained in _Article 3_ (as qualified

 



     

 

 



 

by the Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with this Agreement) or any
certificate delivered by the Company pursuant to _Section 6.3_, the Company
and its Subsidiaries, and their respective affiliates, stockholders,
controlling persons or Representatives shall not have any liability to Parent,
Merger Sub, any Parent Subsidiary, or their respective affiliates,
stockholders, controlling persons or Representatives on any basis (including
in contract or tort, under federal or state securities Laws or otherwise)
based upon any information (including any statement, document or agreement
delivered pursuant to this Agreement and any financial statements and any
projections, estimates or other forward-looking information) provided or made
available (including in any data rooms, management presentations, information
or descriptive memorandum or supplemental information), or statements made (or
any omissions therefrom), to Parent, Merger Sub, any Parent Subsidiary, or any
of their respective affiliates, stockholders, controlling persons or
Representatives.

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_, from and after the
date hereof, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and

to any physical or electronic data room and (z) except to the extent that the

faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that a failure to agree to a
waiver or amendment would reasonably be expected to violate its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, enforce, and
not waive or amend (as applicable), any provisions of any Anti-Takeover Law or
confidentiality or standstill agreement (or any similar agreement) to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party relating to any Acquisition
Proposal or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal or otherwise cause the terms of such agreement to be less
restrictive than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. Except as expressly
permitted by this _Section 5.3_, from and after the date hereof until the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, or, if earlier, the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Article 7_, the Company shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, propose or knowingly facilitate, induce or
encourage any inquiries with respect to, any effort or attempt to submit, or
the submission of, any proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, including by way of furnishing
any non-public information to any Third Party related to any potential
Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate or
engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto (other than
informing any Third Party of the existence of the provisions contained in this
_Section 5.3_), _except that,_ the Company may ascertain facts from any
Person making an Acquisition Proposal for the purpose of the Company Board
clarifying the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and the Third
Party making it in order to allow the Company Board to determine whether the
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal, provided, that the foregoing shall not permit any
negotiations or similar discussions with respect to such Acquisition Proposal
or any verbal expression of the Companys view or position with respect
thereto. Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_, from and after
the date hereof until the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, or, if
earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article 7_,
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall, directly or
indirectly, (i) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve,
adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) fail to make, withdraw, or
qualify (or change, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger
Sub) the Company Board Recommendation or the adoption or declaration of
advisability of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions by
the Company Board, (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve
or recommend, or cause or allow the Company or any of its controlled

have publicly announced an intention, whether or not conditional, to make an
Acquisition Proposal), (vi) fail to recommend, in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, against any
Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange

 



      

 

 



 

Act within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such Acquisition
Proposal, (vii) make any public statement inconsistent with the Company Board
Recommendation or (viii) resolve or agree or announce its intention to resolve
or agree to do any of the foregoing (any action set forth in the foregoing
clauses (i) through (viii) of this sentence, a " _Change of Board
Recommendation_ "). Any breach by a Representative of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries of this _Section 5.3_ shall be deemed a breach hereof by the
Company.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
if at any time following the date hereof and prior to the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval (i) the Company has received a written
Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party, (ii) the Company has not breached
this _Section 5.3_ (other than de minimis non-compliance) with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal and (iii) the Company Board (or a duly authorized
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisors and outside counsel, based on information then
available, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company may (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries and provide
access to the books, records, personnel and facilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal, its
representatives and potential sources of financing and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Third Party making such Acquisition
Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that
prior to taking any action referred to in clause ( _A_ ) or ( _B_ ) above, (x)
the Company and the applicable Third Party shall have entered into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) the Company shall have provided
notice of such Acquisition Proposal to Parent in accordance with _Section
5.3(c)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that any material non-public information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided or made available to any
Third Party shall, to the extent not previously provided or made available to
Parent or Merger Sub, be provided or made available to Parent or Merger Sub as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and in no event later than twenty-four
hours) after it is provided or made available to such Third Party, except to
the extent the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside counsel, that providing Parent or Merger Sub with such
information would violate Law ( _provided_ , that, in such case, (x) the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide or make
available to Parent or Merger Sub such material non-public information in a
manner that does not result in such prohibition, and (y) in the event that the
Company, despite having used commercially reasonable efforts in accordance
with the preceding clause (x), does not provide or make available to Parent or
Merger Sub such material non-public information in reliance on the preceding
clause (x), the Company shall provide Parent with a list of the information
that is being withheld).

 



 

(c) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall promptly (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent in writing in the event
that the Company receives any (i) Acquisition Proposal, (ii) inquiry or
request for information from, or for the initiation of discussions or
negotiations with, the Company or its Representatives concerning, or that
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii)
request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books, or
records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party who has
made or communicated to the Company that it intends to make an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) of the identity of such Person and provide to Parent a
copy of such Acquisition Proposal (or, where no

 



     

 

 



 

such copy is available, a reasonable description of the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request). Without limiting
the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours after such determination) advise Parent if the Company determines
to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations
concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to _Section 5.3(b)_. In addition,
the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis (and in
any event within twenty-four (24) hours) of any material changes to the status
and any changes to material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiries
or requests (and true and complete copies of any amended or modified written
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request, including modified written proposed
agreements), including any change in the Companys intentions as previously
notified.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
if (x) the Company has received a written Acquisition Proposal that has not
been withdrawn and that the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee
thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent
financial advisors and outside counsel, constitutes (and continues to
constitute) a Superior Proposal and (y) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to take such
action in response to such Superior Proposal would violate the directors
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, the
Company Board may at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, (A) effect a Change of Board Recommendation with respect to such
Superior Proposal and/or (B) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)_ in order to enter into a definitive written agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal, in either case subject to the requirements of this
_Section 5.3(d)_; _provided_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to
effect a Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to this _Section 5.3(d)_ or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ unless all of the
following conditions are met:

 



 

(i) the Company shall have provided to Parent at least four days prior
written notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") of the Companys intention to effect
a Change of Board Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d)_, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of
the Person or group of Persons making such Superior Proposal and the Company
Boards reasons for intending to effect a Change of Board Recommendation or to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d) _and shall have provided
to Parent a copy of the latest draft of the proposed transaction agreement to
be entered into in respect of such Superior Proposal and all other material
proposed transaction documents (if any) relating to such Superior Proposal;

 



 

(ii) during the Notice Period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall have,
and shall have caused its Representatives and legal and financial advisors to
have, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent regarding any amendment
to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and intended to cause the
relevant Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal;

 



 

(iii) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any adjustments
and/or amendments that Parent, in its sole discretion, shall have proposed
with respect to this Agreement (including a change to the price terms hereof)
and the other agreements contemplated hereby that may be irrevocably offered
in writing by Parent (the " _Proposed Changed_

 



     

 

 



 

 _Terms_ ") no later than 11:59 a.m., New York City time, on the last day of
the Notice Period and shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its independent financial advisor and outside counsel, that such Proposed
Changed Terms would continue to render the failure by the Company Board to
make such Change of Board Recommendation a violation of its fiduciary duties
to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law or that the Superior
Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such Proposed
Changed Terms were to be given effect (it being understood and agreed that in
the event that the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside counsel, that
such Proposed Changed Terms would render the failure by the Company Board to
make such Change of Board Recommendation no longer a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law or would render such Superior Proposal
no longer a Superior Proposal, the Company shall agree in writing to all
Proposed Changed Terms and the Companys notice of the proposed Change of
Board Recommendation or the termination of this Agreement shall be deemed to
be rescinded and of no further force and effect);

 



 

(iv) the Company shall have complied with its obligations under this _Section
5.3_ (other than de minimis non-compliance) with respect to such Superior
Proposal; and

 



 

(v) prior to or concurrently with any termination of this Agreement, the
Company shall have paid the Company Termination Fee to Parent.

 



 

In the event of any substantive revisions to such Superior Proposal offered in
writing by the party making such Superior Proposal, the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent within 24 hours and to
again comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.3(d)_ with respect to
such new written notice, except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to
three (3) Business Days with respect to any such revised Superior Proposal.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may at any time
prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval effect a Change of
Board Recommendation if (i) the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) determines that an Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing
and (ii) the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to
effect a Change of Board Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event
would violate its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law, but such Change of Board Recommendation shall not occur until
a time that is after the fourth day following Parents receipt of written
notice from the Company advising Parent of such Intervening Event (which
notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of the basis for such
Change of Board Recommendation) and stating that it intends to make a Change
of Board Recommendation and provided that (A) during such four day period the
Company has negotiated in good faith with Parent to the extent Parent wishes
to negotiate to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would enable the Company Board to proceed with the Company Board
Recommendation and (B) at the end of such four day period, the Company Board
maintains its determination described in this clause (ii) (after taking into
account any adjustments offered in writing by Parent to the material terms and
conditions of this Agreement).

 



     

 

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company Board
from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of
the Company if the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to make such disclosure would violate its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law. The issuance by the Company
or the Company Board of a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure
of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Change of Board Recommendation.

 



 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any bona fide offer or proposal from a
Third Party concerning (A) a merger, consolidation or other business
combination transaction involving the Company or any of its material
Subsidiaries, (B) a sale, lease, license or other disposition, by merger,
consolidation, business combination, share exchange, joint venture or
otherwise, in a single transaction, or a series of related transactions of
assets of the Company (including Equity Interests of any Subsidiary of the
Company) or its Subsidiaries representing 15% or more of the consolidated
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or to which 15% or more of the
consolidated revenue of the Company and its Subsidiaries are attributable, (C)
an issuance (including by way of merger, consolidation, business combination
or share exchange) of Equity Interests representing 15% or more of the voting
power of the Company, (D) any other transaction or series of related
transactions resulting in any Person or group of Persons (as defined in
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) obtaining the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management or policies of the Company or any of its material
Subsidiaries (whether by acquisition of voting rights, contract or otherwise)
or (E) any combination of the foregoing (in each case, other the Merger).

 



 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a written Acquisition Proposal (except the
references therein to "15%" shall be replaced by "85%") that the Company Board
(or a duly authorized committee thereof), after consultation with its
independent financial advisors and outside counsel, taking into account such
legal, financial, regulatory, conditionality, timing, likelihood of
consummation and other factors in respect of such Acquisition Proposal and the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal, determines in good faith would result
in a transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to the
Companys stockholders than the Merger (after taking into account any Proposed
Changed Terms).

 



 

(iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means any material event, fact, circumstance,
development or occurrence that is material to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, was not known to the Company Board prior to
execution of this Agreement (or, if known, the implications of which were not
known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Company Board prior to execution
of this Agreement) and first becomes known to the Company Board after
execution of this Agreement and prior to the Company Stockholder Approval;
_provided_ , that in no event shall any of the following be taken into account
in determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred: (a) the receipt,
existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or a Superior Proposal or any
inquiry, indication of interest, proposal, offer or communication relating
thereto (or that

 



     

 

 



 

could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or a Superior
Proposal), or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof, (b) any
changes in the market price or trading volume of any of the Companys
securities, or the fact that the Company meets, exceeds or fails to meet
internal or published projections, forecasts or revenue or earnings
predictions for any period constitute an Intervening Event, except that the
underlying cause or causes of such change or fact may be taken into account
for purposes of determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred, (c) (x)
the public announcement or pendency of this Agreement or the Transactions, (y)
any actions required to be taken or to be refrained from being taken pursuant
to this Agreement, or (z) any material breach of this Agreement by the
Company, or (d) any event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence that
has had or would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the
business or financial condition of Parent or Merger Sub.

 



 

5.4 _SEC Filings; Other Actions_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within fifteen
(15) Business Days) after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall
prepare and file the Proxy Statement with the SEC, which shall, subject to
_Section 5.3_, include the Company Board Recommendation. Parent, Merger Sub
and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Proxy
Statement before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall consider in
good faith and incorporate all comments reasonably proposed by Parent, Merger
Sub and their counsel with respect thereto. As promptly as reasonably
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall set, in
consultation with Parent, a record date for the Company Meeting (which shall
be called in accordance with _Section 5.4(b)_) and commence a broker search
pursuant to Section 14a-13 of the Exchange Act in respect thereof. The Company
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to comments by the SEC staff in respect of the Proxy Statement,
and to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed, as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after
confirmation from the SEC that it will not review, or that it has completed
its review of, the Proxy Statement, to the Companys stockholders as of the
record date for the Company Meeting (as established in accordance with the
preceding sentence). The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with
copies of any written comments, and shall provide them a summary of any oral
comments, that the Company or its counsel receive from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt
of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. Parent and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such responses
and the Company shall consider in good faith and incorporate all comments
reasonably proposed by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel with respect
thereto. Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish all information that is
customarily included in a proxy statement prepared in connection with
transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement concerning themselves
and their affiliates as promptly as practicable after the date hereof.

 



 

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall (i)
take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL, the Company Charter,
and the Company Bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following
(and shall use reasonable best efforts to hold such meeting within thirty (30)
Business Days after) the mailing of the Proxy Statement for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Meeting_ "), and
(ii) subject to a Change of Board Recommendation in accordance with _Section
5.3_, shall include the Company

 



     

 

 



 

Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and use all commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions contemplated hereby (including
by postponing or adjourning the Company Meeting to allow additional
solicitation of proxies in order to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval if
necessary). The Company may, if it receives an unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal or if the Company Board otherwise determines in good faith after
consultation with outside counsel that the Companys stockholders should be
provided with additional information, delay the mailing of the Proxy Statement
or the holding of the Company Meeting, in each case for such reasonable period
as would provide a reasonable opportunity for the Company Board to consider
such Acquisition Proposal or such additional information and to determine the
effect, if any, on the Company Board Recommendation. The Company may also
postpone or adjourn the Company Meeting from time to time (i) with the consent
of Parent, (ii) if a quorum has not been established, (iii) to the extent
necessary to file and mail any supplemental or amended disclosure which the
Company Board has determined in good faith is necessary and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the
Companys stockholders prior to the Company Meeting, (iv) to allow reasonable
additional time to solicit additional proxies if necessary in order to obtain
the Company Stockholder Approval or (v) if required by Law.

 



 

(c) If, at any time prior to the Company Meeting, any information relating to
the Company or Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor, any of their affiliates or
any transaction any of them have or are contemplating entering into in
connection with this Agreement, is discovered by the Company or Parent that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so
that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall as promptly as practicable notify the other party. Following such
notification, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC an appropriate
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement describing such information as
promptly as reasonably practicable and shall consider in good faith and
incorporate all comments reasonably proposed by Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel with respect thereto, and, to the extent required by applicable Law or
the SEC or its staff, the Company shall disseminate such amendment or
supplement to the stockholders of the Company.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,

Transactions as promptly as practicable, including using reasonable best
efforts to accomplish the following: (i) obtain all consents, approvals or

Investment Regulations without the prior written consent of all other parties
or commit

 



     

 

 



 

not to consummate any of the transactions contemplated hereby without the
prior written consent of all other parties. Parent shall pay all filing fees
under the HSR Act and any other applicable Competition Laws or French Foreign
Investment Regulations.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement will require or obligate Parent or any of its
affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries) to (and in no event shall any representation, warranty
or covenant of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement be breached or
deemed breached as a result of the failure of Parent or its affiliates to take
any of the following actions) (i) incur any out-of-pocket expense (other than
reasonable legal fees in connection with the Transaction and, in connection
with a second request, expenses for experts reasonably necessary to satisfy
the conditions in _Section 6.1(b)_ or _6.1(c)_ up to the Outside Date and
other out-of-pocket expenses to the extent necessary to satisfy its reasonable
best efforts obligations in _Sections 5.5(a)_ ; _provided_ that no such out-
of-pocket expenses shall include fines or penalties payable to a Governmental
Entity) or change any terms to any Contract to which Parent or any of its

and its Subsidiaries) is a party in order to obtain any consent or approval
under any Competition Law or French Foreign Investment Regulations or cause
any condition precedent to be satisfied, (ii) agree to or otherwise become

Subsidiaries), (B) the right of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger, or (C) the right of Parent to exercise full rights of ownership of its

Effective Time, the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries), (iii) agree
or be required to sell or otherwise dispose of, hold (through the

Competition Law or French Foreign Investment Regulations.

 



 

(c) Without limiting any provision hereof, between the date hereof and the
earlier of the Effective Time and termination of this Agreement in accordance

its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Contract to acquire (including by
merger, consolidation, or acquisition of stock or assets) any Person or Equity
Interests or all or substantially all assets of any Person, or consummate any
such transaction (other than the acquisition of Mercurius Holdings Limited) if
such Contract or transaction would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay or materially reduce the likelihood of satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_, _Section 6.1(c)_ or _Section
6.1(d)_.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub,

Company prior to the consummation of the Merger.

 



 

(e) Parent and the Company shall assemble all information necessary to timely
and effectively notify, in accordance with all requirements under the ITAR,

the request of the French Ministry of Economy and Finance. The Company shall
undertake to act reasonably promptly and cooperatively in providing all such
information reasonably necessary for the purposes of obtaining the French

5.6 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article 7_, unless prohibited by applicable Law, (a) each
party shall give prompt notice to the other parties if it receives any notice
or other communication from any Governmental Entity or the NYSE (or any other
securities market) in connection with the Transactions; (b) the Company shall
give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub if an event occurs that would
reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the Merger set
forth in _Section 6.3_ not being satisfied; and (c) Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company if an event occurs that would reasonably be expected to
result in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Section 6.2_ not

affect any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement and any failure to make such notice (in and of itself) shall not be
taken into account in determining whether the conditions set forth in _Article
6_ have been satisfied or give rise to any right of termination set forth in

5.7 _Public Announcements_. Until the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub,
on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, shall not issue any press

commercially reasonable efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, or (b)
with respect to any press release or other public statement by the Company

5.8 _Employee Benefit Matters_

 



 

(a) During the period commencing at the Closing Date and ending on September
30, 2020 (the " _Benefit Protection Period_ "), and except as provided in
_Section 5.8(e)_, the Surviving Corporation shall provide (i) to each
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each a " _Continuing Employee_ "), during any period of
employment with the Surviving Corporation following the Closing but during the
Benefit Protection Period, base salary or base wages and a target annual cash
bonus opportunity that is not less than the base salary or base wages and
target annual cash bonus opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) to the Continuing Employees
other compensation and benefits (excluding annual cash bonus opportunities,
equity-based compensation, non-qualified deferred compensation, defined
benefit pension, retiree medical or life benefits, retention, long-term
incentive, severance, change in control or transaction based bonus plans,
arrangements or agreements) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
to other compensation and benefits (excluding annual cash bonus opportunities,
equity-based compensation, non-qualified deferred compensation, defined
benefit pension, retiree medical or life benefits, retention, long-term
incentive, severance, change in control or transaction based bonus plans,
arrangements or agreements) provided to the Continuing Employees under Company
Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) The Surviving Corporation will honor, in accordance with its terms, each
Company Benefit Plan listed on _Section 3.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter (including all of the individual retention and/or severance agreements
of the Company that are listed on _Section 5.8(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter and all obligations thereunder), including any rights or benefits
arising as a result of the Transactions (either alone or in combination with
any other event, including termination of employment), and the Surviving
Corporation shall agree and acknowledge that the consummation of the
Transactions constitutes a "change of control" or a "change in control" or
similar term, as the case may be, for all purposes under each such Company
Benefit Plan.

 



 

(c) Solely for purposes of determining (i) eligibility to participate and
vesting under any benefit plans maintained by Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, that are adopted or
established during the Benefit Protection Period (" _Parent Plans_ ")
(including any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans), and (ii) benefit
accruals under any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans that are Parent
Plans, each Continuing Employees service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as reflected in the Companys records, shall be treated as
service with Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries,

 



     

 

 



 

including the Surviving Corporation, to the same extent such Continuing
Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit for such
service under a comparable Company Benefit Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits and the foregoing service credit shall
not apply with respect to any defined benefit plan.

 



 

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, evidence of insurability, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods under any Parent Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits in which Continuing Employees (and their
eligible dependents) become eligible to participate following the Effective
Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have
been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately
prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount
of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each
Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar
year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such years
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant Parent Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits in which such
Continuing Employee (and dependents) will be eligible to participate from and
after the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the terms and
conditions of employment for any employee covered by a Labor Agreement shall
continue to be governed by the applicable Labor Agreement subject to and in
accordance with its terms.

 



 

(f) At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall provide to Parent a copy of final Section 280G calculations prepared by
a nationally-recognized accounting firm or experienced valuator with respect
to any "disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of
the Code) in connection with the Transactions (which, such calculations,
including the assumptions contained therein, shall be subject to the prior
review and reasonable comment of Parent) (the "Final 280G Calculations"). The
Surviving Corporation agrees to act in accordance with the results of the
Final 280G Calculations with respect to any payments to be made to the
"disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code)
in connection with the Transactions, other than to the extent that following
the date of the Final 280G Calculations, there are any changes in applicable
Law, a Governmental Entity renders a decision that would have an adverse
impact the Final 280G Calculations, the Surviving Corporation receives an
opinion of counsel that advises otherwise, or any mathematical or factual
errors that are discovered in the Final 280G Calculation.

 



 

(g) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.10_, the provisions of this
_Section 5.8_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement,
and no Continuing Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof)
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement, and no provision of this _Section 5.8_ shall create such rights in
any such individuals. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall: (i) guarantee
employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or their respective affiliates to terminate the
employment of any Continuing Employee at any time

 



     

 

 



 

and for any reason; (ii) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective affiliates to continue any Company Benefit Plan or other
employee benefit plans, programs or Contracts or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof following the Closing; or (iii) amend any
Company Benefit Plans or other employee benefit plans, programs or Contracts.

 



 

5.9 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and shall advance expenses as incurred,
in each case in accordance with and to the fullest extent permitted under (i)
applicable Law, (ii) the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or similar
organization documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement and (iii)
any Contract of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any present or
former director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect as of
the date of this Agreement, each present and former director and officer of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and each of their respective employees who
serves as a fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan (in each case, when acting in
such capacity) (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the "
_Indemnitees_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys fees), judgments, settlements, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
whenever asserted, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the extent that they are based
on or arise out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer
of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries who serves as a fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan, including in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions.

 



 

(b) Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect of,
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions) existing as of the
Effective Time in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each of their respective employees who
serves as a fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan as provided in its
certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms. For a period of no less than six years from the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the applicable
partys certificate of incorporation and bylaws or similar organization
documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement or in any Contract of the
Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers
or employees in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and shall not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately
before the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that
all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses in
respect of any Proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made within such
period shall continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

 



 

(c) For six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain for the benefit of the directors and officers of the Company,
as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, an insurance and
indemnification policy that

 



     

 

 



 

provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the
" _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not
less favorable in the aggregate than the existing policy of the Company, or,
if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation
shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess
of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of
this Agreement. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company may purchase, prior to
the Effective Time, a prepaid "tail" policy, which policy provide such
directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time, including in respect of this Agreement or the Transactions. If
such "tail" policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policy in full force and
effect for its full term and cause the obligations thereunder to be
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each case, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, cause proper provision to be made so that such
successor or assign shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 5.9_.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall survive the consummation of
the Merger and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her
representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may
have under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or similar organization
documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement or in any Contract of the
Company or its Subsidiaries listed in _Section 3.16(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter and in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The
obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, under
this _Section 5.9_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.9_
applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable
Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to
whom this _Section 5.9_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 5.9_).

 



 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this _Section 5.9_ is not prior to or in substitution for any
such claims under such policies. The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and are expressly intended for the
benefit of, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnitees.

 



     

 

 



 

5.10 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or
advisable to arrange the Debt Financing as promptly as practicable following
the date of this Agreement (taking into account the anticipated timing of the
Marketing Period) and to consummate the Debt Financing on or before the
Closing Date, including the following:

 



 

(i) maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment Letter until the Transactions
are consummated (subject to Parents right to replace, modify, waive or amend
the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent permitted thereunder and under this
_Section 5.10_);

 



 

(ii) not permitting any amendment or modification to be made to, not
consenting to any waiver of any provision or remedy under, and not replacing,
the Debt Commitment Letter, other than such amendments, modifications, waivers
or replacements that do not: (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount of the Debt Financing) unless the Funds Financing is increased
by a corresponding amount and an amended Funds Commitment Letter reflecting
such increase is executed by the investment funds named therein and delivered
to the Company, (B) impose new or additional conditions to the receipt of the
Debt Financing, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Debt Financing in any manner adverse to the interests of the Company, or
otherwise expand any conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, or
(C)(1) materially delay or prevent the Closing beyond the date the Closing is
required to be effected in accordance with _Section 1.2_, (2) make the
funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining
the Debt Financing) less likely to occur or (3) adversely impact the ability
of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the definitive Debt Financing Documents; _provided_ that
for the avoidance of doubt (x) the foregoing restrictions shall not apply to
the implementation of any "market flex" provisions under the Debt Commitment
Letter as in effect on the date hereof and (y) Parent may amend (or amend and
restate) the Debt Commitment Letter, any related fee credit or discount and
engagement letters solely to (a) add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or any Person with similar roles or titles who had not
executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, in each case, in
all material respects in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letter and (b) amend titles, allocations and fee sharing arrangements with
respect to the existing and additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners,
agents, managers or similar entities in each case, in all material respects in
accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters; provided that Parent
shall promptly furnish to the Company copies of any agreements or other
documentation with respect to such amendment;

 



 

(iii) causing the Funds Financing to be consummated upon satisfaction of the
conditions contained in the Funds Commitment Letter;

 



 

(iv) satisfying on a timely basis (taking into account the anticipated timing
of the Marketing Period) all conditions to the Debt Financing and the Funds
Financing;

 



     

 

 



 

(v) negotiating, executing and delivering Debt Financing Documents that
reflect the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter
(including any "market flex" provisions related thereto) or such other terms
as Parent may agree so long as such changes to the terms do not: (A) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount
of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing) unless
the Funds Financing is increased by a corresponding amount and an amended
Funds Commitment Letter reflecting such increase is executed by the investment
funds named therein and delivered to the Company, (B) impose new or additional
conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, amend or modify any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing in any manner adverse to the
interests of the Company, or otherwise expand any conditions to the receipt of
the Debt Financing, or (C)(1) materially delay or prevent the Closing beyond
the date the Closing is required to be effected in accordance with _Section
1.2_, (2) make the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to occur or (3)
adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive Debt Financing
Documents; and

 



 

(vi) in the event that (A) the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_ and
_6.3_ have been satisfied (or, upon funding, would be satisfied) and (B) the
conditions to the availability of the Debt Financing have been satisfied or
waived (or, with the funding of the Debt Financing, would be concurrently
satisfied), causing the applicable Financing Sources to fund the full amount
of the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing.

 



 

(b) Parent shall, upon reasonable written request of the Company, keep the
Company reasonably informed from time to time of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Financing. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of (i) any
material breach or repudiation, or any threatened material breach or
repudiation, by any party to the Commitment Letters of which Parent becomes
aware and (ii) any material dispute or disagreement among any parties to the
Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements related to the Financing
with respect to the obligation to fund or the amount of the Financing to be
funded at Closing (and, for the avoidance of doubt, other than those related
to the ordinary course negotiation of the definitive Debt Financing
Documents). Without limiting Parents other obligations under this _Section
5.10_, if Parent becomes aware that a Financing Failure Event has occurred,
Parent shall (i) promptly notify the Company of such Financing Failure Event
and the reasons therefor, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain (on
terms in all material respects as favorable to Parent as are reasonably
available for financings of the type contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter in the debt markets at such time) alternative financing from
alternative financing sources, in an amount sufficient (together with the
Funds Financing) to pay the Merger Consideration and consummate the
Transactions, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event, and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, and when obtained,
promptly provide the Company with a copy of, a replacement financing
commitment in accordance with _Section 5.11(a)(ii)_ that provides for such
alternative financing; _provided_ , that if such alternative financing is
obtained, any references to the Debt Financing shall be deemed to include such
alternative financing.

 



 

(c) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to enforce its rights under the
Commitment Letters, including in the event of a Financing Failure Event.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause to be delivered to the Financing Sources the financial statements of
Pattonair and its Subsidiaries and take all other actions to satisfy the
conditions set forth in paragraphs 10 and 11 of Annex VI of the Debt

8.6 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

 



 

8.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision (or part thereof) of this
Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy,
all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement (or parts
thereof) shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision (or part thereof) is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law and in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated
hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the parties intend that the remedies and limitations thereon contained in this
Agreement, including _Section 7.2_ and _Section 8.14_, shall be construed as
an integral provision of this Agreement and that such remedies and limitations
shall not be severable in any manner that increases a partys liability or
obligations hereunder or under the Funds Commitment Letter or the Guaranty or
any Debt Commitment Letter.

 



 

8.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, and
Company Disclosure Letter, the Guaranty, the other documents delivered
pursuant hereto and the letter delivered in connection herewith) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties and
supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and,
except as otherwise expressly provided herein or therein, are not intended to
confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder or thereunder.

 



 

8.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in whole
or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of each of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , _however_
, that Parent and Merger Sub may without the consent of any other party (a)
assign their rights under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to an
affiliate, (b) collaterally assign their rights under this Agreement to any of
the Financing Sources or any agent or collateral trustee for the Financing
Sources or (c) assign their rights under this Agreement in connection with any
sale or transfer of equity securities of, or any merger, consolidation, change
of control or other business combination involving, Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their Subsidiaries, but in the case of clauses (a), (b), and (c) no such
assignment will relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their obligations under this
Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be

 



     

 

 



 

binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

8.10 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, other
than pursuant to _Section 5.9_, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Financing
Sources and Financing Sources Related Parties shall be express third party
beneficiaries of and have the right to enforce _Sections 7.4(d)_, _7.5_ ,
_7.6(b)_ , _8.10_ , _8.12(d)_ and _8.15_ , and (ii) the Parent Related
Parties shall be express third party beneficiaries of and have the right to
enforce _Sections 7.5_ and _8.10._

 



 

8.11 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation_. Each party has participated in the
drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender
shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall
include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include
masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words "include"
and "including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of
limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." As used in this Agreement, references to a "party" or the
"parties" are intended to refer to a party to this Agreement or the parties to
this Agreement. Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this
Agreement to "Sections," "Exhibits," "Annexes" and "Schedules" are intended to
refer to Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules to
this Agreement. All references in this Agreement to "$" or other monetary
amounts are intended to refer to U.S. dollars. Unless otherwise specifically
provided for herein, the term "or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive. The
words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import, when
used in this Agreement, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. In this Agreement, references to "as
of the date hereof," "as of the date of this Agreement" or words of similar
import shall be deemed to mean "as of immediately prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement." The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent"
means the degree to which a subject or thing extends and such phrase shall not
simply mean "if." Time periods within or following which any payment is to be
made or act is to be done under this Agreement shall be calculated by
excluding the day on which the period commences and including the day on which
the period ends, and by extending the period to the next Business Day
following if the last day of the period is not a Business Day.

 



 

8.12 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_.

 



 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE

THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION.
Except

 



     

 

 



 

as provided in _Section 8.12(d)_, all disputes, claims, controversies and
causes of action arising out of or in connection herewith, or the negotiation,
validity or performance of this Agreement or the Transactions shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without regard to Laws that may be applicable under conflicts of
laws principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than

(b) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware State
court, or Federal court of the United States of America, sitting in Delaware,

relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each
of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to
commence any such Proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim
in respect of any such Proceeding may be heard and determined in such Delaware
State court or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such Federal court, (iii)

objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such Proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal court, and (iv) waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum
to the maintenance of such Proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal
court. Each of the parties agrees that a final judgment in any such Proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in _Section 8.3_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 



 

(c) EACH OF THE COMPANY, PARENT AND MERGER SUB ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, OR THE ACTIONS OF THE
COMPANY, PARENT OR MERGER SUB IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE
AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE COMPANY, PARENT AND MERGER SUB
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV)
IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.12(c)_.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party agrees (i)
that any action of any kind or nature, whether at law or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise, against a Financing Source or a Financing Sources
Related Party in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be brought exclusively in
any New York state or federal court and each party submits for itself and its
property with respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts, (ii) that service of process, summons, notice or document by
registered mail addressed to it at its address provided in _Section 8.3_
shall be effective service of process against it for any such action brought

fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of, any such Proceeding in any such court, (iv) that a final
judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law, (v) that the Laws of the State of New York shall govern any such
Proceeding and (vi) to irrevocably waive and hereby waives any right to a
trial by jury in any such action to the same extent such rights are waived
pursuant to _Section 8.12(c)_.

 



 

8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic transmission each of
which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto
and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof
signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has
received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement
shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder
(whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall be
sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

8.14 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at Law would
exist and monetary damages would be difficult to determine, and accordingly,
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity, (i) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specific performance of the terms
hereof, in each case in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if

United States of America, or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity,
(ii) the parties waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond
in connection with the obtaining of any specific performance or injunctive
relief and (iii) the parties will waive, in any action for specific
performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties agrees that (i) the seeking of remedies pursuant to
this _Section 8.14_ shall not in any way constitute a waiver by any party
seeking such remedies of its right to seek any other form of relief that may
be available to it under this Agreement or an election of remedies, including
under _Sections 7.3_ and _7.4_ , in the event that this Agreement has been
terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this _Section
8.14_ are not available

 



     

 

 



 

or otherwise are not granted, (ii) nothing set forth in this Agreement shall
require a party to institute any Proceeding for (or limit a partys right to
institute any Proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section 8.14_
prior, or as a condition, to exercising any termination right under _Article
7_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement
of any Proceeding seeking remedies pursuant to this _Section 8.14_ restrict
or limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of _Article 7_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that
may be available then or thereafter; _provided_ , that in no event will a
party be entitled to both (x) the payment of the Parent Termination Fee or the
Company Termination Fee, as applicable, and (y) specific performance of the
other partys obligations to consummate the Merger or (in the case of
obligations of Parent or Merger Sub) obtain the Funds Financing, and (iii) no
party shall require the other to post any bond or other security as a
condition to institute any Proceeding for specific performance under this
_Section 8.14_.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of _Section 8.14(a)_, it is
explicitly agreed that the Company shall have the right to enforce Parents
obligation to cause the Funds Financing to be funded and to consummate the
Transactions only if: (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_
and _6.3_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions to
Closing that by their terms or their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to such conditions being satisfied assuming a Closing
would occur), (ii) the Company has confirmed in writing that, if specific
performance is granted and the Funds Financing and the Debt Financing (or any
alternative financing in accordance with _Section 5.10_) are funded, the
Closing will occur (iii) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded
at the Closing if the Funds Financing is funded (or in the case any
alternative financing has been obtained in accordance with _Section 5.10_,
such alternative financing been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the
Funds Financing is funded ), and (iv) Parent has failed to cause the Closing
to occur by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to
_Section 1.2_.

 



 

8.15 _Non-Recourse Against Financing Sources_. Except to the extent otherwise
set forth in the Guaranty, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement may only be brought against, the persons who are expressly named as
parties hereto and then only with respect to the specific obligations set
forth herein with respect to such person. None of the Financing Sources or a
Financing Sources Related Party shall have any liability for any obligations
or liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Funds
Commitment Letter, the Debt Commitment Letter or, in each case, the
performance thereof; _provided_ , that in no event shall the foregoing relieve
the Financing Sources from any obligations to Parent or Merger Sub (and
following the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries) arising under
the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing Documents.
