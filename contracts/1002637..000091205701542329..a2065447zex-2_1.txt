                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement"), dated as of December
5, 2001, by and among Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Millennium"), PGM Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a
direct, wholly-owned, newly-formed subsidiary of Millennium ("Sub"), and COR
Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("COR").

         WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Millennium and COR deem it
advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and its respective
stockholders that Millennium and COR combine in order to advance the long-term
business interests of Millennium and COR;

         WHEREAS, the combination of Millennium and COR shall be effected by the
terms of this Agreement through a merger of Sub into COR, as a result of which
the stockholders of COR will become stockholders of Millennium and COR will
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Millennium (the "Merger");

         WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to the parties' willingness to enter into this
Agreement, Millennium and certain officers and directors of COR who are
stockholders of COR have executed Voting Agreements in favor of Millennium in
the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT A (the "COR Voting Agreements") and COR and
certain officers and directors of Millennium who are stockholders of Millennium
have executed Voting Agreements in favor of COR in the form attached hereto as
EXHIBIT B (the "Millennium Voting Agreements"); and

         WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and this Agreement
shall constitute a plan of reorganization pursuant to Section 368(a) of the
Code.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, the
parties agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

         Section 1.01 EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER. Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, a certificate of merger in such form as is required by the
relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL") (the
"Certificate of Merger") shall be duly executed and acknowledged by the
Surviving Corporation (as defined in Section 1.03) and thereafter delivered to
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware for filing, immediately after
the Closing (as defined in Section 1.02). The Merger shall become effective upon
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware or at such later time as is established by Millennium and COR and
set forth in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the
"Effective Time").


<PAGE>

         Section 1.02 CLOSING. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will
take place at 10:00 a.m., Boston time, on a date to be specified by Millennium
and COR (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the fifth business
day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other than
satisfaction of those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain
subject to the delivery of such items and the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State
Street, Boston, Massachusetts, unless another date, place or time is agreed to
in writing by Millennium and COR.

         Section 1.03 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, and pursuant to the provisions of the DGCL, at the Effective
Time (i) the separate existence of Sub shall cease and Sub shall be merged with
and into COR (Sub and COR are sometimes referred to herein as the "Constituent
Corporations" and COR following the Merger is sometimes referred to herein as
the "Surviving Corporation"), (ii) the Certificate of Incorporation of COR as in
effect on the date of this Agreement shall be amended so that Article FOURTH of
such Certificate of Incorporation reads in its entirety as follows: "The total
number of shares of all classes of stock which the Corporation shall have
authority to issue is 1,000, all of which shall consist of common stock, $.01
par value per share," and, as so amended, such Certificate of Incorporation
shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until
further amended in accordance with the DGCL and (iii) the By-laws of Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended to change all
references to the name of Sub to refer to the name of COR, and, as so amended,
such By-laws shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until further
amended in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in Section 259 of the DGCL.

         Section 1.04 DIRECTORS. The directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each
to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws
of the Surviving Corporation.

         Section 1.05 ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURE OF MERGER. At the election of
Millennium prior to December 21, 2001 and after concluding reasonably and in
good faith that it would be obligated to take the actions described in Schedule
1.05 if the Merger was not restructured in the manner described in this Section
1.05, and with the prior written consent of COR which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, the Merger may be structured so that COR shall be merged with and into
Millennium with the result that Millennium shall be the "Surviving Corporation."
If the Merger is so structured, (i) the inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty of COR or Millennium, which representation or warranty is or becomes
inaccurate directly or indirectly as the result of Millennium, rather than COR,
being the Surviving Corporation, shall not be deemed to be a breach of such
representation or warranty, (ii) the failure by COR or Millennium to perform or
comply with a covenant or agreement: (A) that arose as a result of Millennium,
rather than COR, being the Surviving Corporation (including any covenant
contained in this Section 1.05), or (B) to the extent that the failure occurred
directly or indirectly as a result of Millennium, rather than COR,


                                      -2-

being the Surviving Corporation, shall not be deemed to be a breach of or
failure to comply with such covenant or agreement, (iii) any condition to the
obligation of COR or Millennium to effect the Merger which is not satisfied, or
any termination right that becomes available, directly or indirectly as a direct
or indirect result of Millennium, rather than COR, being the Surviving
Corporation, shall be deemed satisfied or unavailable, as the case may be, and
(iv) the other provisions of this Agreement relating to the Merger (including
without limitation Section 1.03 and 1.04) shall be deemed to be appropriately
modified to reflect such alternative structure. Without limiting the foregoing,
COR acknowledges and agrees that (A) in the event that the Merger is structured
as set forth in this Section 1.05, the Millennium Voting Proposal shall be
defined to also include the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the
Merger, and that the vote required thereby shall be the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of Millennium Common Stock outstanding on
the record date for the Millennium Meeting at which a quorum is present, and (B)
it shall not have the right to withhold its consent to the structuring of the
Merger as set forth in this Section 1.05 in whole or in part because of such
change in the Millennium Voting Proposal. If the Merger is structured as set
forth in this Section 1.05, Millennium and COR agree to (I) use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all consents necessary, and otherwise cause the
satisfaction of all conditions to the obligations of COR and Millennium to
effect the Merger without giving effect to the provisions of clause (iii) of the
second sentence of this Section, and (II) enter into agreements and other
instruments reasonably requested by Millennium or COR, including if necessary an
amendment to this Agreement, to effect such structure. If COR provides
Millennium with a written legal opinion of Cooley Godward LLP or another law
firm reasonably acceptable to Millennium, in a form reasonably acceptable to
Millennium, indicating in substance that Millennium would not be obligated to
take the actions described in Schedule 1.05 if the Merger remained structured in
the manner described in Section 1.03, the ability to restructure the Merger in
the manner described in this Section 1.05 shall terminate.

                                   ARTICLE II

                            CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

         Section 2.01 CONVERSION OF CAPITAL STOCK.

                (a) CAPITAL STOCK OF SUB; CANCELLATION OF TREASURY STOCK AND
MILLENNIUM OWNED STOCK; EXCHANGE RATIO. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of COR or Sub or the holder of any
shares of capital stock of COR or capital stock of Sub:

                  (i) Each issued and outstanding share of the capital stock of
         Sub shall cease to be outstanding, shall cease to exist and shall be
         converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable shares of
         common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

                  (ii) All shares of common stock, $.0001 par value per share,
         of COR ("COR Common Stock") that are owned by COR as treasury stock or
         by any wholly-owned Subsidiary (as defined in Section 3.01) of COR and
         any shares of COR Common Stock owned by Millennium, Sub or any other
         wholly-owned Subsidiary of Millennium shall be cancelled and retired
         and shall cease to exist and no stock of Millennium or other
         consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Any shares of
         common stock, $.001 par value per share, of Millennium ("Millennium
         Common Stock") owned by COR shall be unaffected by the Merger.


                                      -3-
<PAGE>

                  (iii) Subject to Section 2.02, each issued and outstanding
         share of COR Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in
         accordance with Section 2.01(a)(ii)), shall be converted into the right
         to receive 0.9873 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of Millennium Common
         Stock (collectively, the "Merger Shares"). All such shares of COR
         Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and
         shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist,
         and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall
         cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
         receive shares of Millennium Common Stock and any cash in lieu of
         fractional shares of Millennium Common Stock to be issued or paid in
         consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in
         accordance with Section 2.02, without interest.

                  (iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
         this Agreement, if and only if the "Actual Signing Date Number of
         Shares" (as defined below) exceeds the "Maximum Signing Date Number of
         Shares" (as defined below), then the Exchange Ratio shall be equal to
         the product of: (1) the number that would have otherwise constituted
         the Exchange Ratio but for this Section 2.01(a)(iv); MULTIPLIED BY (2)
         a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Maximum Signing Date
         Number of Shares, and the denominator of which shall be the Actual
         Signing Date Number of Shares. In no event shall such fraction be
         greater than one. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the
         Actual Signing Date Number of Shares exceeds the Maximum Signing Date
         Number of Shares by less than 37,500 shares, the provisions of this
         Section 2.01(a)(iv) shall not apply to adjust the Exchange Ratio. For
         purposes of this Section 2.01(a)(iv):

         (A)      the "Actual Signing Date Number of Shares" shall be equal to
                  the sum of:

                  (1)      the number of shares of COR Common Stock outstanding
                           as of the date of this Agreement (even if such number
                           is different from the number represented by COR in
                           Section 3.02); and

                  (2)      the number of shares of COR Common Stock issuable
                           upon the exercise of any COR Stock Options or COR
                           Convertible Notes (even if such number is different
                           from the number represented by COR in Section 3.02),
                           in each case outstanding as of the date of this
                           Agreement; and

         (B)      the "Maximum Signing Date Number of Shares" shall be equal to
                  78,232,268 shares.

                (b) ADJUSTMENTS TO EXCHANGE RATIO. The Exchange Ratio shall be
appropriately and proportionately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Millennium Common Stock or COR


                                      -4-
<PAGE>

Common Stock), reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other like
change with respect to Millennium Common Stock or COR Common Stock occurring (or
for which a record date is established) after the date hereof and on or prior to
the Effective Time.

                (c) UNVESTED STOCK. At the Effective Time, any unvested shares
of COR Common Stock awarded to employees, directors or consultants pursuant to
any of COR's plans or arrangements and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into unvested shares of Millennium Common
Stock in accordance with the Exchange Ratio and shall remain subject to the same
terms, restrictions and vesting schedule as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except to the extent by their terms as in effect on the date of
this Agreement such unvested shares of COR Common Stock vest at the Effective
Time. All outstanding rights which COR may hold immediately prior to the
Effective Time to repurchase unvested shares of COR Common Stock shall be
assigned to Millennium in the Merger and shall thereafter be exercisable by
Millennium upon the same terms and conditions in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that the shares purchasable pursuant to such rights and
the purchase price payable per share shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect
the Exchange Ratio. COR shall take all steps necessary to cause the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.01(c) to occur.

         Section 2.02 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES. The procedures for exchanging
outstanding shares of COR Common Stock for Millennium Common Stock pursuant to
the Merger are as follows:

                (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. At the Effective Time, Millennium shall
deposit with a bank or trust company designated by Millennium (the "Exchange
Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of COR Common Stock, for
exchange in accordance with this Section 2.02, through the Exchange Agent,
certificates representing the shares of Millennium Common Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 2.01 in exchange for outstanding shares of COR Common Stock
and cash in an amount sufficient to make payments required pursuant to Section
2.02(e) (such shares of Millennium Common Stock and such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund").

                (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of COR Common Stock (the "Certificates") whose
shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.01 into the right to receive shares
of Millennium Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be
in such form and have such other provisions as Millennium may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for certificates representing shares of Millennium Common Stock
(plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of Millennium Common Stock and
any dividends or distributions as provided below). Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Millennium, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole
shares of Millennium Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions


                                      -5-
<PAGE>

of this Article II plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.02(e) and any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 2.02(c), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of COR Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of COR, a certificate representing the proper number of shares
of Millennium Common Stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 2.02(c)
may be issued or paid to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if the Certificate representing such
COR Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the certificate representing shares of Millennium Common Stock plus
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and any dividends
or distributions pursuant to Section 2.02(c) as contemplated by this Section
2.02.

                (c) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with
respect to Millennium Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the
shares of Millennium Common Stock represented thereby and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section
2.02(e) below until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender
such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender
of any such Certificate, there shall be issued and paid to the record holder of
the Certificate (i) certificates representing whole shares of Millennium Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, (ii) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Millennium Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) below and the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time with respect to such whole shares of Millennium Common Stock with
a payment date on or prior to such time of surrender, without interest, and
(iii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender
and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Millennium Common Stock.

                (d) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COR COMMON STOCK. All shares
of Millennium Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash or
dividends or other distributions paid pursuant to Sections 2.02(c) or 2.02(e))
shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of COR Common Stock, and from and after the Effective
Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of COR Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

                (e) NO FRACTIONAL SHARES. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Millennium Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of
Millennium. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each


                                      -6-
<PAGE>

holder of shares of COR Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Millennium
Common Stock (after taking into account and aggregating all Certificates
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Millennium
Common Stock multiplied by the average of the last reported sale prices of
Millennium Common Stock, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market, during the
ten consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day prior to the Closing
Date.

                (f) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to the stockholders of COR for 270 days after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Millennium, upon demand, and any
stockholders of COR who have not previously complied with this Section 2.02
shall thereafter look only to Millennium for payment of their claim for
Millennium Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Millennium
Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to Millennium
Common Stock.

                (g) NO LIABILITY. To the extent permitted by applicable law,
none of Millennium, Sub, COR, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent, or
any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or counsel, shall
be liable to any holder of shares of COR Common Stock or Millennium Common
Stock, as the case may be, for such shares (or cash, dividends or distributions
with respect thereto) properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall
not have been surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which any shares of Millennium Common
Stock, and any cash payable to the holder of such Certificate pursuant to this
Article II or any dividends or distributions payable to the holder of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
governmental body or authority), any such shares of Millennium Common Stock or
cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

                (h) WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Each of Millennium and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of COR
Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local
or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or Millennium, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
the shares of COR Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Millennium, as the case may
be.

                (i) LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable amount (but not more than the market value) as the Surviving
Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Millennium Common
Stock and any cash in lieu of


                                      -7-
<PAGE>

fractional shares, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of
Millennium Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

                (j) AFFILIATES. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Certificates surrendered for exchange by any Affiliate (as defined in Section
6.09 below) of COR shall not be exchanged until Millennium has received an
Affiliate Agreement (as defined in Section 6.09 below) from such Affiliate.

                                  ARTICLE III

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CRIMSON

         Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by COR to
Millennium on or before the date of this Agreement (the "COR Disclosure
Schedule") (which COR Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in sections
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in this Article
III and the disclosure in any section shall qualify (1) the corresponding
section of this Article III and (2) other sections in this Article III to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent that it also qualifies or applies to such
other sections), COR represents and warrants to Millennium and Sub as follows in
this Article III. As used in this Agreement, any reference to "COR's knowledge",
"the knowledge of COR", "the best knowledge of COR", "of which COR is aware", or
any similar expression shall mean the actual knowledge of Vaughn M. Kailian,
President and Chief Executive Officer, Peter S. Roddy, Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer, Charles J. Homey, Executive Vice President, Research
and Development, Lee M. Rauch, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development, and
Patrick A. Broderick, Senior Vice President and General Counsel.

         For purposes of this Agreement, the term "COR Material Adverse Effect"
means any material adverse change, event, circumstance, development or effect on
(a) the assets, business, financial condition, results of operations or
prospects of COR and its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 3.01 below) taken
as a whole; or (b) the ability of COR to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that the following events
shall not be deemed to be, and shall not be taken into account in determining
whether there has been or whether there is likely or expected to be, a "COR
Material Adverse Effect" on or with respect to COR and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole: (i) any adverse change in the stock price of COR in and of itself, as
quoted on the Nasdaq National Market; (ii) any adverse change, event,
circumstance, development or effect resulting from a change in general economic,
industry or financial market conditions not substantially disproportionately
affecting COR and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; (iii) any change, event,
circumstance, development or effect resulting from a breach of this Agreement by
Millennium or Sub; (iv) any adverse change, event, circumstance, development or
effect resulting from any acts of terrorism or war, including the events of
September 11, 2001, fighting in Afghanistan, letters containing anthrax and
similar circumstances; (v) any adverse change, event, circumstance, development
or effect directly resulting from the announcement or pendency of the Merger;
and (vi) any adverse change, event, circumstance, development or effect
resulting from or relating to compliance with the terms of, or the taking of any
action expressly required by, this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Parties agree that the terms "material", "materially" or "materiality" as used
in this Agreement with an initial lower case "m" shall have their respective
customary meanings,


                                      -8-
<PAGE>

without regard to the meaning ascribed to COR Material Adverse Effect in the
prior sentences of this paragraph or the meaning ascribed to Millennium Material
Adverse Effect in Article IV below.

         Section 3.01 ORGANIZATION OF COR. COR and each of its Subsidiaries (as
defined below) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all
requisite corporate power to own, lease and operate its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction
in which the failure to be so qualified, individually or in the aggregate, would
be reasonably likely to be material to COR and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole. Except as set forth in the COR SEC Reports (as defined in Section
3.04(a)) filed prior to the date hereof, neither COR nor any of its Subsidiaries
directly or indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any corporation,
partnership, joint venture or other business association or entity. As used in
this Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" means, with respect to a person or entity
(the "Parent"), any corporation or other organization, whether incorporated or
unincorporated, of which (i) such Parent or any other Subsidiary of such Parent
is a general partner or a managing member or (ii) at least a majority of the
securities or other interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to
elect a majority of the Board of Directors or others performing similar
functions with respect to such corporation or other organization is directly or
indirectly owned or controlled by such Parent or by any one or more of its
Subsidiaries, or by such Parent and one or more of its Subsidiaries. COR has
made available to Millennium true and complete copies of the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-Laws of COR and of the charter, by-laws or other
organizational documents of each Subsidiary of COR.

         Section 3.02 COR CAPITAL STRUCTURE.

                (a) The authorized capital stock of COR consists of 120,000,000
shares of COR Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$.001 ("COR Preferred Stock"). The rights and privileges of each class of COR's
capital stock are as set forth in COR's Certificate of Incorporation. As of
December 3, 2001, (i) 55,706,426 shares of COR Common Stock are issued and
outstanding, all of which are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, (ii) no shares of COR Common Stock were held in the treasury of
COR or by Subsidiaries of COR, and (iii) no shares of COR Preferred Stock were
issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding COR Common Stock was
issued in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws. Between
December 3, 2001 and the date hereof, (i) no shares of COR Common Stock or COR
Preferred Stock were issued other than pursuant to the exercise of COR Stock
Options (as defined below) or the conversion of COR Convertible Notes (as
defined below), and (ii) no COR Stock Options have been issued or awarded. The
COR Disclosure Schedule sets forth the following information:

                         (1) all issued and outstanding shares of COR Common
Stock that constitute restricted stock or that are otherwise subject to a
repurchase or redemption right or right of first refusal in favor of COR; the
name of the applicable stockholder, the lapsing schedule for any such shares,
including the extent to which any such repurchase or redemption right or right
of first refusal has lapsed as of the date of this Agreement, whether (and to
what


                                      -9-
<PAGE>

extent) the lapsing will be accelerated in any way by the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or by termination of employment or change in
position following consummation of the Merger, and whether such holder has the
sole power to vote and dispose of such shares;

                         (2) as of December 3, 2001, the number of shares of COR
Common Stock reserved for future issuance pursuant to stock options granted and
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement (other than options granted under
the ESPP (as defined in Section 6.11(d) below)), and the plans and arrangements
(whether written or unwritten) under which such options were granted
(collectively, including the ESPP, the "COR Stock Plans"), a complete and
accurate list of all holders of options outstanding as of December 3, 2001 to
purchase shares of COR Common Stock (such outstanding options, the "COR Stock
Options") under the COR Stock Plans (other than the ESPP), indicating with
respect to each such COR Stock Option the employment status (e.g., employee or
consultant) of the holder thereof, the number of shares of COR Common Stock
subject to each such COR Stock Option, the exercise price, the date of grant,
the expiration date and the vesting schedule for any such options, including the
extent to which any such vesting has occurred as of the date of this Agreement,
and whether (and to what extent) the vesting will be accelerated in any way by
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by termination of employment
or change in position following consummation of the Merger;

                         (3) the number of shares of COR Common Stock reserved
for future issuance pursuant to notes convertible into COR Common Stock
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement (such notes, the "COR Convertible
Notes") and the identity of the indentures relating to such COR Convertible
Notes; and

                         (4) the number of shares of COR Preferred Stock
reserved for future issuance pursuant to the rights (the "COR Rights") issued
and issuable under the Rights Agreement dated as of January 23, 1995 between COR
and Chemical Trust Company of California as rights agent (the "COR Rights Plan")
and the agreements or other documents under which the COR Rights were issued.

COR has made available to Millennium true and complete copies of all COR Stock
Plans and the forms of all stock option agreements evidencing COR Stock Options
granted under the COR Stock Plans or otherwise, the indentures and registration
rights agreements pursuant to which any COR Convertible Notes were issued, all
agreements under which any COR Rights were issued or are issuable and all
agreements governing unvested shares of COR Common Stock and the vesting
thereof. All shares of COR Common Stock or COR Preferred Stock issuable pursuant
to the COR Stock Options, the COR Convertible Notes or the COR Rights, upon
issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to
which they are issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable. All outstanding shares of COR Common Stock and all COR Stock
Options, COR Convertible Notes and COR Rights were not, and all shares of COR
Common Stock or COR Preferred Stock issuable pursuant to the COR Stock Options,
the COR Convertible Notes or the COR Rights upon issuance on the terms and
conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
will not be, issued in violation of any purchase option, call option, right of
first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right under
any provision of the DGCL, COR's Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or any
agreement to which COR is a party or is otherwise bound. There are no

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

obligations, contingent or otherwise, of COR or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of COR Common Stock or any
other capital stock of COR or any Subsidiary or to provide funds to or make any
investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any
such Subsidiary or any other entity. All of the outstanding shares of capital
stock or other equity interests of each of COR's Subsidiaries are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and all such shares
and other equity interests in any Subsidiary are owned by COR or another
wholly-owned Subsidiary of COR free and clear of all security interests, liens,
claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in COR's voting rights, charges or
other encumbrances of any nature.

                (b) Except for the COR Common Stock outstanding as of the date
of this Agreement, the COR Stock Plans, the COR Convertible Notes, the COR
Rights and shares of capital stock and other securities of COR issued or
issuable pursuant to the foregoing, (i) there are no equity securities of any
class of COR or any of its Subsidiaries, or any security convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for such equity securities, issued, reserved
for issuance or outstanding, and (ii) there are no options, warrants, equity
securities, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character to which
COR or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound obligating COR or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,
exchange, transfer, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, exchanged,
transferred, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock of or other
equity interests in COR or any of its Subsidiaries or obligating COR or any of
its Subsidiaries to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of, otherwise modify
or amend or enter into any such option, warrant, equity security, call, right,
commitment or agreement. Neither COR nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding
any stock appreciation rights, phantom stock, performance based rights or
similar rights or obligations. To the best knowledge of COR, as of the date of
this Agreement there are no voting trusts, proxies or other voting agreements or
understandings with respect to the shares of capital stock of or other equity
interests in COR or any of its Subsidiaries other than the COR Voting
Agreements. Upon the consummation of the Merger, subject to compliance by
Millennium with Sections 6.11 and 6.19 of this Agreement, all options, warrants,
equity securities, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character to
which COR or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound relating to the issuance of COR securities or securities
of any COR Subsidiary shall become rights to obtain solely shares of Millennium
Common Stock.

                (c) There are no registration rights, and, other than the COR
Rights Plan, there is no rights agreement, "poison pill" anti-takeover plan or
other agreement or understanding to which COR or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or by which it or they are bound with respect to any equity security of
any class of COR or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to any equity
security, partnership interest or similar ownership interest of any class of any
of its Subsidiaries.

                (d) Assuming that the Millennium Common Stock is listed on the
Nasdaq National Market and that there is no change to Section 262 of the DGCL
after the date hereof, COR stockholders are not entitled to dissenters' or
appraisal rights under applicable state law in connection with the Merger.

         Section 3.03 AUTHORITY; NO CONFLICT; REQUIRED FILINGS AND CONSENTS.

                (a) COR has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter
into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the COR Voting
Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by COR have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of COR and its Subsidiaries, subject only to the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the Merger by COR's stockholders under the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the board of
directors of COR (at a meeting duly called and held) has (i) unanimously
determined that the Merger is advisable and in the best interests of COR and its
stockholders, (ii) unanimously authorized and approved the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by COR and unanimously approved the Merger,
(iii) unanimously recommended the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of
the Merger by COR's stockholders and directed that this Agreement be submitted
for consideration by COR's stockholders at a meeting of COR's stockholders, and
(iv) to the extent necessary, adopted a resolution having the effect of causing
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the COR
Voting Agreements not to be subject to the restrictions set forth in any state
takeover law (including Section 203 of the DGCL) or similar law that might
otherwise apply. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by COR and
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of COR, enforceable in accordance
with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to
or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles (the "Bankruptcy
and Equity Exception").

                (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by COR does
not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not, (i) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, any
provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of COR, or the charter,
by-laws, or other organizational document of any Subsidiary of COR, (ii) result
in any violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) a default (or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation
or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any material benefit) under, or
require a consent or waiver under, or constitute a change in control under, or
require the payment of a penalty under or result in the imposition of any lien
on COR's or any of its Subsidiaries' assets under, any of the terms, conditions
or provisions of any material note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license,
contract or other agreement, instrument or obligation to which COR or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their properties or
assets may be bound, or (iii) conflict with or violate any permit, concession,
franchise, license, judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or
regulation applicable to COR or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their
properties or assets, except in the case of clauses (ii) or (iii) for any
conflicts or violations which, individually or in the aggregate, are not
reasonably likely to have a COR Material Adverse Effect.

                (c) No consent, approval, license, permit, waiver, order or
authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any court,
administrative agency or commission or other governmental authority or
instrumentality, foreign or domestic ("Governmental Entity") is required by or
with respect to COR or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except for (i) the filing of a pre-merger notification
report under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended, ("HSR Act") and the termination or expiration of the


                                      -12-
<PAGE>

waiting period applicable thereto, (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Delaware Secretary of State, (iii) the filing of the Joint Proxy
Statement (as defined in Section 3.21 below) with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "Exchange Act"), (iv) the filing of such reports or schedules
under Section 13 of the Exchange Act and materials under Rule 165 and Rule 425
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") as may be
required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, (v) such consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
declarations and filings as may be required under applicable state securities
laws and (vi) such other consents, licenses, permits, orders, authorizations,
filings, approvals and registrations which, if not obtained or made, would not
be reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a COR Material
Adverse Effect. The only COR stockholder vote required for the approval of the
COR Voting Proposal (as defined in Section 6.05(a) below) is the affirmative
vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of COR Common Stock on the record
date for the COR Meeting (as defined in Section 3.21 below).

         Section 3.04 SEC FILINGS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

                (a) Each registration statement, proxy statement, schedule or
report required to be filed by COR or any of its Subsidiaries with the SEC since
January 1, 1998 under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (collectively, the
"COR SEC Reports"), on the date filed (i) complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. COR has made available to Millennium true and complete copies of
all COR SEC Reports and all exhibits thereto or true and complete copies of such
COR SEC Reports and exhibits are available on EDGAR. None of COR's Subsidiaries
is required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC. Each of
the COR SEC Reports was filed on a timely basis.

                (b) Except to the extent expressly stated therein, each of the
consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any related notes
and schedules) contained in the COR SEC Reports (i) complied as to form in all
material respects with the applicable published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, (ii) were prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes to such financial statements
or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC)
and (iii) fairly presented the consolidated financial position of COR and its
Subsidiaries as of the dates and the consolidated results of operations and cash
flows of COR and its Subsidiaries for the periods indicated, consistent with the
books and records of COR and its Subsidiaries, except that the unaudited interim
financial statements were subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments
which were not expected to be material in amount. The unaudited consolidated
balance sheet of COR as of September 30, 2001 contained in the COR Form 10-Q for
the quarter ended September 30, 2001 is referred to herein as the "COR Balance
Sheet."

         Section 3.05 NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Except (i) as disclosed in the
COR SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, (ii) for liabilities to perform
its contractual obligations (which does not include liabilities for breach of
such obligations), and (iii) for liabilities and


                                      -13-
<PAGE>

obligations incurred since the date of the COR Balance Sheet in the ordinary
course of business and consistent with past practice, COR and its Subsidiaries
do not have any liabilities, either accrued, contingent or otherwise (whether or
not required to be reflected in financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles), and whether due or to become due,
which individually or in the aggregate are reasonably likely to have a COR
Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 3.06 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Except as disclosed
in the COR SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, since the date of the COR
Balance Sheet, COR and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective
businesses only in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past
practice and, since that date, there has not been (i) any event, change,
circumstance or development in the financial condition, results of operations,
business, properties or prospects of COR and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
that individually or in the aggregate has had, or is reasonably likely to have,
a COR Material Adverse Effect; (ii) any material damage, destruction or loss
(whether or not covered by insurance) with respect to COR or any of its
Subsidiaries; (iii) any material change by COR or any of its Subsidiaries in its
accounting methods not required pursuant to generally accepted accounting
principles; (iv) any material revaluation by COR or any of its Subsidiaries of
any of their assets; or (v) any other action or event that would have required
the consent of Millennium pursuant to Section 5.01 of this Agreement had such
action or event occurred after the date of this Agreement.

         Section 3.07 [Intentionally Omitted]

         Section 3.08 [Intentionally Omitted]

         Section 3.09 TAXES.

                (a) Except for such items which are not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a COR Material Adverse Effect: (i) COR and
each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed all Tax Returns (as defined below)
that it was required to file (taking into account applicable extensions), and
all such Tax Returns were correct and complete except to the extent that such
Tax Returns do not reflect unpaid Taxes (as defined below) for which accruals
and reserves have been set forth on the COR Balance Sheet; (ii) COR and each of
its Subsidiaries has paid on a timely basis all Taxes that were due (whether or
not shown) on any such Tax Returns; (iii) the unpaid Taxes of COR and its
Subsidiaries for Tax periods through the date of the COR Balance Sheet do not
exceed the accruals and reserves for Taxes set forth on the COR Balance Sheet
exclusive of any accruals and reserves for "deferred taxes" or similar items
that reflect timing differences between Tax and financial accounting principles;
(iv) all Taxes attributable to periods from and after the date of the COR
Balance Sheet have arisen in the ordinary course of business and are consistent
with regard to type and amount with Taxes incurred in comparable historical
periods; and (v) all Taxes that COR or any of its Subsidiaries is or was
required by law to withhold or collect have been duly withheld or collected and,
to the extent required, have been paid to the proper Governmental Entity.

                (b) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Taxes" means all taxes,
charges, fees, levies or other similar assessments or liabilities, including
income, gross receipts, ad valorem, premium, value-added, excise, real property,
personal property, sales, use, services, transfer,


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

withholding, employment, payroll and franchise taxes imposed by the United
States of America or any state, local or foreign government, or any agency
thereof, or other political subdivision of the United States or any such
government, and any interest, fines, penalties, assessments or additions to tax
resulting from, attributable to or incurred in connection with any tax or any
contest or dispute thereof and (ii) "Tax Returns" means all reports, returns,
declarations, statements or other information required to be supplied to a
taxing authority in connection with Taxes.

                (c) COR has made available to Millennium correct and complete
copies of all federal income Tax Returns, examination reports and statements of
deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by COR or any of its Subsidiaries
since December 31, 1994. The federal income Tax Returns of COR and each of its
Subsidiaries have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") or are
closed by the applicable statute of limitations for all taxable years through
December 31, 1994. No examination or audit of any Tax Return of COR or any of
its Subsidiaries by any Governmental Entity is currently in progress or, to the
knowledge of COR, threatened or contemplated. Neither COR nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been informed by any Governmental Entity that the Governmental
Entity believes that COR or any of its Subsidiaries was required to file any Tax
Return that was not filed. Neither COR nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived
any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to an extension of
time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency.

                (d) Neither COR nor any of its Subsidiaries: (i) is a
"consenting corporation" within the meaning of Section 341(f) of the Code, and
none of the assets of COR or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to an election
under Section 341(f) of the Code; (ii) has been a United States real property
holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during
the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(l)(A)(ii) of the Code; (iii)
has made any payments, is obligated to make any payments, or is a party to any
agreement that could obligate it to make any payments that may be treated as an
"excess parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code (without regard to
Section 280G(b)(4)); (iv) has any actual or potential liability for any Taxes of
any person (other than COR and its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of law in any jurisdiction), or as a
transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise; or (v) is or has been
required to make a basis reduction pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-20(b) or Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-2(b).

                (e) Neither COR nor any of its Subsidiaries has distributed to
its shareholders or security holders stock or securities of a controlled
corporation, nor has stock or securities of COR or any Subsidiary been
distributed, in a transaction to which Section 355 of the Code applies (i) in
the two years prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution that
could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions"
(within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code).

         Section 3.10 PROPERTIES. The COR Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true
and complete list of all real property leased by COR or its Subsidiaries
(collectively "Leases") and the location of the premises. Neither COR nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor, to COR's knowledge, any other party to any such Leases is
in default under any of such Leases, except where the existence of such
defaults, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have an
COR Material


                                      -15-
<PAGE>

Adverse Effect. COR and its Subsidiaries do not own and have never owned any
real property. Each of the Leases is in full force and effect and is enforceable
in accordance with its terms and shall not cease to be in full force and effect
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither COR nor
any of its Subsidiaries leases, subleases or licenses any real property to any
person other than COR and its Subsidiaries. COR has made available to Millennium
true and complete copies of all Leases.

         Section 3.11 SUPPLIERS. No material supplier or exclusive supplier of
COR or any of its Subsidiaries, including any manufacturer of Integrilin(R), has
indicated in writing to COR or any of its Subsidiaries that it will stop, or
decrease the rate of, supplying materials, products or services to COR or any of
its Subsidiaries or co-promotion partners. For the Integrilin(R) product, since
November 1, 2001, neither (a) manufacture of bulk drug substance or (b) filling
and finishing of such drug substance have been or are being performed for or on
behalf of COR or any of its Subsidiaries by Schering-Plough Ltd. (or any of its
affiliates) at any facility in Puerto Rico.

         Section 3.12 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

                (a) The COR Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete
list of each of the following items: (1) all patents and applications therefor,
including any patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates,
in the United States, the European Union or any country therein or Japan that
are owned by COR or any of its Subsidiaries or that are licensed or sublicensed
to COR or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to COR Intellectual Property
Rights (as defined below), (2) registrations of the trademark "Integrilin" and
applications therefor, (3) all licenses, agreements and contracts relating to
COR Intellectual Property Rights pursuant to which COR or any of its
Subsidiaries are entitled to use any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined
below) owned by any third party (the "Third Party Licenses"), other than
commercially available, mass marketed shrink-wrap software, and (4) all
agreements under which COR or any of its Subsidiaries has granted any third
party the right to use any COR Intellectual Property Rights.

                (b) COR and its Subsidiaries exclusively own, or are licensed,
sublicensed or otherwise possess legally enforceable rights to use on an
exclusive basis (without any obligation to make any fixed or contingent
payments, including any royalty payments) all Intellectual Property Rights that
are now used or planned to be used in the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale
or importation of, or which are necessary to make, have made, use, sell, offer
to sell or import Integrilin(R), cromafiban or RTK inhibitors CT-53518 or
CT-53608 (each, a "COR Product" and collectively the "COR Products") in the
United States, the European Union and the countries therein, and Japan (all such
Intellectual Property Rights described in this sentence constituting the "COR
Intellectual Property Rights"). For purposes hereof, "Intellectual Property
Rights" means all patents, including patent term extensions and supplementary
protection certificates, trademarks, trade names, domain names, service marks
and copyrights, any applications for and registrations of such patents,
trademarks, trade names, domain names, service marks and copyrights, and all
proprietary processes, formulae, methods, schematics, technology, know-how,
computer software programs or applications and tangible or intangible
proprietary information or material.

<PAGE>

                (c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
consummation of the Merger will not result in the breach of, or create on behalf
of any third party the right to terminate or modify, any license, sublicense or
other agreement to which COR or its Subsidiaries is a party and which relates to
the COR Intellectual Property Rights, including any Third Party License, except
where the breach, termination or modification, individually or in the aggregate
with every other such breach, termination or modification, is not reasonably
likely to have a COR Material Adverse Effect.

                (d) To the knowledge of COR, (i) all patents, including all
patent term extensions and supplementary protection certificates, registered
trademarks, registered service marks and copyrights under which COR or any of
its Subsidiaries holds any rights and which are material to the business of COR
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are valid and subsisting, and (ii)
except as indicated on the COR Disclosure Schedule as being abandoned or
withdrawn, all applications for such patents, trademarks, service marks and
copyrights are subsisting and were filed in good faith. To the knowledge of COR,
no other person or entity is infringing, violating or misappropriating any of
the COR Intellectual Property Rights.

                (e) To the knowledge of COR, none of the activities or business
previously or currently conducted by COR or any of its Subsidiaries relating to
the COR Products or currently planned to be conducted by COR or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to the COR Products (including the manufacture, use, sale,
offer for sale and importation of COR Products for any clinical indications)
infringes, violates or constitutes a misappropriation, in any material way, of
any Intellectual Property Rights of any other person or entity. Since January 1,
1995, neither COR nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
complaint, claim or notice alleging any such infringement, violation or
misappropriation, present or future.

                (f) None of COR or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
agreement under which, following the Closing, a third party would be entitled to
receive a license or any other right in or to Intellectual Property Rights of
Millennium or any of Millennium's Affiliates (other than COR and its
Subsidiaries) or which, following the Closing, would restrict or limit the
business or operations of Millennium or any of its Affiliates (other than COR
and its Subsidiaries).

                (g) COR and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable measures and
precautions to protect and maintain the confidentiality, secrecy and value of
all COR Intellectual Property Rights. To the knowledge of COR, no current or
former employee, officer, director, stockholder, consultant or independent
contractor has any right, claim or interest in or with respect to any COR
Intellectual Property Rights.

         Section 3.13 AGREEMENTS, CONTRACTS AND COMMITMENTS.

                (a) COR has filed with the SEC all contracts and agreements
required to be filed by COR under Item 601 of Regulation S-K or which it would
be required to file if it were required to file an Annual Report on Form 10-K on
the date of this Agreement (collectively, "COR Material Contracts"). Each COR
Material Contract is in full force and effect and is enforceable against COR
(and, to the knowledge of COR, against the other parties thereto) in accordance
with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. Neither COR nor

                                      -17-
<PAGE>

any of its Subsidiaries nor, to COR's knowledge, any other party to any COR
Material Contract is in violation of or in default under (nor does there exist
any condition which, upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both,
would cause such a violation of or default under) any COR Material Contract,
except for violations or defaults that, individually or in the aggregate, are
not reasonably likely to have a COR Material Adverse Effect.

                (b) The COR Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete list of
each contract or agreement to which COR or any Subsidiary is a party or bound
that includes any non-competition, non-solicitation, standstill or similar
restrictions or undertakings on COR or any Subsidiary of COR. To COR's
knowledge, none of the contracts or agreements referred to in the foregoing
sentence would preclude Millennium or any of its Affiliates from engaging in any
current activities of Millennium or such Affiliates or any planned activities of
Millennium or such Affiliates that Millennium has disclosed in the Millennium
SEC Reports (as defined in Section 4.04(a) below) or otherwise disclosed to COR
in writing. Since January 1, 2001, there has been no transaction to which COR or
any of its Subsidiaries was or is a party which would be required to be
disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K and which has not been disclosed in a
COR SEC Report filed prior to the date hereof.

         Section 3.14 PRODUCT LIABILITY; LITIGATION. No product liability claims
have been asserted in a writing given to COR or any of its Subsidiaries or, to
the knowledge of COR, threatened against COR or any of its Subsidiaries relating
to products or product candidates developed, tested, manufactured, marketed,
distributed or sold by COR or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as described in
the COR SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, there is no (i) action, suit
or proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation against COR or any of its
Subsidiaries pending or, to the knowledge of COR, threatened other than those
seeking only monetary damages in an amount, individually or together with
similar matters, not in excess of $100,000 or (ii) judgment, order or decree
outstanding against COR or any of its Subsidiaries.

         Section 3.15 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

                (a) Except as disclosed in the COR SEC Reports filed prior to
the date hereof and except for such matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a COR Material Adverse Effect: (i)
COR and its Subsidiaries have complied with and are in compliance with all
applicable Environmental Laws (as defined in Section 3.15(b)); (ii) the

Subsidiaries were not contaminated with Hazardous Substances during or, to the
knowledge of COR, before the period of ownership or operation by COR or any of
its Subsidiaries; (iv) neither COR nor its Subsidiaries have received written
notice that they are subject to liability for any Hazardous Substance disposal
or contamination on the property of any third party and, to COR's knowledge,

neither COR nor any of its Subsidiaries have released any Hazardous Substance
into the environment in violation of or which could result in response
obligations under applicable Environmental Laws; (vi) neither COR nor any of its

for information alleging that COR or any of its Subsidiaries may be in violation
of, liable under or have obligations under any Environmental


                                      -18-
<PAGE>

Law and (vii) neither COR nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any orders,
decrees, injunctions or other arrangements with any Governmental Entity, or is
subject to any indemnity or other agreement with any third party relating to
liability or obligation under any Environmental Law or relating to Hazardous
Substances.

                (b) As used herein, the term "Environmental Law" means any
federal, state, local or foreign law, regulation, order, decree, permit,
authorization, common law or agency requirement relating to: (A) the protection
of, investigation of effect on, or restoration of the environment, human health
and safety, or natural resources, (B) the handling, manufacturing,
transportation, use, presence, disposal, release or threatened release of any
Hazardous Substance or (C) noise, odor, wetlands, pollution, contamination or
any injury or threat of injury to persons or property related to any of them.

                (c) As used herein, the term "Hazardous Substance" means any

Agreement containing representations and warranties of COR concerning
environmental matters.

                (a) The COR Disclosure Schedule lists all material employee
benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) and all bonus, stock option, stock
purchase, incentive, deferred compensation, supplemental retirement, severance
and other similar employee benefit plans, and all unexpired severance
agreements, written or otherwise, for the benefit of, or relating to, any
current or former employee of COR or any of its Subsidiaries (together, the "COR
Employee Plans").

                (b) With respect to each COR Employee Plan, COR has furnished or
made available to Millennium, a true and complete copy of (i) the most recent
annual report (Form 5500) filed with the IRS, (ii) such COR Employee Plan, (iii)
each trust agreement and group annuity contract, if any, relating to such COR
Employee Plan and (iv) the most recent reports regarding the satisfaction of the
nondiscrimination requirements of Sections 410(b), 401(k) and 401(m) of the
Code.

                (c) Each COR Employee Plan has been administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and each of COR, its Subsidiaries and each
of their ERISA Affiliates (as defined below) has in all material respects met
its obligations with respect to each COR Employee Plan and has made all required
contributions thereto. COR, its Subsidiaries, each ERISA Affiliate and each COR
Employee Plan are in compliance in all material respects with the currently
applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations thereunder
(including Section 4980B of the Code, Subtitle K, Chapter 100 of the Code and
Sections 601 through 608 and Section 701 et seq. of ERISA). All filings and
reports as to each COR


                                      -19-
<PAGE>

Employee Plan required to have been submitted to the IRS or to the United States
Department of Labor have been duly submitted. No COR Employee Plan has assets
that include securities issued by COR or any ERISA Affiliate. Each COR Employee
Plan which is required to satisfy Section 401(k)(3) or Section 401(m)(2) of the
Code has been tested for compliance with, and satisfies the requirements of
Section 401(k)(3) and Section 401(m)(2) of the Code for each plan year ending
prior to the Closing Date. With respect to the COR Employee Plans, no event has
occurred which could reasonably be expected to be subject to any material
liability under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law.

                (d) With respect to the COR Employee Plans, there are no funded
benefit obligations for which contributions have not been made or properly
accrued and there are no material unfunded benefit obligations which have not
been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, on the COR Balance Sheet.

                (e) Neither COR, any Subsidiary of COR nor any trade or business
(whether or not incorporated) which is a member of a controlled group of
corporations or which is under common control with COR or any Subsidiary of COR
within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (an "ERISA
Affiliate") has (i) ever maintained an COR Employee Plan which was subject to
Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or (ii) ever been obligated to
contribute to a multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA).

                (f) Except as disclosed in COR SEC Reports filed prior to the
date of this Agreement, and except as provided for in this Agreement, neither
COR nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any oral or written (i) agreement
with any officer or other key employee of COR or any of its Subsidiaries, the
benefits of which are contingent, or the terms of which are materially altered,
upon the occurrence of a transaction involving COR of the nature contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) agreement with any employee of COR or any of its
Subsidiaries (A) providing any term of employment or compensation guarantee
extending for a period longer than one year from the date hereof, (B) which is
not terminable on 30 days' notice without penalty, or (C) providing for the
payment of compensation in excess of $100,000 per annum, or (iii) agreement or
plan, including any stock option plan, stock appreciation right plan, restricted
stock plan or stock purchase plan, any of the benefits of which will be
increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which will be accelerated, by the
occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
value of any of the benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. COR has made available to
Millennium such information as is in COR's possession or under COR's control and
reasonably necessary for Millennium to calculate any excise tax due under
Section 4999 of the Code as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement for which COR or its Subsidiaries or Millennium may directly or
indirectly become liable and the amount of deductions that may be disallowed
under Section 280G of the Code as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

                (g) Each COR Employee Plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has either obtained from the IRS a favorable
determination letter as to its qualified status under the Code, including all
amendments to the Code effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent
legislation, or has applied (or has time remaining in which to apply) to the


                                      -20-
<PAGE>

IRS for such a determination letter prior to the expiration of the requisite
period under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to
apply for such determination letter and to make any amendments necessary to
obtain a favorable determination or has been established under a standardized
prototype plan for which an IRS opinion letter has been obtained by the plan
sponsor and is valid as to the adopting employer. COR has furnished or made
available to Millennium a true and complete copy of the most recent IRS
determination or opinion with respect to each such COR Employee Plan and, to the
knowledge of COR, nothing has occurred since the inception of each such COR
Employee Plan which could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the
tax-qualified status of any COR Employee Plan subject to Section 401(a) of the
Code.

                (h) None of the COR Employee Plans promises or provides retiree
medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any person, except as required by
applicable law.

         Section 3.17 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. COR and each of its Subsidiaries has
complied in all material respects with, is not in material violation of, and has
not received any notices of material violation with respect to, any foreign,
federal, state or local statute, law or regulation affecting the conduct of its
business, or the ownership or operation of its properties or assets.

         Section 3.18 PRECLINICAL TESTING AND CLINICAL TRIALS. The COR
Disclosure Schedule sets forth all human clinical trials conducted prior to the
date of this Agreement by COR or any of its Subsidiaries, on behalf of COR or
any of its Subsidiaries, or in which COR or any of its Subsidiaries has
participated (including any such trials which are still pending). The human
clinical trials, animal studies and other preclinical tests conducted by COR or
any of its Subsidiaries or in which COR or any of its Subsidiaries has
participated, and such studies and tests conducted on behalf of COR or any of
its Subsidiaries, were and, if still pending, are being conducted in all
material respects in accordance with (A) experimental protocols, informed
consents, procedures and controls generally used by qualified experts in the
preclinical or clinical study of products comparable to those being developed by
COR or its Subsidiaries, and (B) all applicable laws and regulations, including
but not limited to, 21 CFR part 50 (informed consent), part 56 (institutional
review boards), part 58 (good laboratory practices), part 812 (investigational
device exemptions), and all other applicable laws and regulations. None of COR,
its Subsidiaries or the contract research organization overseeing or assisting
COR in administering any clinical or preclinical trial or investigator-sponsored
trial of Integrilin(R), cromafiban or RTK inhibitors CT-53518 or CT-53608 on
behalf of COR or its Subsidiaries has received any notices or correspondence
from the Federal Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") or any other
governmental agency, and no other agent or representative of COR or any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notices or correspondence from the FDA or
any other governmental agency, requiring the delay, termination, suspension or
modification (other than such modifications as are normal in the regulatory
process) of any animal studies, preclinical tests or clinical trials conducted
by or on behalf of COR or any of its Subsidiaries or in which COR or any of its
Subsidiaries has participated. No clinical investigator acting for COR or any of
its Subsidiaries has been or is now, or is threatened to become, the subject of
any disbarment or disqualification proceedings by any regulatory agency.

         Section 3.19 CERTAIN REGULATORY MATTERS.

                (a) COR has made available to Millennium a true and complete
copy of all material written communications between COR or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the FDA or any other governmental entity on
the other hand, and any existing written summaries of material discussions
between such parties, that describe matters that are material to assessing
compliance of COR with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its
implementing regulations, including copies of (i) all warning letters, notices
of adverse findings and similar correspondence, (ii) all audit reports, and
(iii) any document concerning any significant oral or written communication
received from the FDA. COR has also made available to Millennium true and
complete copies of all complaints and other information required to be
maintained by COR or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the United States
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and
Control Act of 1970 and the corresponding laws of jurisdictions other than the
United States.

                (b) COR and its Subsidiaries have filed with the FDA and all
applicable state, local and foreign regulatory bodies for and received approval
of all material registrations, applications, licenses, requests for exemptions,
permits and other regulatory authorizations necessary to conduct the business of
COR and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted. COR and its Subsidiaries and,
to COR's knowledge, any third party which is a manufacturer for COR or its
Subsidiaries, are in compliance in all material respects with all such
registrations, applications, licenses, requests for exemptions, permits and
other regulatory authorizations. Each of COR, its Subsidiaries and, to its
knowledge, any such third party manufacturer is in compliance in all material
respects with all material FDA, state, local and foreign rules, regulations,
guidelines and policies, including, but not limited to, material FDA, state,
local and foreign rules, regulations and policies relating to good clinical
practice ("GCP"), good manufacturing practice ("GMP"), good laboratory practice
("GLP"), advertising and promotion, pre- and post-marketing adverse drug
experience and adverse drug reaction reporting, and all other pre- and
post-marketing reporting requirements, as applicable; (i) no party granting any
such registration, application, license, request for exemption, permit or other
authorization has notified COR or any of its Subsidiaries in writing that it is
considering limiting, suspending or revoking the same, including by enjoining or
limiting the production of any product of COR or any of its Subsidiaries
manufactured by a third party manufacturer, and (ii) to the knowledge of COR
there is no basis for any such limitation, suspension or revocation.

                (c) The COR Disclosure Schedule sets forth a description of any
discussions or negotiations since January 1, 2001 between COR or any of its
Subsidiaries or any party marketing, selling or co-promoting Integrilin(R) and
the Governmental Entity administering the Medicare program relating to any
proposed modification or change of the reimbursement rate or other reimbursement
arrangements with respect to Integrilin(R) and lists any written communications
relating to such discussions or negotiations.

         Section 3.20 TAX MATTERS. To its knowledge, after consulting with its
independent auditors, neither COR nor any of its Affiliates (as defined in
Section 6.09 below) has taken or agreed to take any action which would prevent
the Merger from constituting a transaction qualifying as a reorganization under
368(a) of the Code.

         Section 3.21 REGISTRATION STATEMENT; PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. The
information related to COR or to be supplied in writing by COR for inclusion in
the registration statement on


                                      -22-
<PAGE>

Form S-4 pursuant to which shares of Millennium Common Stock issued in the
Merger will be registered under the Securities Act (the "Registration
Statement"), or for inclusion in any filing pursuant to Rule 165 and Rule 425
under the Securities Act (each a "Regulation M-A Filing"), shall not at the time
the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC or any Regulation
M-A Filing is filed with the SEC, or at any time it is amended or supplemented,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
in the Registration Statement not misleading. The information related to COR or
to be supplied in writing by COR or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion in the
joint proxy statement/prospectus to be sent to the stockholders of Millennium
and COR in connection with the meeting of COR's stockholders to consider this
Agreement and the Merger (the "COR Meeting") and in connection with the meeting
of Millennium's stockholders (the "Millennium Meeting") to consider the issuance
of shares of Millennium Common Stock pursuant to the Merger (the "Joint Proxy
Statement") shall not, on the date the Joint Proxy Statement is first mailed to
stockholders of COR or Millennium, at the time of the COR Meeting or the
Millennium Meeting or at the Effective Time, contain any statement which, at
such time and in light of the circumstances under which it shall be made, is
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made in the Joint Proxy
Statement not false or misleading; or omit to state any material fact necessary
to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the
solicitation of proxies for the COR Meeting or the Millennium Meeting which has
become false or misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event
relating to COR or any of its Affiliates, officers or directors should be
discovered by COR which should be set forth in an amendment to the Registration
Statement or a supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement, COR shall promptly
inform Millennium.

         Section 3.22 LABOR MATTERS.

                (a) Neither COR nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
otherwise bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization. Neither COR
nor any of its Subsidiaries is the subject of any proceeding asserting that COR
or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice or seeking to
compel it to bargain with any labor union or labor organization. There is not
pending or, to the knowledge of COR, threatened, any labor strike, dispute,
walkout, work stoppage, slow-down or lockout involving COR or any of its
Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to
have a material effect on COR and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The COR
Disclosure Schedule lists all employees of COR or any of its Subsidiaries who
are not citizens of the United States and the respective immigration status of
each such employee.

                (b) Except as set forth on the COR Disclosure Schedule, no
officer of COR or any of its Subsidiaries at the vice-president (or equivalent)
level or above has an employment agreement with COR or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than (i) an oral agreement terminable without notice or (ii) an offer
letter that provides for at-will employment without severance arrangements).

         Section 3.23 INSURANCE. All fire and casualty, general liability,
business interruption, product liability, clinical trial and sprinkler and water
damage insurance policies maintained by


                                      -23-
<PAGE>

COR or any of its Subsidiaries are with reputable insurance carriers, provide
coverage for all normal risks incident to the business of COR and its
Subsidiaries and their respective properties and assets (taking into account the
products of COR and its Subsidiaries and the indications for which such products
are and have been sold). COR has made available to Millennium a summary of the
material insurance coverages (which shall include all product liability
coverages) maintained by COR and its Subsidiaries, including deductibles, and a
history of any claims made and claims paid since January 1, 1998 involving more
than $100,000. None of such material insurance policies (including all product
liability policies) will terminate or lapse (or be affected in any other
material manner) by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
No insurer under any such insurance policy has canceled or disclaimed liability
under any such policy or notified COR in writing of its intent to do so or not
to renew any such policy, or has quoted COR new rates for the next policy year.
All material claims under the insurance policies have been filed by COR and its
Subsidiaries and paid in a timely fashion.

         Section 3.24 NO EXISTING DISCUSSIONS. As of the time of execution and
delivery of this Agreement, neither COR nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged,
directly or indirectly, in any discussions or negotiations with any other party
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 6.01).

         Section 3.25 OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR. The financial advisor of
COR, Goldman, Sachs & Co. ("Goldman Sachs"), has delivered to COR an opinion
dated on the date of this Agreement to the effect that, as of such date, the
Exchange Ratio is fair from a financial point of view to the holders of COR
Common Stock. A signed copy of such opinion will be delivered to Millennium as
promptly as practicable following the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

         Section 3.26 SECTION 203 OF THE DGCL AND BUSINESS COMBINATION
PROVISIONS OF CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION NOT APPLICABLE. The Board of
Directors of COR has taken all actions so that the restrictions contained in
Section 203 of the DGCL applicable to a "business combination" (as defined in
Section 203) will not apply to the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement or the COR Voting Agreements or the consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the COR Voting Agreements.
The provisions of Article SIXTH of the Certificate of Incorporation of COR do
not apply to the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the COR
Voting Agreements or the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the COR Voting Agreements so as to require
that the COR Voting Proposal be approved by the affirmative vote of any
percentage of the outstanding shares of the COR Voting Stock greater than a
majority of the outstanding shares of COR Common Stock on the record date for
the COR Meeting or to require any other consent or approval that has not been
obtained on or before the date of this Agreement.

         Section 3.27 RIGHTS AGREEMENT. COR has amended the COR Rights Plan in
the form of EXHIBIT C attached hereto and has taken all other action necessary
or appropriate so that the entering into of this Agreement and the COR Voting
Agreements do not and will not result in the ability of any person to exercise
any of the COR Rights under the COR Rights Plan or enable or require the COR
Rights issued thereunder to separate from the shares of COR Common Stock to
which they are attached or to be triggered or become exercisable or cease to be
redeemable.

         Section 3.28 BROKER FEES. Neither COR nor any of its Subsidiaries nor
any of their respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder,
investment banker or financial advisor or incurred any liability for any
broker's fees, commissions or finder's fees in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that COR has engaged, and
will pay a fee to, Goldman Sachs in accordance with the terms of a letter
agreement between COR and Goldman Sachs dated October 3, 1999, a true and
complete copy of which has been delivered to Millennium.

                                   ARTICLE IV

              REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF Millennium AND SUB

         Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by Millennium
and Sub to COR on or before the date of this Agreement (the "Millennium
Disclosure Schedule") (which Millennium Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in
sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in this
Article IV and the disclosure in any section shall qualify (1) the corresponding
section of this Article IV and (2) other sections in this Article IV to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent that it also qualifies or applies to such
other sections), Millennium and Sub represent and warrant to COR as follows in
this Article IV. As used in this Agreement, any reference to "Millennium's
knowledge", "the knowledge of Millennium", "the best knowledge of Millennium",
"of which Millennium is aware", or any similar expression shall mean the actual
knowledge of Mark J. Levin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin P.
Starr, Executive Vice President, Business Operations and Chief Financial
Officer, Robert Tepper, Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer,
and John B. Douglas III, Senior Vice President and General Counsel (the
"Millennium Knowledge Parties").

         For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Millennium Material Adverse
Effect" means any material adverse change, event, circumstance, development or
effect on (a) the assets, business, financial condition, results of operations
or prospects of Millennium and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; or (b) the
ability of Millennium to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that the following events shall not be deemed to
be, and shall not be taken into account in determining whether there has been or
whether there is likely or expected to be, a "Millennium Material Adverse
Effect" on or with respect to Millennium and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole:
(i) any adverse change in the stock price of Millennium in and of itself, as
quoted on the Nasdaq National Market; (ii) any adverse change, event,
circumstance, development or effect resulting from a change in general economic,
industry or financial market conditions not substantially disproportionately
affecting Millennium and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; (iii) any change,
event, circumstance, development or effect resulting from a breach of this
Agreement by COR or Sub, (iv) any adverse change, event, circumstance,
development or effect resulting from any acts of terrorism or war, including the
events of September 11, 2001, fighting in Afghanistan, letters containing
anthrax and similar circumstances, (v) any adverse change, event, circumstance,
development or effect directly resulting from the announcement or pendency of
the Merger, and (vi) any adverse change, event, circumstance, development or
effect resulting from or relating to compliance with the terms of, the taking of
any action expressly required by, this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Parties agree that the terms "material", "materially" or "materiality" as
used in this Agreement with an initial lower case "m" shall have their
respective customary meanings, without regard to


                                      -25-
<PAGE>

the meaning ascribed to Millennium Material Adverse Effect in the prior
sentences of this paragraph or the meaning ascribed to COR Material Adverse
Effect in Article III above.

         Section 4.01 ORGANIZATION OF MILLENNIUM AND SUB. Each of Millennium and
Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all requisite corporate
power to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the failure
to be so qualified, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely
to be material. Millennium has made available to COR true and complete copies of
the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of Millennium and of the charter,
by-laws or other organizational documents of each Subsidiary of Millennium.

         Section 4.02 MILLENNIUM CAPITAL STRUCTURE. As of the date of this
Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Millennium consists of (i)
500,000,000 shares of Millennium Common Stock, and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, $.001 par value ("Millennium Preferred Stock") of which 500,000
shares have been designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. As of
December 3, 2001, there were issued and outstanding 222,671,521 shares of
Millennium Common Stock, all of which are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and no shares of Preferred Stock. Between December 3, 2001 and
the date of this Agreement, (i) no shares of Millennium Common Stock or
Millennium Preferred Stock were issued other than pursuant to the Millennium
Stock Plans (as defined below) or the warrants and other outstanding rights to
purchase Millennium Common Stock listed in Section 4.02 of the Millennium
Disclosure Schedules, and (ii) no stock options have been issued or awarded by
Millennium. All of the issued and outstanding Millennium Common Stock was issued
in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws. The Millennium
Disclosure Schedule shows the number of shares of Millennium Common Stock and
Millennium Preferred Stock reserved for future issuance pursuant to (i) stock
options granted and outstanding as of December 3, 2001, and the plans under
which such options were granted (collectively, the "Millennium Stock Plans"),
(ii) the conversion of the 5.5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due January 15,
2007 outstanding on the date of this Agreement, (iii) the rights outstanding as
of the date of this Agreement (the "Millennium Rights") under the Rights
Agreement between Millennium and State Street Bank and Trust Company, as Rights
Agent, dated April 5, 2001 (the "Millennium Rights Agreement"); and (iv) the
warrants and other outstanding rights to purchase Millennium Common Stock
outstanding on the date of this Agreement. All shares of Millennium Common Stock
and Millennium Preferred Stock subject to issuance as specified above are duly
authorized and, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the
instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, shall be validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable.

         Section 4.03 AUTHORITY; NO CONFLICT; REQUIRED FILINGS AND CONSENTS.

                (a) Each of Millennium and Sub has all requisite corporate power
and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the Millennium Voting Agreements and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of each of Millennium and Sub, subject only to the
approval of the Millennium Voting Proposal (as defined in


                                      -26-
<PAGE>

Section 6.05(b)) by Millennium's stockholders. Without limiting the generality
of the preceding sentence, the board of directors of Millennium (at a meeting
duly called and held) has (i) unanimously determined that the Merger is
advisable and in the best interests of Millennium, (ii) unanimously authorized
and approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
Millennium and unanimously approved the Merger, and (iii) unanimously
recommended the approval of the issuance of the Merger Shares by Millennium's
stockholders and directed that the approval of the issuance of the Merger Shares
be submitted for consideration by Millennium's stockholders at a meeting of
Millennium's stockholders. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by each of Millennium and Sub and constitutes the valid and binding obligation
of each of Millennium and Sub, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject
to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. Millennium has reserved for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Millennium Common Stock for the purpose of
issuing such shares to COR's security holders in accordance with Article II.

                (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of
Millennium and Sub does not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not, (i) conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or
By-Laws of Millennium or Sub, (ii) result in any violation or breach of, or
constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) a default (or give
rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation
or loss of any material benefit) under, or require a consent or waiver under,
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any material note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, license, contract or other agreement, instrument or obligation
to which Millennium or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of
them or any of their properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) conflict with
or violate any permit, concession, franchise, license, judgment, order, decree,
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Millennium or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of its or their properties or assets, except for any
conflicts or violations which, individually or in the aggregate, are not
reasonably likely to have a Millennium Material Adverse Effect. No person other
than Millennium will have the right, pursuant to registration rights or
otherwise, to sell shares of Millennium capital stock under the Registration
Statement.

                (c) No consent, approval, license, permit, order or
authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental
Entity is required by or with respect to Millennium or any of its Subsidiaries
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (i) the filing
of the pre-merger notification report under the HSR Act and the termination or
expiration of the waiting period applicable thereto, (ii) the filing of the
Registration Statement with the SEC in accordance with the Securities Act, (iii)
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State,

the Exchange Act and materials under Rule 165 and Rule 425 of the Securities Act
as may be required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, (vi) such consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
registrations, declarations and filings as may be required under applicable
state securities laws, (vii) the filing with the Nasdaq National Market of
notice of the listing of the shares of Millennium Common Stock to be issued in
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (viii) such other consents,
licenses, permits, orders, authorizations, filings, approvals and registrations
which, if not obtained or made, would not be reasonably

likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Millennium Material Adverse
Effect. The Millennium stockholder vote required for the approval of the
Millennium Voting Proposal (as defined in Section 6.05(b) below) is the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Millennium Common
Stock voted at the Millennium Meeting at which a quorum of the holders of the
outstanding shares of Millennium Common Stock on the record date for the
Millennium Meeting is present.

         Section 4.04 SEC FILINGS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

                (a) Each registration statement, proxy statement, schedule or
report required to be filed by Millennium or any of its Subsidiaries with the
SEC since January 1, 1998 under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act
(collectively, the "Millennium SEC Reports") on the date filed (i) complied in
all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Millennium has made
available to COR true and complete copies of all Millennium SEC Reports and all
exhibits thereto or true and complete copies of such Millennium SEC Reports and
exhibits are available on EDGAR. None of Millennium's Subsidiaries is required
to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC. Each of the
Millennium SEC Reports was filed on a timely basis.

                (b) Except to the extent expressly stated therein, each of the
consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any related notes
and schedules) contained in the Millennium SEC Reports (i) complied as to form
in all material respects with the applicable published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) were prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes to such financial
statements or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of
the SEC) and (iii) fairly presented the consolidated financial position of
Millennium and its Subsidiaries and the consolidated results of operations and
cash flows for the periods indicated, consistent with the books and records of
Millennium and its Subsidiaries, except that the unaudited interim financial
statements were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments
which were not expected to be material in amount. The unaudited balance sheet of
Millennium as of September 30, 2001 is referred to as the "Millennium Balance
Sheet".

         Section 4.05 NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Except (i) as disclosed in the
Millennium SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, (ii) normal or recurring
liabilities incurred since the date of the Millennium Balance Sheet in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice, (iii) for
liabilities to perform its contractual obligations (which does not include
liabilities for breach of such obligations), (iv) indebtedness for money
borrowed after the date of this Agreement, and (v) liabilities and obligations
incurred in connection with activities permitted by clauses (i), (ii) or (iii)
of Section 5.02(f) below, Millennium and its Subsidiaries do not have any
liabilities, either accrued, contingent or otherwise (whether or not required to
be reflected in financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles), and whether due or to become due, which individually or
in the aggregate, are reasonably likely to have a Millennium Material Adverse
Effect.

         Section 4.06 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Except as disclosed
in the Millennium SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, between the date
of the Millennium Balance Sheet and the date of this Agreement, Millennium and
its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in the ordinary
course of business and consistent with past practice, and since the date of the
Millennium Balance Sheet, there has not been (i) any event, change or
development in the financial condition, results of operations, business,
properties or prospects of Millennium and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or is reasonably likely to
have, a Millennium Material Adverse Effect (it being agreed that the activities
expressly referred to in clauses (i) or (ii) of Section 5.02(f) below shall be
deemed not to have a Millennium Material Adverse Effect); (ii) any damage,
destruction or loss (whether or not covered by insurance) with respect to
Millennium or any of its Subsidiaries having a Millennium Material Adverse
Effect; (iii) any material change by Millennium in its accounting methods not
required pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, principles or
practices to which COR has not previously consented in writing; or (iv) any
revaluation by Millennium of any of its assets having a Millennium Material
Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.07 LITIGATION. Except as described in the Millennium SEC
Reports filed prior to the date hereof, there is no action, suit or proceeding,
claim, arbitration or investigation against Millennium or Sub pending or as to
which Millennium or Sub has received any written notice of assertion, which,
individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to have a Millennium
Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the ability of
Millennium to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         Section 4.08 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Millennium and each of its
Subsidiaries has complied with, is not in violation of, and has not received any
notices of violation with respect to, any foreign, federal, state or local
statute, law or regulation with respect to the conduct of its business, or the
ownership or operation of its properties or assets, except for failures to
comply or violations which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
are not reasonably likely to have a Millennium Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.09 TAX MATTERS. To its knowledge, after consulting with its
independent auditors, neither Millennium nor any of its Affiliates has taken or
agreed to take any action which would prevent the Merger from constituting a
transaction qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

         Section 4.10 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

                (a) Millennium and its Subsidiaries exclusively own, or are
licensed, sublicensed or otherwise possess legally enforceable rights to use,
pursuant to the licenses, agreements and contracts listed in Section 4.10(a) of
the Millennium Disclosure Schedule, all Intellectual Property Rights that are
now used or planned to be used in the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or
importation of, or which are necessary to make, have made, use, sell, offer to
sell or import the product candidates of Millennium and its Subsidiaries that
are undergoing Phase II human clinical trials as of the date of this Agreement
(the "Phase II Products") in the United States, the European Union and the
countries therein, and Japan (all such Intellectual Property Rights described in
this sentence constituting the "Millennium Intellectual Property Rights").

                (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
consummation of the Merger will not result in the breach of, or create on behalf
of any third party the right to terminate or modify, any license, sublicense or
other agreement to which Millennium or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and
which relates to the Millennium Intellectual Property Rights, where the breach,
termination or modification, individually or in the aggregate with every other
such breach, termination or modification, would be material to Millennium and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

                (c) To the knowledge of Millennium, (i) all patents, including
all patent term extensions and supplementary protection certificates, registered
trademarks, registered service marks and copyrights included in the Millennium
Intellectual Property Rights under which Millennium or any of its Subsidiaries
holds any rights and which are material to the business of Millennium and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are valid and subsisting, and (ii) except as
indicated on the Millennium Disclosure Schedule as being abandoned or withdrawn,
all applications for such patents, trademarks, service marks and copyrights are
subsisting and were filed in good faith. To the knowledge of Millennium, no
other person or entity is infringing, violating or misappropriating any of the
Millennium Intellectual Property Rights.

                (d) To the knowledge of Millennium, none of the activities or
business previously or currently conducted by Millennium or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to the Phase II Products or currently planned to be
conducted by Millennium or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Phase II
Products infringes, violates or constitutes a misappropriation, in any material
way, of any Intellectual Property Rights of any other person or entity. Since
January 1, 1995, neither Millennium nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written complaint, claim or notice alleging any such infringement, violation or
misappropriation, present or future.

                (e) Millennium and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable
measures and precautions to protect and maintain the confidentiality, secrecy
and value of all Millennium Intellectual Property Rights. To the knowledge of
Millennium, no current or former employee, officer, director, stockholder,
consultant or independent contractor has any right, claim or interest in or with
respect to any Millennium Intellectual Property Rights.

                (f) Neither Millennium nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any agreement under which, following the Closing, a third party would be
entitled to receive a license or any other right in or to Intellectual Property
Rights of COR or any of COR's Affiliates (other than Millennium and its
Subsidiaries) or which, following the Closing, would restrict or limit the
business or operations of COR or any of its Affiliates (other than Millennium
and its Subsidiaries), other than any license, right, restriction or limitation
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Millennium Material
Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.11 AGREEMENTS, CONTRACTS AND COMMITMENTS.

                (a) Neither Millennium nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to
Millennium's knowledge, any other party to any contract or agreement required to
be filed by Millennium with the SEC under Item 601 of Regulation S-K or which it
would be required to file if it were required to file an Annual Report on Form
10-K on the date of this Agreement (a "Millennium Material Contract") is in
material violation of or in material default under (nor does there exist


                                      -30-
<PAGE>

any condition which, upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both,
would cause such a violation of or default under) any Millennium Material
Contract. Each Millennium Material Contract is in full force and effect and is
enforceable against Millennium (and, to the knowledge of Millennium, against the
other parties thereto) in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy
and Equity Exception.

                (b) To Millennium's knowledge, neither Millennium nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any contract or agreement that includes
any non-competition, non-solicitation, standstill or similar restrictions or
undertakings that would preclude COR or any of its Affiliates from engaging in
any current activities of COR or such Affiliates or any planned activities of
COR or such Affiliates that COR has disclosed in the COR SEC Reports or
otherwise disclosed to Millennium in writing, other than those that would not
have a Millennium Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.12 PRODUCT LIABILITY. No product liability claims have been
asserted in a writing given to Millennium or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the
knowledge of Millennium, threatened against Millennium or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to products or product candidates developed, tested,
manufactured, marketed, distributed or sold by Millennium or any of its
Subsidiaries.

         Section 4.13 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Except as disclosed in the
Millennium SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof and except for such
matters that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to
have a Millennium Material Adverse Effect: (i) Millennium and its Subsidiaries
have complied with and are in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws;
(ii) the properties currently owned or operated by Millennium or any of its
Subsidiaries (including soils, groundwater, surface water, buildings or other
structures) are not contaminated with any Hazardous Substances; (iii) the
properties formerly owned or operated by Millennium or any of its Subsidiaries
were not contaminated with Hazardous Substances during or, to the knowledge of
Millennium, before the period of ownership or operation by Millennium or any of
its Subsidiaries; (iv) neither Millennium nor its Subsidiaries have received
written notice that they are subject to liability for any Hazardous Substance
disposal or contamination on the property of any third party and, to
Millennium's knowledge, neither Millennium nor any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to any such liability; (v) neither Millennium nor any of its
Subsidiaries have released any Hazardous Substance into the environment in
violation of applicable Environmental Laws; (vi) neither Millennium nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any written notice, demand, letter, claim or
request for information alleging that Millennium or any of its Subsidiaries may
be in violation of, liable under or have obligations under any Environmental
Law; and (vii) neither Millennium nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
orders, decrees, injunctions or other arrangements with any Governmental Entity,
or is subject to any indemnity or other agreement with any third party relating
to liability or obligation under any Environmental Law or relating to Hazardous
Substances. This Section 4.13 shall be the exclusive section in this Agreement
containing representations and warranties of Millennium concerning environmental
matters.

         Section 4.14 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS PLANS.

                (a) Each material employee benefit plan (as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA) and all bonus, stock option, stock purchase, incentive, deferred
compensation, supplemental retirement, severance and other similar employee
benefit plans, and all unexpired severance agreements, written or otherwise, for
the benefit of, or relating to, any current or former employee of Millennium or
any of its Subsidiaries are referred to as the "Millennium Employee Plans". Each
Millennium Employee Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects
in accordance with its terms and each of Millennium, its Subsidiaries and each
of their ERISA Affiliates has in all material respects met its obligations with
respect to each Millennium Employee Plan and has made all required contributions
thereto. Millennium, its Subsidiaries, each ERISA Affiliate and each Millennium
Employee Plan are in compliance in all material respects with the currently
applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations thereunder
(including Section 4980B of the Code, Subtitle K, Chapter 100 of the Code and
Sections 601 through 608 and Section 701 et seq. of ERISA). All filings and
reports as to each Millennium Employee Plan required to have been submitted to
the IRS or to the United States Department of Labor have been duly submitted. No
Millennium Employee Plan has assets that include securities issued by Millennium
or any ERISA Affiliate. Each Millennium Employee Plan which is required to
satisfy Section 401(k)(3) or Section 401(m)(2) of the Code has been tested for
compliance with, and satisfies the requirements of Section 401(k)(3) and Section
401(m)(2) of the Code for each plan year ending prior to the Closing Date.

                (b) With respect to the Millennium Employee Plans, there are no
funded benefit obligations for which contributions have not been made or
properly accrued and there are no material unfunded benefit obligations which
have not been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, on the Millennium
Balance Sheet.

                (c) Neither Millennium, any Subsidiary of Millennium nor any
ERISA Affiliate has (i) ever maintained an Millennium Employee Plan which was
subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or (ii) ever been
obligated to contribute to a multiemployer plan (as defined in Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA).

                (d) Each Millennium Employee Plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has either obtained from the IRS a favorable
determination letter as to its qualified status under the Code, including all
amendments to the Code effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent
legislation, or has applied (or has time remaining in which to apply) to the IRS
for such a determination letter prior to the expiration of the requisite period
under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply
for such determination letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a
favorable determination or has been established under a standardized prototype
plan for which an IRS opinion letter has been obtained by the plan sponsor and
is valid as to the adopting employer. Millennium has furnished or made available
to COR a true and complete copy of the most recent IRS determination or opinion
with respect to each such Millennium Employee Plan and, to the knowledge of
Millennium, nothing has occurred since the inception of each such Millennium
Employee Plan which could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the
tax-qualified status of any Millennium Employee Plan subject to Section 401(a)
of the Code.

                (e) None of the Millennium Employee Plans promises or provides
retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any person, except as
required by applicable law.

         Section 4.15 PRECLINICAL TESTING AND CLINICAL TRIALS. The Millennium
Disclosure Schedule sets forth all human clinical trials conducted prior to the
date of this Agreement by Millennium or any of its Subsidiaries, on behalf of
Millennium or any of its Subsidiaries, or in which Millennium or any of its
Subsidiaries has participated, with respect to the Phase II Products (including
any such trials which are still pending). The human clinical trials, animal
studies and other preclinical tests relating to the Phase II Products conducted
by Millennium or any of its Subsidiaries or in which Millennium or any of its
Subsidiaries has participated, and such studies and tests conducted on behalf of
Millennium or any of its Subsidiaries, were and, if still pending, are being
conducted in accordance with (A) experimental protocols, informed consents,
procedures and controls generally used by qualified experts in the preclinical
or clinical study of products comparable to the Phase II Products, and (B) all
applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to, 21 CFR part 50
(informed consent), part 56 (institutional review boards), part 58 (good
laboratory practices), part 812 (investigational device exemptions), and all
other applicable laws and regulations, except for any noncompliances which,
individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Millennium
Material Adverse Effect. None of Millennium, its Subsidiaries or the contract
research organization overseeing or assisting Millennium in administering any
clinical or preclinical trial or investigator-sponsored trials on behalf of
Millennium or its Subsidiaries has received any notices or correspondence from
the FDA or any other governmental agency, and no any agent or representative of
Millennium or any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notices or
correspondence from the FDA or any other governmental agency, requiring the
delay, termination, suspension or modification (other than such modifications as
are normal in the regulatory process) of any animal studies, preclinical tests
or clinical trials conducted by or on behalf of Millennium or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to the Phase II Products or in which Millennium or any of
its Subsidiaries has participated relating to the Phase II Products. No clinical
investigator acting for Millennium or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
the Phase II Products has been or is now, or is threatened to become, the
subject of any disbarment or disqualification proceedings by any regulatory
agency.

         Section 4.16 CERTAIN REGULATORY MATTERS. Millennium and its
Subsidiaries have, with respect to the Phase II Products, filed with the FDA and
all applicable state, local and foreign regulatory bodies for and received
approval of all material registrations, applications, licenses, requests for
exemptions, permits and other regulatory authorizations necessary to conduct the
business of Millennium and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, except for
any such failures to file or receive approval which, individually or in the
aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Millennium Material Adverse
Effect. Millennium and its Subsidiaries and, to Millennium's knowledge, any
third party which is a manufacturer for Millennium or its Subsidiaries, with
respect to the Phase II Products, are in compliance with all such registrations,
applications, licenses, requests for exemptions, permits and other regulatory
authorizations, except for any such noncompliances which, individually or in the
aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Millennium Material Adverse
Effect. Each of Millennium, its Subsidiaries and, to Millennium's knowledge, any
such third party manufacturer, with respect to the Phase II Products, is in
compliance with all FDA, state, local and foreign rules, regulations, guidelines
and policies, including, but not limited to, material FDA, state, local and
foreign rules,


                                      -33-
<PAGE>

regulations and policies relating to GMP and GLP, as applicable, except for any
such noncompliances which, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably
likely to have a Millennium Material Adverse Effect; and to the knowledge of
Millennium, no party granting any such registration, application, license,
request for exemption, permit or other authorization is considering limiting,
suspending or revoking the same except for any such limitations, suspensions or
revocations which, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely
to have a Millennium Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.17 REGISTRATION STATEMENT; PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. The
information in the Registration Statement (except for information related to COR
or supplied in writing by COR for inclusion in the Registration Statement, as to
which Millennium makes no representation and which shall not constitute part of
a Millennium SEC Report for purposes of this Agreement) shall not at the time
the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated in the Registration Statement or necessary in order to make the
statements in the Registration Statement not misleading. The information (except
for information related to COR or to be supplied in writing by COR for inclusion
in the Joint Proxy Statement, as to which Millennium makes no representation) in
the Joint Proxy Statement shall not, on the date the Joint Proxy Statement is
first mailed to stockholders of Millennium or COR, at the time of the Millennium
Meeting or the COR Meeting or at the Effective Time, contain any statement
which, at such time and in light of the circumstances under which it shall be
made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state
any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made in the Joint
Proxy Statement not false or misleading; or omit to state any material fact
necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to
the solicitation of proxies for the Millennium Meeting or the COR Meeting which
has become false or misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
event relating to Millennium or any of its Affiliates, officers or directors
should be discovered by Millennium which should be set forth in an amendment to
the Registration Statement or a supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement,
Millennium shall promptly inform COR.

         Section 4.18 OPERATIONS OF SUB. Sub was formed on November 30, 2001
solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, has engaged in no other business activities and has conducted its
operations only as contemplated by this Agreement.

         Section 4.19 OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR. The financial advisor of
Millennium, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated ("Morgan Stanley"), has delivered
to Millennium an opinion dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that,
as of such date, the Exchange Ratio is fair from a financial point of view to
Millennium. A signed copy of such opinion will be delivered to COR as promptly
as practicable following the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

         Section 4.20 BROKER'S FEES. Neither Millennium nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers or directors has employed any
broker, finder, investment banker or financial advisor or incurred any liability
for any broker's fees, commissions or finder's fees in connection with any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that Millennium has
engaged, and will pay a fee to, Morgan Stanley in accordance with the terms of a
letter agreement between Millennium and Morgan Stanley dated November 20, 2001,
a true, complete and correct copy of which has been delivered to COR.

Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement

writing) to carry on its business in the usual, regular and ordinary course in
substantially the same manner as previously conducted, to pay its debts and

preserve its relationships with customers, strategic partners, suppliers,
distributors, and others having material business dealings with it. Except as

                (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier
of the Effective Time or termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms,
COR shall not, nor shall it cause, authorize or permit (provided that with
respect to its non-officer employees, the foregoing word "permit" shall be
deemed to mean "knowingly permit") any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or any
of its or their directors, employees, officers, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants or other advisors or representatives (collectively,
"Representatives") to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, or
encourage any inquiries or proposals that constitute, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation, business

exchange, sale of shares of capital stock or similar transaction involving COR
or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions with Millennium
contemplated by this Agreement and issuances of capital stock expressly
permitted by Section 5.01(d) above (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals
being referred to in this Agreement as an "Acquisition Proposal"; provided,
however, that an inquiry or proposal shall


                                      -39-
<PAGE>

not be deemed to be an Acquisition Proposal if (W) it is unsolicited by COR or
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or any of its or their Representatives,
(X) it involves less than 1% of the outstanding shares of COR Common Stock, (Y)
it is received by a non-officer employee of COR or an individual separately
retained as a sales representative of COR acting in his capacity as such, and
(Z) COR upon becoming aware of such inquiry or proposal, or such person
receiving such inquiry or proposal immediately upon becoming aware that such
inquiry or proposal is otherwise subject to this Section 6.01, notifies the
maker of such inquiry or proposal that such inquiry or proposal, and any further
communications related thereto, are prohibited by the terms of this Section 6.01
and thereupon ceases any further communications in violation of this Section
6.01), (ii) engage in negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide any
non-public information to any person or entity relating to, any Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) subject to applicable law and the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in the proviso clause of the second sentence of Section 6.05(a),
withdraw or modify or propose to withdraw or modify the approval of the Merger
by the COR Board of Directors or the recommendation by the COR Board of
Directors of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger, (iv)
(A) amend or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any COR Common Stock, (B) amend or grant any waiver or
release or approve any transaction or redeem rights under the COR Rights Plan

COR and its Subsidiaries have not breached this Section 6.01 in a manner that
resulted in its receipt of the unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal referred to in the immediately following clause (A), or otherwise
breached this Section 6.01 in any material respect, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prevent COR or its Board of Directors, from:

                         (A) furnishing non-public information to, or entering
into discussions or negotiations with, any person or entity in connection with
an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that would result in the
acquisition of all of the combined voting power of the shares of COR then
outstanding or all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of COR and
its Subsidiaries by such person or entity, if and only to the extent that:

                             (1) the Board of Directors of COR believes in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor) that such Acquisition
Proposal is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed and
would, if consummated on such terms, result in a transaction more favorable than
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (or any counterproposal by
Millennium), after taking into account all relevant factors, including the risk
of non-consummation of such other Acquisition Proposal or counterproposal (any
such more favorable Acquisition Proposal being referred to in this Agreement as
a "Superior Proposal") and COR's Board of Directors determines in good faith
after consultation with outside legal counsel that such action is necessary for
such Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties to stockholders
under applicable law;


                                      -40-
<PAGE>

                             (2) prior to furnishing such non-public information
to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person or entity,
such Board of Directors receives from such person or entity an executed
confidentiality agreement with customary terms and provisions (which such
agreement shall not interfere with the ability of Millennium to make, and of COR
to accept, a counterproposal); and

                             (3) prior to furnishing such information or
discussing or negotiating a Superior Proposal with the person making such
Superior Proposal, COR provides Millennium with at least three business days'
prior notice thereof; or

                         (B) complying with Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal.

                (b) COR will, and will cause its Representatives to, immediately
cease any and all discussions, negotiations or activities prohibited under
Section 6.01(a) existing as of the date of this Agreement as to any Acquisition
Proposal with any parties conducted heretofore and will use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the return of any confidential information
furnished to any such parties.

                (c) COR shall notify Millennium promptly (and in no event more
than 24 hours) after receipt by COR (directly or through its advisors) of any
Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information in connection with
an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of COR
by any person or entity that informs COR that it is considering making, or has
made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and in writing
and shall indicate in detail the identity of the offeror and the material terms
and conditions of such proposal, inquiry or contact. COR shall continue to keep
Millennium informed, on a prompt and current basis, of the status of any such
discussions or negotiations and the terms being discussed or negotiated. Nothing
in this Section 6.01(c) shall be deemed to modify COR's obligations under
Section 6.01(a) above.

                (d) Nothing in this Section 6.01 shall (i) permit COR to
terminate this Agreement (except as specifically provided in Section 8.01
hereof), (ii) permit COR to enter into any agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal during the term of this Agreement (it being agreed by COR
that during the term of this Agreement, COR shall not enter into any agreement
with any person that provides for, or in any way facilitates, an Acquisition
Proposal (other than (i) a confidentiality agreement of the type referred to in
Section 6.01(a) above or (ii) as expressly set forth in Section 6.01(e))) or
(iii) affect any other obligation of COR under this Agreement.

                (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
6.01, if the conditions of subparagraphs (A)(1), (2) and (3) of Section 6.01(a)
have been satisfied and COR then has the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01(g), then COR may, in connection with the termination by
it of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g), take any of the actions
described in clauses (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of Section 6.01(a)
contemporaneously with the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(g) and the payment to Millennium of the fee described in Section 8.03(c).

other government officials for amendments or supplements to the Registration
Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement or any filing pursuant to Section 6.02(b)

respects with all applicable requirements of law and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set

deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.

and the approval of the Merger.

                (b) Millennium, acting through its Board of Directors, shall,

deemed to be "affiliates" of COR within the meaning of Rule 145 (each such
person is referred to as an "Affiliate") promulgated under the Securities Act
("Rule 145"). COR shall provide Millennium such information and documents as
Millennium shall reasonably request for purposes of reviewing such list and
shall notify Millennium in writing regarding any change in the identity of its
Affiliates prior to the Closing Date. COR has delivered or caused to be
delivered to Millennium, prior to the execution of this Agreement, from each of
its Affiliates, an executed Affiliate Agreement, in substantially the form
appended hereto as EXHIBIT D (collectively, the "Affiliate Agreements").
Millennium shall be entitled to place appropriate legends on the certificates
evidencing any Millennium Common Stock to be received by such Affiliates of COR
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and to issue appropriate stop transfer
instructions to the transfer agent for the


                                      -45-
<PAGE>

Millennium Common Stock, consistent with the terms of the Affiliate Agreements;
provided that such legend shall be removed by delivery of a substitute
certificate without such legend under the circumstances described in the
Affiliate Agreements.

         Section 6.10 NASDAQ LISTING. Millennium shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the shares of Millennium Common Stock to be issued
in the Merger, upon the exercise of COR Stock Options assumed in connection with
the Merger and upon the conversion of the COR Convertible Notes to be listed on
the Nasdaq National Market, subject to official notice of issuance, on or prior
to the Closing Date.

         Section 6.11 STOCK PLANS.

                (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of any holder of a COR Stock Option, the COR Stock Plans
and COR Stock Options shall be assumed by Millennium. At the Effective Time,
each COR Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, shall be deemed to constitute
an option or warrant to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such COR Stock Option, the same number of shares of Millennium
Common Stock as the holder of such COR Stock Option would have been entitled to
receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised such COR Stock Option
in full immediately prior to the Effective Time (rounded downward to the nearest
whole number), at a price per share (rounded upward to the nearest whole cent)
equal to (y) the aggregate exercise price for the shares of COR Common Stock
purchasable pursuant to such COR Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time divided by (z) the number of full shares of Millennium Common Stock deemed
purchasable pursuant to such COR Stock Option in accordance with the foregoing.
At the request of Millennium, the Board of Directors of COR shall cooperate with
Millennium to take all necessary actions, pursuant to the COR Stock Plans and
the instruments evidencing the COR Stock Options, to provide for the conversion
of the COR Stock Options in accordance with this Section, and to provide that no
consent of the holders of the COR Stock Options is required in connection with
such conversion. Millennium shall use reasonable efforts to cause any assumed
COR Stock Options that qualify as "incentive stock options" as defined in
Section 422 of the Code immediately prior to the Effective Time to continue to
so qualify immediately after the Effective Time; provided, however, that
Millennium shall have no liability to a holder of any such options, or any other
party, if an assumed COR Stock Option (or any part thereof) does not qualify as
an incentive stock option for any reason.

                (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Millennium
shall deliver to the participants in COR Stock Plans appropriate notice setting
forth such participants' rights pursuant thereto.

                (c) At or prior to the Effective Time, Millennium shall take all
corporate action necessary to authorize and reserve for issuance at all times a
sufficient number of shares of Millennium Common Stock for delivery under the
COR Stock Plans and COR Convertible Notes. As soon as practicable (or in any
event within five business days) after the Effective Time, Millennium shall file
a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
forms), or another appropriate form with respect to the shares of Millennium
Common Stock subject to the COR Stock Options and shall use its best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current


                                      -46-
<PAGE>

status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such
options remain outstanding.

                (d) COR shall terminate the 1991 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the "ESPP") in accordance with its terms immediately prior to the Effective
Time and the participants in the ESPP shall be permitted to exercise any then
outstanding options thereunder at such time.

         Section 6.12 INDEMNIFICATION.

                (a) From and after the Effective Time, Millennium shall, for a
period of six years after the Effective Time, cause the Surviving Corporation to
honor all of COR's obligations to indemnify and hold harmless (including any
such obligations to advance expenses as incurred) each present and former
director and officer of COR (the "Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or
expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the extent that the
Indemnified Parties would have been entitled to be so indemnified and held
harmless pursuant to the terms of contracts or other documents in existence on
the date of this Agreement.

                (b) From and after the Effective Time, Millennium shall, for a
period of six years after the Effective Time, cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain (to the extent available in the market) in effect a directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy covering those persons who are currently
covered by COR's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (a true and
complete copy of which has been heretofore delivered to Millennium) with
coverage in amount and scope in all material respects at least as favorable to
such persons as COR's existing coverage; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event
shall Millennium or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in excess of
200% the annual premium currently paid by COR for such coverage.

                (c) Millennium shall pay all expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the persons referred to in this Section
6.12 in connection with their successful enforcement of their rights provided in
this Section 6.12.

         Section 6.13 NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. Millennium will give
prompt notice to COR, and COR will give prompt notice to Millennium, upon
becoming aware of the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which
occurrence or failure to occur would be reasonably likely to cause (a) any
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, or (b) any material failure of Millennium or
Sub or COR, as the case may be, or of any officer, director, employee or agent
thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section will not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice or the conditions to such party's obligation to consummate the Merger.


                                      -47-
<PAGE>

         Section 6.14 STOCKHOLDER LITIGATION. Until the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or the Effective
Time, COR shall give Millennium the opportunity to participate in the defense or
settlement of any stockholder litigation against COR or its Board of Directors
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and shall not settle any such litigation without Millennium's prior
written consent.

         Section 6.15 EMPLOYEE MATTERS. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, Millennium shall enroll persons who are, immediately before the
Effective Time, employees of COR or its Subsidiaries ("COR Employees") in
Millennium's employee benefit plans, to the extent applicable, including its
medical plan, dental plan, life insurance plan and disability plan, under the
same coverage applicable to similarly situated employees of Millennium, giving
such COR Employees service credit for their employment with COR for eligibility
and vesting purposes for all of Millennium's employee benefit plans (including
health coverage and vacation plans), as if such service had been performed with
Millennium and waiving any preexisting condition exclusion with respect to
Millennium's medical plan, to the extent that such preexisting condition would
have been covered under COR's plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it is not
reasonably practicable for COR Employees to be enrolled in any one or more of
Millennium's employee benefit plans, due to geographic location or otherwise,
Millennium shall continue to enroll such COR Employees in the corresponding COR
Plan in which such COR Employees are enrolled as of the Effective Time or in a
reasonably comparable plan. Millennium shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to credit each COR Employee with deductible payments and co-payments paid by
such COR Employee under COR's healthcare plans in 2002 prior to the Effective
Time for purposes of determining the extent to which any such COR Employee has
satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or she has reached the
out-of-pocket maximum under Millennium's medical plan for such plan year.
Millennium shall give credit to each COR Employee that becomes an employee of
Millennium for earned but unused vacation and accrued vacation. Nothing in this
Section 6.15 shall prevent Millennium from modifying or terminating any
Millennium employee benefit plan (including a COR benefit plan which is
continued after the Effective Time) at any time and from time to time in its
sole determination.

         Section 6.16 401(k) PLAN. Except as otherwise requested by Millennium,
at least one business day prior to the Effective Time, COR shall take all action
required to terminate any 401(k) Plan maintained by COR or any ERISA Affiliate
(individually or together, the "COR 401(k) Plan") in accordance with its terms
and applicable law, including ERISA and the Code. Without limiting the
generality of Section 6.15, all COR Employees who are participants in the COR
401(k) Plan as of the date the COR 401(k) Plan is terminated shall become
eligible to participate in the Millennium 401(k) plan (the "Millennium 401(k)
Plan") as soon as administratively feasible following the Effective Time.

         Section 6.17 EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY UNDER SECTION 16(b).

                (a) The board of directors of Millennium, or a committee thereof
consisting solely of non-employee directors (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution in
advance of the Effective Time providing that the receipt by the COR Insiders (as
defined below) of Millennium Common Stock in exchange for


                                      -48-
<PAGE>

shares of COR Common Stock, and of options to purchase Millennium Common Stock
upon assumption and conversion of COR Stock Options, in each case pursuant to
the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are
listed in the Section 16 Information (as defined below), is intended to be
exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

                (b) For purposes of Section 6.17(a), "Section 16 Information"
shall mean information regarding the COR Insiders and the number of shares of
COR Common Stock or other COR equity securities deemed to be beneficially owned
by each such COR Insider and expected to be exchanged for Millennium Common
Stock, and options to purchase Millennium Common Stock, in each case, in
connection with the Merger, which shall be provided by COR to Millennium at
least 20 business days prior to the Closing.

                (c) For purposes of Section 6.17(a), "COR Insiders" shall mean
those officers and directors of COR who immediately after the Closing become
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to equity securities of Millennium as a result of their positions with
Millennium immediately after the Closing.

         Section 6.18 BOARD REPRESENTATION. Subject to applicable law,
Millennium shall take all action as may be required such that upon the Effective
Time, Vaughn M. Kailian, Ginger L. Graham, Ernest Mario and Shaun R. Coughlin
shall be elected by the Board of Directors of Millennium as Class I director,
Class I director, Class II director and Class III director, respectively, to the
extent such persons are willing and able to so serve.

         Section 6.19 INDENTURES. COR and Millennium shall take all actions as
shall be required by the indentures for the COR Convertible Notes in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the execution
and delivery of supplemental indentures and related officers' certificates and
related opinions of counsel simultaneously with the Closing. Immediately
following the Effective Time, Millennium will enter into a supplemental
indenture with the trustees of the COR Convertible Notes pursuant to which
Millennium will provide a full and unconditional guarantee of COR's obligations
under the COR Convertible Notes.

made at and as of the Effective Time, except (i) in the case of clause (Y), for
changes expressly contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) in the case of both
clauses (X) and (Y) where the failures to be true and correct, individually or

or approval of any third party (other than a Governmental Entity) required in

                (h) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.03 are not meant to constitute a measure of, or in any way limit,
curtail or impede the receipt of damages or other remedies with respect to a
breach of this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 8.03 are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. If one party fails
to promptly pay to the other any expense reimbursement or fee due hereunder, the
defaulting party shall pay the costs and expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit or
other legal action, taken to collect payment, together with interest on the
amount of any unpaid fee at the publicly announced prime rate of Fleet Bank,
N.A. plus two percent per annum, compounded monthly, from the date such expense
reimbursement or fee was required to be paid.

                (i) As used in this Agreement, "Alternative Transaction" means
with respect to Millennium or COR (as the case may be):

                  (i) a transaction or series of related transactions (including
         open market or private purchases) pursuant to which any person (or
         group of persons) other than Millennium or its affiliates (in the case
         of COR) and other than COR or its affiliates (in the case of
         Millennium) (a "Third Party"), acquires more than 40% of the
         outstanding voting securities of COR or Millennium (as the case may be)
         pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer or otherwise,

                  (ii) a merger or other business combination with a Third Party
         in which the stockholders of Millennium or COR (as the case may be)
         immediately prior to such transaction hold less than 60% of the equity
         interests in the surviving entity, or if the surviving entity is a
         Subsidiary, less than 60% of the equity interests of the Parent of the
         surviving entity, immediately after such merger or other business
         combination; or

                  (iii) any other transaction pursuant to which any Third Party
         acquires control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding
         equity securities of Subsidiaries of COR or Millennium (as the case may
         be)) having a fair market value equal to more than 40% of the fair
         market value of all the consolidated assets of COR or Millennium (as
         the case may be) and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to such
         transaction.

         Section 8.04 AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors,
at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with
the Merger by the stockholders of COR or of Millennium, but, after any such
approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by
such stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

         Section 8.05 EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective
Boards of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, with respect to any
party that is not an Affiliate, (i) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered


                                      -57-
<PAGE>

pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         Section 9.03 INTERPRETATION. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to Articles or Sections, such reference shall be to an Article or a Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of
defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. The phrases "the date of this Agreement", "the date hereof," and
terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires, shall be deemed
to refer to December 5, 2001. The words "include," "includes" and "including"
when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no
rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party.

         Section 9.04 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement
and shall become effective when two or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that
all parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed
and delivered by facsimile transmission.

         Section 9.05 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This
Agreement (including the documents and the instruments executed or to be
executed by the parties hereto and referred to herein) and the Confidentiality
Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreements and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and (b) except for the provisions of
Sections 6.08, 6.11 (other than the last sentence of Section 6.11(a)), 6.12,
6.15, 6.16, 6.17 and 6.18, which are intended for the benefit of the parties
covered thereby, are not intended to confer upon any person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder; provided that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until the
Effective Time.

         Section 9.06 GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. This Agreement
shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware without regard to any applicable conflicts of law principles. Any suit,
action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought exclusively in any federal or state court
located in the State of Delaware, and each of the parties hereby consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom)
in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or
that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient form. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding
may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as


                                      -59-
<PAGE>

provided in Section 9.02 as to giving notice hereunder shall be deemed effective
service of process on such party.

         Section 9.07 OTHER REMEDIES; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. Except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any
one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties
hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity.

         Section 9.08 ASSIGNMENT. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in
whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

         Section 9.09 SEVERABILITY. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree
to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

         Section 9.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF Millennium, CRIMSON AND SUB
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF Millennium, CRIMSON OR SUB IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
