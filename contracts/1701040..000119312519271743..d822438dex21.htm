AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of October 22, 2019, by and among MJ23 UK ACQUISITION LIMITED, a private
company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales ("Parent"), CASTLE
MERGER LIMITED, a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability and a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and CISION LTD., a Cayman
Islands exempted company (the "Company"). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company are sometimes referred to herein as a "Party." All capitalized
terms that are used in this Agreement have the respective meanings given to
them in _Article I_ or elsewhere in this Agreement.

RECITALS 

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the Companies Law (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands (the
"CICL"), Parent and the Company desire to enter into a business combination
transaction pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company
(the "Merger"), with the Company surviving the Merger and becoming a wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent as a result of the Merger.

WHEREAS, the Company Board has unanimously (i) determined that it is in the
best interests of the Company and declared it advisable to enter into this
Agreement providing for the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein; (ii) approved the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and
other obligations hereunder, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and (iii) resolved to
recommend that the Company Shareholders authorize this Agreement.

WHEREAS, each of the board of directors of Parent and the board of directors
of Merger Sub have (i) declared it advisable to enter into this Agreement; and
(ii) approved the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the performance of
their respective covenants and other obligations hereunder, and the
consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein.

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and material inducement to the Companys willingness to enter
into this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have delivered a guarantee
(the "Guarantee") from Platinum Equity Capital Partners V, L.P., a Delaware
limited partnership ("Guarantor"), in favor of the Company and pursuant to
which, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, Guarantor is
guaranteeing certain payment obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this
Agreement.

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and material inducement to Parents willingness to enter into
this Agreement, certain shareholders of the Company have entered into a voting
support agreement in favor of Parent, whereby such shareholders have agreed
to vote in favor of, and support the consummation of, the transactions
contemplated hereby ("Voting Agreement"), on the terms and conditions set
forth therein.

   

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to (i) make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger; and (ii) prescribe certain conditions with respect
to the consummation of the Merger.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein,
as well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
of which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, and intending to be legally
bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

DEFINITIONS and INTERPRETATIONS

Agreement, the following capitalized terms have the following respective
meanings:

Company that is either (i) in effect as of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, or (ii) executed, delivered and effective after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, in either case containing provisions that require
any counterparty thereto (and any of its Affiliates and Representatives named
therein) that receive material non-public information of, or with respect to,
the Company to keep such information confidential; provided, however, that,
in the case of clause (ii), the provisions contained therein are no less
restrictive in any material respect to such counterparty (and any of its
Affiliates and Representatives as provided therein) than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such agreement need not
contain any "standstill" or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the
making of any Acquisition Proposal).

 

(b) "Acquisition Proposal" means any offer or proposal (other than an offer
or proposal by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries) to
engage in an Acquisition Transaction.

 

(c) "Acquisition Transaction" means any transaction or series of related
transactions (other than the Merger) involving:

(i) any direct or indirect purchase, sale or other acquisition by any
Person or Group, whether from the Company or any other Person(s), of Company
Shares representing more than 20% of the Company Shares outstanding after
giving effect to the consummation of such purchase or other acquisition,
including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by any Person or Group
that, if consummated in accordance with its terms, would result in such Person
or Group beneficially owning more than 20% of the Company Shares outstanding
after giving effect to the consummation of such tender or exchange offer;

(ii) any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition by any Person or
Group, or equityholder of any such Person or Group, of assets constituting or
accounting for more than 20% of the consolidated assets, net income or
consolidated revenue of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole
(measured by the fair market value thereof as of the date of such purchase or
acquisition); or

 



6

    

(iii) any merger, consolidation, business combination, joint venture,
repurchase, redemption, share exchange, extraordinary dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or
other transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
which any Person or Group, or equityholder of any such Person or Group, would
hold Company Shares representing more than 20% of the Company Shares
outstanding after giving effect to the consummation of such transaction, in
each case other than the Merger.

 

(d) "Affiliate" means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that,
directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by or is under common control
with such Person. For purposes of this definition, the term "control"
(including, with correlative meanings, the terms "controlling," "controlled
by" and "under common control with"), as used with respect to any Person,
means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause
the direction of the management or policies of that Person, whether through
the ownership of voting securities or partnership or other ownership
interests, by Contract or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, Canyon
Holdings (Cayman), L.P. ("Canyon Holdings") shall not be considered an

impediments or lessening of competition or the creation or strengthening of a
dominant position through merger or acquisition, in any case that are
applicable to the Merger.

 

(h) "Audited Company Balance Sheet" means the consolidated balance sheet
(and the notes thereto) of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as

Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X under the Securities Act for a registered
public offering of non-convertible debt securities on Form S-1 (excluding the
Excluded Information and other than such provisions for which compliance is
not customary in a Rule 144A offering of debt securities);

 



7

    

(iii) the auditors of any financial information contained therein have not
withdrawn their audit opinion with respect to such information; and

or (y) prevents or materially impairs or delays or would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially impair or delay the ability of the Company
to perform its material obligations under this Agreement or the consummation
of the Merger; provided, however, that none of the following, and no Effects
to the extent arising out of or resulting from the following (in each case,

extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions); or (b) such other time,
location and date as Parent, Merger Sub and the Company mutually agree in
writing; _provided that_ , unless otherwise waived by Parent, the Closing
shall occur no earlier than the later of (x) January 31, 2020 and (y) 15

association.

 



26

    

2.6 _Directors and Officers_.

2.7 _Effect of Merger on Shares_.

 

(a) _Share Capital_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the securities described in this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, the
following will occur:

 

(i) each ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub that is
issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will
automatically be surrendered and exchanged into one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable ordinary share of the Surviving Company;

 

(ii) each Company Share that is issued and outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares or Dissenting
Shares) will be automatically surrendered and exchanged into the right to
receive cash in an amount equal to $10.00, without interest thereon (the "Per
Share Price"), in accordance with the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 2.9_
(or, where relevant, in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate,
upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in accordance with the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.11_); and

(iii) each Company Share that is (A) held by the Company as a treasury
share; (B) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (C) owned by any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Owned Company Shares") will
automatically be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or
consideration paid therefor.

(b) _Adjustment to the Per Share Price_. The Per Share Price will be
adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any share split, reverse share
split, share dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of
securities convertible into Company Shares),

shares or other similar change with respect to the Company Shares occurring on
or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

 



27

    

(c) Dissenting Shares.

 

(i) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to
the extent available under the CICL, Company Shares that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
shareholders who shall have validly exercised and perfected and not
effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to dissent from the Merger
in accordance with Section 238 of the CICL (collectively, the "Dissenting
Shares"; holders of Dissenting Shares being referred to as "Dissenting
Shareholders") shall at the Effective Time be cancelled and cease to exist,
and each such Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to receive only the
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance
with the provisions of Section 238 of the CICL, except that all Company Shares
held by a Dissenting Shareholder which shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost its dissenter rights in respect of
such Company Shares under Section 238 of the CICL shall thereupon (i) not be
deemed to be Dissenting Shares and (ii) be deemed to have been cancelled and
cease to exist, as of the Effective Time, in consideration for the right of
the holder thereof to receive the Per Share Price, without any interest
thereon, in the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.9_.

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any actual or, if
in writing, threatened demands received by the Company for appraisal of

any payment with respect to any written demands for appraisal or settle or
offer to settle any such demands.

served by any Company Shareholder pursuant to Section 238(2) and in
accordance with Section 238(3) of the CICL, the Company shall serve written
notice of the authorization of the Merger on such Company Shareholders
pursuant to Section 238(4) of the CICL within twenty (20) days of the
approval of the Merger by Company Shareholders of the Company at the Company
Shareholder Meeting.

 

2.8 _Equity Awards_ _; Restricted Shares_.

 

(a) _Vested Company Options_. At the Effective Time each Vested Company
Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will, without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof,
be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the amount of the Per Share Price
(less the exercise price per share attributable to such Vested Company
Option); multiplied by (ii) the total number of Company Shares issuable upon
exercise in full of such Vested Company Option, subject to any
required withholding of Taxes (the "Vested Option Consideration").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to
Company Options for which the exercise price per share attributable to such
Company Options is equal to or greater than the Per Share Price, such Company
Options will be cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect
thereof.

 



28

    

(b) _Unvested Company Options._ Each Unvested Company Option which is not
a Performance Vesting Option shall be cancelled and replaced with a right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the
aggregate number of Company Shares subject to such Unvested Company
Option multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the
applicable per share exercise price under such Unvested Company Option,
subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the "Unvested Option
Consideration"), which Unvested Option Consideration will, subject to the
holders continued service with Parent and its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates,
vest and be payable at the same time as the Unvested Company Option for which
such Unvested Option Consideration amounts were exchanged would have vested
pursuant to its terms. The Unvested Option Consideration will have the same
vesting schedule as applied to the award of Unvested Company Option for which
it was exchanged, except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any provision providing for
vesting solely as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in combination with any
termination of employment) or for such other administrative or ministerial
changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of Parent are
appropriate to conform the administration of the Unvested Option
Consideration.

(c) _Performance Vesting Options._ At the Effective Time, the level
at which the vesting conditions of the Performance Vesting Options have been
satisfied with respect to each Performance Vesting Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors or any appropriate committee thereof based on the
Companys achievement of the applicable performance goals as of the Closing
Date (which achievement shall in no event be determined to be greater than the
target level of performance), and each Performance Vesting Option that so
vests shall become a Vested Company Option, entitled to the Vested Option
Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)_ hereof. For the avoidance of
doubt, any Performance Vesting Option that does not become a Vested Company
Option pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.8(c)_ shall be canceled and
terminated as of the Effective Time, and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto.

 

(d) _Vested Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time each Vested Company RSU
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will, without any action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to (i) the amount of the Per Share Price;
multiplied by (ii) the total number of Company Shares subject to such Company
RSU, subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the "Vested RSU
Consideration").

 

(e) _Unvested Company RSUs._ Each Unvested Company RSU shall be cancelled
and replaced with a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product of (i) the amount of the Per Share Price multiplied by
(ii) the total number of Company Shares subject to such Unvested Company RSU,
subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the "Unvested RSU
Consideration"), which Unvested RSU Consideration amounts will, subject to the
holders continued service with Parent and its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates,
vest and be payable at the same time as the Unvested Company RSU for which
such Unvested RSU Consideration amounts were exchanged would have vested
pursuant to its terms. All Unvested RSU Consideration will have the
same vesting schedule as applied to the award of Unvested Company RSUs for
which they were exchanged, except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any provision providing for
vesting solely as a result of the consummation of

 



29

    

 the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in combination with
any termination of employment) or for such other administrative or ministerial
changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of Parent are
appropriate to conform the administration of the Unvested RSU Consideration.

 

(f) _Specified Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, each Specified
Restricted Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will,
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to (x) the amount of the Per Share Price;
multiplied by (y) the total number of Company Shares subject to such Specified
Restricted Shares (the "Restricted Share Consideration"); provided that such
Restricted Share Consideration will continue to be subject to the same
vesting terms and/or restrictions (including with respect to forfeiture
thereof) as the Specified Restricted Share for which such Restricted Share
Consideration was exchanged and will be subject to any required withholding
of Taxes. The Restricted Share Consideration will be payable at the same time
as the restrictions or vesting terms with respect to the Specified Restricted
Share for which such Restricted Share Consideration was exchanged would have
lapsed or been satisfied, as applicable, as further specified on _Section_ __
_ 1.1(c)(iii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letters.

 

(g) _ESPP._ Effective as of no later than immediately preceding the
Effective Time, the Company shall terminate the ESPP and shall provide such
notice of termination as may be required by the terms of the ESPP. Prior to
the Effective Time and the Termination Date of the ESPP, (i) the Company shall
determine the date on which the then-current "option period" (as defined in
the ESPP), if any, shall terminate; and (ii) accumulated payroll deductions on
such date shall be used to purchase the applicable number of Company Shares in
accordance with the terms of the ESPP. Promptly following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall amend the ESPP and the current option period
under the ESPP such that (A) no further option periods shall commence
following the termination of the current option period and (B) no employee
may commence participation in the ESPP or increase their level of
participation in the current option period following the date of this
Agreement.

 

(h) _Payment Procedures_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit
(or cause to be deposited or maintained) with the Company, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds (if applicable), the aggregate (i) Vested
Option Consideration owed to all holders of Vested Company Options and (ii)
Vested RSU Consideration owed to all holders of Vested Company RSUs. As soon
as practicable after the Closing Date but in any event no later than three (3)
Business Days following the Closing Date, the applicable holders of vested
Company Equity Awards will receive a payment from the Company or
the Surviving Company, through its payroll system or payroll provider, of all
amounts required to be paid to such holders in respect of vested Company
Equity Awards that are cancelled and converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.8(a)_,  _Section_ __ _ 2.8(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 2.8(d)_, or _Section_ __ _
2.8(f)_ as applicable; provided, that if any payment owed to a holder of
vested Company Equity Awards pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)_, _Section_
__ _ 2.8(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 2.8(d)_, or _Section_ __ _ 2.8(f)_ as
applicable, cannot be made through the Companys or the Surviving Companys
payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Company will (A) by
wire transfer or direct deposit, or (B) by a check sent by overnight courier
to such holder promptly following the Closing Date (but in no event more than
five (5) Business Days thereafter) provide such payment owed to such holder,
net of any required withholding of Taxes. Notwithstanding

 



30

    

 the foregoing, to the extent any such amounts relate to a Company RSU,
Performance Vesting Option, Company Option, Specified Restricted Shares or any
cash based awards after giving effect to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby that is nonqualified deferred compensation subject to
Section 409A of the Code, the Surviving Company shall pay such amounts at the
earliest time permitted under the terms of the applicable agreement, plan or
arrangement relating to such Company RSU, Performance Vesting Option, Company
Option, Specified Restricted Shares or any cash based awards after giving
effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, that
will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

(i) _Further Actions_. The Company will take all action necessary to
effect the cancellation and exchange (as applicable) of the Company Equity
Awards and all Company Equity Plans, in each case effective upon the Effective
Time and to give effect to the transactions set forth in this  _Section_ __ _
2.8_ (including the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e)
promulgated under the Exchange Act). In addition, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that, as of the Effective Time, the Company Share
Plans shall terminate and no holder of a Company Equity Award or any
participant in any Company Share Plan or any other employee incentive or
benefit plan, program or arrangement or any non-employee director plan
maintained by the Company shall have any rights to acquire, or other rights in
respect of, the capital stock of the Company, the Surviving Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company, except the right to receive the payment
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ in settlement thereof.

 

2.9 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall (i) select a
nationally recognized bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the "Payment Agent"); and
(ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent.

(b) _Payment Fund_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of Company Shares
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate
consideration to which such holders of Company Shares (other than Dissenting
Shares) become entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Until disbursed in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash shall be
invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving
Company, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any
agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of
the United States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available) (such
cash and any proceeds thereon, the "Payment Fund"). To the extent that (A)
there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Payment Fund; (B)
the Payment Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the
Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by _Section_ __ _
2.7_; or (C) all or any portion of the Payment Fund is unavailable for Parent
(or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ for any reason, Parent shall, or shall
cause the

 



31

    

 Surviving Company to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the
Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times fully
available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the
Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Any
income from investment of the Payment Fund will be payable to Parent or the
Surviving Company, as Parent directs. The Payment Fund shall not be used for
any purpose other than the payment to holders of Company Shares as
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.7_.

 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in
any event within three (3) Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Company
shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares) of
one or more certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented issued and outstanding Company Shares (other than Owned Company
Shares) (the "Certificates" (if any)) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary
form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to
the Payment Agent (or affidavit and indemnity of loss in lieu of such
certificate as provided for in _Section_ __ _ 2.11_)), and (ii) instructions
for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or such affidavit of loss) in
exchange for the Per Share Price payable with respect to the Company Shares
formerly represented thereby pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Upon
surrender of Certificates (or such affidavit of loss) for cancellation to the
Payment Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of
such Certificates will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount
in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number
of Company Shares represented by such Certificates by (y) the Per Share
Price, and the Certificates so surrendered (or the subject of an affidavit of
loss so provided) will forthwith be cancelled. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, no record holder of uncertificated Company Shares
(other than Owned Company Shares) (the "Uncertificated Shares") will be
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Payment Agent in order to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ with respect of such Uncertificated
Shares. In lieu thereof, such record holder, upon receipt of an "agents
message" by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Payment Agent may reasonably request), will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (1) the aggregate number of Company Shares represented by such
holders transferred Uncertificated Shares by (2) the Per Share Price, and the
transferred Uncertificated Shares will be cancelled. No interest will be paid
or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares on the Per Share Price payable upon the surrender of such Certificates
and transfer of Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.9(c)_. Until so surrendered or transferred, outstanding Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to
evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price payable in respect
thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_.

 

(d) _DTC Payment_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company
shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and the
Depository Trust Company ("DTC") with the objective that the Payment Agent
shall transmit to DTC or its nominee on the Closing Date an amount in cash, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to (i) the number of
Company Shares (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Shares) held of
record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Price.

 



32

    

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If payment of the Per Share Price is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or transferred Uncertificated Share in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (i) the Person requesting
such exchange present proper evidence of transfer or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share surrendered and shall have established to
the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Surviving Company that such Tax
either has been paid or is not applicable.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Company or
any other Party will be liable to a holder of Company Shares for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(g) _Distribution of Payment Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Payment
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one (1) year after the Effective
Time will be delivered to Parent (or the Surviving Company as directed by
Parent) upon demand, and any holders of Company Shares that were issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore
surrendered or transferred their Certificates representing such Company Shares
or Uncertificated Shares for exchange pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.9_
shall thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of
the Company Shares represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), as
general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such
holders may be entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares five (5) years after the Effective Time, or at such earlier date as is
immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat
to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority, will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company free
and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders (and their successors,
assigns or personal representatives) previously entitled thereto.

 

2.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. From and after the
Effective Time, (a) all Company Shares will no longer be outstanding and will
automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist; and (b) each holder of a
Certificate theretofore representing any Company Shares or Uncertificated
Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Per Share Price payable therefor in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 2.7_, or in the case of Dissenting Shares, the rights pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(c)_. The Per Share Price paid in accordance with the
terms of this _Article II_ will be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares. From and after
the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Company of Company Shares that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to
reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades
effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Company
for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with the exchange procedures
of  _Section_ __ _ 2.9(c)_) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article II_.

 



33

    

2.11 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent shall
issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its reasonable
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share
Price, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to
deliver a bond in such reasonable amount as it may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Company or
the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

 

2.12 _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company and the Surviving Company will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, including from
any payment to any holder or former holder of Company Shares or Company Equity
Awards, such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom
pursuant to the Code or any other Tax Laws. To the extent that any amounts are
deducted or withheld pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.12_ and paid over to
the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
whom such deduction or withholding was made.

 

2.13 _Agreement of Fair Value_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
respectively agree that the Per Share Price represents not less than the fair
value of the Company Shares for the purposes of Section 238(8) of the CICL.

company power or authority has not had, and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or
the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (with respect
to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing), except where
the failure to be so qualified or in good standing has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true,
correct and complete copies of its Organizational Documents, each as amended
to the date hereof.

 



34

    

3.2 _Power; Enforceability_. The Company has the requisite company power

The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance
by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder, and the
consummation of the Merger have been duly authorized by all necessary company

advisors, Rothschild and Co US Inc. and Centerview Partners LLC, to the effect
that, as of the date of such opinions and based upon and subject to the
various qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the consideration
to be offered to the holders of Company Shares (other than Owned Company
Shares and Dissenting Shares) in the Merger is fair from a financial point of
view to such holders. Following receipt by the Company Board of such opinions
in writing, signed true and complete copies of which opinions will promptly

opinion is for the benefit of the Company Board and may not be relied upon by
Parent or Merger Sub). 

(c) _Anti-Takeover Laws_. Assuming Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates
do not own more than 5%, individually or in the aggregate, of the Company
Shares, no "moratorium," "fair price," "business combination," "control share
acquisition" or similar provision of any anti-

 takeover Law or any similar anti-takeover provision in the Companys or any
of its Subsidiaries Organizational Documents is, or at the Effective Time
will be, applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby. There is no shareholder rights plan, "poison
pill" anti-takeover plan or other similar device in effect to which the
Company is a party or is otherwise bound.

Merger by the affirmative vote of the holders of Company Shares representing
at least two-thirds of the Company Shares present and voting in person or by
proxy as a single class at the shareholders meeting (the "Requisite

Companys Organizational Documents is the only vote of the holders of Company
Shares that is necessary pursuant to applicable Law and the
Companys Organizational Documents to consummate the Merger.

 

3.6 _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and
obligations hereunder, and the consummation of the Merger do not (a) violate

liens that have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

power and authority to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted

Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character
of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in

3.10 _Company SEC Reports_.

 

(a) Since June 30, 2017 and through the date of this Agreement, the Company
has filed all forms, reports and documents with the SEC that have been

or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, on the date of
such amended or superseded filing), in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, each as in effect on the date
that such Company SEC Report was filed. As of its filing date (or, if amended
or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, on the date of
such amended or superseded filing), each Company SEC Report did not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

(c) No Subsidiary of the Company is required to file any forms, reports or
documents with the SEC.

3.11 _Company Financial Statements; Internal Controls_.

 

(a) _Company Financial Statements_. The consolidated financial statements
(including any related notes and schedules) of the Company filed with the
Company SEC Reports (i) were prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto or as otherwise permitted by Form 10-Q with
respect to any financial statements filed on Form 10-Q); (ii) were prepared
in a manner consistent with the books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; (iii) comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
requirements under the Exchange Act; and (iv) fairly present, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case
of the unaudited financial statements, to normal and recurring year-end
adjustments that were not, or are not expected to be, material in amount, and
to any other adjustment described therein). There are no unconsolidated
Subsidiaries of the Company within the meaning of GAAP.

(b) _Disclosure Controls and Procedures_. The Company has established and
maintains, and has at all times since June 30, 2017 maintained, "disclosure
controls and procedures" and "internal control over financial reporting" (in
each case as defined pursuant to Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 promulgated
under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to ensure that information relating to the Company, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in the Companys periodic
and current reports under the Exchange Act, is made known to the Companys
management by others within those entities to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures as required under the Exchange Act. The
Companys management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year

committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest in Parent,
directly or indirectly, the cash amounts set forth therein for the purpose of
funding a

 



58

    

 portion of the aggregate value of the Merger (the "Equity Financing"); and
(ii) an executed debt commitment letter, dated as of the date of this
Agreement (together with any related fee letters (with solely pricing, other
economic and market flex terms redacted, so long as no redaction covers terms
that would adversely affect the amount, conditionality, availability or
termination of the Debt Financing), in each case, as amended, restated,
supplemented or replaced to the extent expressly permitted by this Agreement,
the "Debt Commitment Letter" and, together with the Equity Commitment Letter,
the "Financing Letters") pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources have
agreed to provide or cause to be provided, subject solely to the terms and
conditions thereof, the amounts of the debt financing set forth therein for
the purpose of, among other things, funding a portion of the aggregate
consideration for the Merger and fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the Merger (including the repayment, prepayment or discharge of the Credit
Agreement). The Debt Financing and the Equity Financing are collectively
referred to herein as the ("Financing"). The Equity Commitment Letter
provides that (A) the Company is an express third party beneficiary thereof;
and (B) Parent and Guarantor have waived any defenses to the enforceability of
such third party beneficiary rights.

(b) _No Amendments_. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) the
Financing Letters and the terms of the Financing have not been amended or
modified prior to the date of this Agreement; (ii) no amendment or
modification to the Financing Letters that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement is contemplated (to the Knowledge of Parent); and (iii) the
respective commitments contained therein have not been withdrawn, terminated
or rescinded in any respect. There are no other Contracts, agreements, side
letters or arrangements to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party relating to
the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing,
other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Letters.

 

(c) _Sufficiency of Financing_. The Financing, when funded in accordance
with the Commitment Letters, is sufficient, in the aggregate, to provide
Parent with the net cash proceeds necessary to (i) make all payments
contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the Merger (including the
payment of all amounts payable pursuant to _Article II_ in connection with or
as a result of the Merger); (ii) repay, prepay or discharge (after giving
effect to the Merger) the principal of and interest on, and all other
Indebtedness and other amounts outstanding pursuant to, the Credit Agreement;
and (iii) pay all fees and expenses required to be paid at the Closing by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub (or its Affiliates party thereto) in connection
with the Merger and the Financing, as applicable.

 

(d) _Validity_. As of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Letters
(in the forms delivered by Parent to the Company) are in full force and
effect and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent or
Merger Sub (or its Affiliates party thereto), Guarantor (with respect to the
Equity Commitment Letter) and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties
thereto, as applicable, enforceable against Parent or Merger Sub (or its
Affiliates party thereto) and the other parties thereto, as applicable, in
accordance with their terms, except, in each case, as such enforceability (i)
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors rights
generally; and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity. As of the date
of this Agreement, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Letters, there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to
the funding of the full proceeds of the Financing pursuant to any agreement
relating to the Financing to which Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates is a party.

 



59

    

 As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that, with or
without notice or lapse of time or both, would, or would reasonably be
expected to, constitute a material default or breach on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent, any of the other parties thereto
pursuant to the Financing Letters. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and
_Section_ __ _ 7.2_, Parent has no reason to believe that it or its
Affiliates party thereto will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis (taking
into account the anticipated timing of the Closing Date) any term or
condition of the Financing to be satisfied by it. As of the date of this
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused to be fully paid,
all commitment or other fees that are due and payable on or prior to the date
of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Financing Letters.

(e) _No Exclusive Arrangements_. None of Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates has entered into any Contract, arrangement
or understanding prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank, investment bank
or other potential provider of debt financing from providing or seeking to
provide debt financing or financial advisory services to any Person in
connection with a transaction relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger.

 

4.12 _Shareholder and Management Arrangements_. As of the date hereof,
neither Parent or Merger Sub nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any of their
respective Affiliates is a party to any Contract, or has authorized, made or
entered into, or committed or agreed to enter into, any formal or informal
arrangements or other understandings (whether or not binding) with any
shareholder, director, officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (a) relating to (i) this Agreement or the Merger; (ii)
the Company or (iii) the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
businesses or operations (including as to continuing employment) from and
after the Effective Time; or (b) pursuant to which (i) any holder of Company
Shares would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount
or nature than the Per Share Price in respect of such holders Company
Shares; (ii) other than the Voting Agreement, any holder of Company Shares has
agreed to authorize the Plan of Merger or vote against any Superior Proposal;
or (iii) any Person other than the Guarantor has agreed to provide, directly
or indirectly, equity investment to Parent, Merger Sub or the Company to
finance any portion of the Merger.

 

4.13 _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time and immediately after giving
effect to the Merger (including the payment of all amounts payable pursuant
to _Article II_ in connection with or as a result of the Merger and all
related fees and expenses of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries in connection therewith), assuming (x) the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Article III_ are
true and correct (without giving effect to any "Knowledge," materiality or
"Company Material Adverse Effect" qualifiers), (y) the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, and (z) immediately prior to the
Effective Time the Company is solvent, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable
value" of the assets of each of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries
(on a consolidated basis) will exceed (i) the value of all liabilities of the
Surviving Company and such Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis), including
contingent and other liabilities; and (ii) the amount that will be required
to pay the probable liabilities of each of the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) on their existing debts (including
contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured; (b) each
of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) will
not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or 

 



60

    

 proposed to be engaged; and (c) each of the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) will be able to pay its liabilities,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.

4.14 _No Other Negotiations_. As of the date of this Agreement, none of
Parent or Merger Sub have entered into any agreements with respect to the
acquisition of any business that would be prohibited by _Section_ __ _
6.2(d)_ if entered into following the date of this Agreement.

(iii) the representations and warranties made by the Company in this
Agreement are in lieu of and are exclusive of all other representations and

acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition
Transaction, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (any such

will be required to enforce, and will not be permitted to waive, terminate or
modify, any provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement that
prohibits or purports to prohibit a proposal being made to the Company Board
(or any committee thereof) unless the Company Board has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to take such
action (I) would prohibit the counterparty from making an unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board in compliance with this _Section_ __
_ 5.3_ and (II) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 

(c) _Superior Proposals_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set

Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to any
Person or its Representatives that has made, renewed or delivered to the
Company an unsolicited, written bona fide Acquisition Proposal after the date
of this Agreement, and otherwise facilitate such Acquisition Proposal or
assist such Person (and its Representatives and financing sources) with such
Acquisition Proposal if requested by such Person, in each case with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal that was not the result of a breach in any material
respect of _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_ and that the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such actions would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided _,_ that subject to applicable Law, the Company shall provide to
Parent and Merger Sub any non-public information or data that is provided to
any Person given such access that was not previously made available to Parent
or Merger Sub prior to or substantially concurrently to the time it is
provided to such Person.

publicly

 



67

    

 known); (D) publicly adopt, approve or recommend (or publicly propose to
adopt, approve or recommend) an Acquisition Proposal; or (E) make any

constitutes an Acquisition Proposal (any action described in clauses (A), (B),
(C), (D) or (E), a "Company Board Recommendation Change"); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that none of (1) a "stop, look and listen" communication by the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company Shareholders pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially
similar communication), (2) the determination by the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal or the taking of any other action contemplated by _Section_ __ _
5.3(c)_ as and to the extent permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)(ii)_; or (3)
the delivery by the Company of any notice contemplated by _Section_ __ _
5.3(e)_ or any negotiations during the Notice Period in respect thereto in
compliance with this Agreement will constitute a Company Board Recommendation
Change or a violation of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_; or

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into

(e) _Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into

set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite
Shareholder Approval:

 

(i) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do
so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) shall not effect such a Company Board Recommendation Change
unless:

 

(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five
(5) Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change,
which notice shall specify the basis for such Company Board Recommendation
Change, including a reasonably detailed description of the facts and
circumstances relating to such Intervening Event;

(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, during
such five (5) Business Day period, the Company has negotiated with Parent and
its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent requested to do
so) to allow Parent to offer such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Financing Letters in such a manner that would obviate
the need to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such
Intervening Event, and following such five (5) Business Day period,
the Company Board (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel and taking into account Parents proposed revisions to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Financing Letters) shall have
determined that the failure of the Company Board to make such a Company Board
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; and

 



68

    

(3) following such five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel and taking into account Parents proposed revisions to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Financing Letters and any
other information provided by Parent) shall have determined that the failure
of the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to make such a Company Board
Recommendation Change to terminate this Agreement would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that each time
material modifications to the Intervening Event occur, the Company shall
notify Parent of such modification and the time period set forth in the
preceding clause (2) shall recommence provided that such time period shall
instead be three (3) Business Days from the day of such notification; or

(ii) if the Company has received a written bona fide Acquisition Proposal
during the Go-Shop Period or an unsolicited written bona fide Acquisition
Proposal after the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, that the Company Board
has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) may (A) effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change with respect to such Superior Proposal; and/or (B) cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_; and/or (C)
cause the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal substantially concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) shall not take any action described in the foregoing
clauses (A), (B) or (C) unless:

 

(1) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel)
that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

 

(2) the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ with respect to such Superior
Proposal; and

(3) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent five (5)
Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period") to the effect that the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) (A) has received an Acquisition Proposal that
has not been withdrawn; (B) has concluded in good faith that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (C) has resolved to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change and to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)(ii)_ absent any revision to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, which notice will identify the Person or "group"
of Persons making such Superior Proposal and include the material
terms thereof and copies of all relevant agreements relating to such Superior
Proposal; and during the Notice Period, the Company has negotiated with Parent
and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent has requested
to do so) to allow Parent to offer such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Financing Letters in such a manner that
would obviate the need to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change; and

 



69

    

(4) following such Notice Period, the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) (after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel and taking into account Parents proposed revisions to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Financing Letters and any
other information provided by Parent) shall have determined that the failure
of the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to make such a Company Board
Recommendation Change to terminate this Agreement would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;  _provided_ , that each time
material modifications to the terms of an Acquisition Proposal determined to
be a Superior Proposal are made (it being understood that any change to the
financial terms of such proposal shall be deemed a material modification),
the Company shall notify Parent of such modification and the time period set
forth in the preceding clause (3) shall recommence provided that such time
period shall instead be three (3) Business Days from the day of
such notification.

(f) _Notice_. From the expiration of the Go-Shop Period until the earlier
to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and
the Effective Time, the Company will as promptly as reasonably practicable
(and, in any event, within 36 hours) notify Parent if any Inquiries, offers
or proposals that constitute or could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal are received by, any non-public information is requested
from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives. Such notice must
include (i) the identity of the Person or "group" of Persons making such
Inquiries, offers or proposals; (ii) a summary of the material terms and
conditions of such Inquiries, offers or proposals; and (iii) copies of any
written materials relating thereto provided to the Company or its
Representatives. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent reasonably informed,
on a prompt basis of the status and terms of any such Inquiries, offers or
proposals (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations.

 

(g) _Certain Disclosures_. Nothing contained in this Agreement will
prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) from (i)
taking and disclosing to the Company Shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, including a "stop, look and listen"
communication by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company
Shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or
any substantially similar communication); (ii) complying with Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; (iii) informing any Person
of the existence of the provisions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_;

disclosure to the Company Shareholders unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal
(including regarding the business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries) that the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) has determined to make in good faith, it being understood
that any such statement or disclosure made by the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) must be subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this
Agreement, a factually accurate public statement by the Company or the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) to the extent required by applicable Law that
describes the Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, the identity of
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal and/or the operation of this Agreement with respect
thereto will not be deemed to be (A) a withholding, withdrawal, amendment, or
modification, or proposal by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to
withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, the Company Board Recommendation; (B) an
adoption, approval or recommendation with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal; or (C) a Company Board Recommendation Change.

5.4 _No Control of the Other Party s Business_. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement are not intended
to give Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other
hand, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the business
or operations of the other at any time prior to the Effective Time. Prior to
the Effective Time, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall exercise,

delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the consummation of the Merger; or
(ii) the ability of such Party to fully perform its obligations pursuant to
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no action by the Company taken in

the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to
this Agreement and the Merger as required by the HSR Act, which shall request

respectively, to cooperate and coordinate) with the other in determining

Governmental Authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction in which any
such filing is made; and (D) take (and cause its respective controlled
Affiliates or Subsidiaries, respectively, to take) all action necessary,
proper or advisable to (1) cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act and any other Antitrust
Laws applicable to this Agreement or the Merger; and (2) obtain any required
approvals or consents pursuant to any Antitrust Laws applicable to this
Agreement or the Merger, in each case as promptly as practicable and in any

72

    

 on the one hand, and the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries),

filings. If any Party or any Affiliate thereof receives a request for
additional information or documentary material from any Governmental Authority

pursuant to any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the Merger, then such Party
will make (or cause to be made), as promptly as reasonably practicable and
after consultation with the other Parties, an appropriate response in
compliance with such request.

(b) _Antitrust Approvals_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, if and to the extent advisable and necessary to obtain the
expiration or termination of the waiting period pursuant to the HSR Act and
any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the Merger, or to obtain any consents
or approvals pursuant to applicable Antitrust Laws, as soon as reasonably
practicable and in any event prior to the Termination Date, each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall (and shall cause their respective controlled Affiliates to)
(i) offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, (A) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of
any and all of the capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets

applicable), on the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand; and (B) any other restrictions on the activities of Parent and
Merger Sub (and their respective controlled Affiliates, if applicable), on
the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand; and
(ii) contest, defend and appeal any Legal Proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger;
provided _,_ however _,_ that, notwithstanding anything in the Agreement or
this _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)(ii)_ to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement
shall limit the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to, and cause each of
their respective controlled Affiliates to, take any and all steps necessary to
eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby prior to the
Termination Date; provided, further, that Parent and Merger Sub shall not be
obligated to take or agree to take any action with respect to the Company or
its Subsidiaries the effectiveness of which is not conditioned on the Closing
occurring.

(c) _Cooperation_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates and Subsidiaries, respectively, to), subject to any restrictions
under applicable Laws, keep the other parties apprised of the content and
status of any material communications with or from any Governmental Authority
with respect to the Merger, including (i) promptly notify the Parties of, and,
if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the others of the contents of) any material
communication received by such Person from a Governmental Authority in
connection with the Merger and permit the other parties to review and discuss
in advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by the other
parties in relation to) any proposed draft notifications, formal
notifications, filing, submission or other material written communication (and
any analyses, memoranda, white papers, presentations, correspondence or other
documents submitted therewith) made in connection with the Merger to a
Governmental Authority; (ii) keep the Parties reasonably informed with respect
to the status of any such submissions and filings to any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Merger and any developments, meetings or
discussions with any Governmental Authority in respect thereof, including with
respect to (A) the receipt of any non-action, action, clearance, consent, 

 



73

    

 approval or waiver, (B) the expiration of any waiting period, (C) the
commencement or proposed or threatened commencement of any investigation,
litigation or administrative or judicial action or proceeding under
applicable Laws and (D) the nature and status of any objections raised or
proposed or threatened to be raised by any Governmental Authority with respect
to the Merger; and (iii) not independently participate in any meeting,
hearing, proceeding or discussions (whether in person, by telephone or
otherwise) with or before any Governmental Authority in respect of the Merger
without giving the other Parties reasonable prior notice of such meeting or
substantive discussions and, unless prohibited by such Governmental
Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate. Parent and Merger Sub
will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, extend or offer or
agree to extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust
Law, or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parties
shall coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of
any applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act. However, each
of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may, as it deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any non-public information provided to any
Governmental Authority as restricted to "outside counsel" only and any such
information shall not be shared with employees, officers or directors or their
equivalents of the other Party without approval of the party providing the
non-public information; provided, _ _ that each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub may redact such information as necessary to (i) remove any
valuation and related information, or (ii) address any contractual
arrangements or reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or
confidentiality concerns before sharing any information provided to any
Governmental Authority with another Party on an "outside counsel" only basis.

 

(d) _Other Actions_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that, between
the date hereof and the Closing, it shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Affiliates to, enter into or consummate any Contracts or arrangements for
an acquisition (by stock purchase, merger, consolidation, purchase of assets,
license or otherwise) of any ownership interest, assets or rights of any
Person if such ownership interest, assets or rights would (including the
termination or expiration of the waiting period pursuant to the HSR Act or any
other Antitrust Law) result in any material delay in obtaining, or to result
in the failure to obtain, any regulatory approvals required in connection
with the Merger, or which would otherwise prevent or delay the Merger in any
material respect.

 

6.3 _Proxy Statement and Other Required SEC Filings_.

 

(a) _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as practical following the date of this
Agreement, the Company (with the assistance and cooperation of Parent and
Merger Sub as reasonably requested by the Company) shall prepare and file with
the SEC a preliminary proxy statement (as amended or supplemented, the "Proxy
Statement") relating to the Company Shareholder Meeting. Subject to _Section_
__ _ 5.3_, the Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement.

 

(b) _Other Required Company Filing_. If the Company determines that it is
required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in
connection with the Merger pursuant to applicable Law (such document, as
amended or supplemented, an "Other

 



74

    

 Required Company Filing"), then the Company (with the assistance and
cooperation of Parent and Merger Sub as reasonably requested by the Company)
shall promptly prepare and file such Other Required Company Filing with the
SEC. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement and any Other Required Company Filing to comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules of the SEC and NYSE. The Company may not file the Proxy Statement or
any Other Required Company Filing with the SEC without providing Parent and
its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon and
shall consider in good faith all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by Parent and its counsel. On the date of mailing of the
Proxy Statement to the Company Shareholders and at the time of the Company
Shareholder Meeting, the Company shall ensure that neither the Proxy
Statement nor any Other Required Company Filing will contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, false or misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by the Company with respect
to any information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or any Other Required
Company Filing.

(c) _Furnishing Information_. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall furnish all information
concerning it and its Affiliates, if applicable, as the other Party may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC
of the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing. If at any time
prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting any information relating to the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates should be
discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the
other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, as the case may be,
so that such filing would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, then the Party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to
such filing describing such information shall be promptly prepared and filed
with the SEC by the appropriate Party and, to the extent required by
applicable Law or the SEC or its staff, disseminated to the Company
Shareholders.

 

(d) _Consultation Prior to Certain Communications_. The Company and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, may not communicate in writing with the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company
Filing, as the case may be, without providing the other Party, to the extent
practicable, a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such written
communication and shall consider in good faith all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by the other Party and its counsel.

 

(e) _Notices_. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on
the other hand, shall advise the other, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for (i) any
amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company
Filing, as the case may be; (ii) any receipt of comments from the SEC or its
staff on the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, as the case
may be; or (iii) any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for
additional information in connection therewith.

 



75

    

(f) _Dissemination of Proxy Statement_. Subject to applicable Law, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to
be disseminated to the Company Shareholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the filing thereof with the SEC and confirmation from
the SEC that it will not review, or that it has completed its review of, the
Proxy Statement; _provided_ that, the Company shall not be required to file or
mail the definitive Proxy Statement prior to the expiration of the Go-Shop
Period.

6.4 _Company Shareholder Meeting_.

 

(a) _Call of Company Shareholder Meeting_. Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, the Company will take all action necessary in accordance with
the CICL, the Companys Organizational Documents and the rules and regulations
of the NYSE to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "Company Shareholder Meeting") as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement to the Company Shareholders for the purpose of obtaining the
Requisite Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Company will not be required to convene and hold the
Company Shareholder Meeting at any time prior to the 25th Business Day
following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company Shareholders.
Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, the Company will use reasonable best
efforts to solicit proxies to obtain the Requisite Shareholder Approval. In
the event that the Company Board makes a Company Board Recommendation Change,
the Company will nevertheless submit this Agreement to the Company
Shareholders for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Approval
unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms
prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting. The Company shall permit Parent and
its Representatives to attend the Company Shareholder Meeting.

 

(b) _Adjournment of Company Shareholder Meeting_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing will prevent the Company from
postponing or adjourning the Company Shareholder Meeting (i) to allow
additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Requisite Shareholder
Approval; (ii) if there are holders of an insufficient amount of Company
Shares present or represented by proxy at the Company Shareholder Meeting to
constitute a quorum at the Company Shareholder Meeting (it being understood
that the Company may not postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholder Meeting
more than two times pursuant to clause (i) or this clause (ii) without the
prior written consent of Parent); (iii) if the Company is required to postpone
or adjourn the Company Shareholder Meeting by applicable Law or a request
from the SEC or its staff; or (iv) if the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that it is reasonably likely to be required under applicable Law
to postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholder Meeting in order to give the
Company Shareholders sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure
that the Company has sent to the Company Shareholders or otherwise made
available to the Company Shareholders (including in connection with any
Company Board Recommendation Change).

 



76

    

6.5 _Financing_.

 

(a) _No Amendments to Financing Letters_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub not permit any
replacement, amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy pursuant to, the Debt Financing Letters if such amendment,
replacement, modification or waiver would, or would reasonably be expected
to, (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing, including by changing
the amount of the fees to be paid or the original issue discount of the
Financing, unless (A) the Equity Financing is increased by an equivalent
amount or (B) the aggregate amount of the Financing would still be sufficient
to fund all of the amounts required to be provided by Parent or Merger Sub for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii)
impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any
of the existing conditions to the receipt of the Financing (solely to the
extent such amendment or modification does not have an adverse impact on the
Company); (iii) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub (or
their Affiliates party thereto) or the Company, as applicable, to enforce its
rights against the other Parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto; (iv) prevent, impede or materially delay the
timely consummation of the Financing or the Closing; or (v) make the funding
of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Financing) less likely to occur; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt,
Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, may amend or modify (or amend and
restate) the Debt Commitment Letter, any fee credit or discount or engagement
letters, solely to (X) add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or any Person with similar roles or titles who had not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement, (Y) amend titles,
allocations and fee sharing arrangements with respect to the existing
and additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or similar
entities and/or (Z) increase the amount of Debt Financing thereunder. Any
reference in this Agreement to (1) the "Financing" will include the financing
contemplated by the Debt Financing Letters as amended, replaced or modified;
and (2) "Equity Commitment Letter," "Debt Commitment Letters" or "Financing
Letters" will include such documents as amended, replaced or modified.

(b) _Taking of Necessary Actions_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will use its respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper and advisable to arrange and
obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions (including, to the extent
required, the full exercise of any market flex provisions) described in the
Financing Letters, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain
in effect the Financing Letters in accordance with the terms and subject to
the conditions thereof until the Merger is consummated and all amounts
required to be paid by Parent pursuant to _Sections 2.8(h)_ , _Section_ __ _
2.9(b)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 6.16_ have been paid (subject to Parent and
Merger Subs right to replace, restate, supplement, modify, assign,
substitute, waive or amend the Financing Letters as expressly permitted by
this Agreement); (ii) negotiate and execute the Debt Financing Documents (in
any event no later than the Closing); (iii) satisfy on a timely basis (in any
event no later than the Closing) all conditions to funding that are applicable
to Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt Commitment Letters and the Debt
Financing Documents and in the Equity Commitment Letter; (iv) in the event
that the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_
have been satisfied (or, upon funding, would be satisfied) and conditions to
the availability of the Financing have been satisfied or waived (or, with the
funding of the Financing, would be concurrently satisfied), consummate the
Financing at or prior to the Closing; (v) comply with its obligations
pursuant to the Financing Letters; and (vi) enforce its rights pursuant to the
Financing Letters. Parent and Merger Sub will fully pay, or cause to be fully
paid, all commitment or other fees arising pursuant to the Financing Letters

(c) _Information_. Parent shall (i) keep the Company informed
in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing;
and (ii) upon request of the Company, provided the Company with copies of all
substantially final drafts and excluded definitive agreements related to the
Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and
Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice (A) of any breach (or
threatened breach) or default (or any event or circumstance that, with notice
or lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
material breach or default) by any party to the Financing Letters or
definitive agreements related to the Financing; (B) of the receipt by Parent
or Merger Sub of any written notice or communication from any Financing
Source with respect to any actual or threatened material breach or default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Financing Letters or any
definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of the
Financing Letters or such definitive agreements; or (C) if for any reason
Parent or Merger Sub at any time believes there is a reasonable likelihood
that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the
terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing
Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing. Parent must
provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of
the circumstances referred to in the previous sentence as soon as reasonably
practical after the date that the Company delivers a written request therefor
to Parent. Parent must, and must use reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt
Financing Sources to, provide the Company and its Representatives with such
access to the Debt Financing Sources as the Company and its Representatives
may reasonably request for the purpose of allowing the Company and its
Representatives to understand the status of Parents efforts to arrange the
Financing.

(d) _Alternate Debt Financing_. If any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the market flex
provisions) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters, Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, to (i) obtain alternative financing from
alternative financing sources with terms and conditions not materially less
favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter and on terms as are reasonably available for financings of the type
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter in the debt markets at such time
and in an amount at least equal to the Debt Financing or such unavailable
portion thereof, as the case may be (the "Alternate Debt Financing"); and
(ii) obtain one or more new financing commitment letters with respect to such
Alternate Debt Financing (the "New Debt Commitment Letters"), which new
letters will replace the existing Debt Commitment Letters in whole or in
part. Parent will promptly provide a copy of any New Debt Commitment Letters
(and any fee letter in connection therewith, which may be redacted in a manner
consistent with _Section_ __ _ 4.11(a)_ hereof) to the Company. In the event
that any New Debt Commitment Letters are obtained, (A) any reference in this
Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letters" will be deemed to include the Debt
Commitment Letters to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment
Letter at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letters to the
extent then in effect; and (B) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt
Financing" includes the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters as modified pursuant to the foregoing.

 



78

    

(e) _No Financing Condition_. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and
agree that obtaining the Financing is not a condition to the Closing.

6.6 _Financing Cooperation_.

(a) _Cooperation_. During the period between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts, and
will cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its respective reasonable best

such financing contemplated in connection with the Offering Determination),

Letter and (y) any Excluded Information); 

(ii) causing senior management (with appropriate seniority and expertise)
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to execute and deliver the Debt
Financing Documents (on behalf of Merger Sub and prior to the Effective Time,
not, for the avoidance of doubt, on behalf of the Company or its
Subsidiaries), to participate in of meetings, presentations,
conference calls, sessions with rating agencies, and other customary
syndication activities, at mutually agreeable times in mutually agreeable
locations upon reasonable advance notice; _provided_ that a reasonable number

or more ratings agencies, to the extent reasonable and customary; _provided_
that, for the avoidance of doubt, all marketing materials should reflect that

(v) furnishing due diligence materials, financial and other pertinent
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective businesses (including information to be used in the preparation of
rating agency presentations, bank confidential information memoranda and
similar customary documents regarding the business and operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably required in connection with the Debt
Financing) to Parent, Merger Sub and the Debt Financing Sources to the extent
reasonably requested by Parent to assist in the preparation of such marketing
materials to be used in connection with the Debt Financing (including in
connection with the syndication of a credit facility as contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letters);

 

(vi) facilitating the obtaining and delivering pay-off letters (and
the accompanying lien releases and terminations) in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent in respect of the Credit Agreement on or

(vii) furnishing Parent and the Debt Financing Sources (and in any event,
no less than four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) with all

PATRIOT Act), to the extent reasonably requested in writing at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to Closing; and

 

(viii) taking all corporate (or otherwise applicable governance) actions,

Parent that are necessary or customary to permit the consummation of the Debt
Financing (and from the occurrence of the Offering Determination any high

on the Closing Date to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, between the date of the occurrence of the
Offering Determination and the Inside Date, the Company will use its
reasonable best efforts, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its
respective reasonable best efforts, in each case at Parents sole expense,
to provide Parent with all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with consummating an offering of non-convertible debt securities
under Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act, including using
reasonably best efforts in (i) providing the cooperation set forth in clause

(b) _Obligations of the Company_. Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_
will require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) waive or amend any
terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses for
which it will not receive reimbursement; (ii) enter into any definitive
agreement prior to the Effective Time; (iii) give any indemnities that are
prior to the Effective Time for which it is not simultaneously indemnified by
Parent or its Affiliates in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Company;
(iv) take any action that, in the good faith determination of the Company,

and its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any
property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (v) take any
action that could reasonably be expected to result in a contravention of,
violation or breach of, or default under, the Agreement, any Organizational
Document, Material Contract or any Law; or (vi) provide access to or disclose
information which would result in waiving any attorney-client privilege, work-
product or similar privilege. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_, no action, liability or obligation of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document
or instrument relating to the Debt Financing will be effective until the
Effective Time (in each case, other than the authorization and representation

information referred to in clause (a)(vii) above), and neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives will be

authorization and representation letters referred to in clause (a)(iii) above
and "know-your-customer" information referred to in clause (a)(vii) above),
(2) take any action that could reasonably be expected to result in any

such person) with respect to any matters related to the Debt Financing, (3)
incur any liability (or cause its directors, officers or employees to incur
any liability) under the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time or (4)
cause the delivery of any legal opinions.

 

(c) _Deemed Compliance_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company shall be deemed to have complied
with this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ for all purposes of this Agreement (including
_Article VI_ , _Article VII_ and _Article VIII_ ) unless the Debt Financing
has not been obtained primarily as a result of the Companys Willful and
Material Breach of its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_. The
Parties hereto acknowledge that this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ represents the sole
obligation of the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, employees and other Representatives with
respect to the cooperation in connection with the Financing and no other
provision of the Agreement (including exhibits and schedules) shall be deemed
to expand or modify such obligations.

 



81

    

(d) _Use of Logos_. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in a form and manner reasonable acceptable to the Company
in connection with the Debt Financing so long as such logos (i) are used
solely in a manner that is not intended or likely to, and will not, harm
or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, and all goodwill arising from the use thereof shall inure to the
Company and (ii) are used solely in connection with a description of the
Company, its business and products or the Merger.

 

(e) _Confidentiality_. All non-public or other confidential
information provided by the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to
this Agreement shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub will be permitted
to disclose such information to any Financing Sources or prospective
financing sources and other financial institutions and investors that are or
may become parties to the Debt Financing and to any underwriters, initial
purchasers or placement agents in connection with the Debt Financing (and, in
each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons
(i) agree to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto;
or (ii) are subject to other confidentiality undertakings reasonably
satisfactory to the Company and of which the Company is an express third party
beneficiary.

 

(f) _Reimbursement_. Promptly upon written request by the Company, Parent
will reimburse the Company for any out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
Representatives in connection with the cooperation of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their Representatives contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
6.6_; provided, that Parent shall not be required to reimburse the Company for
any costs and expenses incurred with respect to the financial statements,
financial information or other materials prepared prior to the date of this
Agreement that may be used in connection with the Debt Financing.

 

(g) _Indemnification_. The Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives shall be indemnified and held harmless by Parent from and

amounts paid in settlement suffered or incurred by them in connection with
their cooperation in arranging the Financing pursuant to this Agreement or the
provision of information utilized in connection therewith; provided, that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that such liabilities, costs,
losses or expenses are determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the willful misconduct
of the Company, of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives. Parents obligations pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.6(f)_ and this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(g)_ are referred to collectively as the

Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates (which for this purpose will
be deemed to include each direct investor in Parent or Merger Sub and the
financing sources or potential financing sources of Parent, Merger Sub and
such investors) enter into any Contract expressly prohibiting or seeking to
expressly prohibit any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of
debt or equity financing from providing or seeking to provide debt or equity
financing or financial advisory services to any Person, in each case in
connection with a transaction relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or in connection with the Merger.

 



82

    

6.7 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board shall (a)
take all actions within their power to ensure that no "anti-takeover" statute
or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger or the
Voting Agreement; and (b) if any "anti-takeover" statute or similar statute
or regulation becomes applicable to the Merger or the Voting Agreement, take
all action within their power to ensure that the Merger may be consummated as
promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation
on the Merger.

 

6.8 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective

reasonable advance request provided in writing to the General Counsel of the
Company, or another Person designated in writing by the Company, to the
properties, books and records and personnel and consultants of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, except that the Company may restrict or otherwise
prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any
applicable Law or Contract requires the Company to restrict or otherwise
prohibit access to such documents or information; (b) access to such
documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege applicable
to such documents or information; (c) such disclosure relates to interactions
with other prospective buyers of the Company or the negotiation of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, or information relating to
the analysis, valuation or consideration of the Merger or the transactions
contemplated hereby; (d) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a
default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right to terminate or
accelerate the rights pursuant to, such Contract; (e) access would result in
the disclosure of any trade secrets of third Persons; or (f) such documents or
information are reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal Proceeding between
the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and its
Affiliates, on the other hand; _provided_ that the Company shall give notice
to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such information or documents and
thereafter the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the
disclosure of such information (or as much of it as possible) in a manner that
would not violate any of clauses (a) through (f). Nothing in this _Section_ __
_ 6.8_ shall be construed to require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives to prepare any reports, analyses,
appraisals, opinions or other information. Any investigation conducted
pursuant to the access contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall be
conducted in a manner that (i) does not unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii)
create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the
Company or its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company and
its Subsidiaries will be subject to the Companys reasonable security measures
and insurance requirements and will not include the right to perform invasive
testing. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement will apply
to any information obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in
connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_. All requests for access pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ must be directed to the General Counsel of the

83

    

6.9 _Section_ __ _ 16(b) Exemption_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall be permitted to take all such actions as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable hereto to cause the Merger, and any dispositions of
equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in
connection with the Merger by each individual who is a director or executive
officer of the Company, to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

 

6.10 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Exculpation, Indemnification and
Insurance_. 

(a) _Indemnified Persons_. The Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to,
honor and fulfill the obligations of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to any indemnification agreements listed on _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter between the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former
directors, officers or employees (and any person who becomes a director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time), on the other hand (collectively, the "Indemnified Persons").
In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries to) cause the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company
and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set
forth in the Organizational Documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company,
as applicable, as of the date of this Agreement. During such six-year period,
such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any
manner except as required by applicable Law.

 

(b) _Indemnification Obligation_. Without limiting the generality of the
provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to)
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law or pursuant to any indemnification agreements listed on _Section_ __ _
6.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter with the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement, each Indemnified Person
from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, penalties, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with
any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or
indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) the fact that
an Indemnified Person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company or such Subsidiary or Affiliate; (ii) any action or omission, or
alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or other Affiliates, or taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary
or Affiliate (including in connection with serving at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary or Affiliate as a director, officer, employee,
agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit
plan)), regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or
omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time; and (iii) the
Merger, as well as any actions taken by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub with
respect thereto, except that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written
notice asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.10(b)_, then the

 



84

    

 claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of
any such Legal Proceeding, the Surviving Company shall advance all fees and
expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an
Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding upon receipt of an
undertaking from such Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be
indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none
of Parent, the Surviving Company nor any of their respective Affiliates shall
settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for
which indemnification is reasonably likely to be sought by an Indemnified
Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent
or termination includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person
from all liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding. Any determination
required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any Indemnified
Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will be made by
independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving Company (which counsel
will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees and
expenses of which shall be paid by the Surviving Company.

(c) _D andO Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to) maintain in
effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance
("DandO Insurance") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions,
retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of the DandO
Insurance; provided, that Parent may (i) substitute therefor policies of an
insurance company the terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no
less favorable in any material respect to such directors and officers than
the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof or (ii) request that the
Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage under its existing
insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective Time). In satisfying
its obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.10(c)_, the Surviving
Company will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the
amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such
amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium"). If the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving
Company shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current directors and officers liability insurance carrier. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company may purchase a prepaid "tail" policy with respect
to the DandO Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance
carrier so long as the aggregate cost for such "tail" policy does not exceed
the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company elects to purchase such a "tail"
policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to) maintain such "tail" policy in full
force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long
as such "tail" policy is in full force and effect in lieu of maintaining
the DandO Insurance.

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If Parent, the Surviving Company or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or Surviving Company or entity in
such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provisions

 



85

    

 will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving
Company or any of their respective successors or assigns shall assume all of
the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.10_.

(e) _No Impairment_. The obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _
6.10_ may not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that
adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other Person who is a
beneficiary pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) without the
prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other Person.
Each of the Indemnified Persons or other Persons who are beneficiaries
pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section_ __
_ 6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third
party beneficiaries of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, with full rights of
enforcement as if a Party. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other
Persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail"
policy referred to in  _Section_ __ _ 6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and
representatives)) pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ will be in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such Persons may have
pursuant to (i) the Companys Organizational Documents; (ii) the
Organizational Documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all
indemnification agreements entered into with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law (whether at Law or in equity).

(f) _Other Claims_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be
construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or
indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ is not prior to or
in substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

6.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Acknowledgement_. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a
"change of control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of each of the
Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time.

 

(b) _Existing Arrangements_. From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to)
honor all of the Employee Plans listed on _Section_ __ _ 3.19(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing will prohibit the Surviving Company from amending or terminating any

__ _ 3.19_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (with respect to U.S. employees)
or in accordance with applicable Laws (with respect to non-U.S. employees)

opportunities (which are specifically addressed by clause (ii) above),
equity-based compensation, non-qualified deferred compensation, defined
benefit pension (except as required by law), retiree medical or life benefits,

and level of benefits under any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans
that are New Plans, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be
granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time to the same extent that such
service was recognized under a similar plan, program, policy or arrangement
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time, except
that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in
duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee will be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in the New Plans to the
extent that coverage pursuant to any such New Plan replaces coverage pursuant
to a comparable Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates
immediately before the Effective Time ("Old Plans"), (ii) for purposes of each
New Plan providing life insurance, medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or
disability benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing
condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-
work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents to the same extents such
requirements were waived or satisfied under the comparable Old Plan, and the
Surviving Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date that such Continuing Employees participation in the corresponding New
Plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, and will
not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture and shall not limit
future accruals.

Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii) require
Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
continue any Employee Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or
termination thereof after the Effective Time; or (iii) create any third party

contemplated hereby shall be issued by any Party without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except that no consent shall be required
for any such filing, release or announcement required by applicable Law,
regulation or stock exchange rule or listing agreement; _provided_ that the
applicable Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide the other
Parties with a right to review such filing, release or announcement in

respect to the portion of any communication relating to an Acquisition
Proposal or Company Board Recommendation Change), on the one hand, and Parent

efforts to consult with the other Parties before (a) participating in any

the defense, settlement and prosecution of any Transaction Litigation. No
Party may compromise or settle, or agree to compromise or settle, any
Transaction Litigation unless the other Parties have consented thereto in
writing (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_, "participate" means that
(i) Parent shall be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant
decisions with respect to the Transaction Litigation by the Party receiving
notice of Transaction Litigation (to the extent that the attorney-client
privilege between such Party and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise
affected), and (ii) may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such

"Company Termination Fee" shall mean an amount equal to $30,600,000.

 



95

    

(c) _Parent Termination Fee_. If this Agreement is validly terminated
pursuant to (i) _Section 8.1(g)_ or (ii) _Section 8.1(i)_, then Parent must
promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) following such
termination pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company the Parent Termination
Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by the Company.

 

(d) _Single Payment Only_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no
event will the Company or Parent be required to pay the Company Termination
Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, respectively, on more than one occasion,
whether or not the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as
applicable, may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this
Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of
different events.

 

(e) _Payments; Default_. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ are an integral part of the Merger
and that each of the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee is
not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will
compensate the Company and the Company Related Parties or Parent and the
Parent Related Parties, as applicable, for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement, which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any
amount due pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ or Parent fails to promptly
pay any amounts due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(c)_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other
hand, commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against the
Company for the amount set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ or any portion
thereof or a judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in  _Section_
__ _ 8.3(c)_ or any portion thereof, as applicable, the Company shall pay to
Parent or Parent shall pay to the Company, as the case may be, its out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such
Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof
at the annual rate of 5% plus the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ in effect on the date that such payment or portion thereof was
required to be made through the date that such payment or portion thereof was
actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by
applicable Law.

(f) _Sole Remedy_.

 

(i) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, the
Companys receipt of the Parent Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(c)_ (including the Companys right to enforce the
Guarantee with respect thereto and receive the Parent Termination Fee from
Guarantor), the Reimbursement Obligations and the Companys right to seek
specific performance pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.8_ will be the sole and
exclusive remedies of the Company and the Company Related Parties against (A)
Parent, Merger Sub or the Financing Sources; and (B) the former, current and
future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates (other than Parent, Merger Sub or the
Financing Sources), members, managers, general or limited partners,
shareholders and successors, heirs and assignees of each of Parent, Merger Sub
and Guarantor (collectively, the "Parent Related Parties"), the Debt Financing
Sources and the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties in respect of this
Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith (including the
Financing Letters and the Guarantee) and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, and upon payment of such amounts (which recourse shall be sought
solely against Parent and Merger

 



96

    

 Sub and subject to the limitations set forth herein (or the Guarantor in
accordance with, and subject to the limitations set forth in, the Guarantee
and Equity Commitment Letter)), none of the Parent Related Parties, the Debt
Financing Sources and the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties will have any
further liability or obligation to the Company or the Company Related Parties
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in
connection herewith (including the Financing Letters and the Guarantee) or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (except that the Parties (or
their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and the Company and
its Subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Reimbursement Obligations, _Section_ __ _
8.2_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_, and  _Section_ __ _
8.1(f)_, and the Guarantor will remain obligated with respect to, and the
Company and its Subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the
Guarantee), and neither the Company nor any other Person shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub,
any other Parent Related Party, any Debt Financing Sources or any of the Debt
Financing Sources Related Parties arising out of, related to or otherwise
in connection with this Agreement (or any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation contained herein), the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the failure of the Closing to be
consummated or the Financing Letters and the financings contemplated therein,
including the Debt Financing and the financing of the Equity Financing (and
the abandonment or termination thereof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)(i)_ will not relieve Parent, Merger Sub or Guarantor
from liability (1) for any Willful and Material Breach of this Agreement or
(2) for any breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that, under no
circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their Affiliates (including the Guarantor) for breaches under
this Agreement, the Guarantee or the Equity Commitment Letter exceed an amount
equal to $91,800,000 plus the Reimbursement Obligations and any obligations
under _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_ in the aggregate for all such breaches (taking
into account, for the avoidance of doubt, any payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, the Reimbursement Obligations and/or any obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_) and in no event shall the Company or any Company
Related Party seek to recover any money damages in excess of such amount. If
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, other than
the remedies described in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)(i)_, no Parent Related
Party, Debt Financing Sources or Debt Financing Sources Related Parties shall
have any further liability or obligation (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise), whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate (or
limited liability company or limited partnership) veil, by or through a claim
against the Guarantor or any other Parent Related Party, the Debt Financing
Sources or any Debt Financing Sources Related Parties and the Company
covenants and agrees that it shall not institute, and shall cause its
directors, officers and Subsidiaries and direct its other
Representatives, Affiliates and other Company Related Parties not to
institute, a Legal Proceeding to seek recourse for such further liability or
obligation.

 

(ii) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_,
Parents receipt of the Company Termination Fee and Parents right to
specific performance pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.8_, will be the sole and
exclusive remedies of Parent and Merger Sub and each of their respective
Affiliates against (A) the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their
respective Affiliates; and (B) the former, current and future holders of any
equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners,
shareholders and assignees of each of the Company, its Subsidiaries and each
of their respective Affiliates (collectively, the "Company Related Parties")
in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith
and the transactions contemplated hereby and

 



97

    

 thereby, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company Related
Parties will have any further liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in
connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
(except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with
respect to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries may be entitled to
remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, _Section_ __ _
8.2_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_ and _Section_ __ _
8.1(f)_, as applicable). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section_ __ _
8.3(f)(ii)_ will not relieve the Company from liability for any Willful and
Material Breach of this Agreement (except as further set forth in the
immediately following proviso); _provided that_ , (x) under no circumstances
will the collective monetary damages payable by the Company for breaches under
this Agreement exceed an amount equal to $91,800,000 plus any obligations
under _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_ in the aggregate for all such breaches (taking
into account, for the avoidance of doubt, any payment of the Company
Termination Fee and/or any obligations under _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_) and (y)
in the event the Company pays the Company Termination Fee (or an aggregate
dollar amount equal to the Company Termination Fee, whether or not such amount
is identified as the "Company Termination Fee") to Parent, and Parent accepts
such fee or does not return it to the Company within two (2) Business Days of
Parents receipt thereof, the Parent Related Parties shall have no further
rights or remedies whatsoever against any of the Company Related Parties,
including any claims for monetary damages of any kind or nature whatsoever,
whether or not arising as a result of or in connection with any Willful and
Material Breach and whether sounding, in contract, tort, at law or in equity,
or based on any other legal theory or argument. If this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, other than the remedies
described in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)(ii)_, the Company shall have no
further liability or obligation, whether by or through attempted piercing of
the corporate (or limited liability company or limited partnership) veil, by
or through a claim against any other Company Related Party, and Parent and
Merger Sub covenants and agrees that it shall not institute, and shall cause
its directors, officers and Subsidiaries and direct its other
Representatives, Affiliates and other Parent Related Parties not to institute,
a Legal Proceeding to seek recourse for such further liability or obligation.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_, it
is agreed that Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)_ (but not, following the valid termination of this
Agreement, with respect to sections of this Agreement that do not survive
such termination); provided, that the Company shall not be entitled under any
circumstances to both (i) payment of the Parent Termination Fee (or monetary
damages for failure to close) and (ii) specific performance of Parents
obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to effect the Closing
in accordance with _Article II_.

 

8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties at
any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (pursuant to authorized action by the
Company Board (or a committee thereof)), except that in the event that the
Company has received the Requisite Shareholder Approval, no amendment may be
made to this Agreement that requires the authorization of the Company
Shareholders pursuant to the CICL without such authorization. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions relating to the
Debt Financing Sources or Debt Financing Sources Related Parties set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.3_,  _Section_ __ _ 9.6_,
_Section_ __ _ 9.8_, _Section_ __ _ 9.10(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.11_,
_Section 9.12_ and this _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ (and the defined terms used
therein) may not be amended, modified or altered in a manner adverse to the
Debt Financing Sources or Debt Financing Sources Related Parties without the
prior written consent of the Debt Financing Sources.

 



98

    

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any Party may, to the extent legally allowed and except as
otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other Party, as applicable; (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such Party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) subject
to the requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver will be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such Party. Any delay
in exercising any right pursuant to this Agreement will not constitute a
waiver of such right.

9.3 _Assignment_. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder, by operation of Law or otherwise,
without the prior written approval of the other Parties, except that Parent
will have the right to assign all or any portion of its rights and
obligations pursuant to this Agreement from and after the Effective Time (a)
in connection with a merger or consolidation involving Parent or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Parent or the
Surviving Company; or (b) to any Debt Financing Source pursuant to the terms
of the Debt Financing for purposes of creating a security interest

 



100

    

 herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of the Debt
Financing, it being understood that, in each case, such assignment will not
(i) affect the obligations of the parties (including Debt Financing Sources)
to the Financing Letters or Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee; or (ii)
impede or delay the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. No assignment by any Party will
relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder. Any purported
assignment of this Agreement without the consent required by this _Section_
__ _ 9.3_ is null and void.

 

9.4 _Confidentiality Agreement_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby
acknowledge that Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC and the Company have
previously executed a confidentiality letter agreement, dated August 14, 2019
(the "Confidentiality Agreement"), that shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Representatives shall hold and treat all documents and information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished or made available to
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives in connection with the
Merger in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. By executing this
Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agree to be bound by and comply with,
and to cause their Representatives to be bound by and comply with, the terms
and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement as if they were parties
thereto.

9.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments
and other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or referred to
herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Guarantee and the Financing Letters, constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement will
(a) not be superseded; (b) survive any termination of this Agreement; and (c)
continue in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of the Effective
Time and the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance
with its terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto.

 

9.6 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.10_ and this  _Section_ __ _ 9.6_, the Parties agree that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement are
solely for the benefit of the other Parties in accordance with and subject to
the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to, and will not,
confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) as
set forth in or contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 6.10_; and (b) from and after
the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of Company Shares and Company
Equity Awards to receive the merger consideration set forth in _Article II_.
The provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_,  _Section_ __ _ 8.4_, _Section_
__ _ 9.3_, _Section_ __ _ 9.8_, _Section_ __ _ 9.10(b)_, _Section_ __ _
9.11_, _Section_ __ _ 9.12_ and this  _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ shall inure to
the benefit of the Debt Financing Sources and the Debt Financing Sources
Related Parties, each of whom are intended to be third party beneficiaries
thereof (it being understood and agreed that the provisions of such Sections
will be enforceable by the Debt Financing Sources and the Debt Financing
Sources Related Parties).

 

9.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, or incapable of being
enforced under any applicable Law, the remainder of this

 



101

    

 Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

9.8 _Remedies_.

 

(a) _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by
Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Although the Company may
pursue both a grant of specific performance and monetary damages (including
the payment of the Parent Termination Fee), under no circumstances will the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance that results in the occurrence of the Closing and monetary
damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific performance and
all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee).

 

(b) _Specific Performance_.

 

(i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event
that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
any Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in
order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (A)
the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at Law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof; and (B)
the rights and limitations of specific enforcement under this Section 9.8(b)
are an integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither the
Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)(i)_, it is acknowledged and
agreed that the right of the Company to an injunction, specific performance
or other equitable remedy in connection with enforcing Parents obligation or
the Companys ability, as a third party beneficiary, to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger will be subject to the
requirements that (A) all of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_
and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that
by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable
of being satisfied at the Closing) at the time Closing is required to be
consummated pursuant to Section 2.3; (B) the Debt Financing has been funded or
will be funded at the Closing on the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing; (C) Parent and Merger
Sub fail to complete the Closing in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.3_; and
(D) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent that
if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing
are funded, then it would take such actions that are required of it by this
Agreement to cause the Closing to occur. In no event will the Company be
entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parents obligation or the
Companys ability, as a third party beneficiary, to cause the Equity Financing
to be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been
funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded
at the Closing).

 



102

    

(iii) The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of
an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief as provided
herein to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement as provided herein to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements
of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement. Any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or
enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other
security.

 

(iv) None of the Debt Financing Sources or the Debt Financing Sources
Related Parties will have any liability to the Company or any of its
Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Debt Financing
(other than under the Debt Financing Documents upon the Closing), or
otherwise, whether at Law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise,
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated
hereby, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letter or any other Debt Financing Document or the performance
thereof, or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made
in connection herewith or therewith, and neither the Company nor any of its
Affiliates will have any rights or claims, and shall not seek any loss or
damage or any other recovery or judgment of any kind, against any of the Debt
Financing Sources or the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties hereunder or
thereunder.

 

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or
counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement
thereof, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of Delaware, including its statute of limitations, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of Laws (whether of the State of Delaware or
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the following matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
construed, performed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the Cayman
Islands: the Merger, the vesting of the rights, property, choses in action,
business, undertaking, goodwill, benefits, immunities and privileges,
contracts, obligations, claims, debts and liabilities of Merger Sub in the
Company, the cancellation of the shares, the rights provided in Section 238
of the CICL, the fiduciary or other duties of the Company Board and the boards
of directors of Parent and Merger Sub and the internal corporate affairs of
the Company and Merger Sub.

 



103

    

9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) _General Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties (a) irrevocably consents
to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process (whether
inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any
Legal Proceeding relating to the Merger and the Guarantee, for and on behalf
of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 9.2_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, and
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.10_ will affect the right of any Party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (b)
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties
and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) (the "Chosen
Courts") in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out of this
Agreement, the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby;
(c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court; (d) agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this
Agreement, the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
shall be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (e) waives
any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal
Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in
an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (f)
agrees that it shall not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this
Agreement, the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in
any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen
Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

 

(b) _Jurisdiction for Debt Financing Source_ s. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and irrevocably
agree (i) that any Legal Proceeding, whether in Law or in equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise, involving the Debt Financing Sources arising out of, or
relating to, the Merger, the Debt Financing or the performance of services
thereunder or related thereto will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
any state or federal court sitting in the State of New York in the borough of
Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, and each Party submits for itself
and its property with respect to any such Legal Proceeding to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to bring or permit any of their
Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Legal
Proceeding in any other court; (iii) that service of process, summons, notice
or document by registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses
provided in any applicable Debt Commitment Letter will be effective service of
process against them for any such Legal Proceeding brought in any such court;
(iv) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection which any of them may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
Legal Proceeding in any such court; and (v) any such Legal Proceeding will be
governed and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York.

 

9.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT,
TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, THE GUARANTEE, THE

 



104

    

 FINANCING LETTERS OR THE FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING

9.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be
executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and
the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts
have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it
being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any
such counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or
similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic
Delivery"), will be treated in all manner and respects as an original
executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature,
or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the
formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense,
except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.
