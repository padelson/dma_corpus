and exclusive remedy for resolving disputes relative to the determination of
the amount of Closing Date Net Assets under this _Section 2.4._

(d) In the event that the Seller Representative and the Buyer are not able to
agree on the Closing Date Net Assets within 30 days after the Seller
Representatives delivery of notice of disagreement pursuant to _Section
2.4(c)_, the Seller Representative and the Buyer shall each have the right to
require that

 



 

- 14 \-  such disputed determination be submitted to BDO Seidman, or if BDO Seidman
is not available for any reason or does not maintain its independent status,
Grant Thornton, LLP or such other independent certified public accounting
firm as the Seller Representative and Buyer may then promptly mutually agree
upon in writing (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for computation or verification in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The Accounting Firm shall
review the matters in dispute and, acting as arbitrator, shall promptly decide
the proper amounts of such disputed entries (which decision shall also include
a final calculation of Closing Date Net Assets). The submission of the
disputed matter to the Accounting Firm shall be the exclusive remedy for
resolving disputes relative to the determination of Closing Date Net Assets
under this _Section 2.4_. If issues are submitted to the Accounting Firm for
resolution, (i) each Seller, the Company and the Buyer shall furnish or cause
to be furnished to the Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents
and information relating to the disputed issues as the Accounting Firm
may request and are available to that Party or its agents, and the Seller
Representative and the Buyer shall be afforded the opportunity to present to
the Accounting Firm any material relating to the disputed issues and to
discuss the issues with the Accounting Firm; (ii) the determination by the
Accounting Firm, as set forth in a notice to be delivered to both the Seller
Representative and the Buyer within 60 days of the submission to the
Accounting Firm, of the issues remaining in dispute, shall be final, binding
and conclusive on the Parties and shall be used in the calculation of Closing
Date Net Assets; and (iii) one-half of the Accounting Firms fees and expenses
shall be paid by the Sellers, and one-half of such fees and expenses shall be
paid by the Buyer. The final calculation of Closing Date Net Assets pursuant
to this _Section 2.4_, as determined pursuant to this _Section 2.4_, is
referred to herein as the " _Closing Date Net Assets Calculation_."

(e) If the Closing Date Net Assets Calculation as finally agreed upon or
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ equals or exceeds the Estimated Net
Assets, the Buyer shall direct the Escrow Agent to pay the Seller
Representative, on behalf of the Sellers the Net Assets Holdback. In addition,
if the Closing Date Net Assets Calculation exceeds the Estimated Net Assets,
then the Buyer shall pay to the Seller Representative, on behalf of the
Sellers, an amount equal to such excess with interest. If the Estimated Net
Assets exceed the Closing Date Net Assets Calculation as finally agreed upon
or determined pursuant to this _Section 2.4_, the Seller Representative shall
direct the Escrow Agent to pay the Buyer out of the Net Assets Holdback an
amount equal to such excess with interest. If the difference between the
Estimated Net Assets and the Closing Date Net Assets Calculation exceeds the
Net Assets Holdback, then the Sellers (on a several basis) will pay the amount
of such excess to the Buyer. Any payment required to be made pursuant to this
_Section 2.4(e)_, is referred to as the " _Net Assets Adjustment Payment_."
The Net Assets Adjustment Payment, together with interest thereon from the
Closing Date until the date of payment at the rate of interest published as
the "Prime Rate" in the "Money Rates" column of

 



 

- 15 \-  the Southwest Edition of The _Wall Street Journal_ (or the average of such
rates if more than one rate is indicated) on the Closing Date, shall be paid
by the Escrow Agent and, if applicable, the Buyer to the Seller
Representative, by the Escrow Agent to the Buyer or by the Sellers to the
Buyer, as the case may be, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated in writing by the Party that is to receive the Net
Assets Adjustment Payment, not later than five days after the amount of the
Net Assets Adjustment Payment is finally agreed upon or determined pursuant to
this _Section 2.4_. After payment of the Net Assets Adjustment Payment or if
no Net Assets Adjustment Payment is required, any amount of the Net Assets
Holdback and any interest thereon remaining on deposit with the Escrow Agent,
if any, shall be paid to the Seller Representative, on behalf of the
Sellers. 

2.5. _Part 12 Holdback._

(a) _Holdback Generally._ The $14,000,000 Part 12 Holdback will be held in a
separate escrow account and will be released to the Sellers incrementally over
three years ($5,000,000 thirty days after the first anniversary of the
Closing, $5,000,000 thirty days after the second anniversary and the balance
thirty days after the third anniversary, subject to actual and pending
claims). The Part 12 Holdback account shall bear interest at money market
interest rates for the benefit of the party ultimately receiving such funds.

(b) _Types of Claims._ The Part 12 Holdback will be paid to the Sellers
unless the Company has been unsuccessful in defending a challenge to Federal
Acquisition Regulations Part 12 classification. The defense of a Part 12
classification challenge will be considered unsuccessful for purposes of the
Part 12 Holdback, if and only if, one of the following events occurs: (i) a
challenged commercial catalog product is sold on a Part 15 basis (a " _Part 15
Claim_ "), or (ii) a contract is rejected because the purchaser will only buy
a commercial catalog product on a Part 15 basis and the Company refuses to
sell the product on that basis, as defined by the decision tree shown in
Exhibit B "Rejection Business Claim Decision Tree" (a " _Rejection Claim_ ").

(c) _EBITDA Thresholds._  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no claim against the
Part 12 Holdback shall be paid for a Rejection Claim incurred during a
particular year if the Companys actual EBITDA meets or exceeds the forecasted
EBITDA for the relevant year. For purposes of the payment of the Part 12
Holdback, the forecasted EBITDA for each year during the Part 12 Holdback
period is:

Jan-Dec 2011: $14,548,000

Jan-Dec 2012: $15,994,000

 



 

- 16 \- Jan-Dec 2013: $18,733,000

 

For purposes of this Agreement, EBITDA will be understood to mean the earnings
of the Company before adjustments for interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, all calculated on a GAAP basis from the Companys regularly
prepared financial statements.

(d) _Determination of Claim Amount._

(i) For Part 15 Claims, the amount of the Buyers claim will be calculated by
deducting the net present value (using a 5% discount rate) of the stream of
payments anticipated to be received under the accepted contract from the net
present value (using a 5% discount rate) of the same stream of payments if
the purchaser had paid the gross commercial catalog sales price for the
products. The anticipated ship dates in the supply agreement or purchase order
will be used as the anticipated payment dates for purposes of the net present
value calculation. The Buyer will assert claims against the Part 12 Holdback
promptly after the Companys acceptance of the supply agreement or purchase
order, but in any event, prior to the final distribution of the Part
12 Holdback.

(ii) For Rejection Claims, the amount of the claim will be 31% of the then-
current gross commercial catalog sales price for products identified on a
refused contract. Rejection Claims will be asserted by the Buyer within 30
days following the final determination of EBITDA for the period relating to
the claim. For example, if 10 units were to have been delivered in March 2011
and 20 units in September 2011, the Buyer will submit a Rejection Claim, if
applicable, with respect to the 30 units in January 2012. If the rejected
contract included shipments after the third anniversary of the Closing, the
claim related to those shipments will be discounted (at a 5% discount rate)
back to the third anniversary of the Closing Date. Such Rejection Claims with
respect to shipments scheduled following the third anniversary will be
permitted only if the applicable EBITDA threshold was not met for the final
period of the Part 12 Holdback period.

(e)  _Other Part 12 Holdback Procedures._ If a Request for Proposal (" _RFP_
") or Request for Quotation (" _RFQ_ ") has not been finally accepted or
rejected but an annual distribution to the Sellers is upcoming, the Buyer may
submit a notice to the Escrow Agent causing that such distribution shall be
delayed until after it is determined if either a Part 15 Claim or a Rejection
Claim may be asserted with respect to the subject contract. Any challenge to
Part 12 classification arising with respect to proposals or solicitations
first submitted after the third anniversary of the Closing will not result in
any claim against the sellers or adjustment to the purchase price. In no event
shall the total Part 12 indemnification claims exceed the Part 12 Holdback.
On a given distribution date, if there are no pending claims, the Escrow Agent
will distribute to the Sellers, pro rata in accordance with their Share
ownership, (i) the amount to be distributed on such date pursuant to Section
2.5(a), minus (ii) the amount of any

 



 

- 17 \-  Part 15 Claim and Rejection Claim payments made to the Buyer during such
annual period, plus (iii) the amount of interest earned on the amount to be
distributed to the Sellers. If a claim is currently pending at the time of
the distribution of the holdback, only the potential amount of such claim
shall be held back and the distribution of that potential claim shall be made
within five business days of the resolution of the last of the pending
claims.

2.6. _The Seller Representative._

 

(a) Each Seller hereby constitutes and appoints Jeffery C. Sanders as its
representative and true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact (in such
capacity, the " _Seller Representative_ ") with full power and authority in

(i) to act on behalf of each of them in the absolute discretion of the Seller

provision of this Agreement; (F) execute, with specific direction from the
Sellers, waivers on behalf of the Sellers as contemplated by _Section 14.2_;

(ii) in general, to do all things and to perform all acts, including executing
and delivering all agreements, certificates, receipts, instructions and other
instruments contemplated by or deemed advisable, to effectuate the provisions
of this _Section 2.4(e)_.

(b) The foregoing appointment and grant of power and authority is coupled with
an interest and is in consideration of the mutual covenants made herein and is
irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of any Seller or by
operation of Law or by the occurrence of any other event. By execution of the
"Acceptance and Agreement of Seller Representative" attached hereto, Jeffery
C. Sanders accepts such appointment and grant.

 

(c) Each Seller consents to the taking by the Seller Representative of any and
all actions and the making by the Seller Representative of any decisions
required or permitted to be taken or made by the Seller Representative
pursuant

 



 

- 18 \-  to this _Section 2.4(e)_, and agrees that each such action or decision
shall bind such Seller.

(d) Each Seller agrees that the Seller Representative shall have no obligation
or liability to any Person for any action or omission taken or omitted by the
Seller Representative in good faith hereunder. 

(e) The Buyer shall be entitled to conclusively rely, without any independent
verification or inquiry, upon any document or notice delivered by the Seller
Representative or upon any other action taken by the Seller Representative as
(i) genuine and correct and (ii) having been duly signed or sent or taken by
the Seller Representative. 

(f) Payments made to or as directed by the Seller Representative under
_Section 2.3(c)_,  _Section 2.6_ or any other provision of this Agreement
are sufficient and binding to the same extent as though such payments were
made directly to the appropriate Seller. The Buyer shall not have any
responsibility or liability for any further delivery or application of any
such payment, it being agreed by the Sellers that, on the terms set forth
herein, (i) any payment the Buyer is required to make hereunder to any Seller
may be made to or as directed by the Seller Representative on behalf of such
Seller, as the case may be, (ii) the Sellers shall determine among themselves
the amount due to each Seller from each payment made to or as directed by the
Seller Representative hereunder, and (iii) each Seller shall look solely to
the Seller Representative for such Sellers respective share of any payment
made to or as directed by the Seller Representative hereunder.

 

(g) The Seller Representative or any successor thereto may appoint a successor
Seller Representative (the " _Successor Seller Representative_ "). To be
effective, such appointment must be (i) written, (ii) signed by the outgoing
Seller Representative or outgoing Successor Seller Representative as the
Seller Representative hereunder, (iii) indicate such appointment, (iv) signed
by the Successor Seller Representative to indicate its acceptance of such
appointment and its agreement to be bound by the terms hereof pertaining to
the Seller Representative, and (v) delivered to the Buyer. Upon such an
appointment of a Successor Seller Representative under this Agreement, such
Successor Seller Representative will succeed to and become vested with all of
the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the Seller Representative, and
the predecessor Seller Representative shall be discharged from such
predecessor Seller Representatives duties and obligations under this
Agreement.

 

2.7. _Escrow Amount._ The Escrow Amount will be available to satisfy indemnity
claims made by the Buyer pursuant to  _Section 11_, and any amount remaining
available after 18 months from the Closing (not subject to a pending claim)
will be released to the Seller Representative for distribution to the Sellers,
all as provided for in more detail in the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

- 19 \- 2.8. _Tax Withholding._ If Buyer determines that the withholding of any
amount from the consideration payable to Sellers pursuant to this Agreement
is required under any applicable Legal Requirements, Buyer will give
reasonable advance written notice to Seller of such withholding obligation.
Buyer will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any such payments such
amounts as Buyer reasonably determines are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Legal
Requirements. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and are paid over
for Sellers account according to applicable Legal Requirements, such amounts
will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
Sellers as provided in the Agreement. If Buyers obligation to withhold with
respect to a payment to Sellers can be reduced or eliminated through the
provision of a certification or applicable form, Buyer shall provide Sellers
with a reasonable opportunity to provide such certification or form.

Disclosure Schedule delivered to the Company and the Sellers at or prior to
the Closing pursuant to _Section 14.9(b))_, or (ii) any of the Buyer Closing
Documents (for this purpose, the Buyer Closing Certificate will be deemed to
have stated that each representation and warranty of the Buyer contained in

effect to any amendment or supplement to the Buyer Disclosure Schedule
delivered to the Company at or prior to the Closing pursuant to _Section
14.9(b))_;

Transactions.

 

11.4. _Limitations._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement (other than  _Section 13.8)_ or any agreement or document
delivered in connection with this Agreement, or provided under any applicable
Legal Requirement, from and after the Closing:

 

(a) The Buyer shall have no right to indemnification pursuant to _Section
11.2(a)_ or, to the extent relating to any failure to perform or comply at or
prior to the Closing, _Section 11.2(b)_, until the aggregate amount of all
Losses that would be indemnifiable under _Subsection 11.2(a)_ but for the
limitation in this _Subsection 11.4(a)_ , exceeds One Million Dollars
($1,000,000) (the " _Deductible_ " _),_ whereupon, subject to the other

exceed the Deductible; provided, however, that the preceding limitations in
this _Section 11.4(a)_ shall not be applicable to claims for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)_ for any Losses arising or resulting from a
breach or alleged breach of the Company Specified Representations, the Sellers
Specified Representations or from fraud or Losses relating to or arising out
of, or in connection with, any Company 401(k) Plan incurred prior to the
Closing or relating to or arising out of, or in connection with, any failures,
violations, errors or omissions that occurred prior to the Closing (including

or resulting from a breach or alleged breach of the Company Specified
Representations, the Sellers Specified Representations or from fraud or Losses
relating to or arising out of, or in connection with, any Company 401(k) Plan

connection with, any failures, violations, errors or omissions that occurred

(c) The maximum, aggregate amount for which the Buyer shall be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to  _Section 11.2(a)_ for Losses arising or
resulting from a breach or alleged breach of the Company Specified
Representations, the Sellers Specified Representations or from fraud shall not
exceed an amount equal to the Purchase Price.

(e) The Sellers shall have no right to indemnification pursuant to _Section
11.3(a)_ or to the extent relating to any failure to return or comply at or
prior to the Closing, _Section 11.3(b)_, until the aggregate amount of all
Losses that would be indemnifiable under such _Subsection 11.4(e)(i)_ but for
the limitation in this  _Section 11.4(e)(ii)_, exceeds the Deductible,
whereupon, subject to the other limitations and provisions of this _Section
11_, the Sellers shall be entitled to indemnification only for the amount by
which such indemnifiable Losses exceed the Deductible; provided, however,
that the preceding limitation in this _Section 11.4(e)_ shall not be
applicable to claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.3(a)_ for
any Losses arising or resulting from a breach or alleged breach of the Buyer
Specified Representations or from fraud.

(f) The maximum, aggregate amount of Losses for which the Sellers shall be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.3(a)_ shall not exceed
the Cap Amount; provided, however, that the preceding limitation in this
_Section 11.4(f)_ shall not be applicable to claims for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 11.3(a)_ for any Losses arising or resulting from a
breach or alleged breach of the Buyer Specified Representations or from fraud.

 

(g) The maximum, aggregate amount for which the Sellers shall be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to  _Section 11.3(a)_ for Losses arising or

 



 

- 51 \-  resulting from a breach or alleged breach of the Buyer Specified
Representations or from fraud shall not exceed an amount equal to the Purchase
Price.

 

(h) In determining the amount of Losses for which an Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification under any provision of this _Section 11_, any
related insurance proceeds that are actually received will be taken into
account.

(i) The amount of Losses taken into account for any purpose under this
_Section 11_ shall be reduced by the amount of any Liabilities that (i)
specifically relate to such Losses, (ii) are set forth in the Estimated Net
Assets as finally agreed upon or determined pursuant to _Section 2.4_, and
(iii) are taken into account in the determination of the Closing Date Net
Assets.

 

(j) No Indemnified Party shall have any right to indemnification from any
Indemnifying Party for any Losses relating to any matter arising or resulting
from this Agreement or any of the Closing Documents to the extent that such
Indemnified Party, its successors or assigns has recovered such Losses with
respect to such matter pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement.

(k) No Party shall be liable to the other Party, either in contract or in
tort, for any of the following relating to any breach or alleged breach of
this Agreement or any other agreement or document delivered in connection with
this Agreement, and none of the following shall be included in the
determination as to whether any Losses have been incurred or as to the amount
of any Losses incurred, in each case whether or not the possibility of any of
the following has been disclosed to a Party in advance or could have been
reasonably foreseen by a Party: (i) punitive damages, (ii) special,
consequential or incidental damages, (iii) loss of future revenue, income or
profits, cost of capital or loss of business reputation or opportunity, or
(iv) diminution in value or multiples of earnings damages; provided, however,
that this _Section 11.4(k)_ shall not apply with respect to such damages
payable by a Party to a third party as a result of a Third Party Claim and for
which such Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this  _Section
11_.

11.5. _Third Party Claims._

 

(a) Promptly after the receipt by a Party or any of its Affiliates of notice
of any claim or Proceeding that is threatened or asserted by any third party
which is subject to indemnification hereunder (a " _Third Party Claim_ " _),_
such Party shall, if a claim for indemnification is to be made against the
other Party under this  _Section 11_, give notice of such Third Party Claim
to the Indemnifying Party. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such
notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability that it may
have on account of its indemnification obligation or otherwise, except to the
extent that the defense of such Third Party Claim is prejudiced by the
Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice.

 



 

- 52 \- (b) The Indemnifying Party may, at its sole cost and expense, upon notice
to the Indemnified Party within 30 days after the Indemnifying Party receives
notice of a Third Party Claim, assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
with counsel chosen by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party and, after notice from the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not, as long as it diligently conducts such
defense, be liable to the Indemnified Party under this _Section 11_ for any
fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of
such Third Party Claim, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates in connection with the defense of such Third
Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to any compromise or
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party
Claim, unless (i) the compromise, settlement or judgment is solely for money
damages that have been paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, or (ii) the
Indemnified Party consents thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

(c) If notice of a Third Party Claim is given to an Indemnifying Party
pursuant to _Section 11.5(a)_, and the Indemnifying Party does not assume
the defense of such Third Party Claim, or assumes but thereafter fails to
diligently conduct such defense, the Indemnified Party may defend such Third
Party Claim in a reasonable manner, including settling such Third Party Claim
on such terms as the Indemnified Party deems appropriate; provided, however,
that whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed or diligently
conducted the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder for any
settlement entered into without the Indemnifying Partys prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

 

(d) In connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim, each Party shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, give the Indemnifying Party full access to
all information relevant thereto and make its and their respective
Representatives available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any such material provided hereunder. 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 11.5_, any
Third Party Claim that is a Tax Proceeding shall be governed by the
provisions of _Section 12.6_.

11.6. _Procedure for Indemnification   Other Claims._ A claim for
indemnification hereunder for any matter not involving a Third-Party Claim may
be asserted by notice to the Party from whom such indemnification is sought.

 

11.7. _Escrow._ If any portion of the Escrow Amount remains subject to the
Escrow Agreement, any liability of the Sellers for indemnification hereunder
shall be

 



 

- 53 \-  first satisfied out of the Escrow Amount to the extent that sufficient funds
are available under the Escrow Agreement.

11.8. _Mitigation._ Upon any Indemnified Party becoming aware of any matter
with respect to which indemnification may be sought by such Indemnified Party
pursuant to this  _Section 11_, such Indemnified Party shall utilize
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the Losses arising or resulting
from such matter.

11.9. _Subrogation._ To the extent that an Indemnifying Party discharges any
claim for indemnification hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates against
third parties relating to such claim.

11.10. _Exclusivity of Remedies._  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or any agreement or document delivered in
connection with this Agreement, or provided under any applicable Legal
Requirement, from and after the Closing, the remedies set forth in  _Section
2.4_, this _Section 11_, _Section 14.7_, _Section 13.8_, and _Section
14.8_, shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties with respect to
any and all of the Contemplated Transactions and matters covered by or
arising under or in connection with this Agreement or any other agreement or
document delivered in connection with this Agreement; provided, however, that
the provisions of _Section 2.4_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to all items which are the subject of the calculations to be made
pursuant to such Section.

SECTION 12. _TAX MATTERS_

12.1. _Proration of Taxes._ In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of
Taxes of the Company attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
determined based on (i) in the case of Taxes other than ad valorem or similar
property Taxes, on the basis of an interim closing of the books as of the
close of business on the Closing Date, and (ii) in the case of ad valorem or
similar property Taxes, pro rata on the basis of the number of days in such
Straddle Period. All transactions occurring on the Closing Date, other than
transactions required to effect this Agreement and transactions in the
Ordinary Course of Business, shall be treated as occurring on the following
day. The tax consequences of any deemed asset sale under IRC Section 338
or similar Legal Requirements shall be solely for Buyers account, and Taxes
allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if no such deemed
asset sale occurred.

 

12.2. _Tax Returns._

(a) The Company shall have responsibility for preparing and timely filing all
Tax Returns relating to the Company that are required to be filed on or prior
to the Closing Date, and for timely paying all Taxes relating to such Tax
Returns. The Buyer shall have responsibility for preparing and timely filing
all

 



 

- 54 \-  Tax Returns relating to the Company required to be filed after the Closing
Date, including any Tax Returns for any Straddle Periods, and for timely
paying all Taxes relating to such Tax Returns, provided that nothing in this
Section 12.2(a) shall affect any indemnification obligations of the Sellers
with respect to such Taxes pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) Any Tax Return relating to the Company that includes any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, shall, unless otherwise required by applicable Tax Legal Requirement
or approved by the Parties, be prepared in accordance with past Tax accounting
practices used with respect to the Tax Returns in question. To the extent any
items are not covered by past practices, or to the extent such past practices
are not permissible under applicable Tax Legal Requirement, the items may be
reported in accordance with any reasonable Tax accounting practices selected
by the Person responsible for preparing the Tax Return.

 

(c) If requested by the Sellers, the Buyer shall make available to the
Company, the Sellers and their Representatives for review and comment any Tax
Returns and related workpapers prepared by the Buyer or its Affiliates
relating to the Company that includes any Pre-Closing Tax Period. The Buyer
shall use its reasonable efforts to make such Tax Return and
workpapers available for review as required under this paragraph sufficiently
in advance of the due date for filing such Tax Returns to provide the Sellers
with a meaningful opportunity to analyze and comment on such Tax Returns and
have such Tax Returns modified before filing. The Buyer and the Sellers shall
attempt in good faith to resolve any issues arising out of the review of such
Tax Returns.

(d) Neither the Sellers nor any of their post-Closing Affiliates will, and
neither the Buyer nor any of its post-Closing Affiliates (including the
Company) will, file any amended return, carryback claim, or other adjustment
request relating to the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including any
Straddle Period) unless such action is required by applicable Legal
Requirements, or the Party that is (or whose Affiliate is) proposing to file
the return, claim, or adjustment request has obtained the prior written
consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.

12.3. _Refunds and Tax Benefits._ Any Tax refund received by the Buyer or the
Company and any credit against otherwise required Tax payments of Buyer or the
Company (including any refund or reduction in estimated Tax payments) (a "
_Tax Benefit_ " _)_ that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for
the account of the Sellers, but only to the extent such Tax Benefits are in
excess of any accrued Tax Benefit of the Company (not including any accrual
for Tax Benefits with respect to temporary differences between book and Tax
income) in the Closing Date Net Assets. The calculation of the Tax Benefit
relating to any taxable period shall take into account any corresponding
increase in Taxes due for the taxable period. For example, the Tax Benefit
attributable to any reduction in state Taxes will be calculated net of any
corresponding increase in federal income Tax. Any Tax Benefit for
any Straddle Period

 



 

- 55 \-  shall be prorated between the Sellers and the Buyer in accordance with the
principles of _Section 12.1_.

12.4. _Inter-period Adjustments._ In calculating the amount of any Tax due
from the Sellers, or Tax Benefit due to the Sellers, hereunder with respect to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period, proper accounting shall be made for any Tax items
arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period that directly relate to such Tax or Tax
Benefit. For example, if the Sellers are entitled to a Tax Benefit for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period resulting from increased depreciation deductions
claimed in the Pre-Closing Tax Period, any corresponding increase in Taxes due
for any Post-Closing Tax Period as a result of lower depreciable basis in the
Post-Closing Tax Period shall likewise be for the Sellers account and shall
constitute a Tax liability of the Sellers that shall reduce the amount of any
such Tax Benefit. Conversely, if any Tax assessment for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period produces a Tax Benefit for any Post-Closing Tax Period, the
Tax Benefit for the Post-Closing Tax Period shall be for the Sellers
account. For purposes of this Section 12.4, the amount of any Taxes or Tax
Benefit arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period shall be reasonably determined by
the Buyer. A refund of Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period attributable to a
carryback of a net operating loss arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period shall
be for Buyers account.

12.5. _Cooperation on Tax Matters._

(a) The Parties shall cooperate to the extent reasonably requested by any
other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any Tax
Proceeding. Such cooperation shall include, upon some other Partys request,
the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such Tax Proceeding and making Representatives available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Such cooperation shall include promptly
forwarding copies of notices and other communications received from or sent to
any Governmental Body relating to Taxes of the Company for which such other
Party may be responsible under applicable Legal Requirements or
this Agreement.

(b) Upon request, the Buyer and the Sellers shall use their best efforts to
obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Body or any
other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed (including any Tax with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions).

 

12.6. _Tax Proceedings._ After the Closing, the Sellers and the Buyer shall
provide prompt written notice to each other of any Tax Proceeding that it
becomes aware of which, if determined adverse to either Party, would be
grounds for indemnification under this Agreement by the other Party. The
obligation to provide notice applies to all material matters related to
the Tax Proceeding, such that there is a continuing obligation to provide
notice of the commencement of the Tax Proceeding as well as all material
developments in the Tax Proceeding. Such notice shall contain

 



 

- 56 \-  factual information (to the extent known) describing the matter in
reasonable detail and shall be accompanied by copies of any notice or other
document received from or with any Tax authority in respect of any such
matters. Failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Party entitled to
receive the notice from any Liability which it may have on account of its
indemnification obligation or otherwise, except to the extent that the
Party entitled to receive notice is materially prejudiced thereby. The
Sellers, at their sole expense, shall have the right to represent the Company
before any Tax authority or any court regarding any Tax Proceeding relating to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period other than a Straddle Period with respect to any
asserted liability for which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement;
provided, however, that the Sellers shall allow Buyer and its counsel to
participate in any such Tax Proceeding; and provided further, that the
Sellers shall not enter into any settlement of any contest or otherwise
compromise any issue in connection with such Tax Proceeding without the prior
written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). The Sellers shall keep Buyer fully and
timely informed with respect to any such Tax Proceeding. Buyer shall have the
exclusive authority to represent the Company with respect to any Tax
Proceeding for all Post-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods; provided,
however, that the Buyer shall allow the Sellers and its counsel to participate
in any such Tax Proceeding in a Straddle Period to the extent such Tax
Proceeding relates to any Tax or Tax Benefit for the Sellers account; and
provided further, that if the Buyer enters into any settlement of any contest
or otherwise compromises any such Tax or Tax Benefit for the Sellers account
in connection with such Tax Proceeding without the prior written consent of
the Sellers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, (a) any additional Losses arising as a direct result of
such settlement or compromise shall not be subject to indemnification by the
Sellers pursuant to this Agreement under Section 11 or otherwise and (b) any
Tax Benefit foregone as a direct result of such settlement or compromise shall
be treated as having been realized by the Buyer for Sellers account. The
Buyer shall keep the Sellers fully and timely informed with respect to any
such Tax Proceeding.

12.7. _Transfer Taxes._ All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other similar transfer Taxes, and all conveyance fees,
recording charges and other similar fees and charges (including any penalties
and interest) incurred in connection with the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions shall be borne by the Buyer and the Seller equally; provided,
however, that any such Taxes, fees and charges incurred in connection with
any financing of the Buyer shall be paid solely by the Buyer. The Party
required by applicable Legal Requirements shall file all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges, and,
if required by applicable Legal Requirements, the other Party shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of such Tax Returns and
other documentation.

12.8. _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements._ All Tax sharing agreements or
similar agreements (other than this Agreement) between the Company and any
Person that is not the Company shall be terminated as of the Closing Date,
and there

 



 

- 57 \-  will be no Liability of the Buyer or the Company under any such agreement
following the Closing Date.

12.9. _Noncompetition._ For Tax purposes, no portion of the Purchase Price (or
other applicable amounts) shall be treated as consideration for the
noncompetition agreement referenced in  _Section 13.6_.

SECTION 13. _OTHER POST-CLOSING COVENANTS_

 

13.1. _Transaction Costs._ Except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, each
Party shall bear and pay all of its Transaction Costs. The Company will pay
the Transaction Costs of the Sellers and the Seller Representative. The Buyer
will pay the HSR Act filing fee. In the event of termination of this
Agreement, the obligation of each Party to pay its own Transaction Costs will
be subject to any rights of such party arising from a breach of this Agreement
by another party.

13.2.  _Confidentiality._ The Parties will maintain in confidence, and will
cause their Representatives to maintain in confidence, and not use to the
detriment of another Party any written, oral or other information obtained in
confidence from another Party in connection with this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions, unless (a) such information is already known to
such Party or to others not bound by a duty of confidentiality or such
information becomes publicly available through no fault of such Party, (b)
the use of such information is necessary or appropriate in making any filing
or obtaining any consent or approval required for the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions, or (c) the furnishing or use of such information
is required pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement or Proceeding. If the
Contemplated Transactions are not consummated, each Party will return or
destroy as much of such written information as any other Party may reasonably
request.

13.3. _Further Assurances._ Each Party agrees (a) to furnish upon request to
any other Party such further information, (b) to execute and deliver to any
other Party such other documents, and (c) to do such other acts and things,
all as any other Party may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out
the intent of this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions and the
agreements and documents referred to herein.

13.4. _Public Announcements._ Except as otherwise expressly provided by this
Agreement, no Party shall issue, and each shall prevent its respective
Affiliates from issuing, any press releases or other public statements with
respect to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions; provided,
however, that either the Company or the Buyer (and their Affiliates) may,
without such approval, make such press releases or other public announcement
as such Party believes are required pursuant to any applicable Legal
Requirements, in which case the Party that is (or whose Affiliate is) required
to make the release or announcement shall allow the other Party reasonable
time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance; provided, further, that a Party or its Affiliates may make internal
announcements to the

 



 

- 58 \-  employees of such Party or its Affiliates that are consistent with the
Parties prior public disclosures regarding the Contemplated Transactions.

 

13.5. _Employees and Employee Matters._ Immediately following the Closing Date
the Company shall, and the Buyer shall cause each Company to, continue to
employ each employee of the Company on an at-will basis (the employees
remaining employed by the Company shall be referred to collectively as "
_Continued Employees_ "). The Company shall provide each Continued Employee
with the same, or a substantially similar position, at the same, or a
substantially similar salary, and on the same, or substantially the same,
terms and conditions as was provided to the Continued Employee immediately
prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall be liable for all severance or
other benefits that employees become entitled to receive pursuant to
employment policies, plans and/or agreements of the Company.

 

 _13.6. Noncompetition._

(a) For a period of five years after the Closing Date (the " _Restriction
Period_ "), each Seller covenants that such Seller shall not, and will cause
such Sellers Affiliates to not, anywhere in the world, directly or
indirectly invest in, own, manage, operate, finance, control, advise, render
services to, guarantee the obligations of, or be employed by any Person (other
than the Company) whose primary business is the design, manufacture,
distribution and sale of products or services related to communications
intercept receivers, provided however, that for purposes of this _Section
13.6_, such Seller may purchase or otherwise acquire up to (but not
more than) five percent of any class of the securities of any Person (but may
not otherwise participate in the activities of such Person) if such securities
are listed on any national securities exchange or have been registered under
Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.

(b) During the Restriction Period, each Seller covenants that it will not (i)
solicit or otherwise induce any employee of the Company to leave the employ of
the Company or (ii) hire, directly or indirectly, any person who was an
employee of the Company, unless such person has approached the Seller without
any solicitation or inducement (other than newspaper or online advertisements
not specifically directed at employees of the Company) by the Seller.

(c) If a final judgment of a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction
determines that any term or provision contained in this _Section 13.6_ is
invalid or unenforceable, then the parties agree that the court or tribunal
will have the power to reduce the scope, duration or geographic area of the
term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace any
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is
valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision. This _Section 13.6_ will be
enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which
the judgment may be appealed. This _Section 13.6_

 



 

- 59 \- __is reasonable and necessary to protect and preserve Buyer s legitimate
business interests and the value of the Company and to prevent any unfair
advantage conferred on the Sellers.

(d) Each of the Sellers acknowledges that it has had access to confidential
and proprietary information with respect to the Company, its Products and
business and that the Company and the Buyer would be materially damaged if the
Sellers were to disclose such information to third parties that were not
authorized to receive such information. Accordingly, each of the Sellers
agrees and covenants that following the Closing it will continue to maintain
the confidentiality of the Companys proprietary and confidential information
in a manner consistent with the terms of the confidentiality agreement
attached to the Companys employee manual as the same exists as of the date of
this Agreement.

 

13.7. _Records Retention and Access._

 

(a) For four years after the Closing Date, the Parties agree that, with
respect to any books, records and files, including Tax Records, relating to
the Company that are delivered to the control of the Buyer or its Affiliates
pursuant to this Agreement or that are retained by the Company or the Sellers
or their Affiliates following Closing (collectively " _Business Records_ "),
each such Person shall have the right upon prior written notice to inspect and
make copies of the same at any time during normal business hours for any
proper purpose. Each Party shall undertake reasonable measures to (a)
preserve the Business Records in its or its Affiliates possession in good
order to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements, and (b) not
destroy or allow the destruction of any such Business Records without first
offering in writing to deliver them to the other Party. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each Party shall retain until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations (including any extensions
thereof) complete copies of all Tax Returns relating to the Company,
supporting work schedules and other records or information that are relevant
to such Tax Returns (collectively, " _Tax Records_ ") delivered to such Party
or retained by such Party pursuant to this Agreement for all Tax periods or
portions thereof ending before or including the Effective Time.

(b) Nothing in _Section 13.5_ shall require the Sellers or the Buyer to
provide access to or disclosure of any information or documents (i) relating
to the Sellers or the Buyers assets or activities other than the assets and
activities of either the Company, or (ii) to the extent such access and
disclosure would (A) violate any applicable Legal Requirements, (B) violate
the terms of any Contract to which the disclosing Person or any of its
Affiliates is bound, or (C) impair any attorney-client, work-product or
similar privilege of the disclosing Person.

(c) Any information or Business Records provided pursuant to _Section 12.5_
or _Section 13.5_ shall be kept confidential by the Person receiving the 

 



 

- 60 \-  information or documents, except as may otherwise be necessary in connection
with the filing of Tax Returns or in connection with any Tax Proceeding or as
otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements.

that Buyer, in its sole discretion, may deem necessary or appropriate with
respect to such compliance failures, fiduciary violations and/or prohibited
transactions. The Sellers indemnification obligations under this _Section
13.8_ (a) shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the Sellers
indemnification obligations under _Section 11, (b)_ shall not be subject to

Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no delay or omission on
the part of

 



 

- 62 \-  any Party in exercising any right or privilege under this Agreement shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any Party of
any right or privilege under this Agreement operate as a waiver of any other
right or privilege under this Agreement nor shall any single or partial

thereof or the exercise of any other right or privilege under this Agreement.

14.3. _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement (a) constitutes the entire agreement
between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and (b)
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral,
between the Parties with respect to such subject matter; provided, however,
that the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery
of this Agreement. Except for the express representations and warranties of
the Parties contained in _Section 3_, _Section 4_ and _Section 5_, or
contained in any of the Closing Documents, no Party has made or is making,
and no Party has relied upon, any representation or warranty whatsoever,
express or implied, including any implied representation or warranty as to
condition, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability or suitability.
Except as otherwise expressly specified in this Agreement, any cost estimates,
projections, predictions, data, financial information, memoranda, offering
materials, presentations or other information provided to any Party or any
other Person are not and shall not be deemed to be or to include
representations or warranties of any Person.

 

14.4. _Amendments._ Except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, this
Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented except by an agreement
in writing signed by both Parties.

14.5. _Assignment; Binding Effect._ No Party may assign or transfer this
Agreement or any of its rights, obligations or interests under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other Parties; provided however, that
the Buyer will be permitted to assign its rights and obligations under

Party. In the event of such an assignment, the Buyer will provide notice to
the other Parties hereto. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure
to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

14.6. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement shall not benefit, or
create any legal, equitable or other right, remedy or claim in or on behalf
of, any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

 

14.7. _Specific Performance._ Each Party acknowledges and agrees that any
breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement would cause
irreparable injury to the other Party for which the other Party would have no
adequate remedy at law. In addition to any other remedy to which either Party
may be entitled, but in the case of any monetary remedies, subject to the
applicable limitations of _Section 11.10_, each Party agrees that temporary
and permanent injunctive and other

 



 

- 63 \-  equitable relief and specific performance may be granted in any Proceeding
brought to enforce any provision of this Agreement.

 

14.8. _Attorney s Fees and Expenses._ If any Proceeding is brought by any
Party against any other Party to enforce any provision of this Agreement, the
prevailing Party in such Proceeding shall be entitled to recover from the
other Party all reasonable attorneys fees and other reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by the prevailing Party in connection therewith.

14.9. _Disclosure Schedules._

 

(a) The numbering and references in the Sections of the Disclosure Schedules
that correspond to Sections of this Agreement are for convenience only and do
not limit the disclosure concerning such referenced Sections. Matters
expressly set forth in any Section of a Disclosure Schedule are deemed to be
set forth and disclosed in all other Sections of such Disclosure Schedule or,
if no Section of such Disclosure Schedule exists with respect to a particular
representation or warranty, shall be deemed to be disclosed in such Disclosure
Schedule with respect to such particular representation or warranty, in
either case (i) to the extent this Agreement requires such disclosure and
(ii) to the extent (and only to the extent) that the relationship of such
disclosure to such other Section of such Disclosure Schedules or particular
representation or warranty is reasonably apparent on the face of such first
Section.

(b) Between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Closing and the
date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1_, if a
Party becomes aware of the occurrence after the date of this Agreement of any
fact or condition that would (except as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement) cause or constitute a breach of any such representation or warranty
had such representation or warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or
discovery of such fact or condition, such Party shall promptly notify the
other Parties in writing. If any such fact or condition would require any
change in the applicable Disclosure Schedule delivered by the notifying Party
if such Disclosure Schedule was dated the date of the occurrence or discovery
of any such fact or condition, such Party shall promptly deliver to the other
Parties an amendment or supplement to such Disclosure Schedule specifying such
change. No such disclosure notification, amendment or supplement delivered by
any Party pursuant to this  _Section 14.9(b)_ shall be given effect for any
purpose prior to consummation of the Closing, including for purposes of (a)
determining whether the Closing conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ or
_Section 9.1_ have been satisfied, or (b) _Section 10_. Once the Closing
has been consummated, any disclosure notification, amendment or supplement
delivered by any Party pursuant to this _Section 14.9(b)_ at or prior to the
Closing shall be deemed to constitute a part of the Disclosure Schedule of
such Party and as permitted exceptions to the representations and warranties
of such Party set forth in this Agreement, effective from and after the date
of this Agreement.

 



 

- 64 \- 14.10. _Severability._ Any provision of this Agreement which is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity or unenforceability without invalidating or rendering
unenforceable any of the remaining provisions hereof, and any such invalidity
or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

14.11. _Governing Law._ THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH,
AND THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, THE SUBSTANTIVE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CONFLICTS-OF-LAW RULES
THAT MAY REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.

14.12. _Venue._ Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of or based
upon this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions may be instituted in the
federal courts of the United States of America or the courts of the State of
Texas, in each case located in the City of Dallas (collectively, the "
_Specified Courts_ "), and each. Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction (except for proceedings instituted in regard to the enforcement
of a judgment of any such court, as to which such jurisdiction is non-
exclusive) of such courts in any such suit, action or proceeding. The Parties
irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of
any suit, action or other proceeding in the Specified Courts and irrevocably
and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such suit, action or other proceeding brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum.

 

14.13. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed and delivered in
multiple counterparts (including through the transmission of signature pages
by facsimile or electronic mail, each of which shall constitute an original
for all purposes), all of which, when taken together, shall constitute one and
the same instrument.

 

14.14. _Waiver of Jury Trial._ EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER AGREEMENTS AND
DOCUMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY
PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF
AND THEREOF.

14.15. _Negotiation and Drafting._ Both Parties have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the other agreements and
documents delivered in connection with this Agreement. Any rule of
construction or interpretation otherwise requiring this Agreement or any of
such other agreements and documents to be construed or interpreted against
any Person by virtue of the authorship of this Agreement or any of such other
agreements and documents shall not apply to the construction and
interpretation hereof or thereof.
