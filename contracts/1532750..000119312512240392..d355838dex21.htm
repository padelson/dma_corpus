Section 2.1 _Merger Consideration._

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Merger Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Atlas, Titan or
any holder of Titan Class A Units or Titan Class B Units:

 

(i) All the limited liability company interests in MergerCo outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be converted into and
become a 100% limited liability company interest in Titan, and Atlas Energy
Holdings Operating Company, LLC, as the holder of such limited liability
company interests, shall be admitted as the sole member of Titan. 

 



3 (ii) Each Titan Class A Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time shall be converted into a right to receive (subject to
_Section 2.5_ with respect to the Escrowed Units): (A) a number of Atlas
Units equal to the product of (x) the number of Atlas Units included in the
Merger Consideration _multiplied_ by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is
one and the denominator of which is the total number of Titan Class A Units
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (the "
_Fraction_ "), which Atlas Units shall be duly authorized and validly issued
in accordance with applicable Laws and the Atlas Partnership Agreement, fully
paid (to the extent required under the Atlas Partnership Agreement) and non-
assessable (such Atlas Units described in this clause (a)(ii) (including the
Escrowed Units) shall be referred to herein as the " _New Units_ "); and (B) a
portion of the Cash Consideration equal to the product of (x) the Cash
Consideration ( _less_ the Allocated Administrative Portion) _multiplied_ by
(y) the Fraction. Each Titan Class B Unit and all other equity interests (if
any) of Titan issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and no equity
interests of Titan (other than Titan Class A Units) shall be converted into
any right to receive any Atlas Units or other consideration.

 

(iii) All the Titan Class A Units, when converted in the Merger, shall cease
to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. At
the Merger Effective Time, each holder of Titan Class A Units shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive (A) its Pro
Rata Share of the Merger Consideration ( _less_ such holders Pro Rata Share
of the Allocated Administrative Portion of the Cash Consideration and _less_
such holders Pro Rata Share of the Escrowed Units) and (B) any cash to be
paid in lieu of any fractional New Units in accordance with _Section
2.3(d)_, in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefore in
accordance with _Section 2.3_.

(b) All payments, deposits and deliveries of funds pursuant to this _Section
2.1_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to
the wire transfer instructions provided by Titan no later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

Section 2.2 _Rights as Unitholders; Unit Transfers_. At the Merger Effective
Time, holders of Titan Class A Units, Titan Class B Units and all other equity
interests in Titan shall cease to be unitholders of Titan and shall have no
right as unitholders of Titan other than the right to receive the
consideration provided under this _Article 2_. After the Merger Effective
Time, there shall be no transfers on the unit transfer books of Titan with
respect to the Titan Class A Units, Titan Class B Units or any other equity
interests of Titan.

Section 2.3 _Exchange of Certificates._

 

(a) _Exchange Procedures_. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, Atlas shall
deliver to each record holder of Titan Class A Units a letter of transmittal
instructions in the form attached hereto as _Annex E_ for use in effecting the
surrender of the Titan Class A Units held by the holders thereof. At and after
the Merger Effective Time, upon the delivery of such letters of

 



4  transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents
as may be required pursuant to such instructions, each holder of Titan Class A
Units shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) New Units
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of New Units that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article 2_ (after taking into
account all Titan Class A Units then held by such holder) _less_ such
holders Pro Rata Share of the Escrowed Units and (ii) a check in the amount
equal to the aggregate amount of cash that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to this _Article 2_ , including cash payable in lieu of any
fractional New Units pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_ and distributions pursuant
to _Section 2.3(b)_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration or on any unpaid distributions payable to holders of Titan
Class A Units. Until the required documentation has been delivered, each Titan
Class A Unit shall be deemed at any time after the Merger Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender such holders Pro
Rata Share of the Merger Consideration ( _less_ the Cash Consideration) _less_
such holders Pro Rata Share of the Escrowed Units, payable in respect of such
Titan Class A Unit and any distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_.

(b) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Titan Class A Units_. No
distributions declared or made with respect to Atlas Common Units with a
record date after the Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
Titan Class A Units with respect to the New Units that such holder would be
entitled to receive in accordance herewith, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional New Units shall be paid to any such holder until such holder shall
deliver the required documentation and surrender such Titan Class A Units as
contemplated by this _Section 2.3_. Subject to applicable Law, following
compliance with the requirements of _Section 2.3(a)_, there shall be paid to
such holder of the New Units issuable in exchange therefor, without interest,
promptly after the time of such compliance, (i) the amount of any cash payable
in lieu of fractional New Units to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.3(d)_ and (ii) the amount of distributions that such holder would
have received from Atlas (or the Surviving Entity) from and after the Merger
Effective Time and prior to the date on which the New Units are issued to such
holder if such holder had held such New Units as of the Merger Effective
Time. 

(c) _Further Rights in Titan Units_. The Merger Consideration issued upon
conversion of a Titan Class A Unit in accordance with the terms hereof
(including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_ or _(d)_ ) shall be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Titan Class A Unit.

 

(d) _Fractional New Units_. No certificates or scrip of the New Units
representing fractional New Units or book entry credit of the same shall be
issued upon the exchange of Titan Class A Units in accordance with _Section
2.3(a)_, and such fractional interests will not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to have any rights as a holder of any New Units. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Titan Class A Units
exchanged in the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a New Unit (after taking into account all Titan Class A
Units exchanged by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest rounded up to the nearest whole cent) in an amount equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) the Execution Date Unit Price by (ii) the
fraction of a New Unit that such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to this _Article 2_. As promptly as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of 

 



5  fractional interests, Atlas shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to,
forward payments to such holders of a right to receive a fraction of a New
Unit subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.

(e) _Withholding_. Each of Atlas and the Surviving Entity shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Titan Class A Units such amounts as Atlas and the
Surviving Entity are required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of
such payment; _provided_ , _however_ , that Atlas or the Surviving Entity, as
the case may be, shall provide notice to the applicable holders of Titan Class
A Units prior to withholding any amounts pursuant to this _Section 2.3(e)_.
To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Atlas or the
Surviving Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Titan Class A Units in respect
of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Atlas or the Surviving
Entity, as the case may be.

(f) _Book Entry and Admission of Holders of New Units as Additional Limited
Partners of Atlas_. Upon the issuance of New Units to each holder of Titan
Class A Units in accordance with this  _Section 2.3_ and the compliance by
such holder with the requirements of Section 10.1 of the Atlas Partnership
Agreement, Atlas Resource Partners GP, LLC shall consent to the admission of
such holder as a limited partner of Atlas and reflect such admission on the
books and records of Atlas.

Section 2.4 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event of any subdivisions,
reclassifications, recapitalizations, splits, combinations or distributions in
the form of equity interests with respect to the Atlas Units, (a) the number
of New Units to be issued in the Merger and the cash payments determined in
accordance with _Section 2.3(d)_ will be correspondingly adjusted and (b) the
number of Escrowed Units placed into escrow and/or to be released to Atlas or
Representative (on behalf of the Original New Unit Holders) pursuant to this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement will be adjusted accordingly.

Section 2.5 _Escrowed Units and Cash Consideration_. The Escrowed Units (or
the applicable portion thereof) shall be released by the Escrow Agent after
Closing to the holders of the New Units (or their respective assignees or
designees) or Atlas, as the case may be, as provided in this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement. Until the Escrowed Units are released from escrow to the
holders of the New Units (or their respective assignees or designees) or Atlas
in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, all distributions
declared or made with respect to the Escrowed Units with a record date after
Closing but prior to the date of such release shall be paid to Representative
on behalf of the holders of the New Units at the time of payment of
such distributions as provided in the Escrow Agreement. The Allocated
Administrative Portion will be held, used and disbursed by Representative as
provided in _Section 12.14_.

 



6 Section 2.6 _Adjustments to the Merger Consideration_. The Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted as of the Closing by the Adjustment Amount
pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_ and, after the Closing, pursuant to _Section
2.7(b)_, but only with respect to matters identified in the Closing Settlement
Statement, the Post-Closing Settlement Statement or an Adjustment Notice, in
accordance with this _Section 2.6_. For purposes of this Agreement and for
determining the Merger Consideration, the " _Adjustment Amount_ " shall mean
an amount, which may be positive or negative, equal to:

(a) (i) the amount of cash or cash equivalents of Titan distributed or paid

Section 2.7 _Closing and Post-Closing Merger Consideration Adjustments_.

 

(a) Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Titan
shall prepare and deliver to Atlas a settlement statement (the " _Closing
Settlement Statement_ ") calculating the amount equal to the Merger
Consideration as adjusted to give effect to Titans good faith estimate of the
Adjustment Amount calculated in accordance with  _Section 2.6_ (or, if then
determinable, the final amounts thereof). Atlas shall have three (3) Business
Days to review the Closing Settlement Statement from Atlass receipt thereof.
On the day following expiration of such three (3) Business Day review period,
Atlas shall submit a written report containing any changes Atlas proposes to
be made to the Closing Settlement Statement. Titan and Atlas shall agree on a
final Closing Settlement Statement no later than one (1) Business Day prior
to Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , if Titan and Atlas are unable to agree,
then, subject to _Section 2.7(b)_, Titans determination shall be used for
purposes of the Merger Consideration to be delivered at the Closing. The
calculation delivered by Titan in accordance with this _Section 2.7(a)_, as
adjusted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, if applicable,
shall constitute the Merger Consideration for purposes of Closing.

 



7 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing but not later than the
last to occur of (i) the sixtieth (60th) day following the Closing Date, (ii)
the day on which all Title Defects and Title Defect Amounts have been finally
determined in accordance with _Section 8.2(g)_ and (iii) the day on which
all Environmental Conditions and Remediation Amounts have been finally
determined in accordance with _Section 9.1(g)_, Atlas shall prepare and
deliver to Representative a draft statement (the " _Post-Closing
Settlement Statement_ ") setting forth the final calculation of the Merger
Consideration taking into account any adjustments pursuant to _Section 2.6_,
any Title Defects finally resolved pursuant to _Section 8.2(g)_ after the
Closing and any Environmental Condition finally resolved pursuant to _Section
9.1(g)_ after the Closing. As soon as reasonably practicable but not later
than the fifteenth (15th) Business Day following receipt of Atlass
statement hereunder, Representative shall deliver to Atlas a written report
(an " _Adjustment Notice_ ") containing any changes Representative proposes be
made in such statement with respect to the calculation of the Adjustment
Amount. Representative shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed (on behalf
of the holders of the New Units) to all items in the Post-Closing Settlement
Statement other than such matters that are proposed to be changed in the
Adjustment Notice with respect to the Adjustment Amount. The parties shall
undertake to agree on the final Merger Consideration no later than five (5)
Business Days after delivery of the Adjustment Notice. If the final Merger
Consideration is:

 

(i) mutually agreed upon in writing by Representative and Atlas during such
five (5) Business Day period, the final Merger Consideration shall be
conclusive and binding on the parties; or

(ii) not mutually agreed upon by Representative and Atlas during such five
(5) Business Day period, then Ernst and Young LLP (the " _Dispute Auditor_ ")
shall resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculation of the
Adjustment Amount. Should Ernst and Young LLP fail or refuse to agree to serve
as Dispute Auditor within five (5) days after written request from any party
to serve, and the parties fail to agree in writing on a replacement Dispute
Auditor within five (5) days after the end of that five (5) day period, or
should no replacement Dispute Auditor agree to serve within ten (10) days
after the original written request pursuant to this sentence, the Dispute
Auditor shall be appointed by the Dallas, Texas office of the American
Arbitration Association. In connection with the engagement of the Dispute
Auditor, each of Representative and Atlas shall execute such engagement,
indemnity and other agreements as the Dispute Auditor shall require as a
condition to such engagement. The Dispute Auditor shall determine as promptly
as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days after the selection
of the Dispute Auditor, based solely on written submissions provided by Atlas
and Representative to the Dispute Auditor (and without independent
investigation on the part of the Dispute Auditor) within ten (10) days
following the Dispute Auditors selection, whether and to what extent (if any)
the Adjustment Amount set forth in the Post-Closing Settlement Statement
requires adjustment. In resolving any disputed item, the Dispute Auditor shall
act as an expert and not an arbitrator, and shall resolve only the items set
forth in the Adjustment Notice that are still in dispute and may not assign a
value to any item greater than the highest value for such item claimed by
either party or less than the lowest value for such item claimed by either
party. Each of Representative and Atlas shall bear one-half of the costs and
expenses of the Dispute Auditor. The determination of the Dispute Auditor
shall be final, conclusive and binding on Atlas and Representative (on behalf
of the holders of the New Units). The date on which the final
Merger Consideration is finally determined in accordance with this _Section
2.7(b)_ is referred to as the " _Determination Date_."

 



8 (c) Any difference in the Merger Consideration delivered at Closing as
determined pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_ and the final Merger Consideration
as determined pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)_ shall be settled by the owing
party to the owed party within five (5) Business Days of the Determination
Date through the delivery of a number of Atlas Units (consisting of an equal
number of Atlas Common Units and Atlas Preferred Units) with a value
(determined based on the Execution Date Unit Price) equal to such difference.
The obligation, if any, under this  _Section 2.7(c)_ to deliver Atlas Units
to Atlas shall be satisfied solely out of the General Escrow Units then held
in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

covenant to the extent specified therein, _provided_ that any disclosure set

in reference to all other applicable sections of this Agreement if the

(a) Each holder of the Titan Class A Units is acquiring the Atlas Units for

intention of distributing the Atlas Units or any part thereof, and such holder
has no present intention of selling or granting any participation in or
otherwise distributing the same in any transaction in violation of
the securities Laws of the United States of America or any state, without
prejudice, however, to such holders right at all times to sell or otherwise
dispose of all or any part of the Atlas Units under a registration statement
under the Securities Act and applicable state securities Laws or under an
exemption from such registration available thereunder (including, if
available, Rule 144 promulgated thereunder). If such holder should in the
future decide to dispose of any of the Atlas Units, such holder understands
and agrees that it may do so only (i)(A) in compliance with the Securities Act
and applicable state securities Law, as then in effect, or pursuant to an
exemption therefrom (including Rule 144 under the Securities Act) or (B) in
the manner contemplated by any registration statement pursuant to which such
securities are being offered, and (ii) if no stop-transfer instructions to
that effect will be in effect with respect to such securities.

 

(b) Such holder (i) is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501
of Regulation D promulgated by the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act and is
sophisticated in the evaluation, purchase, ownership and operation of oil and
gas properties and related facilities and (ii) by reason of its business and
financial experience it has such knowledge, sophistication and experience in
business and financial matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits
and risks of the prospective investment in the Atlas Units, is able to bear
the economic risk of such 

 



20  investment and, at the present time, would be able to afford a complete loss
of such investment. In making its decision to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transaction contemplated herein, such holder, except to the
extent of Atlass representations in this Agreement, (A) has relied or shall
rely solely on its own independent investigation and evaluation of Atlas and
its assets and the advice of its own legal, tax, economic, environmental,
engineering, geological and geophysical advisors and the express provisions of
this Agreement and not on any comments, statements, projections or other
materials made or given by any representatives, consultants or
advisors engaged by Atlas and (B) has undertaken such due diligence
pertaining to Atlas and its assets as such holder deems adequate.

(c) Such holder acknowledges that it has (a) had access to the Atlas SEC
Documents, (b) had access to information regarding the Merger and its
potential effect on Atlass operations and financial results and (c) been
provided a reasonable opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from
representatives of Atlas regarding such matters.

(d) Such holder understands that the Atlas Units it is acquiring hereunder are
characterized as "restricted securities" under the federal securities Laws
inasmuch as they are being acquired from Atlas in a transaction not involving
a public offering and that under such Laws and applicable regulations such
securities may be resold without registration under the Securities Act only in
certain limited circumstances. In connection with the foregoing, such holder
represents that it is knowledgeable with respect to Rule 144 of the Commission
promulgated under the Securities Act.

(e) The Atlas Units shall not be evidenced by physical certificates. If any
physical certificates are issued, it is understood that the certificates
evidencing the Atlas Units initially will bear the following legend:

"These securities have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended. These securities may not be sold, offered for sale, pledged
(except in connection with a bona fide margin account or other loan or
financing arrangement secured by these securities) or hypothecated in the
absence of a registration statement in effect with respect to the securities
under such Act or pursuant to an exemption from registration thereunder and,
in the case of a transaction exempt from registration, unless sold pursuant to
Rule 144 under such Act or the issuer has received documentation reasonably
satisfactory to it that such transaction does not require registration under
such Act." For the avoidance of doubt, the Atlas Units may be pledged in
connection with a bona fide margin account or other loan or financing
arrangement secured by such Atlas Units and such pledge shall not be deemed
to be a transfer, sale or assignment of such Atlas Units, and no buyer
effecting such a pledge shall be required to provide Atlas with any notice
thereof or otherwise make any delivery to Atlas pursuant to this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document."

constitute an amendment to any employee benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement, and any covenant or undertaking that suggests that an employee

deliver, or shall cause to be delivered, to Atlas evidence that Titan has
paid or caused to be paid the principal amount of all Indebtedness owing by

Bank, N.A. _et al_., all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all
prepayment penalties, premiums, fees and other similar costs and expenses due
and owing in connection with the repayment of such Indebtedness (the "
_Closing Debt Amount_ ").

conditions provided herein, each of Atlas and Titan agrees to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and
to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or

Consideration Allocation will be allocated in a manner that is consistent with
the relative reserve valuations ascribed to the applicable Titan Assets. If
within fifteen (15) days after the date of the delivery of the Merger
Consideration Allocation to Representative, Representative notifies Atlas in

 



30  writing that Representative objects to the allocation set forth in the

commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute within twenty (20)
days. In the event that Atlas and Representative are unable to resolve such
dispute within twenty (20) days, Atlas and Representative shall jointly retain

notice (to the extent Titan has actual knowledge without any duty of inquiry)

remedy, the occurrence or failure to occur, or the impending or threatened
occurrence or failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure to
occur would be reasonably likely to cause the failure of any of the conditions
set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _(b)_ ;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.8_ shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice. Atlas agrees to give prompt notice (to the extent Atlas has actual
knowledge without any duty of inquiry) to Titan, and to use commercially
reasonable efforts to prevent or promptly remedy, the occurrence or failure to
occur, or the impending or threatened occurrence or failure to occur, of any

attorneys fees and other professionals fees and expenses), fines,
liabilities or judgments (or amounts that are paid in settlement with the
prior written approval of Atlas or the Surviving Entity), arising out of or
relating to acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such, which acts
or omissions occurred at or prior to the Merger Effective Time, in each case
as and to the fullest extent permitted under (i) the Texas Act and (ii) the
terms of the Amended and Restated Titan Operating Agreement (in all cases
notwithstanding whether any such provisions are mandatory or permissive). In
determining whether an Indemnified Titan Party is entitled to indemnification
under this _Section 6.9_, if requested by such Indemnified Titan Party, such
determination shall be made by special, independent counsel selected by the
Surviving Entity

 



31  and approved by the Indemnified Titan Party (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld) and who has not otherwise performed services for the
Surviving Entity or its affiliates within the last three (3) years (other
than in connection with such matters).

(b) Prior to Closing, Titan shall obtain, and pre-pay all premiums under, a
directors and officers liability tail insurance policy effective for a

policy.

exculpation provisions in the Amended and Restated Titan Operating Agreement
in a manner inconsistent with this _Section 6.9_ or otherwise adverse to the

to afford the officers, employees and agents of Atlas, at the sole cost and
risk of Atlas, reasonable access at all reasonable times from the date hereof
through the Closing Date to its officers, employees, agents, properties,
facilities, books, records, contracts and other Titan Assets and shall
furnish Atlas all financial, operating and other data and information in
Titans possession as Atlas, through its officers, employees or agents, may
reasonably request (subject to Atlas first entering into a customary
indemnification agreement in favor of Titan before gaining such access).
Atlas, at its sole cost and risk, shall have the right to make such due
diligence investigations as Atlas shall deem necessary or reasonable, upon
reasonable notice to Titan and without disruption or damage to Titans
operations or properties, _provided_ that Atlass right of access shall not
entitle Atlas to operate equipment to conduct any intrusive or other
(including environmental) testing or sampling, and Atlas shall not
operate equipment or conduct intrusive or other (including environmental)
testing or sampling. Atlas shall provide Titan with prior notice before the
books, records and Titan Assets of Titan are accessed pursuant to this
_Section 6.10(a)_, along with a description of the activities Atlas intends
to undertake. All information obtained by Atlas and its representatives under
this _Section 6.10(a)_ shall be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement and any applicable privacy laws regarding personal information

(b) _Section 6.10(a)_ shall not require Titan to permit any access, or to
disclose any information, that in its reasonable, good faith judgment (after
consultation with outside counsel) would reasonably be expected to result in
violation of any Contract to which Titan or any of Titans affiliates is a
party or applicable Laws, or is subject to or would cause any privilege
(including attorney-client privilege) which Titan or any of Titans affiliates
would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to such information
and such undermining of such privilege could in Titans or such affiliates
good faith judgment (after consultation with outside counsel) adversely affect
in any material respect Titans or such affiliates position in any pending,
or what Titan or such affiliates believe in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel) could be future litigation.

 



32 (c) The provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated December 28, 2011,
between Atlas Energy, L.P. and the other parties named therein (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

Section 6.11 _Record Retention_. Representative and Atlas, for the longer of a
period of seven (7) years and as required by Law, following Closing, will, to
the extent that either holds any Records, retain (or, in the case of Atlas,
cause the Surviving Entity to retain) the Records and provide the other party,
its affiliates, and its and their officers, employees, representatives and
agents with reasonable access upon prior notice to the Records (to the extent
that such requesting party has not retained the original or a copy) during
normal business hours for review and copying at such requesting partys
expense; _provided_ that either Atlas or Representative may destroy Records
from time to time and prior to the end of such period in accordance with its
normal document retention policy as long as such party notifies the other
party in writing in advance and provides such other party an opportunity to
copy such Records at such other partys expense.

Section 6.12 _Atlas Common Units and Atlas Preferred Units_. 

(a) Upon issuance in accordance with this Agreement, and assuming the accuracy
of the representations and warranties of Titan set forth in _Article 3_ and
of the holders of the Titan Class A Units in _Section 3.35_, and the
performance by Titan of the covenants contained herein, all Atlas Units issued
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement will be issued in accordance
with all applicable securities Laws and all Atlas Common Units included
therein will be approved for listing on the NYSE subject only to official
notice of issuance.

 

(b) Atlas and Titan acknowledge and agree that the New Units have not been
registered under the Securities Act or the securities Laws of any state and
the New Units may be sold or disposed of only in one or more transactions
registered under the Securities Act and applicable state securities Laws or as
to which an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act
and applicable state securities Laws is available. No Person has any right to
require Atlas to cause the registration of any of the New Units issued
pursuant to this Agreement except as expressly set forth in the Registration
Rights Agreement. 

(c) Neither Atlas nor any authorized representative acting on its behalf has
taken or will take any action that would cause the loss of exemption of the
issuance of the New Units from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act. Without limiting the foregoing, neither Atlas nor any of its Subsidiaries
has, directly or indirectly through any agent, sold, offered for sale,
solicited offers to buy or otherwise negotiated in respect of, any "security"
(as defined in the Securities Act) that is or will be integrated with the sale
of the New Units in a manner that would require registration under
the Securities Act.

(d) Atlas and Titan acknowledge and agree that it is the intention of Titan
that the New Units issued pursuant to this Agreement as the Merger
Consideration be issued to the holders of the Titan Class A Units, and Atlas
hereby agrees to reasonably cooperate with Titan to facilitate any such
issuance or transfer in a manner consistent with applicable Law, subject in
all cases to such arrangements in connection therewith being satisfactory to
Atlas.

to be performed or observed prior to or on the Closing Date that have not been
so performed or observed in any material respect, shall be considered not to
have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement to the extent that any such
breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement is (if curable)
cured by the Closing.

(d) _Deliveries_. Atlas shall have delivered, or caused to be delivered, to
Titan or the other applicable Persons, the items required by _Section
1.3(a)_, and such documents, agreements and other instruments delivered
thereto shall be in full force and effect.

(e) _NYSE Listing_. The NYSE shall have approved the supplemental listing
application with respect to the Atlas Common Units issued in accordance with
this Agreement (including the Atlas Common Units issuable upon conversion of
the Atlas Preferred Units included as Merger Consideration), and Atlas shall
have delivered to the holders of the Titan Class A Units a copy of such
supplemental listing application countersigned by the NYSE and no notice of
delisting from the NYSE shall have been received by Atlas with respect to the
Atlas Common Units and Representative (on behalf of the holders of the New
Units) shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Atlas by an
executive officer of Atlas to such effect.

ARTICLE 8

TITLE MATTERS; CASUALTIES; TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

Section 8.1  _Titan s Title; General Disclaimer of Title Warranties and
Representations_. Without limiting Atlass remedies for Title Defects set
forth in this _Article 8_ or the Escrow Agreement, neither Titan nor any
other Person makes any warranty or representation, express, implied,
statutory or otherwise, with respect to Titans title to any of the
Properties, and Atlas hereby acknowledges and agrees that Atlass sole and
exclusive remedy for any defect of title, including any Title Defect, with
respect to any of the Properties before or after the Claim Date shall be,
except for the Unsubordinated Lien Title Defects which are the subject of
Special Indemnity Claims, as set forth in _Section 8.2_ and the Escrow
Agreement.

Section 8.2 _Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments._

 

(a) _Title Defect Notices_. No later than 60 days after the date of this
Agreement (the " _Claim Date_ "), Atlas must deliver claim notices to Titan
and to Representative meeting the requirements of this _Section 8.2(a)_
(collectively the " _Title Defect Notices_ " and individually a " _Title
Defect Notice_ ") setting forth any matters which, in Atlass reasonable
opinion, constitute Title Defects and which Atlas intends to assert as a Title
Defect pursuant to this _Article 8_. For all purposes of this Agreement and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Atlas shall be deemed to
have waived, and there shall be no liability for, any Title Defect under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement which Atlas fails to assert as a Title
Defect by a Title Defect Notice received by Titan and Representative on or
before the Claim Date. To be effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in
writing, and shall include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defects,
(ii) the Wells and Undrilled Locations affected by the Title Defect (each a "
_Title Defect Property_ ") and (iii) Atlass good faith estimate (which is
non-binding) of the Title

 



36  Defect Amount relating to each Title Defect with respect to each Title
Defect Property (the " _Claimed Defect Amount_ "). To give Titan and
Representative an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects,
Atlas agrees to use reasonable efforts to give Titan and Representative
written notice (which shall not constitute a Title Defect Notice) of all Title
Defects discovered by Atlas on a weekly basis, which notice may be
preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Claim Date and will not
prejudice in any way Atlass ability to assert a Title Defect.

(b) _Right to Cure_. If Atlas provides written notice of a Title Defect, Titan
(prior to Closing) or Representative (after Closing), as the case may be,
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost,
to cure, at any time prior to one hundred and twenty (120) days after the
Closing Date (the " _Cure Period_ ") such Title Defect, and all costs and
expenses associated with curing such Title Defect (including any internal
costs incurred with respect to employees of Atlas or its Affiliates (including
the Surviving Company) to the extent Representative requests in writing any
such Persons to undertake any work in connection therewith and such Person(s)
agrees in writing to undertake such work) shall be borne by Representative
(subject to the obligation of the Original New Unit Holders to reimburse
Representative as provided in _Section 12.14(c)_).

 

(c) _Remedies for Title Defects_.

(i) If, prior to Closing, Atlas and Representative are in agreement with
respect to any Title Defect timely and properly asserted by Atlas in
accordance with _Section 8.2(a)_, then Atlas and Representative may agree in
writing prior to the Closing to reduce the Merger Consideration at the Closing
by including the agreed to Title Defect Amount (subject to the Individual
Title Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible) with respect to such
Title Defect in the Closing Title Defect Amount.

(ii) For all other Title Defects not resolved pursuant to _Section
8.2(c)(i)_, then, subject to Representatives continuing right to dispute the
existence of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Amount asserted by Atlas
and subject to _Section 8.2(g)_, in the event that any Title Defect timely
and properly asserted by Atlas in accordance with _Section 8.2(a)_ is not
waived in writing by Atlas, Representative shall, after Closing, at its sole
discretion, elect to:

 

(A) subject to the Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Aggregate
Deductible, reduce the Merger Consideration by instructing the Escrow Agent
to release to Atlas a number of the then remaining Title Dispute Escrow Units
held in escrow under the Escrow Agreement equal to (A) an amount determined
pursuant to _Sections 8.2(e)_ and _(g)_ as being the value of such Title
Defect Amount divided by (B) the Execution Date Unit Price; or

(B) attempt to cure (in whole or in part) the Title Defect pursuant to
_Section 8.2(b)_;

_provided, however_ , that to the extent any of the foregoing Title Defects
is not cured by the expiration of the Cure Period, clause (ii)(A) in this
_Section 8.2(c)_ shall apply to such Title Defects.

 



37 (d) _Exclusive Remedy_. _Section 8.2(c)_ shall be the exclusive right
and remedy of Atlas with respect to Titans failure to have Defensible Title
or any other title matter with respect to any Well or Undrilled Location.

(e) _Title Defect Amount_. The " _Title Defect Amount_ " resulting from a
Title Defect that is the subject of a Title Defect Notice timely and properly
delivered pursuant to  _Section 8.2(a)_ and that is not waived in writing by
Atlas shall be the amount by which the Allocated Value of the affected Title
Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of such Title Defect
and shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms
and conditions:

(i) if Atlas and Representative agree in writing on the Title Defect Amount
before or after Closing, then that amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 

(ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance (other than a Permitted
Encumbrance) that is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title
Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title
Defect from the Title Defect Property;

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the actual Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest as stated on _Exhibit A_ , then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property and a fraction,
the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest decrease and the
denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in  _Exhibit A_ ,
provided that if the Title Defect does not affect such Title Defect Property
throughout its productive life, the Title Defect Amount determined under this
_Section 8.2(e)(iii)_ shall be reduced to take into account the applicable
time period only;

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation or Encumbrance (other than
a Permitted Encumbrance) upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect
Property of a type not described above, the Title Defect Amount shall be
determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title Defect
Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by the Title
Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of
the Title Defect over the life of the Title Defect Property, the values placed
upon the Title Defect by Atlas and Representative and such other reasonable
factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;

(v) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

 

(vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon
any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Title
Defect Property.

 

(f) _Title Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no
event shall there be any adjustments to the Merger Consideration or other
remedies provided pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise for any individual
Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount does

 



38  not exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold and (ii) in no event shall
there be any adjustments to the Merger Consideration or other remedies
provided to Atlas for any Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount
exceeds the Individual Title Defect Threshold unless (A) the amount of the sum
of (x) the Title Defect Amounts of all such Title Defects that exceed the
Individual Title Defect Threshold, in the aggregate, excluding any Title
Defect Amounts to the extent attributable to Title Defects that are cured by
Titan or Representative, as the case may be, and (y) the Remediation Amounts
of all Environmental Conditions, in the aggregate, excluding any individual
Environmental Condition for which the Remediation Amount does not exceed the
Individual Environmental Threshold and excluding any Environmental Conditions
Remediated by Titan exceeds (B) the Aggregate Deductible, after which
point Atlas shall be entitled to adjustments to the Merger Consideration only
with respect to such Title Defects in excess of the Aggregate Deductible;
_provided_ that the entire Title Defect Amount of Title Defects meeting the
description in clause (x) above and not just the portion in excess of the
Individual Title Defect Threshold shall be counted toward determining whether
the Aggregate Deductible has been met. __ The Parties agree that, subject to
_Section 8.2(e)(v)_, if the same Title Defect affects more than one Well or
Undrilled Location, then the Title Defect Amounts for each Well or Undrilled
Location affected by such Title Defect shall be aggregated for the purposes of
determining whether the Individual Title Defect Threshold has been met with
respect to such Title Defect.

(g) _Title Dispute Resolution_.

 

(i) Prior to the Closing, Titan and Atlas shall attempt to agree on, and after
Closing, Representative and Atlas shall attempt to agree on, all Title
Defects and Title Defect Amounts prior to the end of the Cure Period. If
Representative and Atlas are unable to agree in writing by the end of the Cure
Period, the extent of the existence of the Title Defects and the Title Defect
Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this
_Section 8.2(g)_; _provided, however_ , that arbitration pursuant to this
_Section 8.2(g)_ may be initiated prior to the end of the Cure Period by
written agreement of Atlas and Representative. There shall be a single
arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at least ten (10) years
experience in oil and gas titles involving properties in Texas, as selected
by mutual agreement of Atlas and Representative, within fifteen (15) days
after the end of the Cure Period, and absent such agreement, by the Dallas,
Texas office of the American Arbitration Association (the " _Title Arbitrator_
"). The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Dallas, Texas and shall be
conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the
terms of this  _Section 8.2_. The Title Arbitrators determination of the
existence of a Title Defect and his award of the Title Defect Amount with
respect to a Title Defect shall be made within twenty (20) days after
submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon
Atlas, Representative and the holders of the New Units without right of
appeal. In making his determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by
the rules set forth in this _Article 8_ and, subject to the foregoing, may
consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are
necessary to make a proper determination. The Title Arbitrator, _however_ ,
may not award Atlas, with respect to any Title Defect, a greater Title Defect
Amount than the Claimed Defect Amount claimed by Atlas in the applicable Title
Defect Notice with respect to such Title Defect and notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Title Arbitrators awards are subject to
the limitation on liabilities

 



39  provisions set forth in _Sections 8.2(e)_ and _8.2(f)_. The Title Arbitrator
shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific
disputed Title Defect and Title Defect Amounts submitted by either party and
may not award damages, interest or penalties to Atlas or Representative or to
holders of the New Units with respect to any matter. Representative and Atlas
shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case.
Each of Representative and Atlas shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses
of the Title Arbitrator.

(ii) Within ten (10) days after the Title Arbitrator delivers written notice
to Representative and Atlas of his award of the Title Defect Amount with
respect to a Title Defect, to the extent such Title Defect Amount would
otherwise be required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this _Article 8_ ,
Representative and Atlas shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release to Atlas a
number of Title Dispute Escrow Units then available in escrow equal to (A)
such Title Defect Amount divided by (B) the Execution Date Unit Price.

(iii) If the Title Defect Amount determined by Representative and Atlas in
writing or the Title Arbitrator with respect to any Title Defect is less than
the Claimed Defect Amount claimed by Atlas in the applicable Title Defect
Notice in respect of such Title Defect, then within ten (10) days after the
Title Defect Amount being so determined, Atlas and Representative shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to release to Representative (on behalf of the
Original New Unit Holders) a number of Title Dispute Escrow Units then held
in escrow equal to (A) the amount by which the Claimed Defect Amount claimed
by Atlas in the applicable Title Defect Notice exceeds such determined Title
Defect Amount divided by (B) the Execution Date Unit Price. 

(h) _Recourse Only Against Title Dispute Escrow Units_.

 

(i) Atlas, on behalf of itself and all other Atlas Indemnified Parties,
acknowledges and agrees that the Title Dispute Escrow Units shall be the sole
and exclusive source of funds for satisfaction of all (and no Person shall
under any circumstance have any personal liability or obligation for the
satisfaction of any) Disputed Title Matters, Title Defect Amounts or breach
of _Article 8_. The Title Dispute Escrow Units shall be used solely to satisfy
Disputed Title Matters.

(ii) The aggregate liability to Atlas in connection with all Disputed Title
Matters, Title Defect Amounts or breach of _Article 8_ shall in no event
exceed the Title Dispute Escrow Units then held in escrow under the Escrow
Agreement, and Atlas, on its own behalf and on behalf of each other Atlas
Indemnified Party, hereby covenants forever not to assert, file, prosecute,
commence or institute (or sponsor or facilitate any Person in connection with
the foregoing), any complaint or lawsuit or any legal, equitable, arbitral or
administrative proceeding of any nature, against any Titan Released Party in
connection with or relating to any Disputed Title Matters, Title
Defect Amounts or breach of _Article 8_. Before and after such time as the
Title Dispute Escrow Units are released from escrow, Atlas shall have no
recourse against any Titan Released Party in respect of any Title Defect or
for any unpaid Title Defect Amounts or breach of _Article 8_.

 



40 (iii) If Atlas asserts a claim under this _Article 8_ , Atlas shall, subject
to the limitations on liability hereunder, be entitled to be paid the Title
Defect Amount determined in accordance with _Sections 8.2(e)_ and _8.2(g)_ ,
solely by receiving from the Escrow Agent all or a portion of the
then available Title Dispute Escrow Units (determined using the Execution
Date Unit Price) in an amount equal to such Title Defect Amount as provided in
_Section 8.2(g)_.

 

(iv) All (A) claims in respect of Title Defects and Title Defect Amounts
asserted properly and timely by Atlas in accordance with this Agreement prior
to the Claim Date that become subject to dispute resolution in accordance with
_Section 8.2(g)_ and that are not resolved by the Title Arbitrator or
Representative and Atlas in writing and are not satisfied (through releases
from the escrow of Title Dispute Escrow Units or title curative work
completed) prior to the expiration of the Cure Period and (B) Title Defects
that Representative has elected to attempt to cure pursuant to  _Section
8.2(c)(ii)_ for which Atlas contests the adequacy or completeness of the cure
(or the remaining Title Defect Amount (if any) after taking into account the
curative work) shall be deemed to be " _Pending Title Claims_ " to the extent
and for so long as any Title Dispute Escrow Units remain in escrow pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement. The dollar amount of all Claimed Defect Amounts in
respect of Pending Title Claims are hereinafter collectively referred to as
the " _Pending Title Claim Amount_." On the first (1st) Business Day following
the expiration of the Cure Period, Atlas and Representative shall jointly
execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent written instructions instructing the
Escrow Agent to release and deliver to Representative the then remaining
balance of the Title Dispute Escrow Units held in escrow in excess (with a
value determined using the Execution Date Unit Price) of the (if any) Pending
Title Claim Amount. A number of Title Dispute Escrow Units equal to the
Pending Title Claim Amount divided by the Execution Date Unit Price will
continue to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement until such time as the Pending Title Claims have been fully
resolved and the Escrow Agreement shall be extended accordingly; _provided,
however_ , if the remaining balance of the value (determined using the
Execution Date Unit Price) of the Title Dispute Escrow Units (from time to
time thereafter) exceeds the then remaining Pending Title Claim Amount, then
Atlas and Representative shall promptly notify the Escrow Agent in writing
that the excess amount of Title Dispute Escrow Units shall be released
promptly to Representative (on behalf of the holders of the Original New Unit
Holders).

(v) All Title Defects that Representative has elected to attempt to cure
pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)(ii)(B)_ for which Atlas disputes the adequacy or
completeness of the cure (or the remaining Title Defect Amount (if any) then
applicable after taking into account the curative work) shall be submitted to
the Title Arbitrator for resolution. In making his determination the Title
Arbitrator shall adhere to the applicable rules, procedures, process and
provisions set forth in _Section 8.2(g)_. 

(vi) If, following the Closing but prior to the expiration of the Cure Period,
Representative has cured any Title Defect in whole or in part, then, at the
request of Representative (on behalf of the Original New Unit Holders), but
subject to Atlass rights under _Section 8.2(h)(v)_, Atlas and Representative
shall promptly instruct the Escrow Agent to release to Representative (on
behalf of the Original New Unit Holders) (A)

 



41  where the Title Defect has been cured in full, a number of Title Dispute
Escrow Units equal to (1) the Claimed Defect Amount with respect to such Title
Defect divided by (2) the Execution Date Unit Price and (B) where a Title
Defect has been partially (but not fully) cured and Representative advises
Atlas that Representative has terminated its efforts to fully cure such Title
Defect, a number of Title Dispute Escrow Units as agreed to in writing by
Representative and Atlas or the Title Arbitrator as provided in _Section
8.2(g)(iii)_.

Section 8.3 _Casualty or Condemnation Loss_.

(a) If after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Titan Assets is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent
domain by any Governmental Authority, the Titan Assets or portion thereof
shall be excluded from the definition of Titan Assets to the extent of the
interests affected by the condemnation or right of eminent domain but the
Merger Consideration shall not be reduced as a result thereof.

(b) If any action for condemnation or taking under right of eminent domain is
pending or threatened with respect to any Titan Asset or portion thereof after
the date of this Agreement, but no taking of such Titan Asset or portion
thereof occurs prior to the Closing Date, the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement shall nevertheless close.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the date
of this Agreement, if the Closing occurs, Atlas shall assume all risk of loss
with respect to production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion or
otherwise (including watering out of any Well, collapsed casing or sand
infiltration of any Well) and the depreciation of Personal Property due to
ordinary wear and tear, in each case, with respect to the Titan Assets. 

Section 8.4 _Consents to Assign_. Promptly following the date hereof, and, in
any event, prior to the Closing, Titan shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all consents listed on Section 3.5 of the Titan Disclosure
Schedule that are required to permit the consummation by Titan of the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ , neither party shall
be required to incur any Liability or pay any money in order to be in
compliance with the foregoing covenant.

ARTICLE 9

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

 

Section 9.1 _Environmental Conditions_.

(a) _Assertions of Environmental Conditions_. Atlas must deliver claim notices
to Titan and Representative meeting the requirements of this _Section 9.1(a)_
(collectively the " _Environmental Condition Notices_ " and individually an "
_Environmental Condition Notice_ ") no later than the Claim Date, setting
forth any matters that, in Atlass reasonable opinion, constitute
Environmental Conditions and that Atlas intends to assert as Environmental
Conditions pursuant to this _Section 9.1_. For all purposes of this Agreement
but subject to Atlass remedy for a breach of Titans representation contained
in  _Section 3.17_ and Titans indemnity obligation in _Section 11.2_,
Atlas shall be deemed to have waived any Environmental Condition that Atlas
fails to assert as an Environmental Condition by an Environmental
Condition Notice received by Titan

 



42  and Representative on or before the Claim Date. To be effective, each
Environmental Condition Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a
reasonably detailed description, including, where available, supporting
documentation, of the matter constituting the alleged Environmental Condition,
(ii) a description of each Titan Asset (or portion thereof) that is affected
by the alleged Environmental Condition, (iii) Atlass assertion of the
Allocated Value of the portion of the Titan Assets affected by the alleged
Environmental Condition, and (iv) Atlass good faith estimate, which is non-
binding, based on the information made available to Atlas prior to the date
of such notice (as such estimate shall be adjusted in good faith by Atlas
prior to the Claim Date based on information made available to Atlas prior to
the Claim Date) of the Remediation Amount that Atlas asserts is attributable
to such alleged Environmental Condition (the " _Claimed Remediation Amount_
"). Atlass calculation of the Claimed Remediation Amount included in the
Environmental Condition Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the
Remediation proposed for the Environmental Condition that gives rise to the
asserted Environmental Condition and the primary assumptions used in
calculating the Remediation Amount, including, where applicable, any standards
that Atlas asserts must be met to comply with Environmental Laws. Titan shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to Remediate any claimed Environmental
Condition at any time prior to the Closing Date (the " _Environmental
Condition Cure Period_ "). Titan may, prior to Closing, select and employ at
its sole discretion any generally accepted remedial technology or approach to
Remediate an identified Environmental Condition.

 

(b) _Remedies for Environmental Conditions_.

 

(i) If, prior to Closing, Atlas and Representative are in agreement with
respect to any Environmental Condition timely and properly asserted by Atlas
in accordance with _Section 9.1(a)_, then Atlas and Representative may agree
in writing prior to the Closing to reduce the Merger Consideration at the
Closing by including the Remediation Amount (subject to  _Section 9.1(f)_)
with respect to such Environmental Condition in the Closing Remediation
Amount.

 

(ii) For all other Environmental Conditions timely asserted by Atlas in
accordance with _Section 9.1(a)_ that are not waived in writing by Atlas or
Remediated on or before the last day of the Environmental Condition Cure
Period, then, subject to _Section 9.1(f)_, Representative shall select, at
Closing, one of the following remedies in its sole discretion (or both
remedies where Representative elects to treat certain matters under clause (A)
and certain other matters under clause (B)):

(A) submit certain or all of the Environmental Conditions and/or Remediation
Amounts to dispute resolution pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_ and direct Atlas
to place the Environmental Remediation Escrow Units into escrow with the
Escrow Agent at the Closing; or

(B) assumption of responsibility by Representative (by written notice to
Atlas from Representative no later than the Closing, and in the absence of
such written notice by the Closing, Representative shall be deemed to have
selected clause (ii)(A) of _Section 9.1(b)_) for the Remediation of certain
or all of such Environmental Conditions (and if only certain Environmental
Conditions are subject to assumption of responsibility under this clause (B),
the balance of the Environmental Conditions and Remediation Amounts shall be
subject to clause (A) above in this _Section 9.1(b)(ii)_).

 



43 (c) If _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ above is applicable, Atlas shall be deemed to
have assumed responsibility for Remediation of such Environmental Condition.
If clause (ii)(B) of _Section 9.1(b)_ above is applicable, then (A)
Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to implement such
Remediation in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of
Environmental Laws, taking into consideration Titans use and operation of the
Titan Assets, in a timely fashion for the type of Remediation Representative
elects to undertake (at no cost or expense, internal or otherwise, to Atlas
or its Affiliates including, the Surviving Company) and, upon advance written
notice, Atlas hereby grants Representative access to the affected Titan Assets
after the Closing Date to implement and complete such Remediation in
accordance with an access agreement mutually agreeable to the parties, and (B)
there shall be no reduction to the Merger Consideration related to such
Environmental Condition. Upon completion of Remediation under clause (ii)(B)
of _Section 9.1(b)_ above, Representative shall at its sole cost and expense
and without any cost or expense (internal or otherwise) to Atlas or its
Affiliates, including the Surviving Company (except to the extent
Representative requests in writing any such Persons to undertake any work in
connection therewith and such Person(s) agrees in writing to undertake such
work), (A) close all bore holes from its Remediation in accordance with
recognized industry standards, (B) repair all damage done to the Titan Assets
in connection with the Remediation, and (C) remove all equipment, tools or
other property brought onto the Titan Assets in connection with the
Remediation. Any party performing Remediation shall keep the other party
reasonably informed regarding any Remediation. In completing the Remediation,
the party performing the Remediation shall provide the other party with draft
copies of all documents to be submitted to any Governmental Authorities
regarding the Remediation and shall reasonably cooperate with the other party
to incorporate comments provided by it to the party performing the Remediation
regarding such documents. In addition, the party performing the
Remediation shall promptly provide the other party with copies of any
correspondence with any Governmental Authority regarding the Remediation and
shall provide the other party with the opportunity to participate in any
meetings with any Governmental Authority regarding the Remediation. The party
performing the Remediation shall be solely responsible for obtaining any
permits or other authorizations from any Governmental Authority associated
with the Remediation. The party performing the Remediation shall promptly
remove any waste material generated during the Remediation from the Titan
Assets. The party performing the Remediation shall require any contractors or
subcontractors entering the Titan Assets in connection with the Remediation to
provide the other party with certificates of insurance demonstrating coverage
under Commercial General Liability, Contractors Pollution Liability, and
Errors and Omissions Liability insurance policies in a form reasonably
acceptable to the other party and naming the other party as an additional
insured.

(d) With respect to any provision of this _Article 9_ that refers to any
Remediation completed by Representative, whether before or after the Closing,
Representative will be deemed to have adequately completed the Remediation (i)
upon receipt of a certificate of approval or completion from the
applicable Governmental Authority that the Remediation has been implemented
to the extent necessary to comply with existing Laws or (ii) if no certificate
or approval is available under Environmental Law, upon express written consent
of Atlas, upon mutual agreement of the parties or upon receipt of a
certificate from an independent, licensed

 



44  professional engineer that the Remediation has been implemented to the
extent necessary to comply with Environmental Laws; _provided,_ if the parties
cannot agree, the issue of whether the Remediation is completed may be
resolved by the dispute resolution procedures set forth in _Section 9.1(g)_.
Any such Remediation determined in accordance with such procedures to be
incomplete will be completed, at such partys sole cost and expense, in
accordance with the requirements of this Agreement by the non-performing party
promptly following such determination.

(e) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for Atlass remedy for a breach of Titans
representation contained in _Section 3.17_ and the indemnification obligation
in  _Section 11.2_, the provisions set forth in _Section 9.1(b)_ shall be
the exclusive right and remedy of Atlas with respect to any Environmental
Condition or other environmental matter with respect to any Titan Asset. The
parties acknowledge and agree that information identified or discovered by
Atlas prior to the Claim Date or information identified, discovered or
developed in connection with the Remediation of a noticed Environmental
Condition shall not form the basis for a claim for a breach of representation
or warranty pursuant to _Section 3.17_.

(f) _Environmental Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
(i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Merger Consideration or
other remedies provided by Titan for any individual Environmental Condition
for which the Remediation Amount does not exceed the Individual Environmental
Threshold and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Merger
Consideration or other remedies provided by Titan for any Environmental
Condition for which the Remediation Amount exceeds the Individual
Environmental Threshold unless the sum of (A) the Remediation Amounts of all
such Environmental Conditions that exceed the Individual Environmental
Threshold, in the aggregate and (B) the Title Defect Amounts of all Title
Defects, in the aggregate, excluding any individual Title Defect for which the
Title Defect Amount does not exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold and
any Title Defects cured by Titan or Representative exceeds the Aggregate
Deductible, after which point Atlas shall be entitled to adjustments to the
Merger Consideration or other remedies only with respect to the portion of the
Remediation Amounts in excess of such Aggregate Deductible; _provided_ that
the entire Remediation Amount and not just the portion in excess of the
Individual Environmental Threshold shall be counted toward determining whether
the Aggregate Deductible has been met. The parties agree that if the same
Environmental Condition affects more than one Well or Undrilled Location,
then the Remediation Amounts for each Well or Undrilled Location affected by
such Environmental Condition shall be aggregated, without duplication of any
costs or losses included in another Remediation Amount hereunder, for the
purposes of determining whether the Individual Environmental Threshold has
been met with respect to such Environmental Condition.

(g) _Environmental Dispute Resolution_. Prior to the Closing, Representative
and Atlas shall attempt to agree on all Environmental Conditions and
Remediation Amounts. If Representative and Atlas are unable to agree by the
Closing Date, the Environmental Conditions and/or Remediation Amounts in
dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to
this _Section 9.1(g)_. There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be an
environmental attorney or environmental expert with at least ten (10) years
experience in environmental matters involving oil and gas producing properties
in Texas, as selected by mutual agreement of Atlas and Representative within
one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, and

 



45  absent such agreement within such time period, then each party will nominate
a candidate to select the Environmental Arbitrator, and such candidates so
nominated by Atlas and Representative shall together determine the
Environmental Arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after the last candidate is
nominated and absent such determination within such time period, the
Environmental Arbitrator shall be selected by the Dallas, Texas office of the
American Arbitration Association (the " _Environmental Arbitrator_ "). The
arbitration proceeding shall be held in Dallas, Texas and shall be conducted
in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the
terms of this _Article 9_. The Environmental Arbitrators determination of the
Environmental Condition or the Remediation Amount with respect to an
Environmental Condition shall be made within twenty (20) days after
submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon both
parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination, the
Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this
_Section 9.1_ and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters
as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to
make a proper determination. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Environmental Arbitrators awards are subject to the limitations on
liability set forth in _Section 9.1(f)_. The Environmental Arbitrator shall
act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed
Environmental Conditions and/or Remediation Amounts submitted by either party
and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either party with respect
to any matter. Atlas and Representative shall bear its own legal fees and
other costs of presenting its case. Atlas and Representative shall bear one-
half of the costs and expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator.

(h) Within ten (10) days after the Environmental Arbitrator delivers written
notice to Representative and Atlas of his award of the Remediation Amount with
respect to an Environmental Condition, to the extent such Remediation Amount
would otherwise be required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this _Article
9_ , Representative and Atlas shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release to
Atlas a number of Environmental Remediation Escrow Units then available in
escrow equal to (A) such Remediation Amount divided by (B) the Execution Date
Unit Price.

(i)  _Recourse Only Against Environmental Remediation Escrow Units_ __.
Without limiting the obligations of Representative with respect to any
Environmental Condition that it has elected in writing to Remediate pursuant
to  _Section 9.1(b)(ii)(B)_:

(i) Atlas acknowledges and agrees that the Environmental Remediation
Escrow Units shall be the sole and exclusive source for satisfaction of all
(and no Person shall under any circumstance have any personal liability or
obligation for the satisfaction of any) Environmental Conditions, Remediation
Amounts or breach of  _Article 9_. The Environmental Remediation Escrow Units
shall be used solely to satisfy Remediation Amounts for Environmental
Conditions.

(ii) The aggregate liability to Atlas in connection with all Environmental
Conditions and Remediation Amounts shall in no event exceed the Environmental
Remediation Escrow Units then held in escrow under the Escrow Agreement and
Atlas hereby covenants forever not to assert, file, prosecute, commence,
institute (or sponsor or facilitate any Person in connection with the
foregoing), any complaint or lawsuit or any 

 



46  legal, equitable, arbitral or administrative proceeding of any nature,
against any Titan Released Party in connection with or relating to any
Environmental Conditions, Remediation Amounts or breach of _Article 9_.
Before and after such time as the escrowed Environmental Remediation Escrow
Units are released from escrow, Atlas shall have no recourse against any Titan
Released Party in respect of any Environmental Condition or for any unpaid
Remediation Amount or breach of _Article 9_.

(iii) If Atlas asserts a claim under this  _Article 9_ , Atlas shall, subject
to the limitations on Titans liability hereunder, be entitled to be paid the
Remediation Amount determined in accordance with _Section 9.1(f)_, solely by
receiving from the Escrow Agent all or a portion of the then available
Environmental Remediation Escrow Units (determined using the Execution Date
Unit Price) in an amount equal to such Remediation Amount as provided in
_Section 9.1(g)_.

 

(iv) All Environmental Claims that Representative has elected to attempt to
Remediate pursuant to  _Section 9.1(b)(ii)(B)_ for which Atlas disputes the
adequacy or completeness of the Remediation (or the remaining Remediation
Amount (if any) then applicable after taking into account the Remediation
work) shall be submitted to the Environmental Arbitrator for resolution. In
making his determination the Environmental Arbitrator shall adhere to the
applicable rules, procedures, process and provisions set forth in _Section
9.1(g)._

 

(v) Upon completion of dispute resolution proceedings pursuant to _Section
9.1(g)_ and after award of all Environmental Remediation Escrow Units
distributable to Atlas as a consequence thereof pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)_,
then, at the request of Representative (on behalf of the Original New Unit
Holders), Atlas and Representative shall promptly instruct the Escrow Agent
to release to Representative (on behalf of Original New Unit Holders) all
remaining Environmental Remediation Escrow Units.

Section 9.2 _NORM, Wastes and Other Substances_. Atlas acknowledges that the
Titan Assets have been used for exploration, development and production of oil
and gas and that there may be petroleum, produced water, wastes, Hazardous
Substances or other substances or materials located in, on or under the Titan
Assets or associated with the Titan Assets. Equipment and sites included in
the Titan Assets may contain asbestos, NORM or other Hazardous Substances.
NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells, materials and
equipment as scale, or in other forms. The wells, materials and equipment
located on the Titan Assets or included in the Titan Assets may contain
NORM and other wastes or Hazardous Substances. NORM containing material
and/or other wastes or Hazardous Substances may have come in contact with
various environmental media, including water, soils or sediment. Special
procedures may be required for the assessment, remediation, removal,
transportation or disposal of environmental media, wastes, asbestos, NORM and
other Hazardous Substances from the Titan Assets.

50  the extent any such party suffers such damages (including costs of defense

Section 11.3 _Indemnification Obligations of Atlas_.

(a) Subject to the other terms of this _Article 11_ , from and after the
Closing Date, Atlas shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Original New
Unit Holders and their respective affiliates (collectively, the " _Titan

arising out of or resulting from:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Atlas in _Article 4_
and in the certificate delivered by Atlas at Closing pursuant to _Section
1.3(a)(v)_ (without giving effect to any qualifier as to "knowledge" or
"materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" or words of similar meaning set
forth therein); and

(ii) any breach of any covenant, agreement or undertaking made by Atlas in
this Agreement.

(b) The Losses of the Titan Indemnified Parties described in this _Section
11.3_ as to which the Titan Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification hereunder are hereinafter collectively referred to as "
_Titan Losses_."

Section 11.4 _Indemnification Procedure_.

 

(a) Promptly after receipt by an Atlas Indemnified Party or a Titan
Indemnified Party (hereinafter collectively referred to as an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") of notice by a third party (including any Governmental Authority) of
any Actions or the commencement of any audit with respect to which such
Indemnified Party may be entitled to receive payment hereunder for any 

 



51  Atlas Losses or any Titan Losses (as the case may be), such Indemnified
Party will notify Atlas or Representative, as the case may be (in such
capacity, Atlas or Representative, is hereinafter referred to as an "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") of such Action or audit; _provided, however_ , that
the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying
Party from liability under this Agreement with respect to such Action or
audit only if, and only to the extent that, the defense of such Actions or
audit is prejudiced as a result of the failure to notify the Indemnifying
Party. Notwithstanding Representatives status as an Indemnifying
Party, Representative shall have no personal liability hereunder and its
obligations shall be satisfied only to the extent of the General Escrow Units
then held in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. The Indemnifying Party
will have the right, at its sole expense, upon written notice delivered to
the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) calendar days after receiving such
notice, to assume the defense of such Action with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. In
the event, however, that the Indemnifying Party declines or fails to (i)
assume the defense of the Action on the terms provided above or (ii) employ
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, in any case within
such fifteen (15) day period, then such Indemnified Party may employ counsel
to represent or defend it in any such Action and the Indemnifying Party will
(subject to the other terms and provisions of this Agreement) pay
the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel as incurred; _provided,
however_ , that the Indemnifying Party will not be required to pay the fees
and disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction in any single Action. For avoidance of doubt, the fees and
disbursements of counsel of any Atlas Indemnified Party in connection with an
Atlas Loss shall be satisfied solely by receiving from the Escrow Agent a
portion of the General Escrow Units, with such fees and expenses being
converted into a number of General Escrow Units based on the Execution Date
Unit Price, in an amount equal to such fees and disbursements. In any Action
with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder, the
Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the
defense of such Action, will have the right to participate in such matter and
to retain its own counsel at such Partys own expense. The Indemnifying Party
or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, will at all times use
reasonable efforts to (i) diligently conduct the defense of any Action for
which it is maintaining the defense and (ii) keep the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, reasonably apprised of the status of
the defense of any Action the defense of which they are maintaining and to
cooperate in good faith with each other with respect to the defense of any
such Action.

 

(b) No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any Action or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought
hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, unless
(i) such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release
of the Indemnifying Party from all liability arising out of such Action (and,
where Representative is the Indemnifying Party, an unconditional release of
all claims against the Titan Released Parties in respect of all Liability
arising out of such Action), (ii) does not contain any admission or statement
of any wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the Indemnifying Party (and where
Representative is the Indemnifying Party, the Titan Released Parties) and
(iii) does not contain any equitable order, judgment or term that in any
manner affects, restrains or interferes with the business of the Indemnifying
Party or any of the Indemnifying Partys affiliates. An Indemnifying Party may
not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or
compromise any Action or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to
which indemnification is being sought hereunder unless (i) such

 



52  settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of the
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Action, (ii) does not
contain any admission or statement of any wrongdoing or liability on behalf
of the Indemnified Party and (iii) does not contain any equitable order,
judgment or term that in any manner affects, restrains or interferes with the
business of the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified Partys
affiliates.

(c) A claim for indemnification by an Indemnified Party for any matter not
involving an Action by a third party may be asserted by written notice to the
Indemnifying Party from whom indemnification is sought. Such notice will
specify with reasonable specificity the basis for such claim.

 

Section 11.5 _General Escrow Claims Period_.

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _General Escrow Claims Period_ "
shall be the period of time that commences at the Closing and terminates on
the first anniversary of the Closing Date and no claim may be asserted under
_Section 11.2(a)(i)_ (or with respect to any breach of a representation,
warranty, certification, covenant, undertaking or agreement referred to in
_Section 11.2(a)(i)_) after the General Escrow Claims Period has ended.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the close of business on the last
day of the General Escrow Claims Period, Representative shall have been
notified in writing by Atlas of a claim for indemnity for which a claim for
indemnification under _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ may be asserted under this
Agreement by an Atlas Indemnified Party and such claim shall not have been
finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim shall continue to
survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until the earlier of
the date such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance with the
terms hereof and the time at which there are no General Escrow Units held in
escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Special Claims Period_ " shall be
the period of time that commences at the Closing and terminates on the date
that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date and no claim may be
asserted under _Section 11.2(a)(ii)_ (or with respect to any breach of any
Extended Survival Covenant, Fundamental Representation or certification
referred to in _Section 11.2(a)(ii)_) after the Special Claims Period has
ended; _provided, however_ , that with respect to the Extended Survival
Covenants, the Special Claims Period will expire with respect to each such
covenant when the survival period for such covenant ends in accordance with
_Section 11.1_; _provided further, however,_ that the Special Claims Period
for Subordinated Lien Title Defects shall terminate on the date that is three
(3) years after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to
the close of business on the last day of the Special Claims Period,
Representative shall have been notified in writing by Atlas of a claim for
indemnity for which a claim for indemnification under Section 11.2(a)(ii) may
be asserted under this Agreement by an Atlas Indemnified Party and such claim
shall not have been finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim
shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity hereunder
until the date such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance
with the terms hereof.

 

Section 11.6 _Limits of Liability_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Atlas
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover on a claim for
indemnification under _Section 11.2(a)(i) _ 

 



53  for any individual Atlas Loss unless the amount of such Atlas Loss or group
of related Atlas Losses exceeds the De Minimis Threshold (each Atlas Loss or
group of related Atlas Losses that does not exceed the De Minimis Threshold
shall be referred to as an " _Atlas De Minimis Liability_ ") and then not
until the aggregate amount of all Atlas Losses (excluding the Atlas De Minimis
Liabilities) incurred by the Atlas Indemnified Parties exceeds the Aggregate
Deductible reduced by (i) the aggregate amount of all Title Defect Amounts for
Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold and that are
neither cured nor are the subject of an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration under _Section 8.2(c)(i)_ and (ii) the aggregate Remediation
Amounts of all Environmental Conditions that exceed the Individual
Environmental Threshold and that are neither Remediated nor are the subject of
an adjustment to the Merger Consideration under _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ (the "
_Atlas Basket_ ") and then the recoverable Losses shall be limited to those
that exceed the Atlas Basket; _provided, however_ , the limitations
on indemnification set forth in this _Section 11.6(a)_ shall not apply to
Atlas Losses resulting from any breach of the representations and warranties
made in _Sections 3.1_ , _3.2_ , _3.3_ , _3.4(a)_ , _3.24, 3.26(f)_  and
_3.35_.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Titan
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover on a claim for
indemnification under _Section 11.3(a)_ for any individual Titan Loss unless
the amount of such Titan Loss or group of related Titan Losses exceeds the De
Minimis Threshold (each Titan Loss or group of related Titan Losses that does
not exceed the De Minimis Threshold shall be referred to as an " _Titan De
Minimis Liability_ ") and then not until the aggregate amount of all Titan
Losses (excluding the Titan De Minimis Liabilities) incurred by the Titan
Indemnified Parties exceeds the Aggregate Deductible (the " _Titan Basket_ ")
and then the recoverable Losses shall be limited to those that exceed the
Titan Basket; _provided_ , _however_ , that Atlas shall have no liability to
the Titan Indemnified Parties for any Titan Losses incurred by the Titan
Indemnified Parties in excess of the Cap; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ ,
the limitations on indemnification set forth in this  _Section 11.6(b)_
shall not apply to Titan Losses resulting from any breach of the
representations and warranties made by Atlas in _Sections 4.1_ , _4.2_ ,
_4.3(a)_ and _4.8_.

 

(c) the Losses indemnifiable hereunder for Unsubordinated Lien Title Defects
pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(ii)_ shall be (i) first, the reasonable third
party costs and expenses of the Atlas Indemnified Parties in excess of the
Individual Title Defect Threshold incurred to prevent any unsubordinated lien
from becoming an Unsubordinated Lien Title Defect or the reasonable third
party costs and expenses of the Atlas Indemnified Parties incurred to cure any
such Unsubordinated Lien Title Defect in accordance with accepted industry
practices for properties similar to the Properties using
commercially reasonable efforts, and (ii) second, if following such curative
efforts a Title Defect Amount remains, such Title Defect Amount; _provided,
however_ , that after $1.5 million of such Losses have been indemnified
hereunder, only fifty percent (50%) of any further such Losses shall be
indemnifiable; _provided further, however_ , that (x) the Losses indemnifiable
for all Unsubordinated Lien Title Defects related to a particular affected
Well (including all indemnifiable costs and expenses incurred in preventing
or curing such Unsubordinated Lien Title Defects) shall not exceed the
Allocated Value of the affected Well, and (y) the Allocated Value of the
applicable Well shall be reduced by the net cash flow attributable to such
Well between the Closing and the date of the indemnity hereunder except to the
extent a claim has been made by a third party in connection with or arising
from the Unsubordinated Lien Title Defect claiming all or any portion of such
net cash flow (a " _Cash Flow Claim_ "), and (z) to the extent a third partys
Cash Flow Claim is finally determined (with

 



54  respect to which Atlas will use good faith efforts to obtain) to be
unsuccessful subsequent to the payment of any indemnity hereunder, an
adjustment will be made between the Atlas Indemnified Parties and the
indemnifying parties to extent the indemnity would have been reduced pursuant
to clause (y) above.

 

Section 11.7 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_.

(a) From and after the Closing, other than the remedies set forth in _Articles
8_ and _9_ , the remedies set forth in this _Article 11_ shall provide the
sole and exclusive remedies arising out of, in connection with, relating to
or arising under this Agreement, any document, agreement, certificate
(including the certificates delivered at Closing by Atlas and Titan pursuant
to _Sections 1.3(a)(iv)_ and _1.3(b)(i)_ , respectively) or other instrument
delivered pursuant hereto or the transactions contemplated hereby, whether
based on contract, tort, strict liability, other laws or otherwise, including
any breach or alleged breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made herein or any other document contemplated herein or delivered
pursuant hereto. The parties acknowledge and agree that from and after the
Closing the remedies available in this _Section 11.7_ supersede (and
each party waives and releases) any other remedies available at Law or in
equity including rights of rescission, rights of contribution and claims
arising under applicable statutes.

 

(b) Atlas, on behalf of itself and all other Atlas Indemnified Parties,
further acknowledges and agrees that, after the Closing, except for the
indemnification obligations of the holders of Titan Class A Units in
accordance with Section 11.2(a)(ii), and except as provided in _Section
11.7(g)_, the Escrowed Units shall be the sole and exclusive source
for satisfaction of all (and no Titan Released Party or Representative or any
of their respective affiliates shall under any circumstance have any personal
liability or obligation for the satisfaction of any) claims by all Atlas
Indemnified Parties for all Losses in connection with, arising out of or
resulting from the subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(c) Atlas, on its own behalf and on behalf of each other Atlas Indemnified
Party, hereby covenants forever not to assert, file, prosecute, commence or
institute (or sponsor or facilitate any Person in connection with the
foregoing), any complaint or lawsuit or any legal, equitable, arbitral or
administrative proceeding of any nature, against any Titan Released Party,
Representative or any of their respective affiliates pursuant to  _Section
11.2(a)_ (excluding the holders of the Titan Class A Units to the extent such
holders have liability under _Section 11.2(a)(ii)_). At and after such time
as the General Escrow Units are exhausted or released, the Atlas Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to seek indemnity under this Agreement or
otherwise, and the Atlas Indemnified Parties shall have no recourse against
any Titan Released Party, Representative or any of their respective affiliates
for any unpaid Losses (other than the holders of the Titan Class A Units to
the extent such holders have liability under _Section 11.2(a)(ii)_).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in the
Letter of Transmittal, the Atlas Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
recover on claims for indemnification under this Agreement or the Letter of
Transmittal (and the maximum aggregate liability to the Atlas Indemnified
Parties under or with respect to this Agreement and the Letter of Transmittal
shall in no event exceed) more than an amount of Atlas Units (based on the

 



55  Execution Date Unit Price) and cash which, in the aggregate, equals the
dollar value of the Merger Consideration (based on the Execution Date Unit
Price with respect to the Atlas Units included in the Merger Consideration).
Atlas, on its own behalf and on behalf of each other Atlas Indemnified Party,
hereby covenants forever not to assert, file, prosecute, commence or institute
(or sponsor or facilitate any Person in connection with the foregoing), any
complaint or lawsuit or any legal, equitable, arbitral or administrative
proceeding of any nature, against any Titan Released Party, Representative or
any of their respective affiliates to recover amounts in excess of such
amount. 

(e) If an Atlas Indemnified Party asserts an indemnity claim under _Section
11.2(a)(i)_ during the General Escrow Claims Period, the Atlas Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to indemnification in accordance with this _Article
11_ by receiving from the Escrow Agent all or a portion of the General Escrow
Units then held in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (x) the amount of Losses indemnifiable hereunder
by (y) the Execution Date Unit Price.

(f) All claims asserted by an Atlas Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section
11.1(a)(i)_ during the General Escrow Claims Period that are not resolved and
satisfied during the General Escrow Claims Period (including the obligation
to pay any such indemnity claim) shall be deemed to be " _Pending Section
11.7 Claims_," to the extent the remaining General Escrow Units then held in
escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement are sufficient (based on the
Execution Date Unit Price) to satisfy such claims. The dollar amount of all
Losses claimed in respect of Pending Section 11.7 Claims are hereinafter
referred to as the " _Pending Section 11.7 Claim Amount_" and the General
Escrow Units equal to the lesser of (A) the number of General Escrow Units
determined by dividing the Pending Section 11.7 Claim Amount by the Execution
Date Unit Price and (B) the total number of remaining General Escrow Units
then held in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement are hereafter referred to
as the " _Remaining General Escrow Units_ ". On the first (1st) Business Day
following the last day of the General Escrow Claims Period, Atlas and
Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent written
instructions instructing the Escrow Agent to release and deliver to
Representative the then remaining balance of the General Escrow Units in
excess of the Remaining General Escrow Units (if any). The Remaining General
Escrow Units will continue to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement until the Pending Section 11.7 Claims have been
resolved by the parties in writing or in a court of competent jurisdiction
and the Escrow Agreement shall be deemed to be extended accordingly;
_provided_ , _however_ , if as of the first calendar day of any subsequent
month the remaining balance of the value (determined using the Execution Date
Unit Price) of the General Escrow Units exceeds the then remaining Pending
Section 11.7 Claim Amount, then Representative and Atlas shall promptly notify
the Escrow Agent in writing that the excess amount of General Escrow Units
shall be released promptly to Representative (on behalf of the Original New
Unit Holders).

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
have agreed that if, based on a preponderance of the evidence, any
representation and warranty made by Titan in this Agreement was deliberately
made and actually known by any Titan Knowledge Person as of the date hereof
to be untrue in any material respect, then the limitations on Atlass remedies
set forth in _Sections 11.7(b)_ and _11.7(c)_ shall not apply with respect to
such breach and the holders of the Titan Class A Units shall be, subject to
the other provisions of this Agreement

 



56  (including _Section 11.1_, _Section 11.5_ and _Section 11.7(d)_), jointly
and severally liable to Atlas for all Losses arising out of such breach
(except in the case of Hollis Sullivan, Mark Schumacher, Butch Ford and
Hammack SP, LLC, each of whom shall be only severally liable for only his or
its Pro Rata Share of such Losses).

LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY AND INDEMNITIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT,
INCLUDING THOSE IN THIS _ARTICLE 11_ , SHALL APPLY IN THE EVENT OF THE SOLE,
JOINT AND/OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OF THE
PARTY WHOSE LIABILITY IS RELEASED, DISCLAIMED, LIMITED OR INDEMNIFIED.

rise to any claim hereunder shall be reduced by any insurance proceeds or
other payments actually received by the Indemnified Party (less the amount of
any deductible paid or costs incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection
therewith) in satisfaction of any Losses giving rise to the claim. Atlas shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies
or under other rights of recovery for Losses; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Atlas shall be entitled to seek payment (including indemnification) under this
Agreement pending resolution of any such recovery efforts. 

Section 11.10 _Tax Benefits_. The amount of any Atlas Losses and Titan Losses
giving rise to any claim hereunder shall be reduced to the extent of any Tax

extent provided in this Agreement), except with respect to
the Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct. Representative
shall at all times be entitled to rely on any directions received from the
Majority Holders; _provided_ , _however_ , that Representative shall not be
required to follow any such direction, and shall be under no obligation to
take any action in its capacity as Representative, unless Representative has

determination of Representative, are sufficient to protect Representative
against the costs, expenses and Liabilities which may be incurred by
Representative in responding to such direction or taking such action.

Liability or expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted to be taken in
