company or other organization to do business, and, to the extent legally
applicable, is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of
its owned, operated or leased properties or the nature of its activities
makes such qualification necessary, except for jurisdictions where the failure

of NBCUniversal to consummate the transactions contemplated by, or perform
its obligations under, the Transaction Documents to which it is or will at
Closing be a party.

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by NBCUniversal of the Transaction
Documents to which it is or will at Closing be a party and the consummation by

will at Closing be a party will be, duly executed and delivered by
NBCUniversal, and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the
other parties hereto and thereto) this Agreement constitutes and, upon
execution and delivery, the other Transaction Documents will constitute,
legal, valid and binding obligations of NBCUniversal, enforceable against
NBCUniversal in accordance with their terms, subject to the effect of any
applicable Laws relating to bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential transfers, or similar Laws
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and 

 



6  subject, as to enforceability, to the effect of general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).

 

Section 2.02 _No Conflict_ _._ The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which NBCUniversal is or
will at Closing be a party, and the consummation of the transactions

with the organizational documents of NBCUniversal, (b) conflict with or
violate any Law or Governmental Order applicable to NBCUniversal or any of its
properties or assets, or (c) result in any breach of, or constitute a default
(or an event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both,
would become a default) under, or give to any Person any rights of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of any Lien on any properties or assets of NBCUniversal pursuant to,
or require a consent or approval under, any note, bond, mortgage or
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other
material instrument to which NBCUniversal is a party or by which any of its
properties or assets is bound or affected; except, in the case of clauses (b)
and (c), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, rights or
Liens as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected

Financing") pursuant to which HoldCo will incur, immediately prior to the
issuance of the HoldCo Preferred Shares, additional debt in an aggregate
principal amount not to exceed $100,000,000, which will be guaranteed by
Comcast, for purposes of paying the expenses of HoldCo (including any fees
incurred in connection with the HoldCo Third Party Financing or the Excluded
HoldCo Third Party Financing). Prior to the Closing, Comcast may negotiate,
and to the extent (but only to the extent) requested by or consented to in
writing by Comcast, GE shall cause HoldCo to enter into, definitive
agreements with respect to, and to

 



19  consummate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Excluded
HoldCo Third Party Financing. For the avoidance of doubt, the Excluded HoldCo
Third Party Financing shall not constitute Additional HoldCo Third Party
Financing (as defined in Section 5.04(c)).

(c) In addition to the HoldCo Third Party Financing and the Excluded HoldCo
Third Party Financing, at any time and from time to time prior to the Closing,
Comcast may arrange for additional third party debt financing (the "Additional
HoldCo Third Party Financing"), which may include unsecured notes ("Third
Party HoldCo Notes") that rank _pari passu_ with the HoldCo Notes. Prior to
the Closing, Comcast shall negotiate, and to the extent (but only to the
extent) requested by or consented to in writing by Comcast, GE shall cause
HoldCo to enter into, definitive agreements (the "Additional HoldCo Third
Party Financing Agreements") with respect to, and to consummate in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, any Additional HoldCo Third Party
Financing; _provided_ , that any such Additional HoldCo Third Party Financing
Agreements shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to GE and
HoldCo and shall provide that no such Additional HoldCo Third Party Financing
Agreements shall remain outstanding if the Closing does not occur and this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. Such Additional HoldCo
Third Party Financing shall provide for guarantees by Comcast and its
cable holding companies that guarantee Comcasts senior unsecured debt
securities, such guarantees to be effective either upon issuance or upon
Closing. Subject to Section 5.04(c)(ii) below and the proviso to Section
1.01(k), GE shall cause HoldCo to distribute the net proceeds of any
Additional HoldCo Third Party Financing to NBCH at the Closing in lieu of
HoldCo Notes having the same aggregate principal amount, and the principal
amount of each series of HoldCo Notes (as set forth in Section 1.01(k)) shall
be reduced on a _pro rata_ basis (in proportion to the contemplated aggregate
principal amount of the Holdco Notes represented by each such series) by the
aggregate amount of any proceeds of Additional HoldCo Third Party Financing
so distributed to NBCH, as set forth in Section 1.01(k). In connection with
any Additional HoldCo Third Party Financing:

(i) GE and Comcast will cooperate to provide that the proceeds of any
Additional HoldCo Third Party Financing issued or incurred prior to the
Closing shall be held in escrow with a third-party escrow agent pending the
Closing (at Comcasts cost) and either (A) released to NBCH at the Closing in
accordance with Section 1.01(k) or (B) if the Closing does not occur and this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, returned to the lenders
or holders of such Additional HoldCo Third Party Financing (as the case may
be) in accordance with the terms of the Additional HoldCo Third Party
Financing Agreements.

 

(ii) Comcast and GE shall each pay 50% of all discounts and selling
commissions incurred in connection with any Additional HoldCo Third Party
Financing (the "Shared Underwriting Expenses").

 



20 (d) In order to assist with obtaining the HoldCo Third Party Financing, any
Excluded HoldCo Third Party Financing and any Additional HoldCo Third Party
Financing and any financings to be obtained by Comcast in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
the "Third Party Financing") (it being understood that the consummation of
any such financing to be obtained by Comcast shall not be a condition to the
obligation of Comcast to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), each of NBCUniversal, HoldCo, Comcast, NBCH and GE shall, and
shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its respective Representatives to, provide such
assistance and cooperation as HoldCo or Comcast may reasonably request
(including, but not limited to, providing (x) all information requested by any
lender providing such Third Party Financing necessary to enable such lender to
identify HoldCo to the extent required for compliance with the Patriot Act or
other "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations,
(y) such documents (which shall not include legal opinions) with respect to
the good standing of HoldCo, the due authorization, execution and
authentication of the Third Party Financing and other matters related to the
due authorization, execution and authentication of such Third Party Financing
as Comcast, any lender providing Third Party Financing or any managing
initial purchasers of an offering of Third Party HoldCo Notes may reasonably
request and (z) such information with respect to Holdco as would be required
of GE and NBCH in connection with any "Demand" under the Notes Marketing
Assistance Agreement); _provided_ , that in no event will GE or any of its
Affiliates be required to provide any credit support in connection with the
Third Party Financing nor will GE, its Affiliates (other than HoldCo) or its
Representatives be required to enter into or perform any obligations under
any HoldCo Third Party Financing Agreement or any Additional HoldCo Third
Party Financing Agreement or otherwise provide any representations,
warranties, indemnities, agreements, opinions or other documents or
certificates by or on behalf of HoldCo, GE, NBCH or any other party in
connection therewith, except as provided in clauses (x), (y) and (z) of this
sentence. Any offering materials used by or on behalf of Comcast in
connection with any Additional HoldCo Third Party Financing Agreement shall
be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to GE and HoldCo, and Comcast
shall provide GE and HoldCo drafts of such materials and a reasonable period
of time to review and comment upon such materials prior to any use thereof.
Comcast shall promptly reimburse GE and HoldCo for (i) all of their respective
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses (excluding
GEs allocable portion of the Shared Underwriting Expenses) to the extent
resulting from any actions taken by either of them in the

 



21  course of compliance with their obligations under, or at the request of
Comcast pursuant to, this Section 5.04 and (ii) any other Liabilities arising
out of or in relation to the Third Party Financing, except to the extent
arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of a GE Indemnified
Party or a HoldCo Indemnified Party (collectively, the "Third Party Financing
Liabilities").

Subsidiaries shall be entitled to preferential client treatment, including
access to marketing execution and placements comparable to the top tier or
highest spender category of advertising or past practice, whichever is more
favorable to GE, and (ii) once specific advertising schedules are ordered by
GE, such orders and associated expenditures are non-cancelable subject to
mutually acceptable options and any other terms and conditions as are
negotiated by the parties at the time the order is placed. For the avoidance
of doubt, the dollar amounts described in this Section 5.05 are for the
purchase of advertising, including access to marketing execution, but
exclusive of associated out-of-pocket expenses. This Section 5.05 shall have
no force or effect if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing.

representatives and their respective successors and assigns, hereby
irrevocably waives, releases and discharges each other party to this
Agreement and each such other partys current and former Affiliates,

(each, a "Released Person"), from any and all Liabilities to such Releasing
Person of any kind or nature whatsoever (including in respect of rights of
contribution or indemnification) based on, arising out of or relating to a
Released Persons status as a member, director, officer, employee or
representative of NBCUniversal from the "Closing" (as defined in the Master
Agreement) through and including the Closing hereunder, in each case whether
arising under the NBCUniversal LLC Agreement or any other agreement or
understanding or otherwise at law or in equity (collectively, the "Released
Obligations"); _provided_  that the Released Obligations shall not include
(i) any Liability of HoldCo in respect of any pre-Closing breach of Section

obligations described in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B) shall continue in

discharge is a general waiver, release and discharge and waives any rights it
may have under any Law that purports to limit the effect of a general waiver,
release and discharge (such as a Law that seeks to limit the effect of a

time such waiver, release and discharge is granted). Each Releasing Person
further acknowledges that it may discover, after this Agreement becomes
effective, that the facts and circumstances upon which it based its decision
to enter into such general waiver, release and discharge are other than or
different from what it now believes to be true. Such general waiver, release
and discharge shall, however, remain binding and effective notwithstanding
the discovery of such new or different facts or circumstances.

on HoldCo that is material and disproportionate as to its effect on other
Members or their Affiliates, without the consent of GE, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.02(b) not to be satisfied, and such condition
would be incapable of being satisfied, by the End Date; _provided_ , _however_
, that Comcast is not then in material breach of this Agreement;

(d) by either GE or Comcast if the Closing shall not have occurred by March
27, 2013 (the "End Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(d) shall not be available to
any party whose failure to take any action required to fulfill any obligation
under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in,
the failure of the Closing to occur prior to such date; or

(e) by GE or Comcast, in the event of the issuance of a final, nonappealable
Governmental Order restraining or prohibiting the Closing;

 

 _provided_ , that the party asserting that a condition set forth in Section
7.01 or Section 7.02 has failed to be satisfied shall bear the burden of
proof of such failure.

Section 8.02 _Notice of Termination_ _._ Any party desiring to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01 shall give written notice of such
termination to the other parties to this Agreement.

 

Section 8.03 _Effect of Termination_ _._ In the event of the termination of
this Agreement as provided in Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith

 



31  become void and there shall be no liability on the part of any party to this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall
relieve any party hereto from liability for any knowing and intentional
breach of this Agreement or knowing and intentional failure to perform its
obligations under this Agreement _._

Section 8.04 _Extension; Waiver_ _._ At any time prior to the Closing, GE may,
with respect to Comcast or NBCUniversal, or Comcast may, with respect to GE,
NBCH or HoldCo, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Person, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or (c) waive compliance with
any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement ( _provided_
that such waiver of compliance with such agreements or conditions shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure). Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the party granting such extension or waiver.
Neither the waiver by any of the parties hereto of a breach of or a default
under any of the provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure by any of the
parties, on one or more occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this
Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall be construed
as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a
waiver of any of such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder or
thereunder.

ARTICLE 9

Section 9.01 _Indemnification by GE_ _._ From and after the Closing, and
subject to the provisions of this Article 9, GE shall indemnify, defend and

and assigns and their respective directors, officers and employees
(collectively, the "NBCUniversal Indemnified Parties"), (y) HoldCo, its
successors and assigns and their respective directors, officers and employees
(collectively, the "HoldCo Indemnified Parties") and (z) Comcast, its

successors and assigns and their respective directors, officers and employees
(each, a "Comcast Indemnified Party") against, and reimburse any NBCUniversal
Indemnified Party, HoldCo Indemnified Party or Comcast Indemnified Party for,
all Losses that such NBCUniversal Indemnified Party, HoldCo Indemnified Party
or Comcast Indemnified Party may suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a
result of:

(a) the failure of any representations or warranties made by GE, NBCH or
HoldCo in this Agreement to be true and correct on and as of the date

 



32  hereof or on and as of the Closing Date as though made on the Closing Date
(or with respect to representations and warranties that are made as of a
specific date, the failure of such representations and warranties to be true
and correct as of such date);

(b) any breach or failure by GE, NBCH or HoldCo to perform any of its
covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement; or

(c) any Liabilities of HoldCo (other than Released Obligations) attributable
to any events, actions or omissions occurring prior to the HoldCo Acquisition
(other than (i) Liabilities of NBCUniversal for which HoldCo is liable in its
capacity as an equityholder of NBCUniversal and (ii) any Third Party
Financing Liabilities; _provided_ , that GE shall not be obligated to
indemnify the NBCUniversal Indemnified Parties, the HoldCo Indemnified Parties
or the Comcast Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Section 9.01(c) for any
such Liability to the extent that GE is also obligated to indemnify any such
party for such Liability pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, in which case
the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement shall govern.

 

Section 9.02 _Indemnification by Comcast_ _._ (a) From and after the Closing,
and subject to the provisions of this Article 9, Comcast shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless (x) the NBCUniversal Indemnified Parties, (y) the
HoldCo Indemnified Parties and (z) GE and its Affiliates (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, the NBCUniversal Indemnified Parties and the HoldCo
Indemnified Parties), their respective successors and assigns and their
respective directors, officers and employees (collectively, the "GE

NBCUniversal Indemnified Party or HoldCo Indemnified Party for, all Losses
that such GE Indemnified Party, NBCUniversal Indemnified Party or HoldCo
Indemnified Party may suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of: 

(i) the failure of any representations or warranties made by Comcast in this
Agreement to be true and correct on and as of the date hereof or on and as of
the Closing Date as though made on the Closing Date (or with respect to
representations and warranties that are made as of a specific date, the
failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct as of
such date); or

(ii) any breach or failure by Comcast to perform any of its covenants
or obligations contained in this Agreement.

(b) From and after the date hereof, and subject to the provisions of this
Article 9, Comcast shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the HoldCo
Indemnified Parties and the GE Indemnified Parties against, and reimburse any
HoldCo Indemnified Party and GE Indemnified Party for, all Losses that such 

 



33  HoldCo Indemnified Party or GE Indemnified Party may suffer or incur, or
become subject to, as a result of the Third Party Financing, except to the
extent arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of a HoldCo
Indemnified Party or a GE Indemnified Party.

Section 9.03 _Indemnification by NBCUniversal_ _._ From and after the
Closing, and subject to the provisions of this Article 9, NBCUniversal shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless (x) the GE Indemnified Parties and (y) the
HoldCo Indemnified Parties against, and reimburse any GE Indemnified Party or
HoldCo Indemnified Party for, all Losses that such GE Indemnified Party or
HoldCo Indemnified Party may suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a
result of:

 

(a) the failure of any representations or warranties made by NBCUniversal in
this Agreement to be true and correct on and as of the date hereof or on and
as of the Closing Date as though made on the Closing Date (or with respect to
representations and warranties that are made as of a specific date, the
failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct as of
such date); or

(b) any breach or failure by NBCUniversal to perform any of its covenants or
obligations contained in this Agreement (unless GE, NBCH or HoldCo was the
primary cause thereof).

Section 9.04 _Notification of Claims_ _. _ (a) A Person that may be entitled
to be indemnified under any of the Transaction Documents (the "Indemnified
Party"), shall promptly notify the party or parties liable for such
indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of any assertion of any
pending or threatened claim, demand or proceeding that the Indemnified Party
has determined has given or would reasonably be expected to give rise to a
right of indemnification under this Agreement (including a pending or
threatened claim, demand or proceeding asserted by a third party against the
Indemnified Party, such claim being a "Third Party Claim"), describing in
reasonable detail the relevant facts and circumstances;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to provide timely notice shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article 9 except to
the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure, it
being understood that notices for claims in respect of a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement must be delivered prior to the
expiration of any applicable survival period specified in Section 10.01 for
such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.04(a) with respect to any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party may assume the defense and control of such Third
Party Claim. In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense
of 

 



34  such claim, it shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and
at its own expense; _provided_ , that (i) if the Indemnified Party reasonably
concludes that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have a
conflict of interest or different defenses available with respect to such
Third Party Claim or (ii) the Indemnifying Party has not in fact employed
counsel to assume control of such defense, the reasonable fees and expenses of
one counsel (in addition to local counsel) to the Indemnified Parties shall be
considered "Losses" for purposes of this Agreement. The party that shall
control the defense of any such Third Party Claim (the "Controlling Party")
shall select counsel, contractors and consultants of recognized standing and
competence. GE and Comcast, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause each
of their respective Affiliates and Representatives to, cooperate fully with
the Controlling Party in the defense of any Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party does not so assume control of such defense, the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to control such defense. The Controlling Party shall
keep the other party advised of the status of such Third Party Claim and the
defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the
defense of any Third Party Claim in accordance with this Section 9.04(b), the
Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party before entering into any settlement of, or consenting to the entry of
any judgment arising from, such Third Party Claims unless (x) the
Indemnifying Party shall (i) pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out
of such settlement or judgment concurrently with the effectiveness of such
settlement, (ii) not encumber any of the assets of any Indemnified Party or
agree to any restriction or condition that would apply to or materially
adversely affect any Indemnified Party or the conduct of any Indemnified
Partys business and (iii) obtain, as a condition of any settlement or other
resolution, a complete release of any Indemnified Party potentially affected
by such Third Party Claim and (y) such settlement or consent shall not include
an admission of wrongdoing on the part of any Indemnified Party.

 

Section 9.05 _Exclusive Remedies_ _._ Other than with respect to any
injunctive remedies or in the case of intentional fraud, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that, following the Closing, the indemnification
provisions of Section 9.01 and Section 9.02 shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of any Indemnified Parties, respectively, for any Losses (including
any Losses from claims for breach of contract, warranty, tortious conduct
(including negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated on common law,
statute, strict liability, or otherwise) that it may at any time suffer or
incur, or become subject to, as a result of, or in connection with, any
breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement by GE, HoldCo,
Comcast or NBCUniversal, respectively, or any failure by GE, HoldCo, Comcast
or NBCUniversal, respectively, to perform or comply with any covenant or
agreement set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive any right of rescission they may
otherwise have or to which they may become entitled. 

 



35 Section 9.06 _Additional Indemnification Provisions_ _._ (a) With respect to
each indemnification obligation contained in any Transaction Document or any
other document executed in connection with the Closing, all Losses shall be
net of any third-party insurance proceeds that have been actually recovered by
the Indemnified Party in connection with the facts giving rise to the right
of indemnification.

(b) If an Indemnifying Party makes any payment for any Losses suffered or
incurred by an Indemnified Party pursuant to the provisions of this Article 9,
such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to
all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits or
other claims of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses and with
respect to the claim giving rise to such Losses.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, Losses covered by Section 9.01 or Section 9.02
may include Losses incurred in connection with a Third Party Claim or
otherwise and Losses that arise as a result of the negligence, strict
liability or any other liability under any theory of law or equity of, or
violation of any Law by, the Person indemnified thereunder.

Section 9.07 _Certain Losses_ _._ (a) If GE becomes aware of any Losses for
which HoldCo or NBCUniversal may be entitled to seek indemnification from
Comcast under this Agreement, or for which HoldCo may be entitled to seek
indemnification from NBCUniversal under this Agreement, (i) GE shall notify
HoldCo or NBCUniversal, as applicable, and (ii) if HoldCo or NBCUniversal does
not promptly seek such indemnification, GE shall be entitled to seek such
indemnification on behalf of HoldCo or NBCUniversal and may exercise or cause
to be exercised all of the rights of HoldCo and NBCUniversal with respect to
such Losses as if GE were the Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses;
_provided_ that any amounts recovered from Comcast or NBCUniversal with
respect to such Losses shall be paid to HoldCo or NBCUniversal, as applicable.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that the indemnification
provided for in this Article 9 is intended to indemnify the Indemnified
Parties only for Losses suffered or incurred by them directly and is not
intended to indemnify any Indemnified Party with respect to Losses suffered or
incurred solely by virtue of their direct or indirect equity ownership in
another Person (including any other Indemnified Party).

 

Section 9.08 _Mitigation_ _._ Each Indemnified Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss for which such
Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Agreement.

 



36 Section 9.09 _Third Party Remedies_ _._ If any Indemnified Party (or any
of their respective Affiliates) is at any time entitled (whether by reason of
a contractual right, a right to take or bring a legal action, availability of
insurance, or a right to require a payment discount or otherwise) to recover
from another Person any amount in respect of any matter giving rise to a Loss
(whether before or after the Indemnifying Party has made a payment to an
Indemnified Party hereunder and in respect thereof), the Indemnified Party
shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliate to use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to, (a) promptly notify the Indemnifying Party
and provide such information as the Indemnifying Party may require relating to
such right of recovery and the steps taken or to be taken by the Indemnified
Party in connection therewith and (b) keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably
informed of the progress of any action taken in respect thereof; _provided_
that for the avoidance of doubt, the actions required pursuant to clauses (a)
and (b) shall not be preconditions to recovery by any Indemnified Party from
an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement. Thereafter, any claim
against such Indemnifying Party shall be limited (in addition to the
limitations on the liability of the Indemnifying Party referred to in this
Agreement) to the amount by which the Losses suffered by the Indemnified Party
exceed the amounts so recovered by the Indemnified Party or any such
Affiliate. If the Indemnified Parties recover any amounts in respect of
Losses from any third party with respect to a matter as to which the
Indemnified Parties have recovered all of their Losses (whether pursuant to
this Article 9, from third parties or a combination of the foregoing) at any
time after the Indemnifying Party has paid all or a portion of such Losses to
the Indemnified Party pursuant to this provisions of this Article 9, Comcast
or GE, as applicable, shall, or shall cause such Indemnified Parties to
promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of receipt) pay over
to the Indemnifying Party the amount so received (to the extent previously
paid by the Indemnifying Party).

 

Section 9.10 _Limitation on Liability_ _._ In no event shall any party have
any liability to the other (including under this Article 9) for any
consequential, special, incidental, indirect or punitive damages or similar
items (or to the extent the same would constitute consequential or like
damages, lost profits) other than any such damages actually awarded to
a third party in connection with a Third Party Claim; _provided_ that such
limitations shall not limit the right of (a) Comcast, on the one hand, or (b)
GE, on the other hand, to recover contract damages in connection with the
failure of GE, NBCH or HoldCo (with respect to Comcasts right) or Comcast
(with respect to GEs right), to close in violation of this Agreement.

agreements of the parties hereto contained in or made pursuant to this

specified therein, except that breaches of any such covenants or agreements
shall survive indefinitely or until the latest date permitted by law.

Section 10.04 _Severability_ _._ If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or
as a matter of public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties to this Agreement shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

Section 10.05 _Entire Agreement_ _._ The Transaction Documents constitute the
entire agreement between the parties hereto and thereto with respect to the
subject matter of the Transaction Documents and supersede all prior
agreements, undertakings and understandings, both written and oral, between
or on behalf of the parties hereto and thereto, with respect to the subject
matter of the Transaction Documents; _provided_ that, except to the extent
amended, superseded or otherwise modified by the Transaction Documents, the
Initial Investment Agreements shall continue to constitute the agreement
between the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof. For
the avoidance of doubt, the representations and warranties set forth in the
Transaction Documents do not address the Real Estate Agreements or the
subject matter of the Real Estate Agreements. The parties hereto have
voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities and obligations
respecting the subject matter of this Agreement exclusively in
contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement; and
the parties hereto expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties not
expressly set forth in this Agreement. The sole and exclusive remedies for any
breach of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including any
representations and warranties set forth herein) shall be those remedies
provided for in this Agreement or available at Law or in equity for breach of
contract only (as such contractual remedies may be further limited or
excluded pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement); and the parties
hereto hereby waive and release any and all tort claims and causes of action
that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
tort claim

 



40  or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as
an inducement to enter into this Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Agreement shall constitute a waiver or release, or limit any
partys right to pursue any claim or remedy, with respect to intentional fraud
of another party.

 

Section 10.06 _Assignment_ _._ This Agreement shall not be assigned by
operation of Law or otherwise by any party hereto without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto, except that GE or Comcast may assign any
or all of their respective rights and obligations under this Agreement to any
of their respective Affiliates; _provided_ that no such assignment shall
release the applicable assignor from any liability or obligation under this
Agreement. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 10.06 shall
be void. This Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto and their permitted successors
and assigns.

Section 10.07 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_ _._ Except as provided in
Article 9 with respect to the Indemnified Parties, this Agreement is for the
sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their permitted successors
and assigns and nothing in this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.08 _Amendment_ _._ No provision of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, including any Annexes, Exhibits or Schedules thereto,
may be amended, supplemented or modified except by a written instrument making
specific reference hereto or thereto signed by all the parties to such
agreement. No consent from any Indemnified Party under Article 9 (other than
the parties hereto) shall be required in order to amend this Agreement.

Section 10.09 _Dispute Resolution_ _._ (a) Except as set forth in any other
Transaction Document, and except with respect to any request for equitable
relief (including interim relief) by any of the parties hereto on or prior to
the Closing Date, any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the validity,
interpretation, breach or termination of any such agreement, including claims
seeking redress or asserting rights under any Law (a "Dispute"), shall be
resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 10.09,
Section 10.10 and Section 10.14. Until completion of the procedures set forth
in Section 10.09(b), no party may take any action to force a resolution of a
Dispute by any judicial or similar process, except to the limited extent
necessary to (i) avoid expiration of a claim that might eventually be
permitted by this Agreement or (ii) obtain interim relief, including
injunctive relief, to preserve the status quo or prevent irreparable harm.

 



41 (b) Any party seeking resolution of a Dispute shall first submit the Dispute
to the relevant other parties. Each party agrees to confer and discuss in
good faith potential mutually agreeable resolutions to such Dispute, including
by designating an appropriate member of senior management to serve as its
representative in such discussions. Discussions will continue for at least 10
days following submission of the Dispute.

(c) All offers of compromise or settlement among the parties or their
Representatives in connection with the attempted resolution of any Dispute
shall be deemed to have been delivered in furtherance of a Dispute settlement
and shall be exempt from discovery and production and shall not be admissible
in evidence (whether as an admission or otherwise) in any proceeding for the
resolution of the Dispute.

 

Section 10.10 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers_. (a) Except
as otherwise set forth in the other Transaction Documents, this Agreement and
each other Transaction Document (and any claims, causes of action or disputes
that may be based upon, arise out of or relate hereto or thereto, to the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, to the negotiation, execution
or performance hereof or thereof, or to the inducement of any party to enter
herein and therein, whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or
otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or otherwise)
shall in all respects be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, including all matters of construction, validity
and performance, in each case without reference to any conflict of Law rules
that might lead to the application of the Laws of any other jurisdiction.

(b) Each of the parties hereto agrees that if any Dispute is not resolved by
discussions undertaken pursuant to Section 10.09, such Dispute shall be
resolved only in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (or if
unavailable, any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware or, if
unavailable, the Delaware Superior Court) and the appellate courts having
jurisdiction of appeals in such courts. In that context, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties hereto by this Agreement
irrevocably and unconditionally:

 

(i) submits for itself and its property in any Action relating to the
Transaction Documents, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect thereof, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the
State of Delaware (or if unavailable, any federal court sitting in the State
of Delaware or, if unavailable, the Delaware Superior Court), and appellate
courts having jurisdiction of appeals from any of the foregoing, and agrees
that all claims in respect of any such Action shall be heard and determined in
such Delaware court or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such federal
court; 

 



42 (ii) consents that any such Action may and shall be brought in such
courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
venue or jurisdiction of any such Action in any such court or that such Action
was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the
same;

 

(iii) agrees that service of process in any such Action may be effected by
mailing a copy of such process by registered or certified mail (or any
substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to such party at its
address as provided in Section 10.03; and

(iv) agrees that nothing in the Transaction Documents shall affect the right
to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by the Laws of the
State of Delaware.

 

Section 10.11 _Specific Performance_ _._ Each party hereto acknowledges and
agrees that the breach of this Agreement would cause irreparable damage to
the other parties hereto and that no party hereto will have an adequate remedy
at law. Therefore, the obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement
shall be enforceable by a decree of specific performance issued by any court
of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied
for and granted in connection therewith. Such remedies shall, however, be
cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies
which any party may have under this Agreement or otherwise.

Section 10.12 _Rules of Construction_ _._ Interpretation of the Transaction
Documents shall be governed by the following rules of construction: (a) words
in the singular shall be held to include the plural and vice versa, and words
of one gender shall be held to include the other gender as the
context requires; (b) references to the terms Article, Section, paragraph and
