"). Upon the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the

and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive:



(i) at the Closing:

(B) a payment in shares of Parent Common Stock (valued at the Closing Average
Stock Price) equal to the Initial Common Stock Stock Payment.



The payments set forth in subsections (i)(A) and (i)(B) above shall
hereinafter be referred to, collectively, as the " _Initial Common
Consideration_."



(ii) on the Second Payment Date, a payment in cash, Parent Common Stock or any
combination thereof, with the form of consideration at the sole election of
Parent, except that the amount of Parent Common Stock issued shall not be less
than the Second Payment Minimum Share Number (the " _Second Payment_ ") equal
to:



(A) a payment in shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (x) the Second
Payment Share Number, divided by (y) the Fully Diluted Company Common Stock
Number; and



(B) a cash payment equal to (x) (1) (I) $40.0 million, minus (II) the Second
Payment Holdback, minus (III) any Working Capital Shortfall payable pursuant
to Section 3.1(c) below, minus (IV) any Accountant Fees incurred in connection
with Section 3.1(b), minus (V) the Second Payment Date Determined Offsets, if
any, minus (VI) the Second Payment Date Claimed Offsets, if any
(provided that the Second Payment Date Determined Offsets and the Second
Payment Date Claimed Offsets shall in no event be more than the Maximum Second
Payment Date Offset), minus (2) the product of (I) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock issued to Company Common Stock Holders, Optionholders and
the Warrantholder in the Second Payment and (II) the Second Payment Average
Stock Price, divided by (y) the Fully Diluted Company Common Stock Number.



 

21 (iii) on the Third Payment Date, a payment in cash, Parent Common Stock or
any combination thereof, with the form of consideration at the sole election
of Parent, except that the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued
shall not be less than the Third Payment Minimum Share Number when aggregated
with the shares issued pursuant to subsections (i) and (ii) above (the "
_Third Payment_ ") equal to:



(A) a payment in shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (x) the Third Payment
Share Number, divided by (y) the Fully Diluted Company Common Stock Number;
and



(B) a cash payment equal to (x) (1) the Earnout Amount, minus (2) the product
of (I) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued to Company Common
Stock Holders, Optionholders and the Warrantholder in the Third Payment and
(II) the Third Payment Average Stock Price, minus (3) any Accountant Fees
incurred in connection with Section 3.2(c), divided by (y) the Fully Diluted
Company Common Stock Number.



(iv) on the Fourth Payment Date, a payment in cash, Parent Common Stock or any
combination thereof, with the form of consideration at the sole election of
Parent, except that the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued shall
not be less than the Fourth Payment Minimum Share Number when aggregated with
the shares issued pursuant to subsections (i), (ii) and (iii) above (the "
_Fourth Payment_ ") equal to:



(A) a payment in shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (x) the Fourth Payment
Share Number, divided by (y) the Fully Diluted Company Common Stock Number;
and



(B) a cash payment equal to (x) (1) (I) the Second Payment Holdback, minus
(II) the Fourth Payment Date Determined Offsets, if any, minus (III) the
Fourth Payment Date Claimed Offsets, if any (which difference pursuant to this
subsection (1) shall in no event be more than the Maximum Fourth Payment Date
Offset), minus (2) the product of (I) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock issued to Company Common Stock Holders, Optionholders and the
Warrantholder in the Fourth Payment and (II) the Fourth Payment Average Stock
Price, divided by (y) the Fully Diluted Company Common Stock Number. 



The payments set forth in subsections (ii), (iii) and (iv) above shall
hereinafter be referred to, collectively, as the " _Subsequent Common
Consideration_."



(b) _Cancellation of Stock Options_. Prior to the Effective Time of Merger I,
the Company shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to provide that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time of Merger I, each unexpired and
unexercised option or similar right to purchase Company Common Stock (each, a
" _Company Option_ "), under any stock option plan of the Company or any
other plan, agreement or arrangement (the " _Company Stock Option Plans_ "),
whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall be
entitled to receive (as promptly as



 

22 practicable after the Effective Time of Merger I), in consideration of the
cancellation of such Company Option and in settlement therefor:



(i) a payment in cash in an amount equal to the Initial Option Cash Payment,
multiplied by the total number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
subject to such Company Option;



 

(ii) a payment in shares of Parent Common Stock (valued at the Closing Average
Stock Price) in an amount equal to the Initial Common Stock Stock Payment,
multiplied by the total number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
subject to such Company Option (the amounts set forth in clauses (i) and (ii)
being referred to herein collectively as the " _Initial Option Payment_ ");
and



(iii) the right to receive the Subsequent Common Consideration in an amount
calculated with respect to the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously subject to such Company Option as if the former holder of any such
cancelled Company Option had been a holder of Company Common Stock at the
Effective Time of Merger I (the " _Subsequent Option Payment_ ," together with
the Initial Option Payment, the " _Option Payment_ ").



From and after the Effective Time of Merger I, any such cancelled Company
Option shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall
only entitle such holder to the payment of the Option Payment. Prior to the
Effective Time of Merger I, the Board of Directors of the Company shall
have taken all steps necessary to cancel the Company Options and provide for
automatic conversion of the Company Options into the right to receive the
Option Payment.



(c) _Cancellation of Company Warrant_. As of the date of this Agreement, the
Company has taken all actions necessary and appropriate to amend the warrant
to purchase Company Preferred Stock held by Silicon Valley Bancshares, dated
October 22, 2002 (the " _Company Warrant_ ") to provide that the Company
Warrant will be canceled effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time of Merger I and, in exchange therefor, Silicon Valley Bancshares shall be
entitled to receive (as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time of
Merger I), in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Warrant and
in settlement therefor:



(i) a payment in cash in an amount equal to the Initial Warrant Cash Payment,
multiplied by the total number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
subject to such Company Warrant;



(ii) a payment in shares of Parent Common Stock (valued at the Closing
Average Stock Price) in an amount equal to the Initial Common Stock Stock
Payment, multiplied by the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously subject to such Company Warrant (the amounts set forth in clauses
(i) and (ii) being referred to herein collectively as the " _Initial Warrant
Payment_ "); and



(iii) the right to receive the Subsequent Common Consideration in an amount
calculated with respect to that payable to a holder of 22,400 shares of
Company



 

23 Common Stock, as if Silicon Valley Bancshares had been a holder of Company
Common Stock at the Effective Time of Merger I (the " _Subsequent Warrant
Payment_ ," together with the Initial Warrant Payment, the " _Warrant Payment_
").



From and after the Effective Time of Merger I, the cancelled Company Warrant
shall no longer be exercisable by Silicon Valley Bancshares, but shall only
entitle Silicon Valley Bancshares to the payment of the Warrant Payment.



(d) _Cancellation of Treasury and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock held by the Company, Merger Subs or
Parent, or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or
Parent, immediately prior to the Effective Time of Merger I shall be canceled
and extinguished without any conversion thereof.



(e) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub I_. Each share of Common Stock, no par value
per share, of Merger Sub I issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time of Merger I shall be converted into and exchanged for one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, $0.001 par
value, of Surviving Entity I. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub I
evidencing ownership of any such shares shall, as of the Effective Time of
Merger I, evidence ownership of such shares of Common Stock of Surviving
Entity I.



(f) _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. If, between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time of Merger I, the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock or Parent Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of
shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Merger Consideration (including the formulas set forth in the calculation of
the Merger Consideration) shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the
holders of Company Common Stock the same total number and class of shares of
Parent Common Stock after the Effective Time of Merger I as such holders would
have owned had the Effective Time of Merger I occurred prior to such event and
such holders continued to hold such shares until after the event requiring
adjustment. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time of
Merger I, the shares of Company Common Stock into which the Company Options or
Company Warrant are exercisable as of the Effective Time of Merger I
are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock
split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, then the Option Payment and Warrant Payment (including the
formulas set forth in the calculation of the Option Payment and Warrant
Payment) shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Company
Options and Company Warrant the same total number and class of shares of
Parent Common Stock after the Effective Time of Merger I as such holders would
have owned had the Effective Time of Merger I occurred prior to such event and
such holders continued to hold such shares until after the event requiring
adjustment. If, between the Effective Time of Merger I and the Fourth Payment
Date the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock are changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division
or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation
of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction,
then the Merger Consideration (including the formulas set forth in the
calculation of the Merger Consideration) shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide the former



 

24 holders of Company Common Stock, former Optionholders and the former
Warrantholder the same total number and class of shares of Parent Common
Stock such holders would be entitled to receive as Subsequent Common
Consideration as such holders would be entitled to receive had the payment of
the Subsequent Common Consideration occurred prior to such event and
such holders continued to hold such shares until after the event requiring
adjustment.



(g) _Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock will be issued, and no certificates or scrip for any such
fractional shares shall be issued. In lieu thereof, (i) each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction
of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender of
such holders Certificate(s) (as defined in Section 2.6), receive from Parent
an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal
to the product of (A) such fraction, multiplied by (B) the Closing Average
Stock Price, in the case of a fraction at Closing, or the Second Payment
Average Stock Price, in the case of a fraction at the Second Payment Date, or
the Third Payment Average Stock Price, in the case of a fraction at the Third
Payment Date, or the Fourth Payment Average Stock Price, in the case of a
fraction at the Fourth Payment Date, and (ii) each holder of Company Options
or the holder of the Company Warrant who would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall,
upon cancellation of such holders Company Options or Company Warrant, as the
case may be, receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest
whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of (A) such fraction,
multiplied by (B) the Closing Average Stock Price, the Second Payment Average
Stock Price, the Third Payment Average Stock Price or the Fourth Payment
Average Stock Price, as the case may be.



(h) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each share of Company Common Stock (including, but not limited to,
each share of Company Preferred Stock converted into Company Common Stock)
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of Merger I
that are "dissenting shares" within the meaning of Section 1300(b) of the
California Corp. Code (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but the holder thereof
shall only be entitled to such rights as are provided by the California Corp.
Code, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses its
right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time of Merger I, such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or loses its right to appraisal, such Dissenting
Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time
of Merger I into a right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with
the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.



(i) _Lock-up._ The Holders who receive shares of Parent Common Stock as part
of the Initial Common Consideration, Initial Option Payment or
Initial Warrant Payment may not, with respect to fifty percent (50%) of the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued as part of the
Initial Common Consideration, Initial Option Payment or Initial Warrant
Payment, offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract
to



 

25 purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or
warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or
indirectly, any of such shares of Parent Common Stock issued to the Holder in
connection with Merger I (including any shares of capital stock of Parent
subsequently received in the event of a stock dividend, stock split,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination or exchange of shares of
capital stock of the Parent on, of or affecting the Parent Common Stock), or
enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole
or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the Parent
Common Stock, whether any such transaction described above is to be settled by
delivery of Parent Common Stock or such other securities, in cash or
otherwise, for a period of thirty (30) calendar days after the Closing Date
for twenty-five percent (25%) of such shares and a period of sixty (60)
calendar days after the Closing Date for an additional twenty-five percent
(25%) of such shares. All other shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant
to this Agreement will be freely transferable on the date of issuance. The
foregoing restriction shall not apply to shares of Parent Common Stock (i)
transferred as a bona fide gift or gifts, (ii) transferred to any trust for
the direct or indirect benefit of a Holder or the immediate family of a
Holder or (iii) transferred to partners, members, stockholders or affiliates
of a Holder, provided that the Holder is a partnership, limited liability

the transfer that the transferee execute an agreement stating that the
transferee is receiving and holding such capital stock subject to the
provisions of this Agreement (including this Section 2.5(i)) and there shall
be no further transfer of such shares except in accordance with this
Agreement, and provided further that any such transfer shall not involve a
disposition for value.

event later than five (5) Business Days after such surrender for any shares
issuable pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(i). Any certificate representing shares

to the lock-up provisions of Section 2.5(i).



(c) _Cancellation of Common Stock_. Upon surrender of each Certificate for
shares of Company Common Stock (including, but not limited to, each share of
Company Preferred Stock converted into Company Common Stock) and delivery by
Parent of cash and the shares of Parent Common Stock as Initial Common
Consideration to be delivered in exchange therefor, such Certificate for
shares of Company Common Stock shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so
surrendered, each Certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed for
all corporate purposes to evidence only the right to receive upon such
surrender or as promptly as practicable following the Second Payment Date,
Third Payment Date or Fourth Payment Date, as the case may be (i) the
aggregate number of shares into which the Company Common Stock represented
thereby shall have been converted in accordance with the terms and upon the
conditions of this Agreement, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to Section 2.5(g) and (ii) any cash payments payable under Section 2.5(a) of
this Agreement.



(d) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Common Stock_. No

such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends

I, if any, theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock.

Parent Common Stock delivered upon the surrender for exchange of Company
Common Stock (including, but not limited to, each share of Company Preferred
Stock converted into Company Common Stock) in accordance with the terms hereof

pertaining to such shares of Common Stock (including, but not limited to, each
share of Company Preferred Stock converted into Company Common Stock), and
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Common Stock
(including, but not limited to, each share of Company Preferred Stock
converted into Company Common Stock) that were outstanding immediately prior

If, after the Effective Time of Merger I, the Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this Article 2.

shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent Common Stock as may
be required; provided, however, that Parent may, in its sole discretion and
as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such

Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Holders.



ARTICLE 3.

Purchase Price Adjustment; Earnout; Shareholders Agents



Section 3.1 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.



(a) If the Effective Time of Merger I occurs on or prior to the 120th day
following the date of this Agreement, (i) as promptly as practicable, but no
later than ninety (90) calendar days after the Closing Date, Parent will cause
to be prepared in accordance with the Specified Accounting Principles (as
defined below) and delivered to either Shareholders Agent an unaudited
balance sheet of the Company as of the time immediately prior to the Closing
(the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and (ii) Parent will deliver to the Company,
or if the Effective Time of Merger I occurs after such date, on the Closing
Date, the Company will deliver to Parent a statement showing the Companys
reserve for Tax liability (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes
established to reflect differences between book and Tax income) for the
period between the date of the Interim Period Unaudited Company Balance Sheet
through the Closing Date (as determined in the last sentence of Section 8.2)
(the " _Tax Reserve Statement_ "). For purposes of this Agreement,
preparation in accordance with the " _Specified Accounting Principles_ " shall



 

29 mean (A) subject to clause (C) below, preparation in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with those used
in the preparation of the Interim Period Unaudited Company Balance Sheet, (B)
inclusion of line items substantially consistent with those in the Interim
Period Unaudited Company Balance Sheet, and (C) preparation in accordance
with accounting policies and practices consistent with those used in the
preparation of the Interim Period Unaudited Company Balance Sheet. " _Closing
Working Capital_ " means (x) current assets (including cash and
Cash Equivalents) of the Company, minus (y) (1) current liabilities of the
Company (including, but not limited to, any payment owed to any Representative
of the Company but not yet paid, the Company Bonus Accrual Amount and the
Piper Accrual Amount), but, excluding liabilities for Taxes, which shall be
reflected on the Tax Reserve Statement as of the time immediately prior to the
Closing, and also excluding liabilities resulting from unplanned expenditures
to support increased sales or production forecasts that have been previously
approved in writing by Parent, minus (2) long-term liabilities of the Company
as of the time immediately prior to the Closing.



(b) In the event that the Shareholders Agents shall dispute the information
set forth by Parent in the Closing Balance Sheet, then, within thirty (30)
calendar days following the date of the delivery by Parent of such Closing
Balance Sheet, the Shareholders Agents shall provide written notice to Parent
(the " _Working Capital Dispute Notice_ ") specifying the amount disputed and
the basis for the dispute, together with supporting documentation reflecting
the analysis of and justification for any recomputation made. In the event
that Parent shall dispute the information set forth by the Company in the Tax
Reserve Statement, then, within thirty (30) calendar days following the
Closing Date, Parent shall provide written notice to at least one of the
Shareholders Agents (the " _Tax Reserve Statement Dispute Notice_ ")
specifying the basis for the dispute, together with supporting documentation
reflecting the analysis of and justification for any recomputation made.
Parent and the Shareholders Agents shall make good faith efforts to
resolve any dispute relating to the Closing Balance Sheet or Tax Reserve
Statement, as the case may be, through negotiations for a period of thirty
(30) calendar days following the receipt of the written notice defining and
describing the nature of the dispute. In the event that the parties are
unable to finally resolve the dispute within such thirty- (30) calendar-day
period, the parties to the dispute may elect by mutual agreement to extend the
period of negotiation and may elect by mutual agreement to engage a mediator
to assist in such negotiation. To the extent that any matter remains
unresolved following negotiations (as determined by notice by any party to the
other parties), the Shareholders Agents and Parent shall jointly select an
independent accountant of recognized national standing to resolve any
remaining disagreements, which independent accountant shall not have provided
services to either of the Shareholders Agents, the Company, Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates during the five-year period preceding the date of
its selection (the " _Working Capital Independent Accountant_ " or " _Tax
Reserve Independent Accountant_ ," as the case may be). The Shareholders
Agents and Parent shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
to cause such Working Capital Independent Accountant or Tax Reserve
Independent Accountant, as the case may be, to make its determination within
sixty (60) calendar days of accepting its selection. The decision of the
Working Capital Independent Accountant or Tax Reserve Independent Accountant,
as the case may be, shall be a final, binding, and conclusive resolution of
the parties dispute, shall be non-appealable, and shall not be subject to
further review. The costs and expenses of the Working Capital



 

30 Independent Accountant shall be split between Parent and the Shareholders
Agents in proportion to the difference between the amount set forth in the
decision of the Working Capital Independent Accountant and the amount
reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet (with respect to Parents portion) and
the amount reflected in the Working Capital Dispute Notice (with respect to
the Shareholders Agents portion). In the event that the Shareholders Agents
do not pay their portion of the Working Capital Independent Accountants costs
and expenses, Parent shall be entitled to deduct the difference between the
Shareholders Agents portion of the costs and expenses of the Working Capital
Independent Accountant and the amount actually paid by the Shareholders
Agents to the Working Capital Independent Accountant from the Second Closing
Payment Amount. The costs and expenses of the Tax Reserve Independent
Accountant shall be split between Parent and the Shareholders Agents in
proportion to the difference between the amount set forth in the decision of
the Tax Reserve Independent Accountant and the amount reflected in the Tax
Reserve Statement (with respect to the Shareholders Agents portion) and the
amount reflected in the Tax Reserve Statement Dispute Notice (with respect
to Parents portion). In the event that the Shareholders Agents do not pay
their portion of the Tax Reserve Independent Accountants costs and expenses,
Parent shall be entitled to deduct the difference between the
Shareholders Agents portion of the costs and expenses of the Tax Reserve
Independent Accountant and the amount actually paid by the Shareholders
Agents to the Tax Reserve Independent Accountant from the Second Closing
Payment Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any case, the parties shall
be responsible for the payment of their respective costs and expenses,
including any attorneys and accountants fees (other than any accountants
fees payable to the Tax Reserve Independent Accountant or Working Capital
Independent Accountant, which shall be split between the parties in accordance
with this Section 3.1(b)) incurred in connection with the dispute.



(c) If the Effective Time of Merger I occurs on or prior to the 120th day
following the date of this Agreement and if Final Working Capital (as defined
below) is less than Minimum Working Capital (as defined below), then Parent
shall be entitled to deduct from the Aggregate Second Payment Amount in
accordance with Section 2.5(a)(ii)(B)(x)(3) above the amount by which Final
Working Capital is less than Minimum Working Capital (the " _Working Capital
Shortfall_ "). If Final Working Capital exceeds Maximum Working Capital, then
no Working Capital Shortfall shall be payable in accordance with
Section 2.5(a)(ii)(B)(x)(3) above and Parent shall cause to be paid to the
Holders the amount by which Final Working Capital exceeds Maximum Working
Capital (as defined below) concurrently with the Aggregate Second Payment
Amount. In the event that neither of the conditions set forth in the previous
two sentences exist, then no offset or payment shall be made. No such offset
or payment shall be made if the Effective Time of Merger I does not occur on
or prior to the 120th day following the date of this Agreement; provided that
the Company is not responsible in whole or in part for the Effective Time of
Merger I not occurring on or prior to the 120th day following the date of this
Agreement. " _Minimum Working Capital_ " means (i) $1.5 million in the event
the Effective Time of Merger I occurs on or prior to the 60th day following
the date of this Agreement, (ii) negative $250,000 in the event the Effective
Time of Merger I occurs after the 60th day and on or prior to the 90th day
following the date of this Agreement, and (iii) negative $750,000 in the event
the Effective Time of Merger I occurs after the 90th day and on or prior to
the 120th day



 

31 following the date of this Agreement. " _Maximum Working Capital_ " means (i)
$1.5 million in the event the Effective Time of Merger I occurs on or prior
to the 60th day following the date of this Agreement, (ii) $750,000 in the
event the Effective Time of Merger I occurs after the 60th day and on or prior
to the 90th day following the date of this Agreement, and (iii) $250,000 in
the event the Effective Time of Merger I occurs after the 90th day and on or
prior to the 120th day following the date of this Agreement. " _Final Working
Capital_ " means Closing Working Capital as shown in Parents calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 3.1(a), if no Working Capital Dispute Notice is
duly delivered pursuant to Section 3.1(b); or if a Working Capital Dispute
Notice is duly delivered, as finally determined pursuant to Section 3.1(b);
provided that, in no event shall Final Working Capital be less than Parents
calculation of Closing Working Capital set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet
delivered pursuant to Section 3.1(a) or more than the Shareholders Agents
calculation of Closing Working Capital set forth in the Working Capital
Dispute Notice delivered pursuant to Section 3.1(b).



Section 3.2 _Earnout_.



(a) _Earnout Payment_. As promptly as practicable after the end of the Earnout
Period, but in no event later than forty-five (45) calendar days following
December 31, 2005, Parent shall provide either Shareholders Agent with a
report, setting forth the Net Revenue for the Earnout Period and the form of
consideration of the Third Payment as elected by Parent pursuant to
Section 2.5(a)(iii) above (the " _Earnout Report_ "). If an Earnout Dispute
Notice is not delivered pursuant to Section 3.2(c) below, then in no event
later than ten (10) Business Days following the expiration of the Earnout
Dispute Period, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid the Earnout Amount in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If, at any time prior to the
expiration of the Earnout Dispute Period, the Shareholders Agents jointly
notify Parent in writing that they agree with all of the information and
calculations set forth by Parent in the Earnout Report and irrevocably agrees
on behalf of the Holders that the Shareholders Agents and the Holders will
not dispute any information set forth by Parent in the Earnout Report (the "
_Shareholders  Agents Notice_"), then Parent shall pay or cause to be paid
the Earnout Amount in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, within ten
(10) Business Days following the date of receipt of the Shareholders Agents
Notice.



(b)  _Books and Records_. Parent shall keep full, clear and accurate books
and records with respect to the Company Business. The books and records shall
be maintained in such a manner that Net Revenue shall be readily verifiable.
All books and records with respect to the Company Business shall be available
for inspection by the Shareholders Agents or any attorney or accountant
engaged by the Shareholders Agents to act on behalf of the Holders, in all
cases upon reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours. The
information contained in the books and records of Parent with respect to the
Company Business shall remain confidential. If the Shareholders Agents do not
jointly deliver to Parent an Earnout Dispute Notice (as defined below) as set
forth in Section 3.2(c) below, then the Earnout Report for the Earnout Period
shall be deemed final and binding and neither the Shareholders Agents nor the
Holders shall have any further right to contest the report, the computation
of Net Revenue or payment of the Earnout Amount.



(c) _Dispute_. In the event that the Shareholders Agents shall dispute the
information set forth by Parent in the Earnout Report, then, within thirty
(30) calendar days following the date of the delivery by Parent of such
report, the Shareholders Agents shall jointly provide written notice to
Parent (the " _Earnout Dispute Notice_ ") specifying the amount disputed and
the basis for the dispute, together with supporting documentation reflecting
the analysis of and justification for any recomputation made. Parent and the
Shareholders Agents shall make good faith efforts to resolve the dispute
through negotiations for a period of thirty (30) calendar



 

32 days following the receipt of the written notice defining and describing the
nature of the dispute. In the event that the parties are unable to finally
resolve the dispute within such thirty (30) calendar-day period, the parties
to the dispute may elect by mutual agreement to extend the period of
negotiation and may elect by mutual agreement to engage a mediator to assist
in such negotiation. To the extent that any matter remains unresolved
following negotiations (as determined by notice by any party to the other
parties), the Shareholders Agents and Parent shall jointly select an
independent accountant of recognized national standing to resolve any
remaining disagreements, which independent accountant shall not have provided
services to either Shareholders Agent, the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates during the five-year period preceding the date of its
selection, except for any fees incurred pursuant to Section 3.1 of this
Agreement (the " _Independent Accountant_ "). The Shareholders Agents and
Parent shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause
such Independent Accountant to make its determination within sixty (60)
calendar days of accepting its selection. Within ten (10) Business Days after
the date of determination of such Independent Accountant, Parent shall pay or
cause to be paid to the Holders the Second Payment Amount in the manner set
forth herein, subject to the right of offset provisions of Article 11 below.
The decision of the Independent Accountant shall be a final, binding, and
conclusive resolution of the parties dispute, shall be non-appealable, and
shall not be subject to further review. The costs and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be split between Parent and the Shareholders
Agents in proportion to the difference between the amount set forth in the
decision of the Independent Accountant and the amount reflected in the Earnout
Report (with respect to Parents portion) and the amount reflected in the
Earnout Dispute Notice (with respect to the Shareholders Agents portion).
In the event that the Shareholders Agents do not pay their respective amount
of the Independent Accountants costs and expenses, Parent shall be entitled
to deduct the difference between the Shareholders Agents portion of the
costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant and the amount actually paid
by the Shareholders Agents to the Independent Accountant from the Earnout
Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any case, the parties shall be
responsible for the payment of their respective costs and expenses, including
any attorneys and accountants fees (other than any accountants fees payable
to the Independent Accountant, which shall be split between the parties in
accordance with this Section 3.1(d)) incurred in connection with the dispute.



(d) _Operation of Business_. The Holders will be deemed to, as part of their
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein, and the Shareholders Agents hereby, generally, irrevocably,
unconditionally and completely agree that Surviving Entity and Parent (as the
sole shareholder of the Company as of the Effective Time of Merger I) and each
of their respective Affiliates shall, except as specifically provided by this
Section 3.2(d), be entitled to operate the Company Business after the
Effective Time as they determine in their sole and absolute discretion, and
shall have no obligation to operate the Company Business in any manner that
would maximize, maintain or protect the Earnout Payment; provided, however,
that Parent hereby covenants and agrees that from the Effective Time of Merger
I through the last day of the Earnout Period: 



(i) Parent shall not act in bad faith in the operation of the Company
Business with the purpose of reducing the Earnout Amount as contemplated by
this Agreement;



 

33 (ii) The sales representatives that are not employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries will be paid sales commissions on sales of Company Products at
an average percentage rate that is no less than ninety-five percent (95%) of
the average percentage rate of sales commissions payable with respect to other
sports medicine products of Parent;



(iii) Parent will market the Company Products at the same sports medicine
trade shows at which Parent markets other sports medicine products of Parent
and Parent will spend at least an aggregate of $1.0 million on Marketing
Activities between the Closing and December 31, 2005; 



(iv) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain sufficient
inventory of the Company Products to meet at least eighty-five percent (85%)
of the current forecasted demand (as forecasted from time to time by Parent in
its ordinary course of business in its sole and absolute discretion) for such
Company Products, subject to Force Majeure Events or the failure of Parents
supplier(s) to meet Parents requirements to manufacture the Company Products;



(v) Parent shall sell the Company Products through a sales force for the
Company Products in the United States, Germany, Austria, France and the
United Kingdom (the " _Sales Force_ ") which will be selected and maintained
by Parent at its sole and absolute discretion, provided that at least fifty
percent (50%) of Parents sports medicine product sales force selling
Parents Coblation-based RF products (as measured by Parents gross product
revenue with respect to its sports medicine products, excluding the Company
Products) will also sell the Company Products and shall be included as part
of the Sales Force; and



(vi) Parent shall hold at least six (6) training events with respect to
Company Products for its Sales Force in the United States within three (3)
months of Closing (each, a " _Training Event_ ") with attendance by at
least fifty percent (50%) of the Sales Force that has not previously been
trained by the Company prior to the Closing.



(e) _Bankruptcy; Change of Control; Breaches_. In the event that (i) Parent
applies for, consents to, or acquiesces in the appointment of a
trustee, receiver or other custodian for Parent, or a substantial part of the
property of Parent, or makes a general assignment for the benefit of
creditors, or if any bankruptcy, reorganization, debt arrangement or other
proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or any dissolution or
liquidation proceeding is instituted by or against Parent and is not dismissed
within thirty (30) days, or (ii) a Parent Change of Control is consummated or
Parent consummates a spin-off or a sale of the Company Business, the Earnout
Amount payable pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall in any case be based on at
least $40.0 million of Net Revenue, regardless of the actual Net Revenue
recognized during the Earnout Period. If the actual Net Revenue for
the Earnout Period exceeds $40.0 million then an additional Earnout Payment
shall be made such that the total Earnout Payment shall equal the amount that
would have been payable in the absence of the events described in clauses (i)
and (ii) of the first sentence of this Section 3.2(e). The parties hereby
agree that in the case of the events described in clause (i) or (ii) above
occurs, the damages to the Company are not reasonably capable of being
determined, and therefore the parties intend such payment to be



 

34 liquidated damages and not a penalty. The Earnout Amount payable under the
foregoing sentence shall become immediately payable to the Holders, other
than those who held Dissenting Shares. In the case of any material breach by
Parent of its obligations under Section 3.2(d), the Company shall be entitled
to assert recovery and be awarded its damages (including damages based on the
Earnout Amount that would have been received but for Parents breach of
Section 3.2(d)) according to proof, but Parent shall not in such case be
liable for consequential or punitive damages.



(f) _Access to Management_. Upon reasonable notice and at a reasonable time
and location, the Shareholders Agents will be provided access to management
of Parent on at least a quarterly basis during the Earnout Period to review
information with respect to Parents compliance with the covenants set forth
in subsection (d) above.



(g) _Payment of Earnout_. If any Earnout Amount is determined to be payable,
Parent shall, on the Third Payment Date, cause the Earnout Amount to be (i)
delivered to each of the Holders entitled thereto by check mailed to the
record address on file with the Company of each Holder pursuant to Sections
2.5(a)(iii)(B), 2.5(b) or 2.5(c) or (ii) paid to each of the Holders entitled
thereto by the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section
2.5(a)(iii)(A), 2.5(b) or 2.5(c) of this Agreement as of the close
of business on the last Business Day prior to such Earnout Payment Date. The
determination by Parent of any Earnout Amount pursuant to the procedures set

Securities Act, and has previously provided or made available to the Company
true and complete copies of all reports filed by Parent with the SEC since

respective dates, complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and none of such SEC Reports, as of its date, contained any untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except to the
extent that information contained in such SEC Reports has been revised,
supplemented, amended or superceded by later-filed SEC Reports, or has
otherwise become immaterial, none of the Parent SEC Reports contains any
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The financial statements of Parent, including the notes thereto,

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (c) has approved
and determined to recommend that the stockholders of Parent vote to approve

otherwise acquire any Parent Common Stock issued to the Shareholders pursuant
to this Agreement following the Transaction.

following the Transaction, Parent, or a member of its qualified group of
corporations (as defined by Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)),
will continue the historic business of the Company (or, alternatively, if the
Company has more than one line of business, will continue at least one
significant line of the Companys historic business) or use a significant
portion of the Companys historic business assets in a business, in a manner
consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d) (provided, however,
that in the event that Section 4.33(a) is or has been breached, this Section
5.9(c) shall not be considered to be or have been breached).

Merger Sub II has any plan or intention: (i) to merge Merger Sub II into
another entity; (ii) to sell or otherwise dispose of any membership interests
in Merger Sub II or to otherwise take any action or permit any action to be
taken that would result in Merger Sub II ceasing to be an entity wholly-owned
by Parent that is disregarded as separate from Parent for federal income tax
purposes; or (iii) to sell or otherwise dispose of any of the assets of
Company acquired in the Transaction, except that Parent or Merger Sub II, as
appropriate, may (v) make dispositions made in the ordinary course of

provisions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(iii)(B).

existing between Parent (or any member of Parents affiliated group within the
meaning of Section 1504) and Company (or any member of Companys affiliated
group within the meaning of Section 1504), or between Merger Subs and
Company, that was issued, acquired, or will be settled at a discount. Parent
will assume no liabilities of any Company stockholder in connection with the
Transaction.



(f) _Investment Company_. Parent is not an investment company within
the meaning of Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv).

and Merger Subs will pay their respective expenses, if any, incurred in

Shareholders of the Company will be assumed by Parent, and Parent will not
assume any liens, encumbrances or any similar liabilities relating to any
Company capital stock acquired by Parent in the Transaction.



(h) _Acquisitions of Company Shares_. Neither Parent nor, to the Knowledge of
Parent, any person related to Parent (within the meaning of Treasury

cooperate with one another to obtain as promptly as practicable the approval

67 whatsoever the Commissioner does not render a Fairness Approval of the terms

Common Stock to be issued in connection with Merger I, which shall be in form
and substance satisfactory to Parent (but with advance copies provided to the
Company for its review and comment, which such comments shall be promptly
conveyed by the Company to Parent). Each of Parent and the Company will use
all commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC.
Parent will notify the Company promptly of the receipt of any comments from
the SEC and of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the

obtain from any Governmental Authority any consents, licenses, permits,
waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained or made
by Parent, Merger Subs or the



 

68 Company, or to avoid any action or proceeding by any Governmental Authority
(including, without limitation, those in connection with the HSR Act, in
which case each party agrees to make the requisite filing(s) under the HSR Act
within ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement), in
connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, (d) to execute
any documents, instruments or conveyances of any kind which may be reasonably
necessary or advisable to carry out any of the transactions contemplated
hereunder and thereunder (including, without limitation, those in connection
with the HSR Act) and (e) to cooperate with each other in connection with any
actions deemed necessary to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement (including, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, providing copies of draft filings to the non-filing party
prior to filing and considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested in connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry of any of Governmental Authority with respect
to any such filing or any such transaction. The parties hereto will consult
and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto under the HSR
Act or other Applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties agree
to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts (i) to promptly seek
to obtain any Consents that the parties consider to be reasonably necessary
(including, without limitation, the making of all filings required to be made
under the HSR Act and/or with any U.S. or foreign Governmental Authority with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby), (ii) to
give all notices to, and make all registrations and filings with third
parties, including submissions of information requested by U.S. and foreign
Governmental Authorities that the parties agree are reasonably necessary and
(iii) to fulfill all other conditions to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (y) no amendment or modification shall be made to any Contract
to obtain any required Consent without the prior written consent of Parent
and (z) no party hereto or any of their respective Affiliates shall be
required to sell, transfer, divest or otherwise dispose of any of its
respective business, assets or properties in connection with this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party shall deliver
customary closing certificates and representations for the purpose of
facilitating delivery of the opinions of counsel contemplated by this
Agreement.



Section 7.10 _Directors_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the directors of the Company to resign, effective as of the Effective
Time of Merger I.



Section 7.11 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.



 

(a) From and after the Closing, Parent will cause the Surviving Entity to
fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of Company pursuant to
any indemnification provision under the Companys Articles of Incorporation
and the Companys Bylaws on the date of this Agreement (the persons to be
indemnified pursuant to the provisions referred to in this Section 7.11(a)
shall be referred to as, collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "). The
Articles of Organization and Operating Agreement of the Surviving Entity shall
contain the provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation from
liability set forth in the Companys Articles of Incorporation and the
Companys Bylaws on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the
Closing in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any Indemnified Party.



 

69 (b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 7.11(a), during the period
ending six years after the Closing, Parent will indemnify and hold harmless
each Indemnified Party against and from any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to (1) any action
or omission or alleged action or omission in his or her capacity as a
director or officer of the Company (regardless of whether such action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, on or after the
Closing Date) or (2) any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Closing, any Indemnified Party delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a
claim for indemnification under this Section 7.11(b), then the claim asserted
in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Closing until such
time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) Parent will have the
right to control the defense thereof after the Closing (it being understood
that, by electing to control the defense thereof, Parent will be deemed to
have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Parties entitlement
to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto), (ii) any counsel retained
by the Indemnified Parties with respect to the defense thereof for any period
after the Closing must be reasonably satisfactory to Parent and (iii) after
the Closing, Parent will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel, promptly after statements therefor are received (provided that in the
event that any Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder,
any amounts advanced on his or her behalf shall be remitted to the Surviving
Entity); provided, however, that neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity nor
any Indemnified Party will be liable for any settlement effected without its
express written consent. The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only
one law firm (in addition to local counsel) to represent them with respect to
any single action unless counsel for any Indemnified Party determines in good
faith that, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a
conflict exists or is reasonably likely to arise on any material issue
between the positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.11(b) or elsewhere in
this Agreement, Parent agrees that it will not settle or compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with
respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation for which
indemnification may be sought under this Agreement unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all
Indemnified Parties from all liability arising out of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation.



(c) For a period of six years after the Closing, the Surviving Entity
shall cause to be maintained in effect, for the benefit of all persons
covered thereby, the current policy of directors and officers and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that the Surviving
Entity may substitute therefor a policy of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to
former officers and directors of the Company) only with respect to claims
arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Closing;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving Entity be required to
expend pursuant to this Section 7.11 more than an aggregate amount equal to
$18,000 (the " _Maximum Amount_ "). If the amount of the aggregate premiums
necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum
Amount, the Surviving Entity during such six-year period shall maintain or
procure as much coverage as possible for aggregate premiums not to exceed
the Maximum Amount.



 

70 (d) Parent and the Surviving Entity jointly and severally agree to pay all
expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the Indemnified
Parties in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this
Section 7.12.



Section 7.13 _NASD Compliance_. In no event shall Parent issue shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement if the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued would result in the issuance of a number
of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement that is equal to
or in excess of twenty percent (20%) of the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock outstanding as of the date of this Agreement without first obtaining
shareholder approval pursuant to NASD Rule 4350(i)(C).



Section 7.14 _Parent Stockholder Approval_. Parent shall seek stockholder
approval of the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant
to Sections 2.5(a)(ii), 2.5(a)(iii), 2.5(a)(iv), 2.5(b) and 2.5(c) at the
2005 Annual Meeting. Parents proxy statement with respect to the 2005 Annual
Meeting will contain a recommendation of the Board of Directors of Parent that
the stockholders of Parent vote to approve such issuance of shares of Parent
Common Stock, unless the making of such recommendation would reasonably be
likely to result in a breach of the Board of Directors of Parents fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of Parent.



Section 7.15 _Employee Benefits_. With respect to each benefit plan, program,
practice, policy or arrangement maintained by Parent or a subsidiary of Parent
in which employees of the Company subsequently participate (the "Parent
Plans"), for purposes of determining eligibility, vesting and entitlement to
benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation entitlement, service
with the Company (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides
past service credit) shall be treated as service with Parent, provided, that
such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits or to the extent that such service was not
recognized under the applicable Company Benefit Plan. As of the Effective Time
of Merger I, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, credit to employees
of the Company the amount of vacation time that such employees had accrued
under any applicable Company Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time of Merger
I, subject to any cap on vacation accrual set forth in Parents vacation
policy, provided that the accrued vacation time of each such employee in
excess of such cap shall be paid as soon as practicable to such employee at
the employees compensation rate in effect as of the Effective Time of Merger
I. Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause to be waived any waiting
periods, evidence of insurability requirements or the application of any
preexisting condition limitations under any Parent Plans. Employees of the
Company shall be given credit for amounts paid under a similar Company Benefit
Plan during the plan year that includes the Effective Time for purposes of
applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though
such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Parent Plan for the plan year in which the Effective Time of Merger I occurs.
Parent shall pay or cause to be paid the bonuses described on _Schedule 7.15_
of this Agreement consistent with the Companys past practice.



 

71 ARTICLE 8.

Tax Matters



Section 8.1  _Tax Periods Ending on or before the Closing Date_ _._ Parent
shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax
Returns for the Company for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, which are filed after the Closing Date. Parent shall permit the
Shareholders Agents to review and comment on each such Tax Return described
in the preceding sentence prior to filing and shall make such revisions to
such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the Shareholders Agents.
Parent shall be reimbursed for Taxes with respect to such periods by
offsetting from the amount payable to the Holders in the Aggregate Second
Payment Amount, Second Payment Holdback or Fourth Payment Amount, in
each case as more fully set forth in Article 11 below, except to the extent
that such Taxes are reflected in the Final Tax Reserve Statement.



Section 8.2 _Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date_
_._ Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed any Tax Returns of the Company for Tax periods which begin before the
Closing Date and end after the Closing Date. Parent shall be reimbursed in an
amount equal to the portion of such Taxes which relates to the portion of such
Taxable period ending on the Closing Date by offsetting from the amount
payable to the Holders in the Aggregate Second Payment Amount, Second Payment
Holdback or Fourth Payment Amount, in each case as more fully set forth in
Article 11 below, except to the extent that such Taxes are reflected in the
Final Tax Reserve Statement. For purposes of the preceding sentence, in the
case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a
Tax period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion
of such Tax that relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the
Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or
related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Tax period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (ii)
in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed
equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on
the Closing Date. __



Section 8.3 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_ _._ Parent, the Company and the
Shareholders Agents shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to this Agreement and any audit, litigation or administrative,
judicial or other inquiry or proceeding with respect to Taxes (the " _Tax
Contest_ "). Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
partys request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any Tax Contest and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Parent, the Company and the Shareholders Agents
agree (a) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company relating to any Tax period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by Parent, any extensions thereof) of the respective Tax
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with
any Tax authority or other Governmental Authority, (b) to deliver or make
available to Parent, within sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date,
copies of all such books and records, and (c) to give the other party
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any



 

72 such books and records and, if the other party so requests, Parent, the
Company or the Shareholders Agents, as the case may be, shall allow the
other party to take possession of such books and records at such other partys
expense. Parent and the Shareholders Agents further agree, upon request, to
use their best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited
to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

 



Section 8.4 _Contest Provisions_ _._ If, subsequent to the Closing, any of
Parent or the Company receives notice of a Tax Contest with respect to any Tax
Return for a Tax period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing
Date, then within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of such
notice, Parent shall notify the Shareholders Agents of such notice. The
Shareholders Agents shall have the right to control the conduct and
resolution of such Tax Contest, provided, however, that if any of the issues
raised in such Tax Contest could have an impact on Taxes of the Company for a
Tax period or portion thereof beginning on or after the Closing Date (a "
_Post-Closing Tax Period_ "), then the Shareholders Agents shall afford
Parent the opportunity to control jointly the conduct and resolution of the
portion of such Tax Contest which could have an impact on Taxes of the Company
in any Post-Closing Tax Period. If the Shareholders Agents shall have the
right to control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest but elect in
writing not to do so, then Parent shall have the right to control the conduct
and resolution of such Tax Contest, provided that Parent shall keep at least
one of the Shareholders Agents informed of all developments on a timely
basis. Each party shall bear its own costs for participating in such Tax
Contest. To the extent the Company incurs any costs for participating in the
Tax Contest, Parent shall have the right to offset the amount payable to the
Holders from the Aggregate Second Payment Amount, Second Payment Holdback or
Fourth Payment Amount, as more fully set forth in Article 11 below by the
amount of the costs so incurred.



Section 8.5 _Reorganization Matters_.



(a) The parties intend the Transaction to qualify as a reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Code. However, neither Parent nor the Company makes any
representation or warranty to the other or to any Shareholder regarding the
tax treatment of the Transaction or whether the Transaction will qualify as a
"reorganization" under the Code. Each of the Company, the Shareholders and
Parent acknowledges that it is relying on its own advisors in connection with
the Tax treatment of the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The Company, the Shareholders and Parent each agree to use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Transaction to
qualify, and will not take any actions which to their Knowledge could
reasonably be expected to prevent the Transaction from qualifying, as
a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code.



(b) This Agreement is intended to constitute, and the parties hereto hereby
adopt this Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). Provided that
the representations set forth in Sections 4.33 and 5.9 are true as of the
Closing Date and that the Continuity Ratio equals at least forty percent
(40%), each of Parent and the Company shall report the Transaction as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, unless
otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code.



 

73 Section 8.6 _Certain Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other substantially similar Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement
(collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be paid by the Shareholders when
due, and the Shareholders will, at their own expense, file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and,
if required by applicable law, Parent will, and will cause its affiliates to,
join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The
Shareholders shall (i) provide Parent with evidence satisfactory to Parent
that such Transfer Taxes have been paid by the Shareholders and (ii) use their
best efforts to provide Parent at Closing with a clearance certificate
or similar document(s) which may be required by any state taxing authority to
relieve Parent of any obligation to withhold any portion of the payments to
the Shareholders pursuant to this Agreement.



Section 8.7 _FIRPTA Certificate_ _._ On or prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall have delivered to Parent a form of notice to the Internal
Revenue Service in accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.897-2(h)(2) and in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent along with written authorization for Parent to deliver such notice
form to the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of the Company upon the Closing
of the Transaction.



Section 8.8 _Carrybacks_. The parties agree and acknowledge that any net
operating losses or similar Tax attribute of the Company is an asset
of Parent that (subject to any applicable limitations imposed by Law) is
being acquired by Parent pursuant to the Transaction, and that the Company and
Parent, as applicable, shall not elect to carry back any such Tax attributes
to prior years of the Company or otherwise act so as to limit the ability of
Parent to use such attributes subsequent to the Transaction.



Section 8.9 _Treatment of Offset_. Any offset against the Aggregate Second
Payment Amount, Second Payment Holdback or Fourth Payment Amount,
in accordance with Article 11 shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration and shall be treated as such by Parent,
the Merger Subs, the Company and the Shareholders on their Tax Returns to the
extent permitted by Law. 



ARTICLE 9.

related transactions contemplated by this Agreement are subject, in

ARTICLE 11.

Survival of Representations and Warranties; Right of Offset



 

Section 11.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. Each statement
contained in any Schedule or certificate delivered by or on behalf of the
Company pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be a representation and
warranty by the Company contained in this



 

77 Agreement. The representations and warranties of the Company contained in
Article 4 of the Merger Agreement shall survive the Effective Time of Merger
I until January 15, 2006 (the " _Survival Period_ "); provided, however, in
the case of actual fraud, intentional misrepresentation or criminal activity,
the representations and warranties of the Company shall survive until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Any claims under this
Agreement with respect to a breach of a representation or warranty must be
asserted by written notice within the applicable survival period contemplated
by this Section 11.1, and if such a notice is given, the survival period for
such representation and warranty shall continue, solely with respect to such
claim, until the claim is fully resolved. The right to recovery or other
remedy based on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
herein will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or
any knowledge acquired by Parent or Merger Subs (or capable of being acquired)
at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or
compliance with any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. All
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall be deemed to have been made again by the Company at and as of the
Closing Date (except for representations and warranties made as of a certain
date, which shall be made as of such date). The waiver of any condition based
on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or agreement, will not affect the right to
recovery or other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements, unless such right is also expressly waived.



Section 11.2 _Rights of Offset_.



(a) Parent shall be entitled to offset against the Aggregate Second Payment
Amount, an amount equal to the amount of any damage, claim, loss, cost or
expense, including, without limitation, interest, penalties, reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses of investigation, response action, removal
action or remedial action (including any consequential or punitive damages)
(collectively, " _Breach Damages_ ") incurred by Parent and its respective
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Entity), and each of
its respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, partners and
agents (the " _Covered Parties_ ") that arise out of or relate to, whether
directly or indirectly (i) any misrepresentation (provided that, for purposes
of this Section 11.2(a), any representation qualified by materiality shall not
be so qualified) or breach of any warranty on the part of the Company
contained in this Agreement or in any Schedule or certificate delivered by or
on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement, or (ii) any breach or
non-performance by the Company of any of its respective covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement or in any Schedule or certificate
delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement. The term
" _Breach Damages_ " as used in this Section 11.2 is not limited to matters
asserted by third parties against the Covered Parties, but includes Breach
Damages incurred or sustained by such persons in the absence of third-party
claims, and payments by a Covered Party shall not be a condition precedent to
recovery. Parent shall be entitled to offset pursuant to this subsection (a)
only if the aggregate Breach Damages to which Covered Parties are entitled to
offset pursuant to this Article 11 exceed $500,000 (the " _Deductible Amount_
"), and if such aggregate Breach Damages exceed the Deductible Amount, Parent
shall be entitled to offset against the Aggregate Second Payment Amount only
the amount of Breach Damages in excess of the Deductible Amount.



 

78 (b) For the period of 24 months following the Closing, Parent shall be
entitled to offset against the Aggregate Second Payment Amount or the Second
Payment Holdback, an amount equal to the amount of any damage, claim, loss,
cost, Tax liability or expense, including, without limitation, interest,
penalties, reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of investigation, response
action, removal action or remedial action (including any consequential or
punitive damages) (collectively, " _Damages_ ") incurred by the Covered
Parties that arise out of or relate to, whether directly or indirectly: (i)
(A) any and all Taxes of the Company with respect to any Tax year or portion
thereof ending on or before the Closing Date (or for any Tax year beginning
before and ending after the Closing Date to the extent allocable
(as determined in the last sentence of Section 8.2) to the portion of such
period beginning before and ending on the Closing Date), except to the extent
that such Taxes are reflected in the Final Tax Reserve Statement; (B) the
unpaid Taxes of any Person (other than the Company) under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise, with
respect to any Tax year portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date
(or for any Tax year beginning before and ending after the Closing Date to the
extent allocable (as determined in the last sentence of Section 8.2) to the
portion of such period beginning before and ending on the Closing Date),
and (C) any and all Damages incurred in connection with, arising out of,
resulting from, or incident to any of the Taxes described in the foregoing
clauses (A) and (B) or (ii) IP Claims. The term " _Damages_ " as used in this
Section 11.2(b) is not limited to matters asserted by third parties against
the Covered Parties, but includes Damages incurred or sustained by such
persons in the absence of third-party claims, and payments by a Covered Party
shall not be a condition precedent to recovery.



Section 11.3 _Mechanics Relating to Offset_.



(a) In the event that Parent seeks an offset under Section 11.2 hereunder, it
shall, within the limitation period provided for in Section 11.2 above, give
to at least one of the Shareholders Agents a notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ")
describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claims for
offset under Section 11.2 hereunder (the " _Offset Claim_ "), to the best of
its understanding, and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the
amount or the method of computation of the amount of such claim, and a
reference to the provision of this Agreement or any agreement, certificate or
instrument executed pursuant hereto or in connection herewith upon which such
claim is based; provided, however, that a Claim Notice in respect of
any action at law or suit in equity by or against a third Person as to which
recovery will be sought shall be given promptly after the action or suit is
commenced; and provided further, that failure to give such notice shall not
prejudice the rights of Parent hereunder except to the extent that the
Holders shall have been materially prejudiced by such failure. In the event
that any Claim Notice is delivered and thereafter any amount is required to be
paid hereunder, Parent shall be entitled to holdback from the Aggregate
Second Payment Amount with respect to any Claim Notice relating to Breach
Damages under Section 11.2(a) and the Aggregate Second Payment Amount, Second
Payment Holdback or the Fourth Payment Amount with respect to any Claim
Notice relating to Damages under Section 11.2(b) that portion of the Aggregate
Second Payment Amount, Second Payment Holdback or Fourth Payment Amount equal
to the amount of outstanding claims (as determined by Parent in good faith, in
its sole discretion) until such time as Parents right to make an offset
under Section 11.2 has been finally resolved.



 

79 (b) The Shareholders Agents shall have sixty (60) calendar days after receipt
of any Claim Notice by at least one of the Shareholders Agents pursuant
hereto to (i) agree to the amount or method of determination set forth in the
Claim Notice and agree that the amount set forth in the Claim Notice shall be
offset by Parent against the Aggregate Second Payment Amount with respect to
any Claim Notice relating to Breach Damages under Section 11.2(a) and the
Aggregate Second Payment Amount, Second Payment Holdback or Fourth Payment
Amount with respect to any Claim Notice relating to Damages under Section
11.2(b) in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) provide Parent with notice
that it disagrees with the amount or method of determination set forth in the
Claim Notice (the " _Offset Dispute Notice_ "). Within fifteen (15) calendar
days after the giving of any Offset Dispute Notice, the Shareholders Agents
and Parent shall negotiate in a bona fide attempt to resolve the matter. If no
Offset Dispute Notice is given, then the claim in the amount alleged by the
Covered Party in the Claim Notice shall be deemed to be valid and may be
offset against the Aggregate Second Payment Amount with respect to any Claim
Notice relating to Breach Damages under Section 11.2(a) and the Aggregate
Second Payment Amount, Second Payment Holdback or Fourth Payment Amount with
respect to any Claim Notice relating to Damages under Section 11.2(b). No
claim shall be offset against the Aggregate Second Payment Amount with respect
to any Claim Notice relating to Breach Damages under Section 11.2(a) and the
Aggregate Second Payment Amount, Second Payment Holdback or Fourth Payment
Amount with respect to any Claim Notice relating to Damages under Section
11.2(b) if such claim is timely disputed as set forth above, unless and until
its validity is finally resolved.



(c) If a claim by a third Person is made against a Covered Party, and if
Parent intends to seek a right of offset with respect thereto under Section
11.2, Parent shall promptly notify at least one of the Shareholders Agents in
writing of such claims, setting forth such claims in reasonable detail.
Failure to give such notice shall not prejudice the rights of Parent hereunder
except to the extent that the Holders shall have been materially prejudiced by
such failure. Parent shall have the right to undertake, at the Holders cost,
risk and expense through offset against the Aggregate Second Payment Amount
with respect to any Claim Notice relating to Breach Damages under Section
11.2(a) and the Aggregate Second Payment Amount, Second Payment Holdback or
Fourth Payment Amount with respect to any Claim Notice relating to Damages
under Section 11.2(b)), the defense, compromise or settlement of the claim but
shall not thereby waive any right of offset therefor pursuant to this
Agreement.



(d) In the event there is a reduction in any Aggregate Second Payment Amount,
Second Payment Holdback or Fourth Payment Amount as a result of Agreed Offsets
or Determined Offsets, then Parent shall be entitled to retain the Agreed
Offsets or Determined Offsets, as the case may be. In the event that there is
an Offset Claim that is neither an Agreed Offset or Determined Offset and such
Offset Claim is finally resolved against Parent by a court of competent
jurisdiction, then Parent shall promptly pay the full amount of the Offset
Claim to the Holders. In the event that there is an Offset Claim that is
neither an Agreed Offset or Determined Offset and such Offset Claim is finally
resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction in part against Parent and in
part in favor of Parent, then Parent shall promptly pay the amount of the
part of the Offset Claim finally resolved against Parent to the Holders and
shall be entitled to retain the amount of the part of the Offset Claim finally
resolved in favor of Parent. 



 

80 Section 11.4 _Application_. The indemnification and offset provisions of this
Article 11 shall apply only to breaches by the Company of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company contained herein and the
matters referred to in Section 11.2(b) and, with the exception of claims based
upon actual fraud, intentional misrepresentation or criminal activity, from
and after the Effective Time of Merger I, offset against the Aggregate Second
Payment Amount and the Second Payment Holdback as provided in this Article 11
shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Parent and the Surviving Entity
for misrepresentation in or breach of, or otherwise in connection with, this
Agreement or any Schedule or certificate delivered by or on behalf of the
Company pursuant to this Agreement. The maximum aggregate amount of any
offsets against the Second Payment and Fourth Payment pursuant to this Article
11 shall be $15.0 million, as provided in the definitions of Maximum Second
Payment Date Offset and Maximum Fourth Payment Date Offset, and there shall
be no offset against the Third Payment pursuant to this Article 11.

would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
representation or warranty shall have become inaccurate, provided that if such



 

81 inaccuracy in Parents representations and warranties or breach by Parent is
curable by Parent through the exercise of its commercially reasonable
efforts, then this Agreement shall not terminate pursuant to this Section
12.1(d) as a result of such particular breach or inaccuracy until the

inaccuracy until the expiration of a forty-five (45) day period commencing
upon delivery of written notice from Parent to the Company of such breach or
inaccuracy (it being understood that this Agreement shall not terminate
pursuant to this Section 12.1(e) as a result of such particular breach or
inaccuracy if such breach by the Company is cured prior to such termination

facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, provided that the exchange of original signature pages
takes place promptly following such exchange by facsimile.



Section 12.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT

irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of any state court

irrevocable waives any objection which he or it may now or hereafter have to

Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
