the former relate, respectively, each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the subject
matter of this Agreement, including the business, assets and properties of the Companies, is
unique, that the other parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached,
and that the remedies at law would not be adequate to compensate such other parties not in default
or in breach. Accordingly, each of the parties agrees that the other parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
such provisions in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled under this Agreement.
The parties waive any defense that a remedy at law is adequate in connection with actions
instituted for injunctive relief or specific performance of this Agreement as provided in this
Section.

of the assets of Seller related to the Business, including the capital stock or shares in the

Agreement, Purchaser will deposit the Escrow Amount in immediately available funds with the Escrow
Agent to be held and disposed of as provided in this Escrow Agreement. The funds and property held
by the Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement, regardless of the account in which contained,
including any interest, dividends or gains earned thereon and any other earnings in respect
thereof, are hereinafter called the &#147;<I>Escrow Fund</I>.&#148; The Escrow Fund will be held in trust and will
be used solely for the purposes and subject to the conditions set forth in this Escrow Agreement.
The Escrow Agent will hold the Escrow Fund in two separate accounts, the first (the &#147;<I>Adjustment
Escrow Account</I>&#148;) to hold $8,000,000 (the &#147;<I>Adjustment Escrow Amount</I>&#148;) of the amount deposited,

the foregoing, the Escrow Agent acknowledges that Purchaser has a security interest in the Escrow
Fund and the Escrow Agent is maintaining the Escrow Fund subject to such security interest.

requested in writing by Purchaser to perfect or maintain the security interest created by Seller
hereunder in Seller&#146;s interest in the Escrow Fund. Purchaser is authorized by the other parties to
