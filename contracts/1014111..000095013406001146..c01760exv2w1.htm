If the actual amount of any such item is not known as of the Closing Date, such proration shall be based on the previous years assessment of such item and the parties shall adjust such proration and pay any underpayment or reimburse for any overpayment within thirty (30) days after the actual amount becomes known. 

  

 2.6 _Estimated Initial Purchase Price_. At least two days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser an estimated consolidated balance sheet (the " _Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") for the Companies as of the close of business on the Closing Date, denominated in Dollars converted from other currencies using the currency exchange rates published in the United States edition of the Wall Street Journal on a publication day that shall be no more than two publication days prior to the delivery of the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet, prepared on a pro forma basis without giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but after the elimination of any Excluded Assets and any Retained Liabilities, and otherwise in accordance with HK GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Latest Financial Statements and otherwise consistent with the accounting methods and policies set forth in _Schedule 2.6_. The Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet shall include a determination of the Estimated Closing Date Net Current Asset Amount as of the close of business on the Closing Date. " _Estimated Closing Date Net Current Asset Amount_ " means the excess of Current Assets over Current Liabilities (as those terms are defined in Section 2.9(a)) shown on the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet.  " _Estimated Initial Purchase Price_ " means an amount equal to $330,000,000 plus the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing Date Net Current Asset Amount exceeds the Target Net Current Asset Amount or minus the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing Date Net Current Asset Amount falls short of the Target Net Current Asset Amount.

 2.9 _Post-Closing Adjustment to Estimated Initial Purchase Price_. 

  

 (a) Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date a consolidated balance sheet (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") for the Companies as of the close of business on the Closing Date, denominated in Dollars converted from other currencies using the currency exchange rates published in the United States edition of the Wall Street Journal on the Closing Date or, if the Closing Date shall not have been a publication day, on the publication day next preceding the Closing Date, prepared on a _pro forma_ basis without giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement but after the elimination of any Excluded Assets and any Retained Liabilities and otherwise in accordance with HK GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Latest Financial Statements and in all events consistent with the accounting methods and policies set forth in _Schedule 2.6_. The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall include a determination of the Closing Date Net Current Asset Amount. " _Closing Date Net Current Asset Amount_ " means the excess of Current Assets over Current Liabilities shown on the Closing Date Balance Sheet. " _Current Assets_ " means the current assets shown on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with HK GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Latest Financial Statements and in all events consistent with the accounting methods and policies set forth in  _Schedule 2.6_. " _Current Liabilities_ " means the current liabilities shown on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with HK GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Latest Financial Statements and in all events consistent with the accounting methods and policies set forth in _Schedule 2.6_. In connection with the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, it is expected that Purchasers independent accountants will, within two (2) days prior to and four (4) days after the 

   ##### 

  

 

Closing, take a physical inventory of all product stocks other than those
on consignment, which inventory Sellers independent accountants shall be
permitted to observe. Subject to Sellers compliance with the standard "hold
harmless" requirements of Purchasers accountants, Purchaser shall make the
workpapers and back-up materials used in preparing the Closing Date Balance
Sheet available to Seller and its accountants and other representatives
at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice in connection with (i) the
review by Seller of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and (ii) the resolution by
Purchaser and Seller of any objections to the Closing Date Balance Sheet. 

   

 (b) If Seller has any objections to the Closing Date Balance Sheet or the Closing Date Net Current Asset Amount, Seller shall deliver statement describing in reasonable detail such objections to Purchaser within forty-five (45) days after receiving the Closing Date Balance Sheet. Purchaser and Seller shall attempt in good faith to resolve any such objections. If Purchaser and Seller do not reach a resolution of all objections within thirty (30) days after Purchaser has received the statement of objections, they shall submit the issues to KPMG for resolution. KPMG shall be directed to determine, in accordance with HK GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Latest Financial Statements and in all events consistent with the accounting methods and policies set forth in _Schedule 2.6_, the amounts to be included in the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Net Current Asset Amount. The parties shall provide to KPMG, within ten (10) days of after its retention, with a definitive statement of the position of each party with respect to each unresolved objection and shall advise KPMG that the parties accept the accounting firm as the appropriate Person to interpret this Agreement for all purposes relevant to the resolution of the unresolved objections. Purchaser shall provide KPMG access to the books, records and, subject to compliance with the standard "hold harmless" requirements of Purchasers accountants, the workpapers of Purchasers accountants. The parties shall request KPMG to carry out a review of the unresolved objections and prepare a written statement of its determination regarding each unresolved objection together with its calculation of the Closing Date Net Current Asset Amount and the Excess Net Asset Amount or the Net Asset Shortfall Amount, as the case may be, based on its resolution of the parties objections (the " _Accountant s Determination_") within thirty (30) days. The determination of KPMG shall be set forth in writing and shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties. 

  

 (c) If Purchaser and Seller submit any unresolved objections to KPMG for resolution as provided in Section 2.9(b), (i) each of the parties shall bear its own costs and expenses and (ii) the fees and expenses of KPMG shall be borne in proportion to the amounts by which respective positions of the parties as to the Closing Date Net Current Asset Amount (calculated based on such partys position regarding the Closing Date Balance Sheet) differ from the Closing Date Net Current Asset Amount determined by KPMG (based on its resolution of the parties objections submitted for determination). 

  

 (d) Within seven (7) days after the date on which the Closing Date Net Current Asset Amount shall have been finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.9: 

  

 (i) If the Closing Date Net Current Asset Amount equals the Estimated Closing Date Net Current Asset Amount, the Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be released by the Escrow Agent from the Adjustment Escrow Account to Seller in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

     

 (ii) If the Closing Date Net Current Asset Amount exceeds the Estimated Closing Date Net Current Asset Amount (the amount of such excess, the " _Excess Net Asset Amount_ "), (A) Purchaser shall pay to Seller an aggregate amount equal to the Excess Net Asset Amount, and (B) the Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be released by the Escrow Agent from the Adjustment Escrow Account to Seller in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. 

   

 (iii) If the Closing Date Net Current Asset Amount is less than the Estimated Closing Date Net Current Asset Amount, an amount equal to such deficiency (the amount of such deficiency, the " _Net Asset Shortfall Amount_ ") shall be withdrawn by the Escrow Agent from the Adjustment Escrow Account, and, to the extent that the amount of the Net Asset Shortfall Amount exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Amount, from the Indemnification Escrow Amount and paid to Purchaser. If the Net Asset Shortfall Amount is less than the Adjustment Escrow Amount, the amount remaining in the Adjustment Escrow Account, after release of the Net Asset Shortfall Amount to Purchaser, shall be released by the Escrow Agent to Seller in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. If the Net Asset Shortfall Amount exceeds the Escrow Amount, the Escrow Amount shall be paid to Purchaser and Seller shall pay the amount of the excess to Purchaser. 

  

 (e) All payments to be made to Purchaser or Seller pursuant to Section 2.9(d) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts designated by Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, and all such payments shall include simple interest thereon at a rate equal to one percent (1.00%) over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for ninety (90) day Dollar deposits, accruing from the Closing Date to the date of payment. 

  

 2.10 _Earnout_. 

  

 (a) The amount of the earnout (the " _Earnout Amount_ ") shall be based on the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of the Business, calculated as hereinafter provided (" _EBITDA_ "), for each of the twelve-month periods ending on March 31, 2007 (" _FY07 EBITDA_ "), March 31, 2008 (" _FY08 EBITDA_ ") and, if necessary, March 31, 2009 (" _FY09 EBITDA_ "). The Earnout Amount, which shall have a cumulative minimum of $5,000,000 and a cumulative maximum of $45,000,000, shall be determined and paid as follows: 

   

 (i) in the event that FY07 EBITDA shall exceed $43,300,000, a first installment of the Earnout Amount (the " _First Earnout Installment_ ") shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller on or before June 1, 2007 in an amount that shall be equal to the product of (A) $22,500,000 multiplied by a (B) a fraction (1) the numerator of which shall be the lesser of (x) $7,600,000 or (y) the amount by which FY07 EBITDA shall have exceeded $43,300,000 and (2) the denominator of which shall be $7,600,000, _provided, however,_ that the amount of the First Earnout Installment shall in no event be less than $2,500,000 (regardless of the amount of FY07 EBITDA); 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) in the event that the sum of FY07 EBITDA and FY08 EBITDA shall exceed $95,900,000, a second installment of the Earnout Amount (the " _Second Earnout Installment_ ") shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller on or before June 1, 2008 in an amount that shall be equal to the product of (A) $45,000,000 multiplied by a (B) a fraction (1) the numerator of which shall be the lesser of (x) $16,900,000 or (y) the amount by which the sum of FY07 EBITDA and FY08 EBITDA shall have exceeded $95,900,000 and (2) the denominator of which shall be $16,900,000, _provided, however,_ that the amount of the Second Earnout Installment as so determined shall be reduced by the amount of the First Earnout Installment; and _provided further_ , that the amount of the Second Earnout Installment shall in no event be less than $2,500,000 (regardless of the amounts of FY07 EBITDA and FY08 EBITDA); and 

   

 (iii) in the event that (x) the sum of the amounts of the First Earnout Installment and the Second Earnout Installment shall have been less than the maximum Earnout Amount of $45,000,000 and (y) FY09 EBITDA shall have exceeded $73,800,000, a further installment of the Earnout Amount (the " _Makeup Earnout Installment_ ") shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller on or before June 1, 2009 in an amount that shall be determined by (A) adding (1) the amount by which FY09 EBITDA shall have exceeded $73,800,000 to (2) the sum of FY07 EBITDA and FY08 EBITDA, (B) recomputing the amount of the Second Earnout Installment that would have been paid if the result of (A), rather than the sum of FY07 EBITDA and FY08 EBITDA, had been used in determining the amount of the Second Earnout Installment, and (C) subtracting from that recomputed amount the amount of the Second Earnout Installment. 

  

 (b) For purposes of this Section 2.10, EBITDA shall be determined on the basis of actual gross profits of the Business but using, in lieu of actual operating costs, depreciation and amortization, certain assumed amounts, as follows: 

   

 (i) the gross profit obtained by Purchaser from the sale of products bearing the "Memorex" brand or any derivative thereof during each of the twelve-month periods described in Section 2.10(a) (respectively, " _FY07 Gross Profit,_ " " _FY08 Gross Profit"_ and " _FY09 Gross Profit_ ") shall be determined from the unaudited management accounts of Purchaser maintained in accordance with US GAAP and with the accounting policies and procedures applied in a consistent manner by Purchaser in the conduct of its business and the preparation of its financial statements, _provided, however_ , that the costs to be included and those to be excluded in the determination of gross profit shall be as described in _Schedule 2.10_; 

   

 (ii) FY07 EBITDA shall be determined by (A) subtracting from FY07 Gross Profit assumed operating costs in the amount of $82,500,000 and (B) adding back projected depreciation and amortization charges in the amount of $3,000,000; 

   

 (iii) FY08 EBITDA shall be determined by (A) subtracting from FY08 Gross Profit assumed operating costs in the amount of $97,200,000 and (B) adding back projected depreciation and amortization charges in the amount of $3,000,000; and 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iv) FY09 EBITDA shall be determined by (A) subtracting from FY09 Gross Profit assumed operating costs in the amount of $107,900,000 and (B) adding back projected depreciation and amortization charges in the amount of $4,000,000. 

  

 (c) Purchaser shall provide to Seller, no later than June 1 of each year beginning with 2007 and ending with 2009, a report setting forth the amounts of FY07 EBITDA, FY08 EBITDA and FY09 EBITDA, respectively, as determined by Purchaser and explaining in reasonable detail the way in which such determination was made, together with payment in the corresponding amount due under this Section 2.10. Seller shall have the right, at any time within ninety (90) days after its receipt of the report, to cause Sellers independent accounting firm to conduct a review of the books and records of Purchaser to the extent relevant to the verification of those amounts, and Purchaser shall provide access for such accountants to the relevant books and records at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice. In the event that the accounting firm concludes that the amount of FY07 EBITDA, FY08 EBITDA or FY09 EBITDA, as the case may be, as determined by Purchaser has been understated by more than $250,000, Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for the expense of the review, but in all other cases the expense shall be borne by Seller. Should Purchaser dispute the results of the review, the parties shall submit the dispute to KPMG for resolution in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.9(b), which shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ , and Section 2.9(c). 

  

 (d) In the event that a Change of Control Transaction should be consummated or become effective at any time prior to April 1, 2009 then, if the Earnout Amount theretofore paid to Seller shall have been less than $45,000,000, Purchaser shall pay to Seller, no later than the date on which the Change of Control Transaction shall be consummated or become effective, (i) an amount equal to the difference between the Earnout Amount theretofore paid and $45,000,000. For purposes hereof, a " _Change of Control Transaction_ " shall mean any transaction or agreement that results in or has the effect of (i) Purchaser ceasing to have ultimate control of Memorex US, Memorex Europe or any other Person to which all or any material portion of the Business, to the extent that it relates to products using the Memorex brand or any derivative thereof, shall have been transferred or (ii) transferring all or any material portion of the Business, to the extent that it relates to products using the Memorex brand or any derivative thereof, to any Person of which Purchaser does not have ultimate control, where "control" of a Person means the right or authority to elect a majority of the board of directors or other analogous governing body of such Person or to direct the conduct of all or a material portion of the business of such Person, in either case without the consent of any other Person not itself under the ultimate control of Purchaser; _provided however_ that a merger, acquisition or other transaction affecting the control of Purchaser shall not itself constitute a Change of Control Transaction. 

  

 (e) Seller acknowledges that, following completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser must operate its business utilizing the Acquired Assets and the Acquired Companies in the best interests of its shareholders, and that Purchaser owes no fiduciary duty, or any express or implied contractual duty, to Seller with respect to the Earnout Amount except as expressly provided in this Section 2.10. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, amounts owed to Seller under this Section 2.10 shall not be subject to any right of offset of any kind against amounts claimed by or owed to Purchaser. 

  

 2.11 _Unobtained Consents_. In the event that any Required Consent has not been obtained as of the Closing and that Purchaser, in its sole discretion, chooses to waive the closing condition as to the obtaining of such Required Consents, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 2.1, Section 2.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement: 

   

 (a) with respect to any Contract, Governmental Authorization or other item included in the Acquired Assets with respect to which such Required Consent was not obtained (each a " _Restricted Asset_ "), Purchaser may elect either (i) to exclude such Restricted Asset from the Acquired Assets, in which event, unless and until the applicable Required Consent is obtained after the Closing, neither this Agreement nor any instrument delivered at the Closing shall constitute an assignment or transfer of such Restricted Asset or any interest arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, or (ii) to accept the assignment or transfer of such Restricted Asset notwithstanding the failure to obtain the applicable Required Consent; 

   

 (b) regardless of which election Purchaser makes pursuant to Section 2.11(a), Seller shall, for a period of up to six (6) months after the Closing, continue to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such Required Consents as soon as practicable following Closing; 

   

 (c) with respect to any Restricted Asset that Purchaser has elected to exclude from the Acquired Assets pursuant to Section 2.11(a)(i), if the applicable Required Consent is obtained following the Closing Date, such Restricted Asset shall immediately be deemed to be included in the Acquired Assets, and an appropriate instrument of transfer substantially in the form that would have been used to convey such Restricted Asset pursuant to Section 2.8(b) had such Restricted Asset been acquired by Purchaser at the Closing and a copy of the Required Consent shall be promptly executed and delivered by and to the appropriate Persons; 

   

 (d) with respect to any Restricted Asset that Purchaser has elected to have transferred and assigned pursuant to Section 2.11(a)(ii), if the applicable Required Consent is subsequently obtained, a copy of such Required Consent shall be delivered to Purchaser and any instrument delivered at the Closing shall constitute an assignment or transfer of such Restricted Asset and all interests arising thereunder or resulting therefrom in their entirety; and 

   

 (e) any Restricted Asset that Purchaser shall have elected to exclude pursuant to Section 2.11(a)(i) shall be treated, for purposes of the determination of the Purchase Price, as if it had been transferred and assigned to Purchaser. 

  

 2.12 _Allocation_. Purchaser and Seller and their respective Affiliates shall determine the allocation among the Acquired Assets of the Purchase Price and all other capitalized costs, including any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Article IX, as they each deem 

   ##### 

  

 

appropriate and shall report, act and file Returns (including Internal Revenue
Service Form 8594 and any amendments thereto) accordingly. 

   

 2.13 _Further Assurances_. On and after the Closing Date, Seller shall take, or shall cause the appropriate Person to take, all appropriate action and execute any documents, instruments or conveyances of any kind that may be reasonably requested by Purchaser to carry out any of the provisions of this Agreement.

Subject to any restrictions imposed by applicable Law, Purchaser shall have full access to the personnel records (including performance appraisals, disciplinary actions, grievances and medical records) of the Companies for the purpose of preparing for and conducting employment interviews with all Acquired Employees.

The Purchase Price has been established on the basis that none of the Acquired Companies, at Closing, will have any Indebtedness and that none of them will have any accounts payable or receivable to Seller, any of the Owners or Insiders, or any other Affiliates of the Owners or Insiders. Accordingly, Seller shall, prior to the Closing: 

   

 (a) cause each of the Acquired Companies to repay and discharge in full any and all Indebtedness to which it may be subject, other than any Indebtedness to Seller that may be capitalized prior to Closing; and 

   

 (b) cause each of the Acquired Companies to repay and discharge in full any and all Liabilities of any kind or description, owed to Seller, any of the Owners or Insiders, and any other Affiliates of the Owners or Insiders, other than (i) any Liabilities to Seller that may be capitalized prior to Closing and (ii) any Liabilities to direct shareholders of Seller other than Memorex Holdings; _provided_ that offsetting transactions having the same economic effect may alternatively be used so long as any Liabilities of the Acquired Companies for Taxes that may arise therefrom are reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet. 

   ##### 

  

    

 5.5 _Waiver of Claims_. Effective as of the Closing, Seller waives any claim arising prior to the Closing that it might have against any of the Acquired Companies, whether arising out of this Agreement or otherwise, and Seller will, prior to Closing, cause any Contracts between Seller and any of the Acquired Companies to be terminated, in each case at no cost to Purchaser or any of the Acquired Companies other than the payment of any amounts for which any of the Acquired Companies shall have become liable prior to such termination. Effective as of the Closing, Seller agrees not to make any claim for indemnification against any of the Acquired Companies, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Acquired Companies from any claim from any of Sellers officers, directors, employees or agents, based upon or arising by reason of the fact that any of such Persons is or was serving at the request of any of the Companies as a partner, trustee, director, officer, employee or agent of any of the Acquired Companies (whether such claim is pursuant to any Law, Organizational Document, Contract or otherwise) and waives and releases any such claim for indemnification or contribution Seller may have against any of the Acquired Companies.

 5.6 _Conditions_. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.1, to the extent reasonably within Sellers control, to be satisfied and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably possible; _provided that_ , for purposes of this Section 5.6 only, the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in subsections 7.1(a) and 7.1(i) shall be deemed to be within Sellers control if, but only if, any failure of such conditions to be satisfied shall be attributable in whole or in material part to the affirmative actions of Seller. 

  

 5.7 _Consents and Authorizations_. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, in cooperation with Purchaser, to obtain as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement all Consents and Governmental Authorizations necessary or reasonably desirable for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or that could, if not obtained, adversely affect the conduct of the business of the Companies as currently conducted, including those listed on _Schedule 7._ _1(e)_ Seller shall keep Purchaser fully advised at reasonable intervals of its progress in obtaining such Consents and Governmental Authorizations.

After the Closing Date, Seller shall hold all of the books and records of Seller pertaining to Acquired Assets and the Acquired Companies in accordance with Sellers retention policies in effect from time to time for a period of not less than two years from the Closing Date and, if it proposes at any time within seven (7) years after the Closing Date to destroy or dispose of any such books and records, including any transfer to a third party, it shall first offer in writing given at least sixty (60) days prior to such proposed destruction or disposition to surrender them to Purchaser at the sole expense of Purchaser; provided Seller shall not be prohibited hereunder from transferring such books and records to Hanny Holdings at any time after the Closing Date.

 5.15 _Confidentiality_.

organizations, partners, outside legal counsel, and consultants and (iv) any
and all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, summaries and other material

Companies included in the foregoing (" _Confidential Information_ "). Seller
acknowledges that such Confidential Information constitutes a unique and
valuable asset of the Companies and, upon consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, of the Purchasing Companies and represents a
substantial investment of time and expense by them, and that any unauthorized
disclosure or other use of such Confidential Information other than for
the purpose of operating the Companies prior to Closing and thereafter for
the sole benefit of Purchaser would be wrongful and would cause irreparable
harm to Purchaser. Seller shall deliver to Purchaser at Closing or destroy,
at the request and option of Purchaser, all tangible and intangible
embodiments (and all copies) of such Confidential Information that are in the
possession of Seller. The foregoing obligations shall not (i) require Seller
to restrict access to or the use of Confidential Information by any Owner,
any Affiliate of an Owner or any company or partnership owned or managed by
any of them, (ii) prohibit the use by any Owner, any Affiliate of an Owner
or any company or partnership owned or managed by any of them of Confidential
Information in a manner that does not contravene the requirements of the
Inducement Agreement or (iii) apply to any Confidential Information that (A)
is or subsequently becomes generally publicly known, other than as a direct
or indirect result of the breach by Seller of this Agreement or of any
Ancillary Agreement; (B) subsequently comes lawfully into the possession of
Seller, any Owner, any Affiliate of an Owner or any company or partnership
owned or managed by any of them, free from any obligation of confidentiality,
from a third party that does not owe Purchaser an obligation
of confidentiality; or (C) is required to be disclosed by applicable Law,
judgment or order of any Governmental Entity, or regulation of any securities
exchange. 

   

 (b) Seller acknowledges that Purchaser has required that Seller make the agreements in this Section 5.15 as a condition to Purchasers consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller agrees that the agreements contained in this Section 5.15 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Purchaser and that any violation or breach of this Section 5.15 shall result in irreparable injury to Purchaser for which no adequate remedy would exist at law. Accordingly, in addition to any relief at law that may be available to Purchaser for such violation or breach and regardless of any other provision contained in this Agreement, Purchaser may be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief restraining such violation or breach. 

  

 (c) In the event that Seller is requested or required (by oral question or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, Seller shall, to the extent 

   ##### 

  

 

reasonably practicable, notify Purchaser promptly of the request or
requirement prior to any disclosure so that Purchaser may seek an appropriate
protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section
5.15. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver
from Purchaser, Seller is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any
Confidential Information, Seller may disclose the Confidential Information;
_provided, however_ , that Seller shall, at the expense of Purchaser, provide
reasonable cooperation to Purchaser if Purchaser seeks to obtain, at the
expense of Purchaser, an order or other assurance that confidential
treatment shall be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information
required to be disclosed as Purchaser designates. 

   

 5.16 _Assignment of Confidentiality Agreements_. To the extent permitted by such agreements, effective upon the Closing, Seller shall assign to Purchaser all right, title and interest of Seller in and to any confidentiality agreement to which Seller or any of its agents may be a party pertaining to the confidentiality of information relating to the Companies, the Business or the hiring of employees of any of the Companies. 

  

 5.17 _Covenant Not to Compete_. 

  

 (a) As an inducement for Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and as additional consideration for the payment of the Purchase Price, for a period of one (1) year from the Closing Date, Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, engage in, acquire, own or hold a business anywhere in the world that competes with the Business as conducted by the Companies prior to the Closing Date _(_ the _"Restricted Business")_ , whether as a proprietor, principal, agent, partner, officer, director, shareholder, employee, member of any association, consultant or otherwise. Ownership by Seller, as a passive investment, of less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of capital stock of any corporation whose stock is listed on any recognized securities exchange or publicly traded on The NASDAQ National Market shall not constitute a breach of this Section 5.17. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be restricted by the foregoing provisions from acquiring and thereafter owning and operating any business if the revenues attributable to the portion of the business thereof that consists of Restricted Business are less than ten percent (10%) of the total revenues of such business. 

  

 (b) Seller acknowledges that Purchaser has required that Seller make the agreements in this Section 5.17 as a condition to Purchasers consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 5.17 are reasonable (including with respect to duration, geographical area and scope) and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Purchaser and that any violation or breach of this Section 5.17 shall result in substantial and irreparable harm to Purchaser for which no adequate remedy would exist at law. Accordingly, in addition to any relief at law that may be available to Purchaser for such violation or breach and regardless of any other provision contained in this Agreement, Purchaser may be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief restraining such violation or breach. 

  

 (c) If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction holds that any term or provision of this Section 5.17 is invalid or unenforceable, the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid 

   ##### 

  

 

and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the
invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the
judgment may be appealed; provided, that such modification shall apply only
to the extent that it affects the jurisdiction under the laws of which the
original term or condition shall have been held to be invalid or
unenforceable, and the original term or condition shall otherwise continue in
full force and effect. 

   

 5.18 _Use of Names Following the Closing Date_. Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall change its corporate name to one that does not include the name "Memorex" or any other name that is confusingly similar to that name and shall cease using, and shall not thereafter use, any such name, including use in any and all printed materials, signage, websites or similar identifying materials, except for historical purposes. 

  

 5.19 _Release of Claims_. At Closing, Seller shall waive, release and agree, with binding effect on its successors and assigns, not to bring any claim, demand, cause of action or proceeding, including any cost recovery action, against any of the Purchasing Companies or the Acquired Companies under any Environmental Law based on any act or omission of any of the Acquired Companies occurring prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 5.20 _Memtek Taiwan Employees_. Within five (5) days after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall, subject to applicable Laws, make available to Purchaser, in electronic form, such information with respect to each Acquired Employee of Memtek Taiwan as Purchaser may reasonably request. Seller will obtain the requisite consents and otherwise make arrangements for the Purchaser to interview and offer employment with one of the Purchasing Companies or the Acquired Companies, effective upon the Closing, to any of the Acquired Employees employed by Memtek Taiwan. 

  

 5.21 _Termination of 401(k) Plan_. If requested by Purchaser, Seller shall cause Memorex US to terminate its 401(k) plan with effect prior to the Closing Date, pursuant to written resolutions the form and substance of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate and take all other steps reasonably necessary or appropriate so that, as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, the Acquired Employees who are participants in Sellers qualified defined contribution plans are permitted to take distributions or to roll over their benefits under that plan to one or more defined contribution plans sponsored by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries. 

  

 5.22 _Compliance with Bulk Sales Laws_. If and to the extent reasonably requested by Purchaser, Seller shall prior to Closing take such actions, including the giving of any notices and compliance with any waiting periods, as may be required under applicable Laws in the nature of "bulk sales" and other creditor notice laws in connection with Purchasers acquisition of the Acquired Assets and the Business. 

  

 5.23 _Termination of Golacinski Contract_. Seller shall, with effect as of the Closing, cause to be terminated, without liability to any of the Acquired Companies that survives the Closing, all existing Contracts between Mr. Michael Golacinski and any of the Acquired Companies.

IX. Indemnification 

   

 9.1 _Indemnification by Seller_. 

  

 (a) Seller shall indemnify Purchaser and hold Purchaser harmless against any Loss suffered or incurred by any of the Purchasing Companies and, after Closing, the Acquired Companies, whether or not actually incurred prior to the applicable date referred to in Section 9.1(d), arising from, relating to or constituting (i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement either at the date of this Agreement or on the Closing Date as though then made and as though the Closing Date had been substituted for the date of this Agreement, or in any closing certificate delivered by or on behalf of Seller pursuant to this Agreement; (ii) any Liability of Seller for Taxes, whenever incurred, and any Liability of any of the Acquired Companies for Taxes incurred prior to the Closing, other than Taxes to be paid by Purchaser pursuant to Section 6.7; (iii) any failure of Seller to pay and discharge the obligations of Seller not assumed by the Purchasing Companies pursuant to this Agreement; (iv) any Loss incurred as a consequence of an order being made under Section 249 of the Insolvency Act of 2003 in respect of Seller or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (v) any Liability under applicable Law arising prior to the Closing by reason of the funding, operation, termination or winding up of any Plan established or maintained by any of the Companies; (vi) any Retained Liabilities and (viii) any breach of any of the agreements of Seller contained in this Agreement (collectively, " _Purchasing Company Losses_ "). 

  

 (b) Seller shall indemnify Purchaser for Purchasing Company Losses resulting from any breaches of or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.3 (other than clause (a) of such section) and Sections 3.5 through 3.26 only if the aggregate amount of all Purchasing Company Losses resulting from all such breaches or causes exceeds $1,500,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "), in which case Seller shall be liable (subject to the other applicable limitations set forth in this Article IX) for the aggregate amount of all Purchasing Company Losses in excess of the Basket Amount. 

  

 (c) Sellers liability under Section 9.1 for Purchasing Company Losses, other than (i) those described in Section 9.1(a)(i) resulting from any breaches of or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in any of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3(a), 3.4 or 3.27, (ii) those described 

   ##### 

  

 

in Section 9.1(a)(iv) and (iii) those described in Section 9.1(a)(viii) to
the extent arising from the breach of covenants or agreements to be performed
prior to Closing (the matters described in the foregoing clauses (i) through
(iii) being referred to as the " _Exception Matters_ "), shall not exceed the
Indemnification Escrow Amount. Any indemnification obligations of Seller for
Purchasing Company Losses (other than for Purchasing Company Losses with
respect to the Exception Matters) shall be satisfied solely and exclusively
out of the funds remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Account, other than
any interest or other income accruing in the Escrow Account, and Purchaser
shall not pursue any claim against Seller in respect of any
Purchasing Company Losses other than such Losses arising out of the Exception
Matters. 

   

 (d) If Purchaser has a claim for indemnification under this Section 9.1, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller one or more written notices of Purchasing Company Losses (each a " _Purchaser Claim_ "), with a copy to the Escrow Agent, on or before September 30, 2007, except for Purchasing Company Losses arising from a breach or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties made in Sections 3.12, 3.18 or 3.21, for which Purchaser shall deliver a Purchaser Claim prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Seller shall have no liability under this Section 9.1 unless the written notices required by the preceding sentence are given by the date specified. Any Purchaser Claim shall state in reasonable detail the basis for such Purchasing Company Losses to the extent then known by Purchaser and the nature of the Purchasing Company Losses for which indemnification is sought. The Purchaser Claim shall state the amount of the Purchasing Company Losses claimed if then known to Purchaser. If the amount is not known at the time of the submission of the Purchaser Claim, the Purchaser shall provide a good faith estimate based upon the facts then known and shall submit an amended Purchaser Claim promptly after the amount thereof shall have become known to Purchaser. If such Purchaser Claim (or an amended Purchaser Claim) states the amount of the Purchasing Company Losses claimed and Seller notifies Purchaser that Seller does not dispute the claim described in such notice or fails to notify Purchaser within twenty (20) business days after delivery of such notice by Purchaser whether Seller disputes the claim described in such notice, the Purchasing Company Losses in the amount specified in Purchasers notice shall be admitted by Seller (an " _Admitted Claim_ "), and Seller shall pay the amount of such Purchasing Company Losses to Purchaser. If Seller has timely disputed the liability of Seller with respect to a Purchaser Claim stating the amount of a Purchasing Company Losses claimed, Seller and Purchaser shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute. If a claim for indemnification has not been resolved within thirty (30) days after delivery of Sellers notice, Purchaser may seek recourse to arbitration as provided in Section 10.13. If a Purchaser Claim does not state the amount of the Purchasing Company Losses claimed because such amount is not known at the time of submission of the Purchaser Claim, such omission shall not preclude Purchaser from recovering from Seller the amount of the Purchasing Company Losses described in such Purchaser Claim if any such amount is provided in an amended Purchaser Claim submitted promptly after the amount thereof shall have become known to Purchaser. In order to assert its right to indemnification under this Article IX, Purchaser shall not be required to provide any notice except as provided in this Section 9.1(d) and in the Escrow Agreement. 

  

 (e) Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount of any Purchasing Company Losses indemnifiable hereunder arising out of or resulting from any of the Exception Matters ten (10) days following the determination of Sellers liability for and the amount of such Purchasing Company Losses (whether such determination is made by agreement between Purchaser and Seller, by arbitration award or by final adjudication) but in 

   ##### 

  

 

no event shall Seller be liable to Purchaser for any Purchasing
Company Losses resulting from the Exception Matters for an aggregate amount
in excess of the Purchase Price, provided that Sellers indemnification
obligations shall be satisfied first out of any funds remaining in the Escrow
Account and its payment obligation hereunder shall be limited to the
amount of any deficiency. 

   

 9.2 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. 

  

 (a) Purchaser shall indemnify in full Seller and hold it harmless against any Loss, whether or not actually incurred prior to the date referred to in Section 9.2(d), arising from, relating to or constituting (i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Purchasing Companies pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) any breach of any of the agreements of Purchaser contained in this Agreement, (iii) the failure of any of the Purchasing Companies to assume, pay and discharge the Assumed Liabilities and (iv) any Liability to the extent resulting from the ownership or use of the Acquired Assets or operation of the Acquired Companies after Closing (" _Seller Losses_ "). 

  

 (b) Purchaser shall indemnify Seller for Seller Losses attributable to the causes described in clause (i) of Section 9.2(a) only if the aggregate amount of all Seller Losses attributable to such causes exceeds the Basket Amount, in which case Purchaser shall be liable for the aggregate amount of Seller Losses in excess of the Basket Amount. 

  

 (c) Purchasers liability under Section 9.2 for Seller Losses, other than (i) those described in Section 9.2(a)(i) resulting from any breaches of or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in any of Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3(a), and (ii) those described in Section 9.2(a)(ii) shall not exceed the Indemnification Escrow Amount. 

  

 (d) If Seller has a claim for indemnification under this Section 9.2, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser one or more written notices of Seller Losses (a " _Seller Claim_ ") on or before September 30, 2007. Purchaser shall have no liability under this Section 9.2 unless the written notices required by the preceding sentence are given by the date specified, provided that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to Seller Claims for breaches by Purchaser of its agreements pursuant to Sections 2.9 or 2.10 of this Agreement. Any written notice shall state in reasonable detail the basis for Seller Losses to the extent then known by Seller and the nature of Seller Losses for which indemnification is sought. The Seller Claim shall state the amount of Seller Losses claimed if then known to Seller. If the amount is not known at the time of the submission of the Seller Claim, the Seller shall submit an amended Seller Claim promptly after the amount thereof shall have become known to Seller. If such written notice (or an amended notice) states the amount of Seller Losses claimed and Purchaser notifies Seller that Purchaser does not dispute the claim described in such notice or fails to notify Seller within twenty (20) business days after delivery of such notice by Seller whether Purchaser disputes the claim described in such notice, Seller Losses in the amount specified in Sellers notice shall be admitted by Purchaser, and Purchaser shall pay the amount of Seller Losses to Seller. If Purchaser has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, Purchaser and Seller shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute. If a claim for indemnification has not been resolved within thirty (30) days after delivery of Purchasers notice, Seller may seek recourse to arbitration as provided in Section 10.13. If a Seller Claim does 

   ##### 

   

   

not state the amount of the Seller Losses claimed, such omission shall not
preclude Seller from recovering from Purchaser the amount of the Seller Losses
described in such Seller Claim if any such amount is provided in an amended
Seller Claim submitted promptly after the amount thereof shall have become
known to Seller. In order to assert its right to indemnification under this
Article IX, Seller shall not be required to provide any notice except
as provided in this Section 9.2(d). 

   

 (e) Purchaser shall pay the amount of any Seller Losses to Seller within ten (10) days following the determination of Purchasers liability for and the amount of Seller Losses (whether such determination is made pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Section 9.2, by agreement between Seller and Purchaser, by arbitration award or by final adjudication). 

  

 9.3 _Third-Party Action_. 

  

 (a) If Purchaser is entitled to indemnification under Section 9.1(a) for Purchasing Company Losses arising from, relating to or constituting any Litigation instituted by any third party (any such third party action or proceeding being referred to as a " _Third-Party Action_ "), Purchaser shall give Seller prompt written notice of the commencement of such Third-Party Action. The complaint or other papers pursuant to which the third party commenced such Third-Party Action shall be attached to such written notice. The failure to give prompt written notice shall not affect Purchasers right to indemnification unless such failure has materially and adversely affected Sellers ability to defend successfully such Third-Party Action. 

  

 (b) Seller may participate in, and, to the extent Seller desires, at any time assume the defense of, such Third-Party Action with reputable attorneys retained by Seller and at Sellers expense. Upon and after notice from Seller to Purchaser of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Action, Seller shall not be liable to Purchaser under this Article IX for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by Purchaser in connection with the defense thereof;  _provided, however_ , that Purchaser shall be entitled at any time, at its own cost and expense, to participate in Sellers conduct of such defense and to be represented by attorneys of its own choosing. Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller in Sellers conduct of such defense to the extent reasonably requested by Seller in the contest and defense of such Third-Party Action, including but not limited to providing reasonable access (upon reasonable notice) to the books, records and employees of Purchaser if relevant to the defense of such Third-Party Action; _provided_ , that such cooperation shall not unduly disrupt the operations of the business of the Purchaser or cause Purchaser to waive any statutory or common law privileges, breach any confidentiality obligations owed to third parties or otherwise cause any confidential information of Purchaser to become public. 

  

 (c) If Seller does not elect to assume the defense of any Third-Party Action, Purchaser shall be entitled to conduct its own defense and to be represented by attorneys of its own choosing. For the avoidance of doubt, the costs and expenses of such defense shall be included in Purchasing Companies Losses indemnifiable in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Article IX. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Neither Purchaser nor Seller may concede, settle or compromise any Third-Party Action without the consent of the other party, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 9.4 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. The parties hereto agree that, with the exception of equitable remedies as provided in Sections 5.15(b), 5.17(b) and 10.12, their sole and exclusive remedy in respect of a breach by the other party hereto of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation of such party hereunder or in any certificate or other agreement entered into in connection herewith or delivered pursuant hereto or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be the right to obtain indemnification as provided in this Article IX, and all other rights and remedies in respect of such a breach or breaches (excluding any act or omission that constitutes fraud by either of the parties hereto) are hereby expressly forever waived and released. Each party hereto covenants not to institute any litigation or other proceeding with respect to any rights and remedies waived by such party under this Section 9.4. 

  

 9.5 _Tax Adjustment_. Any payment to Purchaser or Seller under this Article IX shall be, for Tax purposes, to the extent permitted by Law, an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

  

 9.6 _No Double Recovery_. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, Purchaser shall be entitled only to one recovery of Purchasing Company Losses indemnified hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller shall not have any indemnification obligations pursuant to this Article IX for Purchasing Company Losses to the extent such Purchasing Company Losses are or have been reflected in or taken account of in the determination of the Closing Date Net Current Asset Amount or have reduced or eliminated, or will reduce or eliminate, the amount of the First Earnout Installment, the Second Earnout Installment or the Makeup Earnout Installment that would have been paid had such Purchasing Company Losses not been taken into account in determining FY07 EBITDA, FY08 EBITDA or FY09 EBITDA., as the case may be, subject to reimbursement by Purchaser to Seller of the amount of any indemnification previously paid or satisfied from the Escrow Account to the extent that such Purchasing Company Losses are subsequently determined to have reduced or eliminated any of the aforementioned installments of the Earnout Amount. 

  

 9.7 _Insurance_. Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies after Closing to, use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue recovery under applicable insurance policies of any Purchasing Company Losses indemnified hereunder. Any such insurance recoveries shall reduce, dollar for dollar, the amount of any indemnifiable Loss. Purchaser shall reimburse Seller if and to the extent any insurance recoveries are obtained after the Losses to which such recoveries relate have been indemnified by Seller or recovered from the Indemnification Escrow Account and shall reimburse Hanny Holdings for any such Losses paid by Hanny Holdings pursuant to the Inducement Agreement. 

  

X. General 

   

 10.1 _Press Releases and Announcements_. From the date of execution of this Agreement until the Closing, neither party shall issue any press release (or make any other public announcement) related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without prior written approval of the other party hereto, except as may be necessary, in the opinion of counsel to the party seeking to make disclosure, to comply 

   #####

This Agreement may not be amended, a provision of this Agreement or any default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or agreement under this Agreement may not be waived, and a consent may not be rendered, except in a writing executed by the party against which such action is sought to be enforced. Neither the failure nor any delay by any Person in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege shall preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. In addition, no course of dealing between or among any Persons having any interest in this Agreement shall be deemed effective to modify or amend any part of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of any Person under or by reason of this Agreement.

The schedules in the Disclosure Schedule relate only to the representations and warranties in the section and subsection of this Agreement to which they correspond and not to any other representation or warranty in this Agreement except where the relevance to another representation or warranty is reasonably apparent on the face of the statement in the Disclosure Schedule.

 10.12 _Specific Performance_. Subject to the provisions of Sections 5.15(b) and 5.17(b), each of which shall apply to the exclusion of this section in the circumstances to which the former relate, respectively, each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the subject matter of this Agreement, including the business, assets and properties of the Companies, is unique, that the other parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached, and that the remedies at law would not be adequate to compensate such other parties not in default or in breach. Accordingly, each of the parties agrees that the other parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically such provisions in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled under this Agreement. The parties waive any defense that a remedy at law is adequate in connection with actions instituted for injunctive relief or specific performance of this Agreement as provided in this Section.

Exhibit A 

   

ESCROW AGREEMENT 

   

 This ESCROW AGREEMENT (this " _Escrow Agreement_ ") is made as of [ ], 2006, among IMATION CORP., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA (" _Purchaser_ "), MEMOREX INTERNATIONAL INC., a corporation organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (" _Seller_ "), and U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, a national banking association, as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "). 

  

Recitals 

   

 WHEREAS, Purchaser and Seller have entered into a Acquisition Agreement dated as of January 19, 2006 (the " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") pursuant to which Purchaser is acquiring substantially all of the assets of Seller related to the Business, including the capital stock or shares in the capital of certain of its operating subsidiaries. Capitalized terms used in this Escrow Agreement without definition will have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Acquisition Agreement. 

  

 WHEREAS, in order to provide a source of payment for the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Indemnification Escrow Amount pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, Purchaser and Seller have agreed, pursuant to Section 2.8 of the Acquisition Agreement, that Purchaser will deliver to the Escrow Agent the sum of $41,000,000 (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") from the Estimated Initial Purchase Price to be held and disposed of by the Escrow Agent as provided in this Escrow Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Escrow Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: 

  

 1. _Appointment of the Escrow Agent_. Purchaser and Seller appoint the Escrow Agent to serve as, and the Escrow Agent agrees to act as, escrow agent upon the terms and conditions of this Escrow Agreement. 

  

 2. _Deposit of the Escrow Amount._  

  

 (a) At the Closing, in accordance with the terms of Sections 2.7 and 2.8 of the Acquisition Agreement, Purchaser will deposit the Escrow Amount in immediately available funds with the Escrow Agent to be held and disposed of as provided in this Escrow Agreement. The funds and property held by the Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement, regardless of the account in which contained, including any interest, dividends or gains earned thereon and any other earnings in respect thereof, are hereinafter called the " _Escrow Fund_." The Escrow Fund will be held in trust and will be used solely for the purposes and subject to the conditions set forth in this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent will hold the Escrow Fund in two separate accounts, the first (the " _Adjustment Escrow Account_ ") to hold $8,000,000 (the " _Adjustment Escrow Amount_ ") of the amount deposited, together with any investment earnings thereon, representing a source of payment of Sellers obligations 

   ##### 

  

    

under Section 2.9 of the Acquisition Agreement, in each case, to the extent
provided herein, and the second (the " _Indemnification Escrow Account_ " and
with Adjustment Escrow Account, the " _Escrow Accounts_ ") to hold $33,000,000
(the " _Indemnification Escrow Amount_ ") of the amount deposited,
representing a source of payment of Sellers obligations under Sections 9.1
and 9.3 of the Acquisition Agreement, in each case to the extent provided
herein, and, to the extent funds in Adjustment Escrow Account are insufficient
for that purpose, Sellers obligations under Section 2.9 of the Acquisition
Agreement, to the extent provided herein. 

  

 (b) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 2(c) and 7(a), (i) Seller will have the ability to pledge, convey, hypothecate or grant a security interest in its rights hereunder (it being understood that Seller may assign Sellers contractual rights under this Agreement to a Person to whom or which it assigns its rights under the Acquisition Agreement). Until all funds are disbursed pursuant to Section 3, the Escrow Agent will be in sole possession of the Escrow Fund and will not act or be deemed to act as custodian for any person for purposes of perfecting a security interest therein. Accordingly, except as provided in Sections 2(c) and 7(a), no person will have any right to have or to hold any of the Escrow Fund (except for Sellers contractual rights under this Agreement) as collateral for any obligation and will not be able to obtain a security interest in any assets (tangible or intangible) contained in the Escrow Fund (except for Sellers contractual rights under this Agreement). 

  

 (c) The parties acknowledge and agree that neither a voluntary nor involuntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law nor the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or similar official in respect of Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, (any of which is referred to herein as " _Bankruptcy Event_ ") will increase Purchasers or Sellers, as the case may be, interest in the Escrow Fund or affect, modify, convert or otherwise change any right either may have to the Escrow Fund. 

  

 (d) Seller hereby grants to Purchaser, effective as of the date hereof, a security interest in, and hereby pledges and assigns to Purchaser, Sellers interest in the Escrow Fund (except for Sellers contractual rights under this Agreement) to secure Purchasers rights to receive payments from the Escrow Fund under this Agreement; _provided_ that Purchasers security interest in the Escrow Fund will be subject and junior to the lien granted to the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 7(a) and will rank _pari passu_ with Sellers security interest in the Escrow Fund granted hereunder;  _provided_ that any such pledge, conveyance, hypothecation or grant shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement and shall not increase Sellers or any such assignees interest in the Escrow Fund or affect, modify, convert or otherwise change any right it may have to the Escrow Fund. Subject to the foregoing, the Escrow Agent acknowledges that Purchaser has a security interest in the Escrow Fund and the Escrow Agent is maintaining the Escrow Fund subject to such security interest. Subject to the foregoing, the Escrow Agent and Seller will take all actions as may be reasonably requested in writing by Purchaser to perfect or maintain the security interest created by Seller hereunder in Sellers interest in the Escrow Fund. Purchaser is authorized by the other parties to this Agreement to file UCC financing statements to perfect Purchasers security interest granted herein, with or without execution by the other parties hereto, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Such security interest will automatically be released with respect to any funds properly disbursed from the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Purchaser agrees to execute such instruments of release and termination of the security interest 

   ##### 

  

    

granted hereunder with respect to any interest in the Escrow Fund received by
Seller pursuant to the terms hereof, as may be reasonably requested
in writing by Seller. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller
makes no representation or warranty as to the creation, perfection or
priority of any security interest of Purchaser in, to or relating to the
Escrow Fund. 

  

 (e) Purchaser hereby grants to Seller, effective as of the date hereof, a security interest in, and hereby pledges and assigns to Seller, Purchasers interest in the Escrow Fund (except for Purchasers contractual rights under this Agreement) to secure Sellers rights to receive payments from the Escrow Fund under this Agreement; _provided_ that Sellers security interest in the Escrow Fund will be subject and junior to the lien granted to the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 7(a) and will rank _pari passu_ with Purchasers security interest in the Escrow Fund granted hereunder;  _provided_ that any such pledge, conveyance, hypothecation or grant shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement and shall not increase Purchasers or any such assignees interest in the Escrow Fund or affect, modify, convert or otherwise change any right it may have to the Escrow Fund. Subject to the foregoing, the Escrow Agent acknowledges that Seller has a security interest in the Escrow Fund and the Escrow Agent is maintaining the Escrow Fund subject to such security interest. Subject to the foregoing, the Escrow Agent and Purchaser will take all actions as may be reasonably requested in writing by Seller to perfect or maintain the security interest created by Purchaser hereunder in Sellers interest in the Escrow Fund. Seller is authorized by the other parties to this Agreement to file UCC financing statements to perfect Sellers security interest granted herein, with or without execution by the other parties hereto, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Such security interest will automatically be released with respect to any funds properly disbursed from the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Seller agrees to execute such instruments of release and termination of the security interest granted hereunder with respect to any interest in the Escrow Fund received by Purchaser pursuant to the terms hereof, as may be reasonably requested in writing by Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser makes no representation or warranty as to the creation, perfection or priority of any security interest of Seller in, to or relating to the Escrow Fund. 

  

 (f) The Escrow Agent represents that (i) it is a "securities intermediary" (as that term is defined in Section 8-102(a)(14) of the UCC) and is acting in such capacity with respect to the Escrow Fund; (ii) it is not a "clearing corporation" (as that term is defined in Section 8-102(a)(5) of the UCC); (iii) the Escrow Fund is an account to which "financial assets" (as that term is defined in Section 8-102(a)(9) of the UCC) are or may be credited, and the Escrow Agent will, subject to the terms of this Agreement, treat Purchaser and Seller as entitled to exercise the rights that comprise any financial asset credited to the Escrow Fund; and (iv) each item of property (including, without limitation, any investment property, financial assets, securities, instruments, general intangibles or cash) credited to the Escrow Fund will be treated as a "financial asset" within the meaning of Section 8-102(a)(9) of the UCC. 

  

 3. _Payments to Purchaser from the Escrow Accounts._  

  

 (a) _Adjustment Escrow Account_. In the event that Purchaser is owed any amount required to be paid by Seller pursuant to Section 2.9(d)(iii) of the Acquisition Agreement (the " _Net Asset Shortfall Amount_ "), Purchaser will have the right (but not the obligation) to deliver a written notice (an " _Adjustment Notice_ ") to the Escrow Agent (with a copy to Seller) (i) setting forth the Net Asset Shortfall Amount, 

   ##### 

  

    

(ii) attaching a true and complete copy of the written agreement of Purchaser
and Seller or the determination of the independent accountants (the "
_Accountants  Determination_") pursuant to Section 2.9 of the Acquisition
Agreement showing that the Net Asset Shortfall Amount in the amount claimed
is owed, (iii) requesting that such amount be paid from the Adjustment Escrow
Account (to the extent of the funds available therein, and, if such funds are
insufficient, from the Indemnification Escrow Account) and (iv) containing
payment instructions. Within three (3) business days after receipt of an
Adjustment Notice from Purchaser, the Escrow Agent will pay the Net Asset
Shortfall Amount (to the extent of funds available in Adjustment Escrow
Account, and, in the event funds therein are insufficient, from
the Indemnification Escrow Account) to Purchaser in immediately available
funds according to Purchasers instructions and the remainder, if any, of the
Adjustment Escrow Amount to Seller in immediately available funds according
to Sellers instructions. In the event that there should be an Excess Net
Asset Amount or no Net Asset Shortfall Amount, Seller will have the right (but
not the obligation) to deliver an Adjustment Notice to the Escrow Agent (with
a copy to Purchaser) (i) stating that there is no Net Asset Shortfall Amount
or that there is an Excess Net Asset Amount, (ii) attaching a true and
complete copy of the Accountants Determination pursuant to Section 2.9 of the
Acquisition Agreement showing that there is no Net Asset Shortfall Amount or
that there is an Excess Net Asset Amount, (iii) requesting that the full
Adjustment Escrow Amount be paid from the Adjustment Escrow Account to Seller
or its designee and (iv) containing payment instructions. Within three (3)
business days after receipt of an Adjustment Notice from Seller, the Escrow
Agent will pay the full Adjustment Escrow Amount to Seller in immediately
available funds according to Sellers instructions. 

  

 (b) _Indemnification Escrow Account_. In the event that Purchaser is owed any amount required to be paid by Seller pursuant to Article IX of the Acquisition Agreement (an " _Indemnification Amount_ "), Purchaser will have the right (but not the obligation) to deliver a written notice (an " _Indemnification Notice_ ") to the Escrow Agent (with a copy to Seller) (i) setting forth the Indemnification Amount, (ii) attaching a true and complete copy of the Final Determination showing that the Indemnification Amount in the amount claimed is owed, (iii) requesting that such amount (or any portion thereof) be paid from the Indemnification Escrow Amount on deposit in the Indemnification Escrow Account and (iv) containing payment instructions. Within three (3) business days of receipt of an Indemnification Notice, the Escrow Agent will pay the requested Indemnification Amount to Purchaser in immediately available funds according to Purchasers instructions. A " _Final Determination_ " means (x) the written agreement of Seller and Purchaser, or (y) a final arbitration award or a final order, decree or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States of America from which no appeal may be taken, whether because of lapsed time or otherwise, in an action between Purchaser and Seller. The Escrow Agent will reserve in the Indemnification Escrow Account the aggregate amount of all Purchaser Claims submitted by Purchaser to Seller pursuant to Section 9.1(d) of the Acquisition Agreement of which the Escrow Agent has received a copy until such Purchaser Claims are paid or otherwise disposed of pursuant to a Final Determination. On the business day following March 31, 2007, the Escrow Agent will pay, in accordance with written instructions received from Seller, fifty percent (50%) of the Indemnification Escrow Amount less the sum of (i) the aggregate total of all amounts theretofore paid to Purchaser out of the Indemnification Escrow Account and (ii) the aggregate total of the amounts set forth in all pending Indemnification Notices and unresolved Purchaser Claims. On the business day following September 30, 2007, the Escrow Agent will pay, in accordance with written instructions received from Seller, 

   ##### 

  

    

the balance then remaining in the Escrow Fund less the aggregate total of the
amounts set forth in all pending Indemnification Notices and
unresolved Purchaser Claims. In the event that such payment is reduced
because of unresolved Purchaser Claims, promptly following the payment or
other disposal of each unresolved Purchaser Claim pursuant to a Final
Determination the Escrow Agent will pay, in accordance with
written instructions received from Seller, the amount, if any, by which the
balance then remaining in the Escrow Fund exceeds the aggregate amount of the
remaining unresolved Purchaser Claims. 

  

 4. _Termination_. This Escrow Agreement will terminate on the date that no funds remain in the Escrow Fund. 

  

 5. _Qualified Investments_. The Escrow Account will be invested by the Escrow Agent for the account and risk of Seller in any one or more Qualified Investments. As used herein, " _Qualified Investment_ " will mean (a) treasury bills, treasury notes or any other direct obligations issued by or guaranteed in full as to principal and interest by the United States of America with a maturity of not more than 90 days, (b) obligations of or guaranteed by the United States government with a maturity of not more than 90 days, (c) certificates of deposit with a maturity of not more than 90 days with a commercial bank having capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than $100,000,000 (including the Escrow Agent and its affiliates), and (d) debt of or guaranteed by any state or political subdivision with a maturity of not more than 90 days that is rated A or better (the "Permitted Investments"); and provided further, that at least $1,000,000 (or, if less, the full amount of the Escrow Funds then in the Escrow Account) shall be held in fully liquid investments. The Escrow Agent is authorized to sell any Qualified Investment purchased by it pursuant to this Section 5 in order to provide cash to make any payment required or permitted to be made under this Agreement by the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent will not be liable for any loss due to fluctuations in market rates resulting from a sale of Qualified Investments in accordance with the previous sentence or penalties incurred because of early redemption. The Escrow Agent will hold any Qualified Investments purchased by it without any responsibility other than for the safe keeping thereof. 

  

 6. _Tax Matters; Distributions_. Seller will provide the Escrow Agent with a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8 or W-9, as applicable. The principal of the Escrow Fund will be treated for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes as owned by Seller. All interest or other income earned in the Escrow Account will be treated as the property of Seller and treated for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes as earned by Purchaser and will be reported as such by the Escrow Agent. Within five (5) business days after the end of each calendar quarter during the term of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall pay to Seller, in accordance with Sellers payment instructions, all income earned in the Escrow Account during that calendar quarter. None of such income shall be subject to Purchaser Claims, nor shall the Escrow Agent withhold payment thereof by reason of any excess of unresolved Purchaser Claims over the amount then remaining in the Escrow Fund. 

  

 7. _Concerning the Escrow Agent._  

  

 (a) Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other, will pay the Escrow Agent the fees detailed in _Schedule 1 _hereto for the services to be rendered hereunder and will pay or reimburse the Escrow Agent upon request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances 

   ##### 

  

    

incurred or made by it in connection with carrying out its duties
hereunder, including, without limitation, trading commissions and fees and
reasonable attorneys fees. The Escrow Agent is hereby granted a prior lien
upon any property, cash or assets of the Escrow Fund with respect to its
unpaid fees, nonreimbursed expenses and unsatisfied indemnification
rights, superior to the interests of any other persons or entities. The
Escrow Agent will have the right to set off and deduct any unpaid fees,
nonreimbursed expenses and/or unsatisfied indemnification rights from amounts
on deposit in the Escrow Fund. 

  

 (b) Seller and Purchaser will jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Escrow Agent and each director, employee, attorney, agent and affiliate of the Escrow Agent for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred unless caused by or arising out of gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Escrow Agent or breach by the Escrow Agent of the terms of this Escrow Agreement, arising out of or in connection with its entering into this Escrow Agreement and carrying out its duties hereunder, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim of liability. The obligations of Seller and Purchaser under this Section 7(b) will survive the termination of this Escrow Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, as between Seller and Purchaser, any payment to be made to the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 7(a) or 7(b) will be borne 50% by Purchaser and 50% by Seller, severally and not jointly. 

  

 (d) The Escrow Agent will prepare and deliver to Purchaser and Seller within ten business days after the end of each calendar month or partial calendar month ending prior to or on the date of termination of this Escrow Agreement a written account describing all transactions with respect to the Escrow Account during such calendar month. 

  

 (e) The duties and responsibilities of the Escrow Agent under this Agreement will be determined solely by the express provisions of this Escrow Agreement, and no other or further duties or responsibilities will be implied. 

  

 (f) The Escrow Agent may act upon any instrument or other writing provided by a duly authorized officer of any of the parties hereto believed by it in good faith to be genuine, and to be signed or presented by the proper person and on the legal advice of its counsel in making payments as provided herein. The Escrow Agent will not be liable in connection with the performance by it of its duties pursuant to the provisions of this Escrow Agreement, except for its own willful misconduct, gross negligence or breach by it of the express terms of this Escrow Agreement. 

  

 (g) IN NO EVENT WILL THE ESCROW AGENT BE LIABLE, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSSES OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF THE ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (h) The Escrow Agent will have the right, but not the obligation, to consult with counsel of choice and will not be liable for action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel. If the Escrow Agent becomes involved in litigation on account of this Escrow Agreement, it will have the right to retain counsel and will have a first lien on the property deposited hereunder for any and all costs, attorneys fees, charges, disbursements, and expenses in connection with such litigation; and will be entitled to reimburse itself therefor out of the property deposited hereunder, and if it will be unable to reimburse itself from the property deposited hereunder, the parties hereto jointly and severally agree to pay to the Escrow Agent on demand its reasonable charges, counsel and attorneys fees, disbursements, and expenses in connection with such litigation. The Escrow Agent will have the right to perform any of its duties hereunder through agents, attorneys, custodians or nominees without liability for the acts or nonaction of any such party selected with due care. 

  

 (i) Any banking association or corporation into which the Escrow Agent may be merged, converted or with which the Escrow Agent may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Escrow Agent will be a party, or any banking association or corporation to which all or substantially all of the corporate trust or escrow business of the Escrow Agent will be sold or otherwise transferred, will succeed to all the Escrow Agents rights, obligations and immunities hereunder without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding. 

  

 (j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent will not be obligated to perform any obligation hereunder and will not incur any liability for the nonperformance or breach of any obligation hereunder to the extent that the Escrow Agent is delayed in performing, unable to perform or breaches such obligation because of acts of God, war, terrorism, fire, floods, strikes, electrical outages, equipment or transmission failures, or other causes reasonably beyond its control. 

  

 (k) In the event funds transfer instructions are given (other than in writing at the time of the execution of the Escrow Agreement), whether in writing, by telecopier or otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or persons designated on _Schedule 1 _hereto, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmations of anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in writing actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. The parties to the Escrow Agreement acknowledge that such security procedure is commercially reasonable. It is understood that the Escrow Agent and the beneficiarys bank in any funds transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying number provided by any party hereto to identify (i) the beneficiary, (ii) the beneficiarys bank or (iii) an intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply funds for any payment order it executes using any such identifying number, even where its use may result in a person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a bank other than the beneficiarys bank, or an intermediary bank, designated. 

  

 8. _Resignation of Escrow Agent; Appointment of Successor_. The Escrow Agent may at any time resign by giving 90 days prior written notice of resignation to Purchaser and to Seller. Purchaser and Seller may at any time, with or without cause, jointly remove the Escrow 

   ##### 

  

    

Agent by giving ten days prior written notice signed by Purchaser and Seller
to the Escrow Agent. If the Escrow Agent resigns or is removed, a successor
escrow agent, which will be a bank or trust company with assets in excess of
$1 billion, will be appointed jointly by Purchaser and Seller, who will
notify the Escrow Agent by written instrument executed by Purchaser and Seller
and delivered to the Escrow Agent and to such successor escrow agent and,
thereupon, the resignation or removal of the predecessor escrow agent will
become effective and such successor escrow agent, without any further act,
deed or conveyance, will become vested with all right, title and interest to
all cash and property held hereunder of such predecessor escrow agent. The
predecessor Escrow Agent will be discharged from its obligations under this
Escrow Agreement but will not be discharged from any liability for actions
taken or omitted to be taken as Escrow Agent hereunder prior to such
succession. The predecessor Escrow Agent will transmit all records pertaining
to the Escrow Amount held by it and will pay all of the Escrow Amount held by
it to the successor Escrow Agent. If no successor escrow agent will have been
appointed within 90 days of a notice of resignation by the Escrow Agent, the
Escrow Agents sole responsibility will thereafter be to hold the Escrow Fund
until the earlier of its receipt of designation of a successor escrow agent,
a joint written instruction by Purchaser and Seller and the termination of
this Escrow Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

  

 9. _General._  

  

 (a) _Amendment and Waiver_. This Escrow Agreement may not be amended, nor may any provision of this Escrow Agreement or any default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or agreement under this Escrow Agreement be waived, except in a writing executed by all parties to this Agreement. Neither the failure nor any delay by any Person in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Escrow Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. In addition, no course of dealing between or among any persons having any interest in this Escrow Agreement will be deemed effective to modify or amend any part of this Escrow Agreement or any rights or obligations of any person under or by reason of this Escrow Agreement. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Escrow Agreement with respect hereto are cumulative and not alternative. 

  

 (b) _Notices_. All notices, demands and other communications to be given or delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Escrow Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been given (i) when delivered if personally delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (ii) when received if sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier service (receipt requested), (iii) five (5) business days after being mailed, if sent by first class mail, return receipt requested, or (iv) when receipt is acknowledged by an affirmative act of the party receiving notice, if sent by facsimile, telecopy or other electronic transmission device (provided that such an acknowledgement does not include an acknowledgment generated automatically by a facsimile or telecopy machine or other electronic transmission device). Notices, demands and communications to Purchaser, Seller or the Escrow Agent will, unless another address is specified in writing, be sent to the address indicated below:

 (c) _Assignment_. Neither this Escrow Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any party to this Escrow Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties to this Escrow Agreement, except that Seller may assign its rights under this Agreement to Hanny Holdings or any Person under the continuing control of any of Hanny Holdings. This Escrow Agreement and all of the provisions of this Escrow Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties to this Escrow Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 (d) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing expressed or referred to in this Escrow Agreement confers any rights or remedies upon any Person that is not a party or permitted assign of a party to this Escrow Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Escrow Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Escrow Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Escrow Agreement. 

  

 (f) _Complete Agreement_. This Escrow Agreement contains the complete agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or between the parties, written or oral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as between Purchaser and Seller this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the Acquisition Agreement, which shall prevail in the event of any inconsistency. 

  

 (g) _Signatures; Counterparts_. This Escrow Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile signature will be considered an original signature. 

  

 (h) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, USA, which shall be the proper law hereof notwithstanding any rule or principle of conflict of laws under which any other body of law would be made applicable; provided, however, that the arbitration agreement contained in Section 9(i) and the enforcement of any award rendered pursuant thereto shall be governed by United States federal law to the exclusion of state law. 

  

 (i) _Arbitration_. Any disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration under the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted at New York, New York, USA in the English language. In the event that any arbitration commenced under this Agreement shall involve issues in common with an arbitration commenced under the Acquisition Agreement, the parties hereto consent to the consolidation of the two arbitrations. 

  

 (j) _Construction_. The parties and their respective counsel have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Escrow Agreement. In addition, each of the parties acknowledges that it is sophisticated and has been advised by experienced counsel and, to the extent it deemed necessary, other advisors in connection with the negotiation and drafting of this Escrow Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Escrow Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Escrow Agreement. The parties intend that each representation, warranty and agreement contained in this Escrow Agreement will have independent significance. If any party has breached any representation, warranty or agreement in any respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or agreement relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) that the party has not breached will not detract from or mitigate the fact that the party is in breach of the first representation, warranty or agreement.

 Purchaser and Seller are parties to an Acquisition Agreement entered into on January 19, 2006 (the " _Acquisition Agreement_ "). Pursuant to Section 2 of the Acquisition Agreement, the parties wish to document the transfer of Acquired Intellectual Property covered by the Acquisition Agreement. All capitalized terms in this Intellectual Property Assignment shall have the same meaning as such terms have in the Acquisition Agreement. 

 

1\. Assignment. For value received, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged,
Seller does hereby grant, bargain, sell, convey, assign, transfer and set
over unto Purchaser, absolutely and not as security, all of Sellers right,
title and interest in and to the following, whether now existing or hereafter
arising, acquired or created: 

   

1.1. All of the "Acquired Intellectual Property" described in the Acquisition
Agreement; 

   

 1.2. All goodwill of Sellers business symbolized by, incorporated in or associated with the Acquired Intellectual Property;

being transferred hereunder are still shown in the various domain name
registrars, patent offices, or trademark offices as being owned by a
predecessor-in-interest to or an Affiliate of Seller. Seller agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to record the appropriate documents to
perfect its title to such domain names, applications and registrations. 

  

3\. Further Assurances. Seller has today delivered to Purchaser, along with
this Assignment, appropriate country-specific patent and trademark
assignments for recordation by Purchaser with relevant patent and trademark
offices duly executed by Seller. Seller agrees that, upon reasonable request
from time to time, it shall (or direct its Affiliates to, if applicable)
execute and deliver all such additional documents as may be required, and do
all other acts which may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable
opinion of Purchasers counsel to perfect or record the right or title of
Purchaser to the Acquired Intellectual Property transferred hereby.

     3.  |   | For the purposes of this opinion we have assumed without
further enquiry:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | the authenticity of all documents submitted to us
as originals, the conformity with the originals thereof of all documents
submitted to us as copies or drafts and the authenticity of such originals;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | the genuineness of all signatures and seals;  
      
    | (c)  |   | the accuracy and completeness of all corporate minutes,

       | (a)  |   | The Company is a company duly incorporated with
limited liability under the International Business Companies Act and validly
existing in good standing under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. The
Company is a separate legal entity and is subject to suit in its own name.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | The Company has full capacity to enter into and perform
its obligations under the Agreement and the Company has taken all necessary
action to authorise its entry into the Agreement and the exercise of its
rights and the performance of its obligations under the Agreement.  
      
    | (c)  |   | The Agreement has been duly executed for and on behalf
of the Company pursuant to the Directors Resolutions.  
      
    | (d)  |   | The Agreement will be treated by the courts of the
British Virgin Islands as the legally binding, valid and enforceable
obligations of the Company.

       | (e)  |   | No consents or authorisations of any government
or official authorities of or in the British Virgin Islands are necessary for
the entry into and performance by the Company of, and the exercise of its
rights, pursuant to the Agreement.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (f)  |   | The execution and delivery, where applicable, of the
Agreement by the Company, and the performance of its obligations and the
exercise of any of its rights under the Agreement, do not and will not
conflict with:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | any law of the British Virgin Islands; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the
Company.  
   

  

       | (g)  |   | No stamp duties or similar documentary taxes
imposed by or in the British Virgin Islands are payable in respect of the
Agreement.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (h)  |   | The Company will not be required by any laws of the
British Virgin Islands to make any deduction or withholding from any payment
it may make under the Agreement.  
      
    | (i)  |   | There are no government controls or exchange controls
in relation to the observance by the Company of its obligations under the
Agreement.  
      
    | (j)  |   | There are several ways in which an arbitration award
obtained in the state of California may be enforced in the British Virgin
Islands.  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | Any final and conclusive monetary award
obtained against the Company in arbitration proceedings in California in
respect of the Documents for a definite sum may, with the leave of the High
Court in the British Virgin Islands, be enforced in the same manner as
a judgment of the British Virgin Islands court under the provisions of
the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of
Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958 (the "Convention"). The High Court may
only exercise its discretion to refuse leave if:  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (1)  |   | a party to the arbitration agreement was, under
the law applicable to him, under some incapacity;  
      
    | (2)  |   | the arbitration agreement was not valid under
the governing law of the arbitration agreement;  
      
    | (3)  |   | the Company was not given proper notice of
the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings, or
was otherwise unable to present its case;  
      
    | (4)  |   | the award deals with an issue not contemplated by or
not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains
matters beyond the scope of the arbitration, subject to the proviso that an
award which contains decisions on such matters may be enforced to the extent
that it contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration which can
be separated from those matters not so submitted;

       | (5)  |   | the composition of the arbitral authority was
not in accordance with the agreement of the parties or, failing
such agreement, with the laws of New York;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (6)  |   | the award has not yet become binding upon the parties,
or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority, either in
California, or pursuant to the law of the arbitration agreement;  
      
    | (7)  |   | the subject matter of the award was not capable
of resolution by arbitration; or  
      
    | (8)  |   | enforcement would be contrary to public policy.  
   

  

       | (ii)  |   | Alternatively, the award may be treated as a
cause of action in itself (if it has such effect under the law of place where
the award was made) and sued upon as a debt so that no retrial of the issues
would be necessary, in which case the British Virgin Islands court will
ordinarily enforce the debt unless:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (1)  |   | the original arbitral tribunal had no
jurisdiction to make the award;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (2)  |   | the award was made in breach of the principles
of natural justice;  
      
    | (3)  |   | the award conflicts with an earlier decision of
a British Virgin Islands court;  
      
    | (4)  |   | enforcement would be contrary to public policy; or  
      
    | (5)  |   | the award was procured by fraud.  
   

  

       | (iii)  |   | The award may also be registered under the
provisions of the Arbitration Act (Cap 6) and enforced as a judgment of the
British Virgin Islands courts. There is no statutory test for the exercise of
the courts discretion in relation to registration in this manner, but in our
view the court would be likely to exercise its discretion in a similar matter
to the requirements for enforcing awards under the Convention where the award
was made in a jurisdiction which is a signatory to the Convention.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (k)  |   | The Company is not entitled to immunity from suit
or enforcement of a judgment on the ground of sovereignty or otherwise in the
courts of the British Virgin Islands in respect of proceedings against it in
relation to the Agreement, and the execution of the Agreement and performance
of its obligations under the Agreement by the Company, constitute private and
commercial acts.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (l)  |   | Under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, you will
not be deemed to be resident, domiciled or carrying on any commercial
activity in the British Virgin Islands or subject to any tax in the British
Virgin Islands by reason only of the execution and performance of the
Agreement nor is it necessary for the execution, performance and enforcement
of the Agreement that you be authorised or qualified to carry on business in
the British Virgin Islands.

       | (m)  |   | The choice of the law of the State of New York as
the proper law of the Agreement would be upheld as a valid choice of law by
the courts of the British Virgin Islands and applied by such courts in
proceedings in relation to the Agreement as the proper law thereof.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (n)  |   | It is not necessary in order to ensure the legality,
validity, enforceability or admissibility in evidence in proceedings of the
obligations of the Company or your rights under the Agreement that it or any
other document be notarised, filed, registered or recorded in the British
Virgin Islands.  
      
    | (o)  |   | The obligations of the Company under the Agreement
constitute direct obligations that rank at least _pari passu_ with all its
other unsecured obligations.  
      
    | (p)  |   | No court proceedings pending against the Company are
indicated by our searches of the British Virgin Islands High Court Registry
referred to at paragraph 2(b)(v).  
      
    | (q)  |   | On the basis of our searches of the British Virgin
Islands Registry of Corporate Affairs and the British Virgin Islands High
Court Registry referred to at paragraphs 2(b)(iv) and 2(b)(v) respectively,
no currently valid order or resolution for winding up of the Company and no
current notice of appointment of a receiver over the Company or any of its
assets appears on the records maintained in respect of the Company at the
Registry of Corporate Affairs, but it should be noted that failure to file
notice of appointment of a receiver does not invalidate the receivership
but merely gives rise to penalties on the part of the receiver.  
      
    | (r)  |   | Service of process in the British Virgin Islands on the
Company may be effected by leaving at the registered office of the Company
the relevant document to be served. On the basis of our search of the British
Virgin Islands Registry of Corporate Affairs referred to at paragraph
2(b)(iv), the registered office of each Company is [ ], Road Town, Tortola,
British Virgin Islands.  
   

  

     5.  |   | This opinion is confined to and given on the basis of
the laws of the British Virgin Islands as they are in force at the date of
this opinion. We have made no investigation of, and express no opinion on,
the laws of any other jurisdiction.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     6.  |   | The opinions set out above are subject to the following
qualifications:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | Rights and obligations may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, arrangement and other similar laws of
the British Virgin Islands of general application affecting the rights of
creditors.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Claims under the Agreement may become barred under the
laws relating to limitation of actions in the British Virgin Islands or may
be or become subject to defences of set-off or counterclaim.  
      
    | (c)  |   | Equitable remedies such as injunctions and orders for
specific performance are discretionary and will not normally be available
where damages are considered an adequate remedy, that is, where the court is
of the opinion that, it is just, in all the circumstances, that a plaintiff
should be confined to his remedy in damages.

       | (d)  |   | Where obligations are to be performed in a
jurisdiction outside the British Virgin Islands they may not be enforceable
under the laws of the British Virgin Islands to the extent that such
performance would be contrary to public policy under the laws of that
jurisdiction.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (e)  |   | The courts in the British Virgin Islands will determine
in their discretion whether or not an illegal or unenforceable provision may
be severed.  
      
    | (f)  |   | The courts of the British Virgin Islands may refuse to
give effect to a provision in respect of the cost of unsuccessful litigation
brought before those courts or where the courts themselves have made an order
for costs.  
      
    | (g)  |   | The term "enforceable" means that a document is of a
type and form enforced by the British Virgin Islands courts. It does not mean
that each obligation will be enforced in accordance with its terms. Certain
rights and obligations may be qualified by inconclusiveness of certificates,
doctrines of good faith and fair conduct, the availability of equitable
remedies and other matters, but in our view, this qualification would not
defeat your legitimate expectations in any material respect.  
   

  

     7.  |   | This opinion is rendered for your benefit and the
benefit of your legal counsel in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement only. It may not be disclosed to or relied on
by any other party or for any other purpose.
