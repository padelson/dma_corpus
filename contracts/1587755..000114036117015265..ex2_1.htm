NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties and covenants herein and intending to be legally bound, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

  


 

  

ARTICLE I

  


 

  

 _The Merger_

  


 

  

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set

Section 1.02 _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall
take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, Four

waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions),
or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between
the Company and Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Marketing Period
has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions), then the Closing shall
occur on the earlier to occur of (a) a Business Day, if any, during the
Marketing Period specified by Parent on no less than three Business Days'
notice to the Company and (b) two Business Days following the final day of the
Marketing Period, as the Marketing Period may be extended in accordance with
the terms hereof (subject in each case in clause (a) and clause (b) above to
the satisfaction or waiver (by the party entitled to grant such waiver) of all
the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ for the Closing as of the date
determined pursuant to this proviso). The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

  


 

  

Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the
Delaware Secretary of State the certificate of merger relating to the Merger
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed and acknowledged in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and, as soon as practicable on or
after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings required under the DGCL
or by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time that the Certificate of
Merger has been duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, or at such
later time as the Company and Parent shall agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "
_Effective Time_ ").

  

  

 

2  

  

Section 1.04 _Effects_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

  


 

  

Section 1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The certificate of
incorporation of the Company shall, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action, be amended and restated to read in its
entirety as set forth on _Exhibit A_ and, as so amended and restated, shall be
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The bylaws of
Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Company until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law, except that references to the name of
Merger Sub shall be replaced by references to the name of the Surviving
Company.

  


 

  

Section 1.06 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Company_. The directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of
the Surviving Company until the earlier of their death, in each case,
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company
until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case
may be.

  


 

  

ARTICLE II

  


 

  

 _Effect on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Entities; Exchange of
Certificates_

  


 

  

Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, HHC,
Merger Sub or the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (the " _Common Stock_ ") or any shares of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ "):

  


 

  

(a) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of Merger Sub Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Company with the same rights, powers
and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Company. From and after
the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger Sub Common
Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of
common stock of the Surviving Company into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

  


 

  

(b) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned Stock and Subsidiary-Owned Stock_.

  


 

  

(i) Each share of Common Stock that is owned by the Company as treasury stock
and each share of Common Stock that is owned directly by Parent, HHC, or
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

  

 

3  

  

(ii) Each share of Common Stock that is owned by any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (including HHC but excluding Merger Sub) or of Merger Sub
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  


 

  

(c) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Subject to _Sections 2.02_ , _2.03_ and
_6.04_ , each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled or converted into
shares of the Surviving Company in accordance with _Section 2.01(b))_ , and,
except as provided in _Section 2.03_ , any shares of Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Common
Stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")) and,
as of the Effective Time, has not failed to perfect, or not effectively
withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL, shall be converted into
the right to receive $23.75 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ " and together with the Option Merger Consideration and the RSU
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 6.04_ , the " _Closing Merger
Consideration_ "). All such shares of Common Stock, when so converted, shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-
entry form (such shares, " _Book-Entry Shares_ ")) that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented any such shares of Common Stock (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding
shares of Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend or distribution,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any number
or amount contained herein, including the Closing Merger Consideration, will
be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

  


 

  

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates; Payment Fund_.

  


 

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, at its sole
cost and expense, appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment and
delivery of the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_. At the
Closing, immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent for payment in accordance with
this _Article II_ through the Paying Agent, cash sufficient to pay the Merger
Consideration. All such cash deposited with the Paying Agent is hereinafter
referred to as the " _Payment Fund_."

  


 

  

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As reasonably promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time (and in any event within three Business Days after the
Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail, or otherwise
provide in the case of Book-Entry Shares, to each holder of record of Common
Stock (i) a form of letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ")
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title
shall pass (A) with respect to shares evidenced by Certificates, only upon the
proper delivery of the Certificates and validly executed Letter of Transmittal
to the Paying Agent (and such other documents as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request) and (B) with respect to Book-Entry Shares, only upon
proper delivery of an "agent's message" regarding the book-entry transfer of
Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the
Paying Agent may reasonably request) and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates in exchange for the applicable
Merger Consideration.

  

  

 

4  

  

(c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_. Upon (i) in
the case of shares of Common Stock represented by a Certificate, the surrender
of such Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with the
Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, or (ii) in the case of shares of Common Stock
held as Book-Entry Shares, the receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying
Agent, in each case together with such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which such shares
of Common Stock have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.01_. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a
transferee if the Certificate or Book-Entry Share representing such Common
Stock is presented to the Paying Agent (or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
proper evidence of such transfer) accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.02(c)_ , each share of Common Stock, and any Certificate with
respect thereto, shall be deemed at any time from and after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration that the holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to
receive in respect of such shares pursuant to this _Section 2.02(c)_. No
interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon surrender of the
Certificates (or shares of Common Stock held as Book-Entry Shares). In the
case of Company Stock Awards, the holder of such Company Stock Awards shall
receive in exchange therefor the applicable Closing Merger Consideration into
which such Company Stock Awards have been converted pursuant to _Section 6.04_
, to be paid through the payroll of the Company or its Affiliates on or as
soon as practicable after the Closing Date and in no event later than five
Business Days following the Closing Date.

  


 

  

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock_. The Closing Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ upon
conversion of any shares of Common Stock and any Company Stock Awards shall be
deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Common Stock or Company Stock Awards, as
applicable. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company
of shares of Common Stock or Company Stock Awards that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates formerly representing shares of Common Stock (or shares of Common
Stock held in book-entry form) are presented to Parent or the Paying Agent for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
II_ , subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

  

  

 

5  

  

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
any interest received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the
holders of Common Stock for one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent (or its designee), and any holder of Common Stock who has
not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for
payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon.

  


 

  

(f) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, HHC, Merger Sub or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Payment Fund remaining
unclaimed by former holders of Common Stock as of a date that is immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat or become property
of any Governmental Entity shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Parent (or its designee) free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  


 

  

(g) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash in
the Payment Fund if and as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such
investment shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of
a state of the United States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Ratings Service, respectively, or
in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers' acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion, or in mutual funds
investing in such assets. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to, and be the property of, Parent. No investment
losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund shall diminish the rights
of any of the Company's stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration or
any other payment as provided herein. To the extent there are losses with
respect to such investments or the Payment Fund diminishes for any other
reason below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate
funds required to be paid pursuant to the terms hereof, Parent shall
reasonably promptly replace or restore the cash in the Payment Fund so as to
ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient
to make such cash payments.

  


 

  

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Company and the Paying Agent
(without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making
of such payment under applicable Tax Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that except
as required by a change in Law occurring after the date of this Agreement, the
parties agree that no withholding shall be made under Section 1445 of the Code
with respect to the amounts payable under this Agreement. Amounts so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made.

  


 

  

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, pay the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, as a condition precedent to the
payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate to provide a bond in a customary amount.

  

  

 

6  

  

(j) _Payoff Letters; Customary KYC Material_. The Company shall (i) deliver to
Parent, no later than the third Business Day prior to the Closing Date,
customary pay-off letters relating to the repayment on the Closing Date of the
Existing Company Debt and the release of related Liens and (ii) deliver to
Parent no later than the fourth Business Day prior to the Closing Date any
Customary KYC Material that has been requested at least eight calendar days
prior to the Closing Date.

  


 

  

Section 2.03 _Dissenter 's Rights_.

  


 

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Dissenting
Shares shall be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 2.01_ , and instead the holders of such
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to such rights as are granted by Section
262 of the DGCL (unless and until such stockholder shall have failed to timely
perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such stockholder's right
to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL, in which case such stockholder
shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
_Section 2.01_ , without interest thereon, in exchange for such shares of
Common Stock, and such shares of Common Stock shall no longer be deemed to be
Dissenting Shares) and to receive such consideration as may be determined to
be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the
requirements of the DGCL (the " _Dissenter 's Rights_"). In such case, at the
Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except with
respect to Dissenter's Rights and as provided in this _Section 2.03_.

  


 

  

(b) The Company shall provide prompt written notice to Parent of any written
notices or demands for appraisal by any holder of shares of Common Stock,
attempted withdrawals of such notices or demands and any other instruments
received by the Company relating to the Dissenter's Rights, and, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall have the right to participate in and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise
required by an order of a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, settle or offer to settle any
such demands.

Sub of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ "). The Parent
Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in this _Article

applies to such other section.

  

  

 

7  

  

Section 3.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Parent, HHC and
Merger Sub is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has all corporate or
limited liability company power and authority, as applicable, required to

hereunder. Each of Parent, HHC and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to
do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the
ownership or leasing of its properties make such qualification necessary,
other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

Section 3.02 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. Each of

has adopted resolutions, by unanimous vote of the directors present at a
meeting duly called at which a quorum of directors of Parent was present, (i)
approving the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and (ii)

Merger Sub, for adoption. As of the date of this Agreement, such resolutions
have not been amended or withdrawn. Parent, as sole stockholder of HHC, and
HHC, as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, have adopted and approved this
Agreement. No other corporate proceedings (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any stockholder approval) on the part of Parent, HHC or Merger Sub are
necessary to authorize, adopt or approve, as applicable, this Agreement or to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (except for the filing of the Certificate of Merger in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the DGCL). Each of Parent, HHC and Merger Sub
has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement
constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms except, in each case, as enforcement may be limited

rights generally and by general principles of equity.

made, not misleading. No representation is made by Parent, HHC or Merger Sub
with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein.

  


 

  

Section 3.05 _Litigation_. There is no suit, action or other proceeding
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent, HHC or
Merger Sub that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any
Judgment outstanding against or, to the Knowledge of Parent, investigation by
any Governmental Entity involving Parent, HHC or Merger Sub that, individually
or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent

Section 3.06 _Brokers ' Fees and Expenses_. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person, other than Goldman Sachs and Co., the fees

Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent, HHC or
Merger Sub.

its date of incorporation, Merger Sub has not carried on any business nor
conducted any operations other than the execution of this Agreement, the
performance of its obligations hereunder and matters ancillary thereto.

  


 

  

Section 3.08 _Ownership of Common Stock_. None of Parent, HHC, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates has been, at any time during the three
years prior to the date hereof, an "interested stockholder" of the Company, as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. As of the date of this Agreement, none of
Parent, HHC or Merger Sub owns any shares of capital stock of the Company or
has any rights to acquire any shares of capital stock of the Company (except
pursuant to this Agreement).

  


 

  

Section 3.09 _Financing_. Parent has received (a) a duly executed commitment
letter, dated as of April 7, 2017 (including the exhibits, annexes, schedules
and amendments thereto) and a Redacted Fee Letter (collectively, the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ "), from the lenders party thereto (collectively, the "
_Lenders_ "), pursuant to which the Lenders have committed, on the terms set
forth therein, to lend amounts set forth therein on the Closing Date in order
to finance, in part, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Debt Financing_ ") and (b) the fully

  

  

 

10  

  

executed commitment letters, each dated as of April 7, 2017 (the " _Equity
Commitment Letters_ " and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the "
_Commitment Letters_ "), from the investors party thereto (collectively, the "
_Equity Investors_ "), pursuant to which the Equity Investors named therein
have committed, on the terms set forth therein, to invest in Parent the
amounts of equity set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ "). The Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Financing
contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letters, respectively, are hereinafter
referred to collectively as the " _Financing_ ". Parent has made available to
the Company true, accurate and complete copies of the Commitment Letters, each
as in effect on the date of this Agreement. As of the date hereof, none of the
Commitment Letters has been amended, modified, terminated or withdrawn and
each Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligations of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each
other party thereto (and the Company has been designated as a third party
beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letters to the extent provided therein),
and each Commitment Letter is enforceable in accordance with its terms against
Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto, in each case
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting creditors' rights
and to general principles of equity. There are no side letters or other
agreements relating to the Commitment Letters that could (w) reduce the
aggregate amount of Financing below the amount required to consummate the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement and any other amounts required
to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses,
(x) impose new or additional conditions precedent to the receipt of the
Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent
Closing in any respect, (y) adversely impact the ability of Parent, HHC or
Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the Financing Sources and (z)
otherwise adversely affect (including with respect to timing, taking into
account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) the ability of Parent,
HHC or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated herein. As of
the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach
on the part of Parent or any of its Affiliates under the Commitment Letters or
to the Knowledge of Parent (with respect to any conditions relating to the
Company or the Lenders), a failure of any condition to the obligations of the
Financing Sources in the Commitment Letters, or otherwise resulting in any
portion of the Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable. Parent has
fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the
Commitment Letters to be paid prior to the date hereof. Assuming the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.03_ are satisfied at
Closing, the Financing, when funded in accordance with the applicable
Commitment Letters on the Closing Date, together with the cash of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, will provide Parent with sufficient immediately
available cash funds to consummate the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and to pay
all related fees and expenses. The Financing is not subject to any conditions
to the obligations of the parties under the Commitment Letters to make the
full amount of the Financing available to Parent at the Closing other than
those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, the Equity Commitment Letter,
respectively and, the Financing is not subject to the consummation of any
transaction other than the Merger. As of the date hereof, Parent has no reason
to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied
or that the Financing will not be available to Parent on the Closing Date in
the amount necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses.

  

  

 

11  

  

Section 3.10 _Guarantees_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
each Guarantor has executed and delivered a Guaranty, and such Guaranty is
valid and in full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of such Guarantor, enforceable against them in accordance
with its terms, except (a) to the extent that enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (b) that the
availability of equitable remedies, including specific performance, is subject
to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding thereof may be
brought. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default on the part of any Guarantor under either
Guaranty to which it is a party.

  


 

  

Section 3.11 _Solvency of the Surviving Company Following the Merger_. As of
the Effective Time, assuming (i) the accuracy, in all material respects, of
the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement and
material compliance by the Company with the covenants contained in this
Agreement and (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions to Parent's obligation
to consummate the Merger, or waiver of such conditions, immediately after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, payment of
the aggregate Merger Consideration, repayment or refinancing of any
Indebtedness in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, if any, and payment of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, will be Solvent. For
the purposes of this _Section 3.11_ , the term " _Solvent_ ," when used with
respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the
amount of the "fair saleable value" (determined on a going concern basis) of
the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed the value of all
"liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities," as
of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with
applicable federal laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors;
(b) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount
of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or
proposed to be engaged following such date; and (c) such Person will be able
to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they
mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will
be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or lines
of credit, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become
due.

  


 

  

Section 3.12 _Investment Canada Act_. Merger Sub qualifies as a "WTO investor"
within the meaning of subsection 14.1(6) of the ICA.

  


 

  

Section 3.13 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in _Article IV_ or in any certificate
delivered by the Company to Parent, HHC and Merger Sub (and notwithstanding
the delivery or disclosure to Parent or its Representatives of any
documentation, projections, estimates, budgets or other information), and each
of Parent, HHC and Merger Sub acknowledges that (x) none of the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or any other Person on behalf of the Company makes, or
has made, any representation or warranty relating to itself or its business or
otherwise in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and Parent, HHC and Merger Sub are
not relying on any representation or warranty of any Person except for those
expressly set forth in this Agreement, (y) no person has been authorized by
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any other Person on behalf of the
Company to make any representation or warranty relating to itself or its
business or otherwise in connection with this Agreement and Merger, and if
made, such representation or warranty shall not be relied upon by Parent, HHC
or Merger Sub as having been authorized by such entity, and (z) any estimate,
projection, prediction, data, financial information, memorandum, presentation
or any other materials or information provided or addressed to Parent, HHC,
Merger Sub or any of their Representatives, including any materials or
information made available to Parent and/or its Representatives in connection
with presentations by the Company's management, are not and shall not be
deemed to be or include representations or warranties. Each of Parent, HHC and
Merger Sub acknowledges that it has conducted, to its satisfaction, its own
independent investigation of the condition, operations and business of the
Company and in making its determination to proceed with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, each of Parent, HHC and
Merger Sub has relied solely on the results of its own independent
investigation and the terms of this Agreement and has not relied directly or
indirectly on any materials or information made available to Parent and/or its
Representatives by or on behalf of the Company.

ARTICLE IV

  


 

  

 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_

  


 

  

The Company represents and warrants to Parent, HHC and Merger Sub that the
statements contained in this _Article IV_ are true and correct except (i) as
set forth in the Company SEC Documents furnished or filed and publicly
available after July 1, 2016 and prior to the date of this Agreement (the "
_Filed Company SEC Documents_ ") (excluding any risk factor disclosures
contained in such documents under the heading "Risk Factors" and any
disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or
other statements that are similarly non-specific and predictive or forward-
looking in nature) and provided that nothing disclosed in such Filed Company
SEC Documents shall be deemed to be a qualification of or modification to the
representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 4.03_ , _4.04_ , or
_4.05_ or (ii) as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company
to Parent at or before the execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "). The Company Disclosure Letter
shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the
numbered and lettered sections contained in this Agreement, and the disclosure
in any section or subsection shall be deemed to qualify any other section in
this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the text of

Section 4.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

  


 

  

(a) The Company is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the case of good
standing, to the extent such jurisdiction recognizes such concept). Each of
the Company Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the
case of good standing, to the extent such jurisdiction recognizes such
concept), except in the case of the Company Subsidiaries where the failure to
be so organized, exist or be in good standing has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has
all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and conduct its businesses as and where presently conducted, except
where the failure to have such power or authority, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is
duly qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the
nature of its business or character of the properties owned or leased by it
make such qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered
or made available to Parent, prior to execution of this Agreement, true and
complete copies of the restated certificate of incorporation of the Company in
effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Charter_ ") and the
amended and restated bylaws of the Company in effect as of the date of this
Agreement (the " _Company Bylaws_ ").

Company Subsidiary or by the Company and a Company Subsidiary, free and clear
of all material Liens, excluding Permitted Liens, and free of any other
material restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or
otherwise dispose of such capital stock, voting securities or other equity

of the total revenues generated and total assets used in such Canadian
business carried on by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, within the

the material diminution of such access.

indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or facilitate any
inquiry, discussion, offer or request that constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal (an " _Inquiry_ ") (it being
understood and agreed that ministerial acts that are not otherwise prohibited
by this _Section 5.04_ (such as responding to unsolicited phone calls solely
to reference the restrictions in this _Section 5.04_ ) shall not be deemed to

Alternative Proposal, (C) enter into, continue or maintain discussions or
negotiations with any Person with respect to an Inquiry or an Alternative

itself about such Alternative Proposal) regarding, or furnish or cause to be

proposal that constitutes, or could be reasonably expected to result in, an
Alternative Proposal, (E) approve, agree to, accept, endorse, recommend,
execute or enter into any Alternative Proposal, (F) submit to a vote of its

38  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.04(a)_ , if the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective
Representatives receives a written Alternative Proposal by any Person or
"Group" (as such term is defined in Section 13(d) under the Exchange Act) at
any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if the
Company has not materially breached its obligations under _Section 5.04(a)_ ,
the Company and its Representatives may, prior to (but not after) the receipt
of the Company Stockholder Approval, take the actions set forth in clauses (i)
or (ii) of this _Section 5.04(b)_ if the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) has determined, in its good faith judgment (after consultation with
the Company's financial advisors and outside legal counsel), that such
Alternative Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary
duties under applicable Law: (i) furnish non-public information to and afford
access to the business, employees, officers, contracts, properties, assets,
books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Person or
"Group" making such Alternative Proposal in response to such Alternative
Proposal, pursuant to the prior execution of (and the Company and/or Company
Subsidiaries may enter into) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; and (ii)
enter into and maintain discussions or negotiations with any Person with
respect to an Alternative Proposal.

  

  

(c) Reasonably promptly (but in no event more than 24 hours) following receipt
of any Alternative Proposal or any Inquiry, the Company shall advise Parent in
writing of the receipt of such Alternative Proposal or Inquiry, and the terms
and conditions of such Alternative Proposal or Inquiry (including, in each
case, the identity of the Person or "Group" making any such Alternative
Proposal or Inquiry), and the Company shall as reasonably promptly as
practicable provide to Parent (i) a copy of such Alternative Proposal or
Inquiry, if in writing; or (ii) a summary of the material terms of such
Alternative Proposal or Inquiry, if oral. The Company agrees that it shall
reasonably promptly provide to Parent any non-public information concerning
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that may be provided (pursuant to
_Section 5.04(b)_ ) to any other Person or "Group" in connection with any such
Alternative Proposal that has not previously been provided to Parent. In
addition, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis
of any material developments regarding the Alternative Proposal or any
material change to the terms or status of the Alternative Proposal or Inquiry.

  

  

 

39  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time before, but
not after, the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may
(i) upon any change, event, development, fact, occurrence or circumstance that
affects the business, assets, results of operation or financial condition of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (other than any Alternative
Proposal), that was not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Company as of
the date hereof and becomes known prior to the time of the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, (A) withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse
to Parent, the Company Recommendation or take any action, or make any public
statement, filing or release inconsistent with the Company Recommendation, or
(B) fail to publicly affirm the Company Recommendation in writing within ten
Business Days after receipt of a written request by Parent to provide such
affirmation following a publicly known Alternative Proposal (any of the
foregoing being an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, recommending against the Merger or approving, endorsing or
recommending any Alternative Proposal), and (ii) if the Company has received a
Superior Proposal (after taking into account the terms of any revised offer by
Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.04(d)_ ) and the Company has not materially
breached its obligations under _Section 5.04(a)_ , terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ to enter into a definitive written agreement
providing for such Superior Proposal simultaneously with the termination of
this Agreement, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), if the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with the Company's financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of
their fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Company Board
may not make an Adverse Recommendation Change or, in the case of a Superior
Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ , unless:

  


 

  

(i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three
Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ ") of taking such action,
which notice shall advise Parent of the circumstances giving rise to the
Adverse Recommendation Change, and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, that
the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal and shall include a copy of
such Superior Proposal (or, where no such copy is available, a description of
the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal), including if
provided to the Company, copies of all material documentation relating to such
Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person making the Superior Proposal
(including any proposed financing commitments with respect to such Superior
Proposal);

  


 

  

(ii) during the Notice Period, the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, each Guaranty and the Commitment Letters so that, in the
case of a Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute (in
the judgment of the Company Board) a Superior Proposal, or in cases not
involving a Superior Proposal, the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation
Change (in the judgment of the Company Board after consultation with the
Company's financial advisors and outside legal counsel) would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; and

  

  

 

40  

  

(iii) after the completion of the Notice Period, the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after considering the results of such negotiations
and giving effect to any proposals, amendments or modifications made or agreed
to by Parent, if any, and after consultation with the Company's financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that, in the case of a Superior Proposal,
such Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal or, in cases not involving
a Superior Proposal, that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation
Change continues to be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  


 

  

If during the Notice Period any material revisions are made to the Superior
Proposal, the Company shall deliver a new written notice to Parent and shall
comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.04(d)_ with respect to such
new written notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this
sentence, references to the three Business Day period above shall be deemed to
be references to a two Business Day period.

  


 

  

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Alternative Proposal or from
making any disclosure to the Company's stockholders if the Company Board
(after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel) concludes that
its failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, a factually
accurate public statement that describes the Company's receipt of an
Alternative Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
shall not be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change.

  


 

  

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

  


 

  

(i) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any bona fide proposal or offer (whether
or not in writing), with respect to any (i) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, other business combination or similar transaction involving the
Company that would result in any Person or "Group" beneficially owning 20% or
more of the outstanding equity interests of the Company or any successor or
parent company thereto; (ii) sale, contribution or other disposition, directly
or indirectly (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange,
other business combination, partnership, joint venture, asset sale,
recapitalization, dividend, distribution, sale of capital stock of or other
equity interests in a Company Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business or
assets of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of
the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii) issuance, sale or other disposition,
directly or indirectly, to any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) or
"Group" of securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing
20% or more of the voting power of the Company; (iv) transaction in which any

by the parties hereto (the " _Stockholder Consent Delivery Period_ "), an
irrevocable written consent in the form attached as _Exhibit B_ hereto from
the holders of record of at least 67.8% of the aggregate voting power of the

the Company.

written information statement of the type contemplated by Rule 14c-2 of the
Exchange Act containing (i) the information specified in Schedule 14C under

Period), prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement to be sent to the
Company's stockholders relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting (together

Company, and provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Information
Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable, and the Information Statement or
Proxy Statement, as applicable, shall include all information reasonably
requested by the Company to be included therein. The Company shall reasonably
promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any

correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC
with respect to the Information Statement or Proxy Statement, and Parent will
cooperate in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
filing or mailing the Information Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable

SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Information Statement or Proxy
Statement, as applicable, or response (including the proposed final version of
the Information Statement or Proxy Statement or response) and (ii) shall
consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by Parent. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause all documents it files with the
SEC under this _Section 6.01(a)_ to comply in all material respects with all
applicable requirements of Law and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.

  

  

 

43  

  

(c) If at any time prior to the date that is 20 days after the Information
Statement is first mailed to the Company's stockholders, or, in the case of
the Proxy Statement, prior to the Effective Time, any change occurs with
respect to information supplied by Parent or its Affiliates for inclusion in
the Information Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable, which is required
to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Information
Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable, Parent shall reasonably promptly
notify the Company of such event, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate
in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to
the Information Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable, and as required
by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or
supplement to the Company's stockholders. Nothing in this _Section 6.01(c)_
shall limit the obligations of any party under _Section 6.01(a)_.

  


 

  

(d) If at any time prior to the date that is 20 days after the Information
Statement is first mailed to the Company's stockholders, or, in the case of
the Proxy Statement, prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with
respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any change occurs with
respect to other information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the
Information Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable, which is required to
be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Information Statement
or Proxy Statement, as applicable, the Company shall reasonably promptly
notify Parent of such event, and the Company shall as reasonably promptly as
practicable file any necessary amendment or supplement to the Information
Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable, with the SEC and, as required by
Law, disseminate the information contained in such amendment or supplement to
the Company's stockholders. Nothing in this _Section 6.01(d)_ shall limit the
obligations of any party under _Section 6.01(a)_.

  


 

  

(e) Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the Information Statement to be (i) filed with the SEC in definitive form as
contemplated by Rule 14c-2 under the Exchange Act and (ii) mailed to the
stockholders of the Company, in each case as reasonably promptly as
practicable (but in any event within five Business Days thereafter) after the
latest of (A) confirmation from the SEC that it has no further comments on the
Information Statement, (B) confirmation from the SEC that the Information
Statement is otherwise not to be reviewed or (C) expiration of the 10-day
period after filing in the event the SEC does not review the Information
Statement. In the event the Stockholder Written Consent is not obtained and
Parent does not terminate this Agreement, in each case, as provided in
_Section 8.01(h)_ , then the Company shall, as reasonably promptly as
practicable after the SEC clears the Proxy Statement duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of (i)
seeking the Company Stockholder Approval; and (ii) in accordance with Section
14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder,
seeking advisory approval of a proposal to the Company's stockholders for a
non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may become
payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the
completion of the Merger. In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the Company's stockholders; and (ii) subject to _Section 5.04(d)_ , solicit
proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval. The Company shall include the Company Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement, except to the extent that the Company Board shall have
made an Adverse Recommendation Change in compliance with _Section 5.04(d)_.
The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms prior thereto, its obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.01_
shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure
or communication to the Company of any Alternative Proposal or by the making
of any Adverse Recommendation Change by the Company Board; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the public announcement of an Adverse Recommendation
Change or the delivery of notice by the Company to Parent pursuant to _Section
5.04(d)(i)_ occurs less than 10 Business Days prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall be entitled to postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting to a date not more than 10 Business Days after the later
of such event.

Section 6.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to
Parent and to the Representatives of Parent reasonable access, upon reasonable
advance notice, during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all their
respective properties, facilities, books, contracts, commitments, personnel
(including outside accountants) and records and, during such period, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably
promptly to Parent (a) to the extent not publicly available, a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during
such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws
or commission actions, (b) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request (in each case, in a
manner so as to not interfere in any material respect with the normal business
operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary), including financial and
operating data; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
required to permit such access or make such disclosure, to the extent it
determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that such disclosure or
access would (i) violate the terms of any confidentiality agreement or other
Contract with a third party ( _provided_ that the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent of such third
party to such access or disclosure); (ii) result in the loss of any attorney-
client privilege ( _provided_ that the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure (or as much of it as
possible) in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client
privilege); or (iii) violate any Law ( _provided_ that the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to provide such access or make such
disclosure in a manner that does not violate Law). Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be required
to provide any access or make any disclosure to Parent pursuant to this
_Section 6.02_ to the extent such access or information is reasonably
pertinent to a litigation where the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the
one hand, and Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse
parties. All information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ shall be
subject to the confidentiality agreement, dated as of January 3, 2017, between
KSL Capital Partners Management IV, LLC and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

45  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Parent and
the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to reasonably
promptly take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective as reasonably promptly as
practicable after the date hereof the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) preparing and filing with a Governmental Entity as
reasonably promptly as practicable all applications, notices, petitions,
filings, ruling requests, and other documents necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to obtain as reasonably
promptly as practicable all Consents necessary to be obtained from any
Governmental Entity in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (collectively, the " _Governmental Approvals_ ") and (ii) as
reasonably promptly as practicable taking all steps as may be necessary to
obtain all such Governmental Approvals. In furtherance and not in limitation
of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to (A) make an appropriate and
complete filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby within 10 Business Days of the
date of this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, (B) make all
other filings, including with respect to the USFS Permits and Canadian
Permits, that are required to be made in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to other Regulatory Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as reasonably promptly as practicable, (C)
make all other filings, including with respect to the USFS Permits and
Canadian Permits, that are required to be made in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to other Regulatory Laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as reasonably promptly as

into any agreement with the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the
United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Commissioner or any
other Governmental Entity not to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other party
hereto (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Parent and the Company shall supply as reasonably promptly as practicable any
additional information or documentation that may be requested pursuant to the
HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law and use its reasonable best efforts to
take all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration
or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any
other Regulatory Law as soon as possible (including complying with any "second
request" for information or similar request from a Governmental Entity
pursuant to other Regulatory Laws within no greater than 90 days from its date
of issuance).

  


 

  

(b) In connection with the actions referenced in _Section 6.03(a)_ to obtain
all Governmental Approvals for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Laws, each of Parent and the Company
shall (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any
communication, filing or submission and in connection with any investigation
or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii)
keep the other party and/or its counsel promptly informed of any communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the FTC, the DOJ, the
Commissioner or any other U.S. or other Governmental Entity and of any
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby;
(iii) consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with the
FTC, the DOJ, the Commissioner or any other Governmental Entity or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other person, and
to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ, the Commissioner or such other
Governmental Entity or other person, give the other party and/or its counsel
the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences;
and (iv) permit the other party and/or its counsel to review in advance any
submission, filing or communication (and documents submitted therewith)
intended to be given by it to the FTC, the DOJ, the Commissioner or any other
Governmental Entity; _provided_ that materials may be redacted to remove
references concerning the valuation of the businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material to be
provided to the other under this _Section 6.03(b)_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only
Material." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the
recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of
the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal
counsel.

  

  

 

46  

  

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in _Sections 6.03(a)_ and _6.03(b)_ , Parent and the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would restrain,
prevent or delay the Closing on or before the End Date, including defending
(with sufficient time for resolution in advance of the End Date) through
litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the FTC, the DOJ, the
Commissioner or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private party;
and (ii) avoid or eliminate impediments under any Regulatory Law so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as possible (and in any event no later
than the End Date), provided, however, that none of the Guarantors or any of
their Affiliates, Parent or the Company shall be required to, nor shall the
Company, without the prior written consent of Parent, (x) agree to the sale,
divestiture or disposition of such businesses, product lines, assets,
contractual rights, or relationships of the Guarantors or any of their
Affiliates, Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries or (y)
otherwise take or commit to take actions that after the Closing would limit
the Guarantors' or any of their Affiliates' or Parent's or its Subsidiaries'
(including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) freedom of action with
respect to, or its or their ability to operate or retain, one or more of the
businesses, product lines or assets of the Guarantors or any of their
Affiliates, Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries. Subject to
the Parent's undertakings pursuant to this _Section 6.03_ , the final
determination of the appropriate course of action with respect to the actions
contemplated in _Section 6.03(b)_ and this _Section 6.03(c)_ shall be made by
Parent.

  


 

  

(d) The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent, and Parent shall
give prompt written notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence, or failure
to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure to occur has resulted in or
would reasonably be expected to result in the failure to satisfy or be able to
satisfy any of the conditions specified in _Article VII_ , and such written
notice shall specify the condition which has failed or will fail to be
satisfied; (ii) any written notice from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to the extent such consent is material to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and (iii) any material
written notice from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.03(d)_ shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to Parent or the Company.

  

  

 

47  

  

(e) The Company acknowledges and agrees that Parent's taking of any actions
contemplated by _Section 5.02_ shall not be or be deemed a breach of Parent's
obligations under this _Section 6.03_ (it being acknowledged and understood
that neither _Section 5.02_ nor this _Section 6.03(e)_ shall affect Parent's
obligations with respect to payment of the Regulatory Termination Fee in
accordance with _Section 8.03_ hereof).

  


 

  

(f) The Company and the Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
notify the Forest Service of the transactions contemplated hereby as the same
relate to the Winter Park Resort that is operated by the Company, and shall
cooperate in good faith to respond to reasonable requests for information from
the Forest Service in connection therewith.

  


 

  

Section 6.04 _Company Stock Awards_.

  


 

  

(a) _Company Stock Options_. Effective as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any holder of a Company Stock Option, each then outstanding Company Stock
Option (whether or not then vested and exercisable) shall terminate and be
cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a single lump sum cash payment,
equal to (i) the product of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock subject
to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
or not then vested, and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price applicable to such shares of Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option, less (ii) any applicable withholding for Taxes (the
" _Option Merger Consideration_ "). If the exercise price applicable to shares
of Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option is equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall terminate and
be canceled in exchange for no consideration. As of the Effective Time, each
holder of Company Stock Options shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Option Merger Consideration related
to the applicable Company Stock Option payable in accordance with _Section
2.01(c)_.

  


 

  

(b) _Company RSUs_. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of
Company RSUs, each then outstanding Company RSU shall become fully vested and
shall terminate and be canceled in exchange for the right to receive a single
lump sum cash payment, equal to (i) the Merger Consideration, less (ii) any
applicable withholding for Taxes (the " _RSU Merger Consideration_ "). As of
the Effective Time, each holder of Company RSUs shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the RSU Merger
Consideration, payable in accordance with _Section 2.01(c)_.

  


 

  

(c) _Termination of Company Stock Plan_. As of the Effective Time, the Company
Stock Plan shall be terminated, and no further Company Stock Awards or other
rights with respect to Common Stock shall be granted thereunder.

  

  

 

48  

  

(d) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions as it determines in good faith to be necessary or appropriate to
effectuate the actions contemplated by this _Section 6.04_.

  


 

  

Section 6.05 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

  


 

  

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or other similar
agreements of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms (it being agreed that
after the Closing such rights shall be mandatory rather than permissive, if
applicable), and Parent shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
to perform its obligations thereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, from
and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company agrees that it will
indemnify and hold harmless each individual who was prior to or is as of the
date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or who was prior to or is as of the date of this Agreement, or
who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director, officer or
employee of another Person (the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ "), against
all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and
fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the
Company Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director, officer or employee of
another Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. In the
event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, (x) each Company
Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the
defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding from the Surviving
Company within 10 Business Days of receipt by the Surviving Company from the
Company Indemnified Party of a request therefor; _provided_ that any person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent
required by the DGCL, the Surviving Company's certificate of incorporation or
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) or any applicable
indemnification agreement, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined by final non-appealable adjudication that such person is not
entitled to indemnification and (y) the Surviving Company and such Company
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with each other in the defense of any such
matter.

  

  

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or provide substitute policies
for the Company and its current and former directors and officers who are
currently covered by the directors' and officers' and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company, in either case, of not
less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable, in
the aggregate, to the insured persons than the directors', officers' and
employees' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time (with insurance
carriers having at least an "A" rating with A.M. Best with respect to
directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance), except that in no event shall the Surviving Company be required to
pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year
more than 300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the
Company prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if
the Surviving Company is unable to obtain the insurance required by this
_Section 6.05(b)_ it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for
each year within such six-year period for an annual premium equal to the
Maximum Amount. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date the
Company may, at its option (following reasonable consultation with Parent),
purchase "tail" directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance for a period of six years for the Company and its current
and former directors, officers and employees who are currently covered by the
directors' and officers' and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently
maintained by the Company, such tail insurance to provide coverage in an
amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other terms not less
favorable to the insured persons than the directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by
the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ that in no event shall the cost of
any such tail insurance exceed the Maximum Amount. The Surviving Company shall
maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder.

  

  

 

49  

  

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.05_ (i) shall survive consummation of
the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Company
Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and
(iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise.

  


 

  

(d) In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving Company shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Company assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.05_.

  


 

  

Section 6.06 _Transaction Litigation_. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Closing Date, each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly notify the other of any actions, suits, claims, litigations,
investigations or proceedings commenced or, to any party's knowledge,
threatened against such party or any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates,
directors or officers in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Subject to entry into a customary joint defense agreement, the Company shall
give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company and participate in the
defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company, any
Company Subsidiary and/or their respective directors or officers (each, a "
_Company Party_ ") relating to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
any Representative of the Company shall compromise, settle or come to an
arrangement regarding any such stockholder litigation, in each case unless
Parent shall have consented in writing (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ that the Company
may compromise, settle or come to an agreement regarding stockholder
litigation made or pending against a Company Party, if each of the following
conditions are met: (i) the resolution of all such litigation requires payment
from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives in an amount
not to exceed the amount set forth in _Section 6.06_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter and/or the provision of disclosures to the stockholders of the Company
relating to the Merger (which disclosures shall be subject to review and
comment by Parent); (ii) the settlement provides for no injunctive relief;
(iii) the settlement provides that Parent and its Subsidiaries and
Representatives are released from all liability in connection therewith; and

Section 6.09 _Employment and Company Benefits_.

  


 

  

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date
that is 12 months after the Closing Date (or, such Company Employee's shorter
period of employment, as the case may be), Parent shall, or shall cause one of
its Affiliates to, provide each Company Employee with (i) a base salary or
hourly wage rate that is at least equal to the base salary or hourly wage rate
provided to the Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date; (ii) a
cash incentive opportunity that is at least equal to the cash incentive
opportunity in effect for the Company Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date (it being understood that Parent will cause the Company to make
the applicable payment in respect of such cash incentive opportunity that is
earned or accrued in the 12 months after the Closing Date, at the time it
would be payable in the ordinary course even if such payment date is after the
conclusion of such 12-month period); and (iii) employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to
such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date (excluding the
benefits in clause (i) and (ii) and any equity incentive, retention, change in
control or transaction-based incentive, defined benefit pension, and retiree
health and welfare benefits). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company
Employee_ " means any employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary who is
employed at the Closing Date and who remains employed with the Surviving
Company or any other Affiliate of Parent immediately following the Closing.

  

  

 

51  

  

(b) Parent shall provide each Company Employee who incurs a termination of
employment during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
date that is 12 months after the Closing Date with severance benefits that are
no less favorable than the severance benefits to which such Company Employee
would have been entitled with respect to such termination under the severance
policies, practices and guidelines of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as
in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date or, if greater, the severance
benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event shall this provision modify the terms or conditions
of any written severance agreement with a Company Employee that is in effect
prior to the Closing, each of which shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with the terms thereof following the Closing. For the avoidance of
doubt, no Company Employee who receives severance in the event of termination
pursuant to an employment or severance agreement shall also receive severance
under any severance policy, practice or guideline after the Closing Date.

  


 

  

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, give each Company
Employee full credit for such Company Employee's service with the Company and
any Company Subsidiary (and any Affiliates or predecessors thereto) for
purposes of eligibility, vesting, and determination of the level of benefits
(including, for purposes of vacation and severance, but not for purposes of
benefit accruals under defined benefit pension plans) under any benefit plans
maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Company) in which the Company Employee participates to the same extent
recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service or would result in retroactive application.

  


 

  

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations
otherwise applicable to Company Employees and their eligible dependents under
any plan maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Company) that provides health benefits in which Company Employees
may be eligible to participate following the Closing, other than any
limitations that were in effect with respect to such Company Employees as of
the Closing Date under the analogous Company Benefit Plan; (ii) honor any
deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by a Company
Employee and his or her eligible dependents an analogous Company Benefit Plans
that is a health plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately
prior to the Closing Date during the portion of the plan year prior to the
Closing Date in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket
maximums under health plans maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Company) in which such Company Employee is eligible
to participate after the Closing Date in the same plan year in which such
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred; and (iii)
waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement
that would otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee and his or her
eligible dependents on or after the Closing Date, in each case to the extent
such Company Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar
limitation or requirement under an analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the
Closing Date.

  

  

 

52  

  

(e) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company and Company
Subsidiaries and Parent shall reasonably cooperate in good faith in achieving
the intended purposes of _Section 6.09(c)_ and _Section 6.09(d)_.

  


 

  

(f) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, comply with the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, or any similar
foreign, provincial, state or local Law, with respect to "employment losses"
which would constitute a "mass layoff" or "plant closing" (each as defined in
such Act) occurring at or after the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(g) Parent shall, or cause the Surviving Company to, honor the terms of each
Collective Bargaining Agreement until such Collective Bargaining Agreement
otherwise expires pursuant to its terms or is modified by the parties thereto.

  


 

  

(h) No provision of this Agreement shall (i) create any right in any Company
Employee or any other Employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
continued employment by or service with Parent or the Company or their
respective Affiliates, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Company or
their respective Affiliates to terminate the employment of any employee for
any reason; (ii) require Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates to continue any particular Company Benefit Plans or prevent the
amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Closing Date (subject
to the other provisions of this _Section 6.09_ ); or (iii) be treated as an
amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan,
policy, program, agreement or arrangement of Parent or the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates.

  


 

  

Section 6.10 _Merger Sub; HHC; Parent Subsidiaries_. Parent shall cause each
of HHC, Merger Sub and any other applicable Affiliate of Parent to comply with

consummate the transactions contemplated herein and pay any other amounts
required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein and to pay all related fees and expenses (" _Alternative
Debt Financing_ ") and to obtain, and, when obtained, to provide the Company

Financing Commitment Letter or any fee letter referred to in such Alternative
Debt Financing Commitment Letter with respect to any Alternative Debt
Financing arranged in compliance with this _Section 6.11(b)_ (and any Debt
Commitment Letter and Redacted Fee Letter remaining in effect at the time in
question) and the term "Debt Financing" shall be deemed to include any such
Alternative Debt Financing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of Parent, HHC and Merger Sub expressly acknowledges and agrees
that neither the availability nor terms of the Debt Financing or any
Alternative Debt Financing are conditions to the obligations of Parent, HHC
and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger.

notice (i) of any breach or threatened breach by any party of the Commitment

contemplated herein, (ii) of any termination or threatened termination of the
Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements, and (iii) of any material

the Financing Agreements). Parent, HHC and Merger Sub shall keep the Company
informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of all material

efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and provide the Company copies of the

requested by the Company for purposes of monitoring the progress of the
financing activities. Parent, HHC and Merger Sub shall not permit any
amendment, modification or supplement to be made to, or any waiver of, any
provision or remedy under or any replacement of the Commitment Letters or the
Financing Agreements or side letters or other agreements, if applicable, that
(w) reduce the aggregate amount of Financing below the amount required to
consummate the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and any other
amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement and to pay all related fees and
expenses, (x) that expands on or imposes new conditions precedent to the
funding of the Financing on the Closing Date that would reasonably be expected
to adversely affect (including, with respect to timing, taking into account
the expected timing of the Marketing Period) the Financing or the ability of
Parent, HHC or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated herein,
(y) adversely impact the ability of Parent, HHC or Merger Sub to enforce its
rights against its Financing Sources or (z) otherwise reasonably be expected
to make it less likely that the Financing would be funded or consummated or to
impair, delay or prevent the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
otherwise adversely affect, in any respect, the ability of Parent, HHC or
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
without the Company's prior written consent (it being understood and agreed
that, in any event, Parent may, (i) subject to the terms and restrictions set

Agreement, amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, arrangers,
bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities that have not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) increase the
size of the Debt Financing in order to, among other things, provide for the
financing of one or more additional transactions; provided that any
agreements, amendments, modifications or supplements relating to such increase
shall not expand on or impose new conditions precedent to the funding of the
Debt Financing on the Closing Date that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect (including, with respect to timing, taking into account the
expected timing of the Marketing Period) the Debt Financing or the ability of
Parent, HHC or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated herein,
(y) adversely impacts the ability of Parent, HHC or Merger Sub to enforce its
rights against its Financing Sources or (z) could otherwise reasonably be
expected to make it less likely that the Debt Financing would be funded or

otherwise adversely affect, in any respect, the ability of Parent, HHC or
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Upon
any such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or replacement of the
Debt Commitment Letter, the term "Debt Commitment Letter" shall mean the Debt
Commitment Letter as so amended, modified, supplemented, waived or replaced,
and Parent, HHC and Merger Sub shall promptly provide copies thereof to the
Company.

Date; _provided_ , further, that if the Marketing Period has not expired by
the End Date, then Parent may elect, in its sole discretion, to extend the End

Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(c)_ unless any such breach or failure

except that no cure period shall be required for a breach which by its nature
cannot be cured prior to the End Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(c)_ if
the Company is then in breach of this Agreement in any material respect;

  


 

  

(d) by the Company prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval in
order to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for a Superior
Proposal in compliance with _Section 5.04(d)_ ; _provided_ that the Company

terms of _Section 5.04(d)_ ; _provided_ , _further_ that the Company pays the
Termination Fee prior to or simultaneously with such termination and enters
into such definitive written agreement for the Superior Proposal
simultaneously with such termination of this Agreement;

  


 

  

(e) by Parent, if the Company has breached any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, or if any representation or
warranty of the Company has become untrue, in each case, such that the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.03(a)_ or _Section 7.03(b)_ , as the case
may be, could not be satisfied as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_
, that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.01(e)_ unless any such breach or failure to be true has not been cured
within 45 days after written notice by Parent to the Company informing the
Company of such breach or failure to be true, except that no cure period shall
be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured prior to the End
Date; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(e)_ if Parent is then in breach of
this Agreement in any material respect;

  


 

  

(f) by Parent prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in the
event that an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred;

  

  

 

62  

  

(g) by the Company, if (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_
and _Section 7.03_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
which by their terms are to be satisfied by the delivery of documents or
taking of any other action at the Closing by any party, but subject to the
satisfaction (or waiver) of such conditions at the Closing), (ii) Parent fails
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the date
which the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.02_ , (iii) the
Company has notified Parent in writing that the Company is ready, willing and
able to effect the Closing (subject to the satisfaction of all of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.03_ ), and (iv) Parent
fails to consummate the Closing within three Business Days after the delivery
of the notice described in the immediately preceding clause (iii); or

  


 

  

(h) by Parent, if a copy of the Stockholder Written Consent evidencing that
the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained has not been delivered to
Parent at the expiration of the Stockholder Consent Delivery Period.

  


 

  

Section 8.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in _Section 8.01_ , this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of the Company, Parent, HHC or Merger Sub,
other than the final sentence of _Section 6.02_ , any expense reimbursement
obligations and indemnification obligations of Parent contained in _Section
6.11_ , this _Section 8.02_ , _Section 8.03_ and _Article IX_ , which
provisions shall survive such termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
except as provided in _Section 8.03_ , no such termination shall relieve any
party from any liability or damages for any willful breach of this Agreement,
except in the event that the Company pays to Parent the Termination Fee or
Parent pays to the Company the Reverse Termination Fee. For purposes of this
Agreement, "willful breach" means a breach that is a consequence of an act or
omission undertaken by the breaching party with the Knowledge that the taking
of, or failure to take, such act would, or would reasonably be expected to,
cause or constitute a material breach of this Agreement; it being acknowledged
and agreed, without limitation, that any failure by any party to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby after the applicable
conditions thereto have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions
would be capable of being satisfied at such time) shall constitute a willful
breach of this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 8.03 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as specifically provided for herein
(including _Section 6.11(a)_ ), all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not
such transactions are consummated.

  


 

  

(a) The Company shall pay to Parent (or its designees) a fee of $28,373,610
(the " _Termination Fee_ ") if:

  


 

  

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ or
Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_ or _Section
8.01(h)_ ; or

  

  

 

63  

  

(ii) (A) after the date hereof, an Alternative Proposal shall have been made,
disclosed, announced, commenced or submitted by a third party to the Company
and not publicly withdrawn at least five Business Days prior to the receipt of
the Company Stockholder Approval or shall have been made, disclosed or
announced directly to the Company's stockholders generally by a third party
and not publicly withdrawn at least five Business Days prior to the receipt of
the Company Stockholder Approval; (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ , _8.01(b)(iii)_ or _Section 8.01(e)_ ; and
(C) within 12 months of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive
Contract to consummate such Alternative Proposal and such Alternative Proposal
is consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this _Section
8.03(a)(ii)_ , the references to 20% in the definition of "Alternative
Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to 50.1%.

transfer of same-day funds (x) in the case of clause (i) above, on the
Business Day immediately following the date of termination of this Agreement
(or simultaneously with such termination, in the case of termination pursuant
to _Section 8.01(d)_ ) and (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, on the date
of consummation as referred to in clause (ii)(C) above.

  


 

  

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.01(c)_ or _Section 8.01(g)_ , Parent shall promptly pay or cause to
be paid to the Company an amount equal to $66,205,091 (the " _Reverse
Termination Fee_ "). The Reverse Termination Fee shall be paid by wire
transfer of same-day funds promptly (but in any event within two Business
Days) after the termination of this Agreement. In no event shall Parent or any
of its Affiliates be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more than
one occasion.

  


 

  

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated or deemed terminated by the
Company or the Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ (solely to the extent
that, at the time of such termination, the condition in _Section 7.01(b)_
shall not have been satisfied) or _Section 8.01(b)(ii)_ (solely to the extent
that the Legal Restraint giving rise to such termination right relates to the
HSR Act or Competition Act), and at the time of either such termination all of
the other conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ (other than _Section 7.01(b)_
or _Section 7.01(c)_ (solely to the extent that the Legal Restraint giving
rise to such failure relates to the HSR Act, Competition Act or any other
antitrust or competition laws), as applicable) and the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.03_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions which by their
terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing), then Parent shall promptly pay
or cause to be paid to the Company an amount equal to $66,205,091 (the "
_Regulatory Termination Fee_ "). The Regulatory Termination Fee shall be paid
by wire transfer of same-day funds promptly (but in any event within two
Business Days) after the termination of this Agreement. In no event shall
Parent or any of its Affiliates be required to pay (i) the Regulatory
Termination Fee on more than one occasion or (ii) more than one of the Reverse
Termination Fee, the Regulatory Termination Fee and the Permit Termination
Fee.

  


 

  

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated or deemed terminated by the
Company or the Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ (solely to the extent
that, at the time of such termination, either of the conditions in _Sections
7.03(d)_ or _Section 7.03(e)_ (collectively, the " _Permits Conditions_ "
shall not have been satisfied)) or _Section 8.01(b)(ii)_ (solely to the extent
that the Legal Restraint giving rise to such termination right relates to the
Permits Conditions), and at the time of either such termination all of the
other conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ (other than _Section 7.01(b)_ or
_Section 7.01(c)_ (solely to the extent that the Legal Restraint giving rise
to such failure relates to one or both of the Permits Conditions), as
applicable) and the conditions set forth in _Section 7.03_ have been satisfied
(other than those conditions which by their terms cannot be satisfied until
the Closing), then Parent shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to the
Company an amount equal to $66,205,091 (the " _Permit Termination Fee_ "). The
Permit Termination Fee shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds
promptly (but in any event within two Business Days) after the termination of
this Agreement. In no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates be required
to pay (i) the Permit Termination Fee on more than one occasion or (ii) more
than one of the Reverse Termination Fee, the Regulatory Termination Fee and
the Permit Termination Fee.

  

  

 

64  

  

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the parties agree
that the payment of the Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
available to Parent, HHC and Merger Sub with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby in the event any such payment becomes due and
payable, and, upon payment of the Termination Fee, the Company (and the
Company's Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers,
employees, stockholders and Representatives) shall have no further liability
to Parent, HHC and Merger Sub under this Agreement. In no event shall the
Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  


 

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties
expressly acknowledge and agree that, if the Reverse Termination Fee or
Regulatory Termination Fee is payable pursuant to this _Section 8.03_ , (i)
the Company's receipt of the Reverse Termination Fee or the Regulatory
Termination Fee, as applicable, from Parent together with any expense
reimbursement obligations and indemnification obligations payable by Parent to
the Company pursuant to _Section 6.11_ (" _Recoverable Amounts_ ") shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company or any of its Affiliates against
Parent, the Financing Sources and any of their Affiliates or any of the
former, current, or future general or limited partners, shareholders or
equityholders, managers, members, directors, officers, employees,
representatives or agents or any former, current or future general or limited
partner, direct or indirect shareholder or equityholder, manager, member,
director, officer, employee, Affiliate, representative or agent of any of the
foregoing (collectively, " _Parent Related Parties_ ") in connection with the
termination of this Agreement and the transactions, documents and agreement
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) in no event shall Parent Related
Parties be subject to (nor shall the Company or any of its Affiliates or any
other Person seek to recover) monetary damages in excess of the Recoverable
Amounts. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Parent fails to
effect the Closing for any reason or no reason or otherwise breaches this
Agreement or fails to perform in any manner (in any case, whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), then except for a Judgment of
specific performance prior to the termination of this Agreement as and only to
the extent permitted by _Section 9.10_ , the Company's sole and exclusive
remedy against Parent Related Parties for any breach, loss or damage shall be
to terminate this Agreement and receive payment of the Recoverable Amounts
from Parent only if and solely to the extent payable hereunder. Without
limiting the foregoing, if Parent fails to effect the Closing for any or no
reason or otherwise breaches this Agreement or fails to perform hereunder in
any manner (in any case, whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or
otherwise), in no event shall the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective former, current or future, direct or indirect, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, Affiliates or
assignees seek, or permit to be sought any monetary damages from Parent
Related Parties, other than the payment of the Recoverable Amounts from Parent
only if and solely to the extent payable hereunder. The parties acknowledge
that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.03_ are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. For the avoidance
of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance in
accordance with _Section 9.10_ and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee
or the Regulatory Termination Fee under this _Section 8.03_ , under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance that results in (i) a Closing and (ii) the
Reverse Termination Fee and/or the Regulatory Termination Fee.

  

  

 

65  

  

Section 8.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there
shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the
Company's stockholders without the further approval of such stockholders, and
(ii) except as provided above, no amendment of this Agreement shall be
submitted to be approved by the Company's stockholders unless required by Law.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties. Termination of this Agreement prior to the
Effective Time shall not require the approval of the stockholders of either
Parent or the Company. With respect to any amendment or modification to
_Section 8.03(e)_ , this _Section 8.04_ , _Section 8.05_ , _Section 9.07_ ,
_Section 9.08_ , _Section 9.10_ , _Section 9.11_ , _Section 9.12_ or the
definition of "Financing Sources" (and any provision of this Agreement to the
extent an amendment or modification of such provision would modify the
substance of any of the foregoing provisions) that is adverse to any Financing
Source, the prior written consent of the adversely affected Financing Source
shall be required before any such amendment or modification may become
effective.

  


 

  

Section 8.05 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement; (c) waive compliance with any covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement; or (d) waive the satisfaction of
any of the conditions contained in this Agreement. No extension or waiver by
the Company shall require the approval of the Company's stockholders unless
such approval is required by Law. Any agreement on the part of a party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights. With respect to any waiver of, or
extension to, this _Section 8.05_ , _Section 8.03(e)_ , _Section 8.04_ ,
_Section 9.07_ , _Section 9.08_ , _Section 9.10_ , _Section 9.11_ , _Section
9.12_ or the definition of "Financing Sources" (and any provision of this
Agreement to the extent an extension or waiver of such provision would modify
the substance of any of the foregoing provisions) that is adverse to any
Financing Source, the prior written consent of the adversely affected
Financing Source shall be required before any such extension or waiver may
become effective.

Section 9.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ that the rights,
interests and obligations of Merger Sub may be assigned to another direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent _provided_ , _further_ , that the
rights, but not the obligations, of Merger Sub under this Agreement may be
collaterally assigned to any agent in connection with the Debt Financing. Any
purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the
preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

  


 

  

Section 9.10 _Specific Enforcement; Jurisdiction; Venue_.

  


 

  

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement, including the right of a party to cause the other parties to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. It is
agreed that the parties are entitled to enforce specifically the performance
of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to in clause
(a) below, without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of
specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable
for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide
an adequate remedy for any such breach. To the extent any party brings a
proceeding to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
(other than proceeding to enforce specifically any provision that expressly
survives termination of this Agreement), the End Date shall automatically be
extended to (i) the 10th Business Day following the resolution of such
proceeding or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding
over such proceeding.

  

  

 

78  

  

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 9.10(a)_ or anything else to the contrary in this
Agreement, it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to the
granting of a decree or order of specific performance or other equitable
relief of the obligations of Parent, HHC and Merger Sub to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded and/or to consummate the Closing only in the event that
(i) all conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.03_ have been
satisfied or waived (other than delivery of items to be delivered at the
Closing and other than satisfaction of those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which shall be capable of being
satisfied at the Closing) at the time _Section 1.02_ contemplated the Closing
to occur, (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded or the Financing Sources
have confirmed in writing to Parent and Merger Sub that the Debt Financing
will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded, in each case
at the Closing, and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to
Parent and Merger Sub that if a decree or order of specific performance or
other equitable relief is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing
are funded, then it would take all such actions required of it by this
Agreement to cause the Closing to occur. For the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing sentence shall not apply to or otherwise limit the right of the
Company to such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies
for obligations other than with respect to the obligations of Parent, HHC and
Merger Sub to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and the Closing to be
consummated. In no event shall the Company or its Subsidiaries be entitled to
receive both (x) a grant of specific performance of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 9.10(b)_ and (y) monetary damages
to which it is entitled to pursuant to this Agreement; provided that the grant
of specific performance results in a Closing.

  


 

  

(c) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party
or its Affiliates against any other party or its Affiliates shall be brought
and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; provided,
that if jurisdiction is not then available in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, then any such legal action or proceeding may be brought in
any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any other Delaware state
court. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of
the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally
and unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each of the parties agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding
relating thereto except in the courts described above in Delaware, other than
actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree
or award rendered by any such court in Delaware as described herein.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and except as
otherwise provided for in the Debt Commitment Letter, each party hereto
acknowledges and irrevocably agrees (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates)
(x) that any action or proceeding, whether at law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising out
of, or relating to, the transactions contemplated hereby, the Debt Commitment
Letter, the Debt Financing (including the transactions contemplated thereby)
or the performance of services thereunder or related thereto shall be subject
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
county of New York, or if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is
vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York in the County of New York (and the appellate
courts thereof) and each party hereto submits for itself and its property with
respect to any such action or proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
court and (y) not to bring or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or support
anyone else in bringing any such action or proceeding in any other court. Each
of the parties further agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute
sufficient service of process and the parties further waive any argument that
such service is insufficient. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in
Delaware as described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise) and (c) that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action
or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

  

  

 

79  

  

Section 9.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT, THE MERGER OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER, THE DEBT FINANCING OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY (INCLUDING, IN EACH CASE, ANY CLAIM, DEMAND,
ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION THAT INVOLVES THE FINANCING SOURCES). EACH PARTY
HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER
AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.11_.

  


 

  

Section 9.12 _Non-Recourse_. Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising
out of, or related to this Agreement may only be brought against Persons that
are expressly named as parties hereto, and then only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth in this Agreement. Other than the Guarantors
under their respective Guarantees, no former, current or future direct or
indirect equity holders, controlling Persons, stockholders, representatives,
members, managers, Affiliates, general or limited partners or assignees of any
party hereto, the Guarantors or of any former, current or future direct or
indirect equity holder, controlling Person, stockholder, representative,
member, manager, general or limited partner, Affiliate, or assignee of any of
the foregoing shall have any liability or obligation for any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or liabilities
of the parties hereto under this Agreement or of or for any action, suit,
arbitration, claim, litigation, investigation, or proceeding based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the breach, termination or failure to consummate such transactions), in each
case whether based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement
of any assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any
statute, regulation or applicable Laws or otherwise and whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate, limited liability company or partnership
veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto or another
Person (including a claim to enforce the Commitment Letters) or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company agrees on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates and their respective members, partners,
stockholders, agents, attorneys, advisors or representatives that none of the
Financing Sources shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity
or otherwise) to any such person relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated herein (including the Debt Financing), waives any
rights or claims against any Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement (and the transactions contemplated hereby), the Debt Commitment
Letter or the Debt Financing (including the transactions contemplated
thereby), whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and
agrees not to commence any action, arbitration, audit hearing, investigation,
litigation, petition, grievance, complaint, suit or proceeding against any
Financing Source in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereunder (including relating to the Debt Financing (including
the transactions contemplated thereby) or the Debt Commitment Letter). This
_Section 9.12_ is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Financing
Sources and shall be binding on all successor and assigns of the Company.

<Select the following clause IV.F for ski areas in prior appropriation States.
Permit administrator must read FSH 2709.11, 52.4 clause D-30 for instructions
on how to use this clause.>

  


 

  

F. _WATER FACILITIES AND WATER RIGHTS_.

  


 

  

"Used primarily for operation of the ski area" in relation to a water facility
or water right means that the water facility or water right provides
significantly more water for operation of the permitted portion of the ski
area than for any other use.

  


 

  

"Sufficient quantity of water to operate the ski area" means that under
typical conditions, taking into account fluctuations in utilization of the
authorized improvements, fluctuations in weather and climate, changes in
technology, and other factors deemed appropriate by the holder's qualified
hydrologist or licensed engineer, the holder has sufficient water rights or
access to a sufficient quantity of water to operate the permitted facilities,
and to provide for the associated activities authorized under the ski area
permit in accordance with the approved operating plan.

  


 

  

1\. _Water Facilities_.

  


 

  

a. The term "water facility" means a facility located on NFS lands that
diverts withdraws, stores, or distributes water, such as a diversion, ditch,
pipeline, reservoir, well, tank, impoundment structure, or similar facility or
feature.

  


 

  

b. The term "ski area water facility" means any water facility on NFS lands
that is authorized by this permit and used primarily for operation of the ski
area authorized by this permit (hereinafter "ski area").

  

    

  

c. The authorized officer may place conditions, as necessary to protect public
property, public safety, cultural resources, and natural resources on NFS
lands, on the installation, operation, maintenance, and removal of any water
facility, but only in accordance with applicable law. This clause D-30 does
not expand or contract the agency's authority to place conditions on the
installation, operation, maintenance, and removal of water facilities at
issuance or reissuance of the permit, throughout the permit term, or
otherwise. The holder must comply with present and future laws, regulations,
and other legal requirements in accordance with section I of this permit.

  


 

  

d. Only ski area water facilities may be authorized by this permit.

  


 

  

e. If due to a change (e.g., due to a change in the ownership of the water
facility or the associated water rights or a change in the beneficial use,
location, or season of use of the water) a ski area water facility will
primarily be used for purposes other than operation of the ski area, the
authorization for that ski area water facility under this permit shall
terminate. Unless the holder has a valid existing right for the water facility
to be situated on NFS lands, the holder must obtain a separate special use
authorization to operate that water facility or to develop any new water
facility on NFS lands that is used primarily for purposes other than operation
of the ski area. When such facilities continue to support approved ski area
operations at any time of year, the separate special use authorization for
these water facilities shall not contain any possessory interest policy based
on FSM 2541.32, paragraph 2 (or similar clauses), any waiver provision, or any
power of attorney provision. Unless the holder has a valid existing right for
the water facility to be situated on NFS lands, if the holder does not obtain
a separate special use authorization for these water facilities, the holder
shall remove them from NFS lands.

  


 

  

<USER NOTE FOR PARAGRAPH F.1.f>

  


 

  

<Insert paragraph F.1.f in permits issued in California, which has both prior
appropriation doctrine and riparian doctrine systems. Otherwise, omit this
paragraph.>

  


 

  

f. This permit does not convey, dispose of, extinguish, or otherwise effect a
transfer of any title, rights, or interest of the United States or the holder
as a riparian or littoral landowner. The United States and the holder retain
all rights, title, and interests they have as riparian or littoral landowners.

  


 

  

2. _Water Rights_. The term "water right" as used below means a right to use water that is recognized under state law under the prior appropriation doctrine. This permit does not confer any water rights.

  


 

  

3\. _Acquisition and Maintenance of Water Rights_.

  


 

  

a. _Terms_.

  


 

  

(1) The term "ski area water right" means any water right for use of water
from a point of diversion on NFS lands, either inside or outside the permit
boundary, that is primarily for operation of the ski area.

  


 

  

(2) The term "original water right" means any existing or new ski area water
right with a point of diversion that was or is, at all times during its use,
located within the permit boundary for this ski area and originally
established under state law through an application for a decree to state water
court, permitting, beneficial use, or otherwise recognized method of
establishing a new water right, in each case by the holder or a prior holder
of the ski area permit. The term "original water right" shall not include any
"acquired water right" and shall not be deemed to become an "acquired water
right" by virtue of the sale of the original water right to a subsequent
holder of the ski area permit.

  


 

  

(3) The term "acquired water right" means any ski area water right that is
purchased, bartered, exchanged, leased, or contracted by the holder or by any
prior holder, except as expressly provided in the last sentence of paragraph
F.3.a(2).

  

    

  

b. An inventory of all ski area water facilities and original water rights is
included in Appendix _ of this permit and shall be updated by the holder upon
reissuance of this permit, upon installation or removal of a ski area water
facility, when a listed ski area water facility is no longer authorized by
this permit, or when an original water right is no longer used for operation
of the ski area.

  


 

  

c. Original water rights must be established in accordance with applicable
state law. The holder, not the United States, shall bear the cost of
establishing, acquiring, maintaining, and perfecting original water rights,
including any original water rights owned solely or jointly by the United
States.

  


 

  

d. Original water rights owned solely by the United States and the United
States' interest in jointly owned original water rights shall remain in
federal ownership. Notwithstanding the holder's obligation to maintain
original water rights owned by the United States, the United States reserves
the right to take any action necessary to maintain and protect those water
rights, including submitting any applications or other filings that may be
necessary to protect the water rights.

  


 

  

4\. _Ensuring Sufficiency of Water Rights and Water for Permitted Ski Area
Operations_.

  


 

  

a. Where the United States solely or jointly owns water rights used by the
holder, the Forest Service shall not divide or transfer ownership of or seek
any change in those water rights that would adversely affect their
availability for operation of the ski area during the term of this permit,
unless required to comply with a statute or an involuntary court order that is
binding on the Forest Service.

  


 

  

b. Where the holder solely or jointly owns original water rights, the holder
shall not divide or transfer ownership of or seek any change in those water
rights that would adversely affect their availability for operation of the ski
area during the term of this permit, unless approved in writing in advance by
the authorized officer. In deciding whether to grant this approval, the
authorized officer shall consider any documentation prepared by the holder's
qualified hydrologist or licensed engineer demonstrating that such action will
not result in a lack of a sufficient quantity of water to operate the
permitted portion of the ski area.

  


 

  

c. At any time and solely within its discretion, the holder may seek to
change, abandon, lease, divide, or transfer ownership of or take other actions
with respect to acquired water rights. Following such actions, paragraph F.1.e
shall apply to the associated ski area water facilities.

  


 

  

5\. _Transfer of Certain Water Rights With Sale of the Ski Area Improvements_.

  


 

  

a. Upon termination or revocation of this permit, the holder shall offer to
sell the holder's interest in any solely or jointly owned original water
rights at market value to the succeeding permit holder. If the succeeding
permit holder declines to purchase original water rights owned solely by the
holder, the holder may transfer them to a third party. If the succeeding
permit holder declines to purchase the holder's interest in original water
rights jointly held with the United States, the holder shall offer to sell
that interest at market value to the United States. If the United States
declines to purchase that interest, the holder may abandon, divide, lease, or
transfer its interest at its sole discretion. This clause imposes no
restrictions on acquired water rights. There are no restrictions on the
transfer or abandonment of acquired water rights. In all instances, the holder
shall retain the full amount of any consideration paid for water rights.
Following such actions, paragraph F.1.e shall apply to the associated ski area
water facilities.

  


 

  

b. If the Forest Service does not reauthorize the ski area, the holder may
submit a proposal to the Forest Service for a permit authorizing a different
use for the ski area water facilities. If a different use is not authorized
for those water facilities, the holder shall remove them from NFS lands. The
holder may, in its sole discretion, abandon, divide, lease, or transfer any
water rights solely owned by the holder. The holder shall offer to sell to the
United States the holder's interest in original water rights jointly owned
with the United States at market value. If the United States declines to
purchase that interest, the holder may abandon, divide, lease, or transfer its
interest at its sole discretion.

purposes other than operation of the ski area, the authorization for that
water facility under this permit shall terminate. Unless the holder has a
valid existing right for the water facility to be situated on NFS lands, the
holder must obtain a separate special use authorization to operate that water
facility or to develop any new water facility on NFS lands that is used
primarily for purposes other than operation of the ski area. When such
facilities continue to support approved ski area operations at any time of
year, the separate special use authorization for these water facilities shall

issuance of this permit.

  


 

  

B. _SKI AREA PERMIT FEE CALCULATION_. The annual ski area permit fee (SAPF)
due the United States for the activities authorized by this permit shall be
calculated using the following formula:

  


 

  

SAPF = (.015 x AGR in bracket 1) + (.025 x AGR in bracket 2) +

  

(.0275 x AGR in bracket 3) + (.04 x AGR in bracket 4), where:

  


 

  

SAPF = the ski area permit fee for use of NFS lands;

  


 

  

AGR = adjusted gross revenue;

  


 

  

AGR = [(LT + SS) x (proration %)] + GRAF, prorated as applicable;

  


 

  

LT = revenue from sales of alpine and Nordic lift tickets and passes;

  


 

  

SS = revenue from alpine and Nordic ski school operations;

  


 

  

Proration % = the factor used to prorate LT and SS revenue between NFS lands
and private land in the ski area; and

  


 

  

GRAF = gross year-round revenue from ancillary facilities located on NFS
lands, prorated as applicable.

  


 

  

1\. _SAPF Formula_. The SAPF shall be calculated by summing the products of
the amount of the holder\'s AGR that falls into each of the four revenue
brackets multiplied by the applicable percentage rate, as shown in the table
below. AGR shall be determined in accordance with clause VI.B.2. The SAPF
shall be calculated based on the holder\'s fiscal year, unless mutually agreed
otherwise by the holder and the authorized officer.

  

    

  

The four revenue brackets shall be adjusted annually using the consumer price
index (CPI-U) issued in FSH 2709.11, chapter 30. The revenue brackets shall be
indexed for the previous calendar year. The holder\'s AGR for any fiscal year
shall not be split into more than one set of indexed brackets. Only the
revenue in each bracket shall be updated annually. The percentage rates shall
not change.

  


 

  

The revenue brackets and percentages in FSH 2709.11, 38.12, exhibit 01, shall
be used as shown in the preceding formula to calculate the SAPF. The revenue
brackets for FY2011 through 2016 are shown below.

*The Washington Office, Director of Recreation, Heritage, and Volunteer Resources, updates the revenue brackets annually, based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U), Table A which is published monthly at http://www.bls.gov. The CPI is revised and issued annually in section 97. Currently the table is located at ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt.

  

  

The bracket update is accomplished by using the change in the CPI-U for "All
Urban Consumers" index for the month of July and is based on the percentage
increase or decrease for the preceding calendar year. This index base period
is 1982-84=100. For example, the 2011 adjustment uses the change between July
2009 and July 2010, "Not Seasonally Adjusted" values.

3\. _Proration of Revenue_. Alpine and Nordic revenue shall be prorated
separately. Prorated revenues shall be added together and summed with GRAF to
produce AGR. One or more of the following methods, as appropriate, shall be
used to prorate revenue:

  


 

  

a. Alpine revenue shall be prorated using the slope transport feet percentage
(STFP), per the direction in FSM 2715.11c, effective in 1992. Only uphill
devices (lifts, tows, and tramways) that are fundamental to the winter sports
operation (usually those located on both federal and private land) shall be
included in the calculation. People movers whose primary purpose is to shuttle
people between parking areas or between parking areas and lodges and offices
shall not be included.

  


 

  

b. Nordic revenue shall be prorated using the percentage of Nordic trail
length on NFS lands to total Nordic trail length.

  


 

  

c. For ancillary facilities that are partially located on NFS lands, the ratio
of the facility square footage located on NFS lands to the total facility
square footage shall be calculated, and the revenue for ancillary facilities
shall be prorated in accordance with this ratio. Special event revenue
allocatable to GRAF shall be prorated by the ratio of use on NFS lands to the
total use.

  


 

  

4\. _Absence of AGR_. In cases when the holder has no AGR for a given fiscal
year, the holder shall pay a land use fee of $2 per acre for NFS lands under
permit or a percentage of the appraised value of NFS lands under permit, at
the discretion of the authorized officer.

  


 

  

C. _SAPF PAYMENTS_. Reports and deposits shall be sent or delivered to the
collection officer, USDA, Forest Service, at the address furnished by the
authorized officer. Checks or money orders shall be made payable to USDA,
Forest Service.

  


 

  

1\. The holder shall calculate and submit an advance payment which is due by
the beginning of the holder\'s payment cycle. The advance payment shall equal
20 percent of the holder\'s average SAPF for 3 operating years, when
available. When past SAPF information is not available, the advance payment
shall equal 20 percent of the SAPF, based on the prior holder\'s average SAPF
or projected AGR. For ski areas not expected to generate AGR for a given
payment cycle, advance payment of the SAPF as calculated in clause VI.B.4
shall be made. The advance payment shall be credited toward the total SAPF for
the payment cycle.

  


 

  

2\. The holder shall report sales, calculate the SAPF due based on a tentative
percentage rate, and make interim payments each calendar, except for periods
in which no sales take place and the holder has notified the authorized
officer that the operation has entered a seasonal shutdown for a specific
period. Reports and payments shall be made by the end of the month following
the end of each reportable period. Interim payments shall be credited toward
the total SAPF for the payment cycle.

  


 

  

3\. Within 90 days after the close of the ski area\'s payment cycle, the
holder shall provide a financial statement, including a completed SAPF
information form, Form FS-2700-19a, representing the ski area\'s financial
condition at the close of its business year and an annual operating statement
reporting the results of operations, including a final payment which includes
year-end adjustments for the holder and each subholder for the same period.
Any balance that exists may be credited and applied against the next payment
due or refunded, at the discretion of the holder.

  


 

  

4\. Within 30 days of receipt of a statement from the Forest Service, the
holder shall make any additional payment required to ensure that the correct
SAPF is paid for the past year\'s operations.

  


 

  

5\. All SAPF calculations and records of sales are subject to review or
periodic audit as determined by the authorized officer. Errors in calculation
or payment shall be corrected as needed for conformance with those reviews or
audits. In accordance with clause VI.E, interest and penalties shall be
assessed on additional fees due as a result of reviews or audits.

  

    

  

D. _CORRECTION OF ERRORS_. Correction of errors includes any action necessary
to calculate the holder\'s sales or slope transport feet percentage or to make
any other determination required to calculate SAPFs accurately. For SAPF
calculation purposes, an error may include:

  


 

  

1\. Misreporting or misrepresentation of amounts;

  


 

  

2\. Arithmetical mistakes;

  


 

  

3\. Typographical mistakes; or

  


 

  

4\. Variation from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), when such
variations are inconsistent with the terms of this permit.

  


 

  

Correction of errors shall be made retroactively to the date the error was
made or to the previous audit period, whichever is more recent, and past SAPFs
shall be adjusted accordingly.

  


 

  

E. _FEE PAYMENT ISSUES_

  


 

  

1\. _Crediting of Payments_. Payments shall be credited on the date received
by the deposit facility, except that if a payment is received on a non-
workday, the payment shall not be credited until the next work day.

  


 

  

2\. _Disputed Fees_. Fees are due and payable by the due date. Disputed fees
must be paid in full. Adjustments will be made if dictated by settlement terms
or an appeal decision.

  


 

  

3\. _Late Payments_

  


 

  

(a) _Interes_ t. Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717 et seq., interest shall be charged
on any fee amount not paid within 30 days from the date it became due. The
rate of interest assessed shall be the higher of the Prompt Payment Act rate
or the rate of the current value of funds to the Treasury (i.e., the Treasury
tax and loan account rate), as prescribed and published annually or quarterly
by the Secretary of the Treasury in the _Federal Register_ and the Treasury
Fiscal Requirements Manual Bulletins. Interest on the principal shall accrue
from the date the fee amount is due.

  


 

  

(b) _Administrative Costs_. If the account becomes delinquent, administrative
costs to cover processing and handling the delinquency shall be assessed.

  


 

  

(c) _Penalties_. A penalty of 6% per annum shall be assessed on the total
amount that is more than 90 days delinquent and shall accrue from the same
date on which interest charges begin to accrue.

  


 

  

(d) _Termination for Nonpayment_. This permit shall terminate without the
necessity of prior notice and opportunity to comply when any permit fee
payment is 90 calendar days from the due date in arrears. The holder shall be
responsible for the delinquent fees, as well as any other costs of restoring
the site to its original condition, including hazardous waste cleanup.

  


 

  

4\. _Administrative Offset and Credit Reporting_. Delinquent fees and other
charges associated with the permit shall be subject to all rights and remedies
afforded the United States pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711 et seq. and common law.
Delinquencies are subject to any or all of the following:

  


 

  

(a) Administrative offset of payments due the holder from the Forest Service.

  


 

  

(b) If in excess of 60 days, referral to the Department of the Treasury for
appropriate collection action as provided by 31 U.S.C. 3711(g)(1).

  

    

  

(c) Offset by the Secretary of the Treasury of any amount due the holder, as
provided by 31 U.S.C. 3720 et seq.

  


 

  

(d) Disclosure to consumer or commercial credit reporting agencies.

  


 

  

F. _ACCESS TO RECORDS_. For the purpose of administering this permit
(including ascertaining that the correct land use fee was paid), the holder
shall make all accounting books and supporting records for the authorized
operations, as well as those of lessees operating in the permit area,
available for review by the Forest Service or other federal agencies
authorized to review the Forest Service activities. Review of accounting books
and supporting records shall be made at dates convenient to the holder and
reviewers. Financial information so obtained shall be kept confidential to the
extent permitted by law. The holder shall retain these records and keep them
available for review for 5 years after they were generated, unless otherwise
approved by the authorized officer in writing.

  


 

  

G. _ACCOUNTING RECORDS_. The holder shall follow GAAP or other comprehensive
bases of accounting acceptable to the Forest Service in recording financial
transactions and in reporting results to the authorized officer. When
requested by the authorized officer, the holder at its own expense shall have
the annual accounting reports audited or prepared by a licensed independent
accountant acceptable to the Forest Service. The holder shall require lessees
to comply with these same requirements. At a minimum, the holder's or lessees'
accounting system shall include:

  


 

  

1\. Systematic internal controls, including recording by type of business the
gross receipts derived from all operations conducted under this permit. Gross
receipts should be recorded daily and, if possible, deposited into a bank
account without reduction by disbursements. Receipt entries shall be
documented by cash-register tapes, sale invoices, rental records, cash
accounts from other sources, or some other means.

  


 

  

2\. A permanent record of capital investments in facilities (including a
depreciation schedule).

  


 

  

3\. Generation and maintenance of such other records and accounts as may be
specified by the authorized officer.

  


 

  

VII. _REVOCATION, SUSPENSION, AND TERMINATION_

  


 

  

A. _REVOCATION AND SUSPENSION_. The authorized officer may revoke or suspend
this permit in whole or in part:

  


 

  

1\. For noncompliance with federal, state, or local law.

  


 

  

2\. For noncompliance with the terms and conditions of this permit.

  


 

  

3\. For abandonment or other failure of the holder to exercise the privileges
granted.

  


 

  

4\. With the consent of the holder.

  


 

  

5\. For specific and compelling reasons in the public interest.

  


 

  

Prior to revocation or suspension, other than immediate suspension under
clause VII.C, the authorized officer shall give the holder (and if applicable,
the operator) written notice of the grounds for revocation or suspension. In
the case of revocation or suspension based on clause VII.A.1, VII.A.2, or
VII.A.3, the authorized officer shall give the holder a reasonable period, not
to exceed 90 days, to cure any noncompliance.

  

    

  

B. _REVOCATION FOR SPECIFIC AND COMPELLING REASONS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST_

  


 

  

The authorized officer may revoke this permit during its term if the Forest
Service determines through the process of amending or revising the applicable
land management plan that the use and occupancy authorized by this permit
should be changed for specific and compelling reasons in the public interest,
other than a determination under clause IV.E. that the authorized improvements
or the permit area cannot be safely occupied. Prior to revoking the permit
under this clause, the authorized officer shall give the holder 90 days
written notice to the holder, provided that the authorized officer may
prescribe a shorter notice period if justified by the public interest. The
Forest Service shall then have the right to purchase the holder's authorized
improvements, remove them or require the holder to relocate or remove them.
The Forest Service shall be obligated to pay the lesser of (1) the cost of
relocation of the authorized improvements and damages resulting from their
relocation that are caused by the Forest Service or (2) the value of the
authorized improvements as determined by the Forest Service through an
appraisal of the market value of the improvements based on the Uniform
Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions (Uniform Standards). Where
appropriate under the Uniform Standards, the potential of the improvements to
generate income over the remainder of the term of the permit may be
considered, but any consideration of future potential for income production
shall be limited to the remainder of the permit term. If this amount is fixed
by agreement between the authorized officer and the holder, that amount shall
be accepted by the holder in full satisfaction of all claims against the
United States under this clause. If agreement is not reached, the authorized
officer shall determine the amount to be paid, which shall be set forth in the
revocation decision. A payment made pursuant to this clause is subject to the
availability of appropriations. Nothing in this permit implies that Congress
will appropriate funds to cover a deficiency in appropriations.

  


 

  

C. _IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION_. The authorized officer may immediately suspend this
permit in whole or in part when necessary to protect public health or safety
or the environment. The suspension decision shall be in writing. The holder
may request an on-site review with the authorized officer's supervisor of the
adverse conditions prompting the suspension. The authorized officer's
supervisor shall grant this request within 48 hours. Following the on-site
review, the authorized officer's supervisor shall promptly affirm, modify, or
cancel the suspension.

  


 

  

D. _APPEALS AND REMEDIES_. Written decisions made by the authorized officer
relating to administration of this permit are subject to administrative appeal
pursuant to 36 CFR Part 214. Revocation or suspension of this permit shall not
give rise to any claim for damages by the holder against the Forest Service,
other than as provided in clause VII.B.

  


 

  

E. _TERMINATION_. This permit shall terminate when by its terms a fixed or
agreed upon condition, event, or time occurs without any action by the
authorized officer. Examples include but are not limited to expiration of the
permit by its terms on a specified date and termination upon change of control
of the business entity. Termination of this permit is not subject to
administrative appeal and shall not give rise to any claim for damages by the
holder against the Forest Service.

  


 

  

F. _RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES UPON REVOCATION OR TERMINATION WITHOUT
RENEWAL_. Except as provided in clause VII.B, upon revocation of this permit
or termination of this permit without renewal of the authorized use, the
authorized officer has the discretion to require the holder to sell or remove
all structures and improvements, except those owned by the United States,
within a reasonable period prescribed by the authorized officer and to restore
the site to the satisfaction of the authorized officer. If the holder fails to
sell or remove all structures or improvements within the prescribed period,
they shall become the property of the United States and may be sold,
destroyed, or otherwise disposed of without any liability to the United
States. However, the holder shall remain liable for all costs associated with
their removal, including costs of sale and impoundment, cleanup, and
restoration of the site.

  

    

  

G. _CONTINUATION OF OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES BEYOND EXPIRATION OR
REVOCATION_. Notwithstanding the termination or revocation of this permit, its
terms and conditions shall remain in effect and shall be binding on the holder
and the holder's personal representative, successors, and assignees until all
the holder's obligations and liabilities accruing before or as a result of
termination or revocation of this permit have been satisfied.

  


 

  

<USER NOTES FOR CLAUSE VIII.H>

  

<Include clause VIII.H when the lands authorized for use are withdrawn for
hydroelectric power or reclamation purposes. Otherwise, delete it.>

  


 

  

H. _TERMINATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HYDROELECTRIC POWER OR RECLAMATION
PURPOSES_. Any lands covered by this permit which have been withdrawn for
hydroelectric power under the act of March 3, 1879, or the act of June 25,
1910, or are covered by an application or license governed by the Federal
Power Act of June 10, 1920, are subject at any time to use for the development
of hydroelectric power. Any lands covered by this permit which have been
withdrawn under the Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902, are subject at any time
to use for reclamation purposes. This permit is issued with the specific
understanding that (1) the use and occupancy authorized by this permit shall
not interfere with such development of hydroelectric power or reclamation and
that (2) the permit shall terminate after 90 days written notice when, in the
judgment of the Federal Power Commission, the lands in question are needed for
the development of hydroelectric power or, in the judgment of the Bureau of
Reclamation, the lands in question are needed for reclamation purposes. The
holder shall have 90 days to remove the authorized improvements. Termination
under this clause shall not give rise to any claim by the holder against the
Federal Power Commission, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Forest Service, or
hydroelectric power licensees for damages, including lost profits and damage
to improvements, due to such development of hydroelectric power or
reclamation.

  


 

  

VIII. _MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS_

  


 

  

A. _MEMBERS OF CONGRESS_. No member of or delegate to Congress or Resident
Commissioner shall benefit from this permit either directly or indirectly,
except to the extent the authorized use provides a general benefit to a
corporation.

  


 

  

B. _REGULATING SERVICES AND RATES_. The authorized officer shall have the
authority to regulate the adequacy and type of services provided the public
under this permit and to require that these services conform to satisfactory
standards. The holder may be required to furnish a schedule of prices for
sales and services authorized by the permit. These prices may be regulated by
the authorized officer, provided that the holder shall not be required to
charge prices significantly different from those charged by comparable or
competing enterprises.

  


 

  

C. _ADVERTISING_. The holder, either orally or in advertisements, signs,
circulars, brochures, letterheads, and like materials, shall not misrepresent
in any way the accommodations provided, the status of the permit, or the
ownership of the permit area or adjacent lands. The fact that the authorized
facilities and services are located on the [ ] National Forest shall be
explicitly stated in all the holder\'s brochures and print advertising
regarding the operations authorized by this permit.

  


 

  

D. _CURRENT ADDRESSES_. The holder and the authorized officer shall keep each
other informed of current mailing addresses, including those necessary for
billing and payment of land use fees.

#PREV_REISSUE_HOLDER#, #PREV_AUTH_ID#, dated #PREV_REIS_ISSUE_DATE#.

  


 

  

F. _SUPERIOR CLAUSES_. If there is a conflict between any of the preceding
printed clauses and any of the following clauses, the preceding printed
clauses shall control.
