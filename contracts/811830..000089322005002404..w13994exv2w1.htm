before, and the denominator of which shall be the number of such
shares outstanding immediately after, the occurrence of such
event, and the resulting product shall from and after the date
of such event be the Merger Consideration, subject to further
adjustment in accordance with this sentence.

<P align="center">
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES FOR MERGER CONSIDERATION

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3.1.&nbsp;<I><U>Sovereign to Make Merger Consideration
Available.</U></I> Sovereign shall appoint an agent, who shall
be reasonably acceptable to ICBC (the &#147;<U>Exchange
Agent&#148;</U>), for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for
the Merger Consideration. Prior to the Effective Time, Sovereign
shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this
Article&nbsp;III, an amount of cash sufficient to make all
payments pursuant to Article&nbsp;II (such cash amount, the
&#147;<U>Exchange Fund</U>&#148;). The cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section&nbsp;3.1 shall be
invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Sovereign;
<U>provided</U> that (a)&nbsp;no such investment or losses
thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the
holders of shares of ICBC Common Stock and following any losses
Sovereign shall promptly provide additional funds to the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of ICBC in
the amount of any such losses and (b)&nbsp;such investments
shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of
America with maturities of no more than 30&nbsp;days or
guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States of America or in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moody&#146;s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard&nbsp;&#38;
Poor&#146;s Corporation, respectively. Any interest or income
produced by such investments will be payable to or at the
direction of Sovereign.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3.2.&nbsp;<I><U>Exchange of Shares.</U></I> (a)&nbsp;As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in no event
more than five Business Days thereafter, Sovereign shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Certificates a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. Upon proper
surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with a letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
share formerly represented by such Certificate (plus any
dividend amount payable as described in Section&nbsp;2.1(b)),
and such Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit
of holders of Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable
upon the surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Article&nbsp;III, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by Section&nbsp;2.1 (plus any
dividend amount payable as described in Section&nbsp;2.1(b)).

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;If the payment of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and that the person requesting such payment shall pay
to the Exchange Agent in advance any applicable stock transfer
or other Taxes or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
payable.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed
by the stockholders of ICBC for twelve months after the
Effective Time shall be paid, at the request of Sovereign, to
Sovereign. Any stockholders of ICBC who have not theretofore
complied with this Article&nbsp;III shall thereafter look only
to Sovereign for payment of the Merger Consideration deliverable
in respect of each share of ICBC Common Stock held by such
stockholder at the Effective Time as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, none of Sovereign,
ICBC, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to
any former holder of shares of ICBC Common Stock for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of ICBC Common Stock
immediately prior to such time when the amounts would, pursuant
to applicable law, otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, the property of Sovereign free and clear of any
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(d)&nbsp;In the event any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen
or destroyed and, if required by Sovereign, the posting by such
person of a bond in such amount as Sovereign may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e)&nbsp;Sovereign or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of ICBC Common Stock
such amounts as Sovereign or the Exchange Agent are required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any applicable provision of any other
U.S.&nbsp;federal, state, local or non-U.S.&nbsp;tax law. To the
extent that such amounts are properly withheld by Sovereign or
the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the ICBC Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding were made by Sovereign or the Exchange Agent.

either in response to an express disclosure requirement
contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or
more representations or warranties contained in Article&nbsp;IV
or to one or more covenants contained in Article&nbsp;VI. No
representation or warranty of ICBC contained in this
Article&nbsp;IV shall be deemed untrue or incorrect, and ICBC
shall not be deemed to have breached a representation or
warranty, or to have failed to satisfy a related condition, as a
consequence of the existence or absence of any fact,
circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance or event,
individually or taken together with all other facts,
circumstances or events inconsistent with that or any other
representation or warranty, has had or is reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect (as hereinafter defined).

interpretations thereof by courts or governmental authorities or

(&#147;<U>GAAP</U>&#148;) or regulatory accounting requirements,
in any such case applicable to banks, savings banks, mortgage

holding companies generally, or (iv)&nbsp;expenses and costs
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby; and <U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>, that a decrease in
the trading or market price of the ICBC Common Stock shall not
be considered, by itself, to constitute a Material Adverse
Effect.

Section&nbsp;4.7(d) of the ICBC Disclosure Schedule (A)&nbsp;any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material
respect ICBC&#146;s ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B)&nbsp;any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who
have a significant role in ICBC&#146;s internal controls over

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e)&nbsp;The records, systems, controls, data and information of

have a materially adverse effect on the system of internal
accounting controls described in the following sentence. As and
to the extent described in the ICBC Reports filed with the SEC
prior to the date hereof, ICBC and its Subsidiaries have devised
and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient
to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
in accordance with GAAP, and as of the date hereof, ICBC has not
identified any material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting.

(i)&nbsp;Since June&nbsp;30, 2005, no event has occurred which
has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect and (ii)&nbsp;from
June&nbsp;30, 2005 to the date hereof, neither ICBC nor any of

not yet due and payable and other standard exceptions commonly
found in title policies in the jurisdiction where such real

respects in accordance with the relevant loan documents,
ICBC&#146;s underwriting standards (and, in the case of Loans
held for resale to investors, the underwriting standards, if

increase the guarantee fees payable to such investor.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SOVEREIGN

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5.1.&nbsp;<I><U>Disclosure Standard.</U></I> No representation
or warranty of Sovereign contained in this Article&nbsp;V shall
be deemed untrue or incorrect, and Sovereign shall not be deemed
to have breached a representation or warranty, or to have failed
to satisfy a related condition, as a consequence of the
existence or absence of any fact, circumstance or event unless
such fact, circumstance or event, individually or taken together
with all other facts, circumstances or events inconsistent with
that or any other representation or warranty, has had or is
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
Sovereign&#146;s ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on a timely basis.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sovereign hereby represents and warrants to ICBC that, except as
set forth in the Sovereign Reports filed prior to the date
hereof:

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5.2.&nbsp;<I><U>Corporate Organization.</U></I> (a)&nbsp;Each of
Sovereign and Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Pennsylvania (in the case of Sovereign) or Delaware (in
the case of Merger Sub). Each of Sovereign and Merger Sub has
the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing
or qualification necessary. Sovereign is duly registered as a
savings and loan holding company under HOLA. The copies of the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of each of Sovereign
and Merger Sub which have previously been made available to ICBC
are true, complete and correct copies of such documents as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;Each Subsidiary of Sovereign other than Merger Sub
(i)&nbsp;is duly organized and validly existing as a savings
bank, corporation, partnership or limited liability company
under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii)&nbsp;is
duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good
standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or
foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the
conduct of its business requires it to be so licensed or
qualified and (iii)&nbsp;has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry
on its business as now conducted.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;Except for its ownership of Sovereign Bank, Sovereign
does not own, either directly or through its Subsidiaries, any
stock or equity interest in any depository institution (as
defined in 12&nbsp;U.S.C. Section&nbsp;1813(c)(1)). Sovereign
Bank is a federal savings bank, duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of the United States of America.
Sovereign Bank is a qualified thrift lender pursuant to
Section&nbsp;10(m) of HOLA and its deposits are insured by the
FDIC through the SAIF to the fullest extent permitted by law.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;Sovereign owns beneficially and of record all of the

security interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements,
limitations on voting rights, charges or other encumbrances of
any nature whatsoever.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5.3.&nbsp;<I><U>Authority; No Violation.</U></I>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;Each of Sovereign and Merger Sub has full corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement have been duly and validly
approved by all necessary action of the Boards of Directors of
each of Sovereign and Merger Sub, and prior to the Effective
Time will be duly and validly authorized by all necessary action
by Sovereign as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, and no other
corporate or stockholder proceedings on the part of Sovereign or
Merger Sub are necessary to approve this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each of
Sovereign and Merger Sub and (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by ICBC) constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of each of Sovereign and Merger Sub, enforceable
against each such corporation in accordance with its terms,
except as enforcement may be limited by general principles of
equity, whether

other instrument or obligation to which Sovereign, Merger Sub or
any of Sovereign&#146;s other Subsidiaries is a party, or by

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;No vote or consent of the holders of any class or
series of capital stock of Sovereign is necessary to approve
this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions contemplated
hereby. The vote or consent of Sovereign as the sole stockholder

in connection with (A)&nbsp;the execution and delivery by each
of Sovereign and Merger Sub of this Agreement and (B)&nbsp;the
consummation by Merger Sub of the Merger and the consummation by
each of Sovereign and Merger Sub of the other transactions
contemplated hereby. As of the date of this Agreement, Sovereign
does not know of any reason why any Requisite Regulatory
Approval should not be obtained on a timely basis.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5.5.&nbsp;<I><U>Broker&#146;s Fees.</U></I> Except for Citigroup
Global Markets Inc. (&#147;<U>Citigroup</U>&#148;),
J.P.&nbsp;Morgan Securities Inc. and Bear, Stearns&nbsp;&#38;

5.6.&nbsp;<I><U>Legal Proceedings.</U></I> As of the date
hereof, neither Sovereign nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party

relating to Sovereign and its Subsidiaries to be provided by
Sovereign to be contained in the Proxy Statement, any filing
pursuant to Rule&nbsp;14a-12 under the Exchange Act, or in any
other document filed with any other Governmental Entity in

they are made, not misleading.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5.9.&nbsp;<I><U>Financing.</U></I> Sovereign and Merger Sub will
have available to them at the Effective Time immediately
available funds necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all related fees and
expenses.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5.10.&nbsp;<I><U>Opinion of Financial Advisor.</U></I> Citigroup
has provided Sovereign with its opinion to the effect that, as
of the date of approval of this Agreement by the board of
directors of Sovereign, and based upon and subject to the
matters set forth therein, the consideration (defined in the
Citigroup opinion to include (a)&nbsp;the shares of Sovereign
Common Stock issued or sold to Banco Santander pursuant to the
Investment Agreement, plus (b)&nbsp;the amount of cash
consideration paid to ICBC stockholders as Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Agreement to the extent such amount exceeds the

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the
parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all
necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices,

all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger) and to comply with the terms
and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and

Entities. ICBC and Sovereign shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the
other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to
the exchange of information, all the information relating to
ICBC and Sovereign, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with,
or written materials submitted to, any third party or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as

connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement or any
other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on

7.2.&nbsp;<I><U>Access to Information.</U></I> (a)&nbsp;Upon
reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information, ICBC shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel and other representatives of Sovereign access, during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and
records, and to its officers, employees, accountants, counsel
and other representatives, in each case in a manner not
unreasonably disruptive to the operation of the business of ICBC
and its Subsidiaries, and, during such period, ICBC shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to Sovereign all
other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as Sovereign may reasonably request. In addition,
during the period prior to the Effective Time, ICBC shall permit
employees of Sovereign reasonable access to and participation in
material discussions relating to problem Loans, Loan
restructurings, Loan workouts and Derivative Contracts (other
than any Derivative Contracts entered into in the ordinary
course of business with Fannie Mae and PHH Mortgage), and other
material asset/liability activities of ICBC and Independence
Bank; <U>provided</U> that neither Sovereign nor any Sovereign
employee shall have any decision-making authority with respect
to such matters. Neither ICBC nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
be required to provide access to or to disclose information
where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or
control of such information or contravene any law, rule or
regulation applicable to the institution in possession or
control of such information. The parties hereto will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;Sovereign shall hold all information furnished by ICBC
or any of its Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to
Section&nbsp;7.2(a) in confidence to the extent required by, and
in accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality

practicable following the date of this Agreement (the
&#147;<U>ICBC Stockholders Meeting&#148;</U>) for the purpose of
obtaining the ICBC Stockholder Approval and, except as provided
hereby, shall take all lawful action to solicit the adoption of
this Agreement by such stockholders. The Board of Directors of
ICBC shall recommend adoption of this Agreement and the

make any other public statement in connection with the ICBC
Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation if
the Board of Directors of ICBC determines, in good faith after
consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, that
the failure to take such action would or could reasonably be
expected to breach its fiduciary

agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and
that it shall not authorize its or its Subsidiaries&#146;
employees, agents and representatives (including any investment
banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its
Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, (i)&nbsp;initiate,
solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries or
the making of any proposal or offer with respect to a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving it or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries (as hereinafter defined), other than any such
transaction permitted by Section&nbsp;6.2, or any sale of 15% or
more of the consolidated assets (including stock of its
Subsidiaries) of ICBC and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
any issuance or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, its
voting securities that, if consummated, would result in any
person (or the stockholders of such person) beneficially owning
securities representing 15% or more of its total voting power
(or of the surviving parent entity in such transaction) or any
of its Significant Subsidiaries (any such proposal or offer
(other than a proposal or offer made by Sovereign) being
hereinafter referred as an &#147;<U>Acquisition
Proposal&#148;</U>), (ii)&nbsp;have any discussions with or
provide any confidential information or data to any person
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal, or knowingly
facilitate any effort or attempt by any person to make or
implement an Acquisition Proposal, (iii)&nbsp;approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal or (iv)&nbsp;approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, asset purchase or share exchange agreement, option
agreement or other similar agreement related to any Acquisition
Proposal or publicly propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section&nbsp;7.4(a), in the event that, prior to the date of the
ICBC Stockholders Meeting, ICBC receives an unsolicited bona
fide Acquisition Proposal, ICBC may, and may permit its
Subsidiaries and its and their representatives to, prior to the
ICBC Stockholders Meeting, (x)&nbsp;furnish or cause to be
furnished confidential information or data, (y)&nbsp;participate
in such negotiations or discussions and (z)&nbsp;approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal if ICBC&#146;s Board of Directors concludes
in good faith after consultation with its legal counsel and
financial advisors that, in the case of any action described in
clauses&nbsp;(x)&nbsp;or (y)&nbsp;above, such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined) and, in the case of
any action described in clause&nbsp;(z)&nbsp;above, such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal;
<U>provided</U> that prior to providing (or causing to be
provided) any confidential information or data permitted to be
provided pursuant to this sentence, ICBC shall have entered into
a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no
less favorable to ICBC than the Confidentiality Agreement
(provided that ICBC may enter into a confidentiality agreement
without a standstill provision, or with standstill or other
provisions less favorable to ICBC, if it waives or similarly
modifies the corresponding provisions in the Confidentiality
Agreement). The term &#147;<U>Significant Subsidiary&#148;</U>
shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in Rule&nbsp;1-02 of
Regulation&nbsp;S-X.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if, at any time prior to the adoption of this
Agreement by ICBC&#146;s stockholders in accordance with this
Agreement, ICBC&#146;s Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, in response to an Acquisition Proposal
that was not solicited in material violation of
Section&nbsp;7.4(a), that such proposal is a Superior Proposal,
ICBC or its Board of Directors may terminate this Agreement;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that ICBC shall not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this sentence, and any purported
termination pursuant to this sentence shall be void and of no
force or effect, unless ICBC prior to or concurrently with such
termination pursuant to this Section&nbsp;7.4(b) pays to
Sovereign the fee payable pursuant to Section&nbsp;9.2(b); and
<U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>, however, that ICBC shall not
exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section&nbsp;7.4(b) until after 72&nbsp;hours following the
provision of written notice to Sovereign advising Sovereign that
ICBC&#146;s Board of Directors intends to cause ICBC to accept
such Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal (it being understood that
neither the delivery of such notice nor any subsequent public
announcement thereof shall entitle Sovereign to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section&nbsp;9.1(f)) and that ICBC shall,
during such 72-hour period, negotiate in good faith with

<P><HR noshade><P>
<H5 align="left" style="page-break-before:always">&nbsp;</H5><P>

<DIV align="left">
Sovereign (to the extent requested by Sovereign) to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such
that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;<U>Superior
Proposal&#148;</U> with respect to ICBC means a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of
ICBC concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and legal advisors, taking into account all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal
and the person making the proposal (including any break-up fees,
expense reimbursement provisions, the conditions to consummation
and the likelihood of consummation), is more favorable to the
stockholders of ICBC from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;ICBC will immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the
date of this Agreement with any persons other than Sovereign
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. ICBC will promptly
(within one Business Day) following the receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal, or of any inquiry which could reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, advise Sovereign
of the material terms thereof and will keep Sovereign reasonably
apprised of any material developments related thereto.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e)&nbsp;Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent ICBC
or its board of directors from complying with Rule&nbsp;14d-9
and Rule&nbsp;14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (or any similar communication to
stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a
tender offer or exchange offer) or from making any legally
required disclosure to stockholders with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, a
communication by ICBC&#146;s board of directors pursuant to
Rule&nbsp;14d-9(e)(3) and any similar communication shall not be
deemed to constitute a Change in ICBC Recommendation.

(a)&nbsp;Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,

each such Senior Executive, ICBC and/or any Subsidiary thereof
(collectively, the &#147;<U>Severance Agreements</U>&#148;),
assuming a termination of each such Senior Executive&#146;s
employment without Cause (as such term is defined in the
Severance Agreements) on the Closing Date, provided that such
persons remain employed by ICBC or its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time, but whether or not such persons remain employed
by ICBC or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time. Except as
may otherwise be agreed between the parties hereto and any
Senior Executive, the Severance Agreements shall remain in
effect in accordance with their respective terms.

criminal or administrative, in which any person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer,
employee or agent of ICBC or any of its Subsidiaries (the
&#148;<U>Indemnified Parties&#148;</U>) is, or is threatened to
be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i)&nbsp;the fact that
he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of ICBC, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or
was prior to the Effective Time serving at the request of any
such party as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent
of another corporation, partnership, trust or other enterprise
or (ii)&nbsp;this Agreement, or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby and all actions taken by an Indemnified
Party in connection herewith, whether in any case asserted or
arising before or after the Effective Time, Sovereign shall
indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, each such Indemnified Party against
any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding
or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by law upon receipt of an undertaking, to the extent
required by the DGCL, from such Indemnified Party to repay such
advanced expenses if it is determined by a final and
nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that
such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification
hereunder), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;Sovereign shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses,
including attorneys&#146; fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided for in this Section&nbsp;7.7 to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;Without limiting anything contained in
Section&nbsp;7.7(a) or any other provision of this Agreement,
the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (i)&nbsp;the
Indemnified Parties will be provided with indemnification from
and after the Effective Time that is no less favorable to their
rights to indemnification presently set forth in the certificate
of incorporation, by-laws or equivalent documents of ICBC or any
of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, in each case as in effect on
the date hereof, and (ii)&nbsp;Sovereign shall honor and perform
under all indemnification agreements entered into by ICBC or any
of its Subsidiaries.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;Sovereign shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the persons covered by ICBC&#146;s directors&#146; and
officers&#146; liability insurance policy immediately prior to
the Effective Time to be covered for a period of six
(6)&nbsp;years from the Closing Date by the directors&#146; and
officers&#146; liability insurance policy or policies maintained
by Sovereign with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, <U>provided</U>
that Sovereign&#146;s policy or policies provide at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which
are not less advantageous to such directors and officers of ICBC
than the terms and conditions of the existing directors&#146;
and officers&#146; liability insurance policy of ICBC. Sovereign
will not be required to expend, in respect of its obligations to
such covered persons as described in the preceding sentence, in
any one year an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums
currently paid by ICBC for the insurance covering the officers
and directors of ICBC (the &#148;<U>Insurance Amount&#148;</U>),
<U>provided</U>, that if such expenditure would exceed the
Insurance Amount, Sovereign shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available
for the Insurance Amount. The provisions of this
Section&nbsp;7.7(d) shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid policies have been obtained by ICBC prior to the
Effective Time, which policies provide the persons covered by
ICBC&#146;s directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability
insurance policy immediately prior to the Effective Time with
coverage for a period of not less than six years from the
Effective Time with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time;
<U>provided</U> such prepaid policies shall not be obtained by
ICBC at a cost per annum that is higher than the Insurance
Amount. If such prepaid policies have been obtained by ICBC
prior to the Effective Time, Sovereign shall maintain such
policies in full force and effect and continue to honor
ICBC&#146;s obligations thereunder.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e)&nbsp;The provisions of this Section&nbsp;7.7 are intended to
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

prior to the Effective Time with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Investment Agreement or
(ii)&nbsp;seek any vote of its stockholders prior to the

matters contemplated by this Agreement or the Investment

investment in, or purchase of securities from, Sovereign to be
made at or prior to the Effective Time; or (iii)&nbsp;consent to

Agreement) beyond the Closing Date determined in accordance with
Section&nbsp;1.4. During the period from the date of this

all of its obligations under the Investment Agreement on a
timely basis and use its reasonable best efforts to cause all
conditions to the closing of the investment contemplated
thereunder to be satisfied as soon as practicable.

shall cause all such individuals who accept such invitation to

Bank&#146;s former market areas. The Divisional Board shall
exist for at least three years following the Effective Time, and
the individuals who accept the invitation to join the Divisional
Board, as described above, shall be entitled to serve as members
of the Divisional Board throughout such three-year period
(unless removed for cause). Each member of the Divisional Board
who is not a member of the board of directors of Sovereign or

&#147;hereof,&#148; &#147;herein&#148; and &#147;hereunder&#148;
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall

provision of this Agreement, and Section references are to this
Agreement unless otherwise specified. Whenever the words
&#147;include,&#148; &#147;includes&#148; or
&#147;including&#148; are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words &#147;without
limitation.&#148; The table of contents and headings contained
in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to
require ICBC, Sovereign or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or affiliates to take any action which would violate or conflict
with any applicable law (whether statutory or common), rule or
regulation.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
10.5.&nbsp;<I><U>Counterparts</U></I>. This Agreement may be
executed in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one
and the same agreement and shall become effective when
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
10.6.&nbsp;<I><U>Entire Agreement</U></I>. This Agreement
(together with the documents and the instruments referred to

10.8.&nbsp;<I><U>Severability</U></I>. Any term or provision of
this Agreement which is determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction
shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of
the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other
jurisdiction, and if any provision of this Agreement is
determined to be so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision
shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, in
all cases so long as neither the economic nor legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party or its stockholders. Upon any
such determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith in
an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute
provision to effect the original intent of the parties.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
10.9.&nbsp;<I><U>Publicity</U></I>. Sovereign and ICBC shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release with
respect to the Merger or this Agreement and neither Sovereign
(or any of its Subsidiaries) nor ICBC (or any of its
Subsidiaries) shall issue any such press release or make any
such public statement without the prior consent of the other
party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that Sovereign or ICBC may,
without the prior consent of the other party (but after prior
consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances)
issue such press release or make such public statement as may
upon the advice of outside counsel be required by law or the
rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (in
the case of such a release or statement by Sovereign) or the
Nasdaq National Market (in the case of such a release or
statement by ICBC) or as may be permitted pursuant to
Section&nbsp;7.3 or 7.4. Without limiting the reach of the
preceding sentence, Sovereign and ICBC shall cooperate to
develop all public announcement materials and shall make
appropriate management available at presentations related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as reasonably
requested by the other party.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
10.10.&nbsp;<I><U>Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries</U></I>.

obligations of any party hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other party. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as
otherwise expressly provided for herein (including
Section&nbsp;7.7 hereof), this Agreement (including the
documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to
confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder.

addition, each of the parties hereto (i)&nbsp;consents to submit
