 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER  

  This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 24, 2005 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, this " _Agreement"_ ), is entered into by and among SOVEREIGN BANCORP, INC., a Pennsylvania corporation (" _Sovereign"_ ), ICELAND ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Sovereign (" _Merger Sub"_ ), and INDEPENDENCE COMMUNITY BANK CORP., a Delaware corporation (" _ICBC"_ ).  

  WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of Sovereign, Merger Sub and ICBC have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and stockholders to consummate the business combination transaction provided for herein in which Merger Sub would merge with and into ICBC (the " _Merger"_ ), and such Boards of Directors have approved the Merger (and, in the case of the Board of Directors of ICBC, have declared this Agreement advisable and recommended that it be adopted by ICBCs stockholders), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and  

  WHEREAS, Sovereign, Merger Sub and ICBC desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and also to prescribe various conditions to the transactions contemplated hereby.  

  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:  

 ARTICLE I  

 THE MERGER  

  1.1. _ _The Merger.__ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL"_ ), at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), Merger Sub shall merge with and into ICBC. ICBC shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation"_ ) in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall terminate.  

  1.2. _ _Effective Time.__ Merger Sub and ICBC shall prepare the certificate of merger for the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger"_ ), which shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined). The term " _Effective Time"_ shall mean the time when the Merger becomes effective, which shall be upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such other time as the parties may agree and as is set forth in the Certificate of Merger.  

  1.3. _ _Effects of the Merger.__ At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the DGCL.  

  1.4. _ _Closing of the Merger.__ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and assuming satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof, other than conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied at Closing (as hereinafter defined), the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing"_ ) will take place at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time on July 1, 2006, _provided_ that (i) the Closing shall occur no later than the date of the closing under the Investment Agreement, dated as of October 24, 2005, between Banco Santander Central Hispano, S.A., a Spanish _sociedad an onima _(" _Banco Santander_ "), and Sovereign (the " _Investment Agreement"_ ) and (ii) the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to satisfy all conditions set forth in Article VIII as soon as practicable and if such conditions are satisfied prior to July 1, 2006, the parties shall cooperate in good faith to close on a date prior to July 1, 2006 mutually acceptable to the parties and as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (the date on which the Closing occurs, the " _Closing Date"_ ). The Closing shall be held at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York unless another place is agreed upon in writing by the parties. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Business Day"_  shall mean any day that is not a Saturday, a Sunday or other day on which banking organizations in the City of New York or the City of Philadelphia are required or authorized by law to be closed.   ##### 

  

  1.5. _ _Certificate of Incorporation.__ At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.  

  1.6. _ _By-laws.__ At the Effective Time, the by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.  

  1.7. _ _Board of Directors.__ The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed (as the case may be) and qualified.  

  1.8. _ _Change to Structure of Merger.__ The parties may at any time change the method of effecting the combination if and to the extent requested by any party and consented to by the other parties (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld); provided, however, that no such change shall: (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration, (ii) adversely affect the tax treatment of ICBCs stockholders as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration or the tax treatment of any party pursuant to this Agreement, or (iii) materially impede or delay completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  

  1.9. _ _Adjustment.__ If at any time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, ICBC shall pay a dividend in, subdivide, combine into a smaller number of shares or issue by reclassification of its shares, the outstanding shares of ICBC Common Stock, the Merger Consideration shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of ICBC Common Stock outstanding immediately before, and the denominator of which shall be the number of such shares outstanding immediately after, the occurrence of such event, and the resulting product shall from and after the date of such event be the Merger Consideration, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this sentence.

declared in  respect of the ICBC Common Stock with a record date prior to
the  Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. 
Following the Effective Time, upon surrender of Certificates in  accordance
with Article III, the Surviving Corporation  shall pay to the holders of
Certificates as of the Effective  Time any unpaid dividends declared in

ICBC Subsidiary (other than shares held in trust  accounts, managed accounts,
custodial or nominee accounts and  the like for the benefit of customers or

      |   (d) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per

Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, be converted  into one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of  common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving  Corporation.  
      
      |   (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the 
contrary, shares of ICBC Common Stock issued and outstanding  immediately
prior to the Effective Time held by a holder who has  the right to demand and
has properly demanded payment for and an  appraisal of such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of  the DGCL (or any successor provision) ("
_Dissenting  Shares"_ ) shall not be converted into a right to receive 
Merger Consideration, but shall have the rights set forth in  Section 262 of
the DGCL (or any successor provision) unless  such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise loses such  holders right to such payment or appraisal, if any.
If,  after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or loses  any
such right to payment or appraisal, each such share of such  holder shall be
converted as of the Effective Time into the  right to receive Merger

  (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.2(c), each share (each, a " _Restricted Share"_ ) of ICBC Common Stock granted subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to any ICBC Stock Plan (as hereinafter defined) which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest and become free of such restrictions as of the Effective Time and, at the Effective Time, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each such Restricted Share in accordance with Section 2.1.

 ARTICLE III  

 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES FOR MERGER CONSIDERATION  

  3.1. _ _Sovereign to Make Merger Consideration Available.__ Sovereign shall appoint an agent, who shall be reasonably acceptable to ICBC (the " _Exchange Agent"_ ), for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for the Merger Consideration. Prior to the Effective Time, Sovereign shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article III, an amount of cash sufficient to make all payments pursuant to Article II (such cash amount, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 3.1 shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Sovereign;  _provided_ that (a) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of shares of ICBC Common Stock and following any losses Sovereign shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of ICBC in the amount of any such losses and (b) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to or at the direction of Sovereign.  

  3.2. _ _Exchange of Shares.__ (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in no event more than five Business Days thereafter, Sovereign shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share formerly represented by such Certificate (plus any dividend amount payable as described in Section 2.1(b)), and such Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Article III, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.1 (plus any dividend amount payable as described in Section 2.1(b)).  

  (b) If the payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any applicable stock transfer or other Taxes or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable.  

  (c) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of ICBC for twelve months after the Effective Time shall be paid, at the request of Sovereign, to Sovereign. Any stockholders of ICBC who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to Sovereign for payment of the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of ICBC Common Stock held by such stockholder at the Effective Time as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of Sovereign, ICBC, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of ICBC Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of ICBC Common Stock immediately prior to such time when the amounts would, pursuant to applicable law, otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the property of Sovereign free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.   ##### 

  

  (d) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Sovereign, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Sovereign may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.  

  (e) Sovereign or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of ICBC Common Stock such amounts as Sovereign or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of any other U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly withheld by Sovereign or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the ICBC Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by Sovereign or the Exchange Agent.  

 ARTICLE IV  

 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ICBC  

  4.1. _ _Disclosure Schedule; Disclosure Standard.__ As of the date hereof, ICBC has delivered to Sovereign a schedule (the " _ICBC Disclosure Schedule"_ ) setting forth, among other things, certain items, the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in Article IV or to one or more covenants contained in Article VI. No representation or warranty of ICBC contained in this Article IV shall be deemed untrue or incorrect, and ICBC shall not be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty, or to have failed to satisfy a related condition, as a consequence of the existence or absence of any fact, circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or taken together with all other facts, circumstances or events inconsistent with that or any other representation or warranty, has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect (as hereinafter defined).  

  As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of ICBC and its Subsidiaries (as hereinafter defined) taken as a whole or a material adverse effect on ICBCs ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on a timely basis; _provided_ , _however_ , that in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, there shall be excluded any effect resulting from or attributable to (i) any change in laws, rules or regulations or published interpretations thereof by courts or governmental authorities or in generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or regulatory accounting requirements, in any such case applicable to banks, savings banks, mortgage banks, mortgage brokers, savings associations or their holding companies generally, (ii) this Agreement (including the announcement thereof) or the transactions contemplated hereby, any action of Sovereign or its Subsidiaries or any action or omission of ICBC or its Subsidiaries taken or omitted to be taken pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or with the consent or at the direction of Sovereign, (iii) changes in general economic conditions or interest rates or any other events, conditions or trends affecting banks, savings banks, mortgage banks, mortgage brokers, savings associations or their holding companies generally, or (iv) expenses and costs incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; and _provided_ , _further_ , that a decrease in the trading or market price of the ICBC Common Stock shall not be considered, by itself, to constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the ICBC Reports. None of ICBCs Subsidiaries is required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

As and to the extent described in the ICBC Reports filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, ICBC and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and as of the date hereof, ICBC has not identified any material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting.

  7.1. _ _Regulatory Matters.__ (a) ICBC shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement relating to the matters to be submitted to the ICBC stockholders at the ICBC Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement"_ ).  

  (b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, and to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger) and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third parties and Governmental Entities. ICBC and Sovereign shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to ICBC and Sovereign, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.   ##### 

  

 The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with
respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties or Governmental Entities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating
to consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

  (c) Sovereign and ICBC shall, upon request, furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Sovereign, ICBC or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each of Sovereign and ICBC will promptly correct any such information in the event it becomes materially false or misleading.  

  (d) ICBC and Sovereign shall promptly furnish each other with copies of all written communications received by ICBC and Sovereign, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries from, or delivered by any of the foregoing to, any Governmental Entity in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  

  7.2. _ _Access to Information.__ (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, ICBC shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of Sovereign access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and to its officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives, in each case in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to the operation of the business of ICBC and its Subsidiaries, and, during such period, ICBC shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to Sovereign all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Sovereign may reasonably request. In addition, during the period prior to the Effective Time, ICBC shall permit employees of Sovereign reasonable access to and participation in material discussions relating to problem Loans, Loan restructurings, Loan workouts and Derivative Contracts (other than any Derivative Contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business with Fannie Mae and PHH Mortgage), and other material asset/liability activities of ICBC and Independence Bank; _provided_ that neither Sovereign nor any Sovereign employee shall have any decision-making authority with respect to such matters. Neither ICBC nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any law, rule or regulation applicable to the institution in possession or control of such information. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.  

  (b) Sovereign shall hold all information furnished by ICBC or any of its Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to Section 7.2(a) in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated September 30, 2005, between Sovereign and ICBC (the " _Confidentiality Agreement"_ ).  

  (c) No investigation by Sovereign or its Representatives shall constitute a waiver of or otherwise affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of ICBC set forth herein.  

  7.3. _ _Stockholder Approval.__ ICBC shall call a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement (the " _ICBC Stockholders Meeting"_ ) for the purpose of obtaining the ICBC Stockholder Approval and, except as provided hereby, shall take all lawful action to solicit the adoption of this Agreement by such stockholders. The Board of Directors of ICBC shall recommend adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the stockholders of ICBC (the " _ICBC Recommendation"_ ); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Board of Directors of ICBC may (x) withdraw, modify, qualify in any manner adverse to Sovereign, condition or refuse to make such recommendation (collectively, a " _Change in ICBC Recommendation"_ ) or (y) take any other action or make any other public statement in connection with the ICBC Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation if the Board of Directors of ICBC determines, in good faith after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, that the failure to take such action would or could reasonably be expected to breach its fiduciary   ##### 

  

 obligations under applicable law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, ICBC shall not be required to hold the ICBC Stockholders Meeting if
this Agreement is terminated prior thereto. 

  

  7.4. _ _Acquisition Proposals.__ (a) ICBC agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall not authorize its or its Subsidiaries employees, agents and representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving it or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (as hereinafter defined), other than any such transaction permitted by Section 6.2, or any sale of 15% or more of the consolidated assets (including stock of its Subsidiaries) of ICBC and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any issuance or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, its voting securities that, if consummated, would result in any person (or the stockholders of such person) beneficially owning securities representing 15% or more of its total voting power (or of the surviving parent entity in such transaction) or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (any such proposal or offer (other than a proposal or offer made by Sovereign) being hereinafter referred as an " _Acquisition Proposal"_ ), (ii) have any discussions with or provide any confidential information or data to any person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal, or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt by any person to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, asset purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal or publicly propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.4(a), in the event that, prior to the date of the ICBC Stockholders Meeting, ICBC receives an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal, ICBC may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and their representatives to, prior to the ICBC Stockholders Meeting, (x) furnish or cause to be furnished confidential information or data, (y) participate in such negotiations or discussions and (z) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal if ICBCs Board of Directors concludes in good faith after consultation with its legal counsel and financial advisors that, in the case of any action described in clauses (x) or (y) above, such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined) and, in the case of any action described in clause (z) above, such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal;  _provided_ that prior to providing (or causing to be provided) any confidential information or data permitted to be provided pursuant to this sentence, ICBC shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to ICBC than the Confidentiality Agreement (provided that ICBC may enter into a confidentiality agreement without a standstill provision, or with standstill or other provisions less favorable to ICBC, if it waives or similarly modifies the corresponding provisions in the Confidentiality Agreement). The term " _Significant Subsidiary"_  shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X.  

  (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by ICBCs stockholders in accordance with this Agreement, ICBCs Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, in response to an Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in material violation of Section 7.4(a), that such proposal is a Superior Proposal, ICBC or its Board of Directors may terminate this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that ICBC shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this sentence, and any purported termination pursuant to this sentence shall be void and of no force or effect, unless ICBC prior to or concurrently with such termination pursuant to this Section 7.4(b) pays to Sovereign the fee payable pursuant to Section 9.2(b); and  _provided_ , _further_ , however, that ICBC shall not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.4(b) until after 72 hours following the provision of written notice to Sovereign advising Sovereign that ICBCs Board of Directors intends to cause ICBC to accept such Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal (it being understood that neither the delivery of such notice nor any subsequent public announcement thereof shall entitle Sovereign to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f)) and that ICBC shall, during such 72-hour period, negotiate in good faith with   ##### 

  

 Sovereign (to the extent requested by Sovereign) to make such adjustments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such Acquisition
Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal. 

  

  (c) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal"_ with respect to ICBC means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of ICBC concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and legal advisors, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, the conditions to consummation and the likelihood of consummation), is more favorable to the stockholders of ICBC from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  

  (d) ICBC will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any persons other than Sovereign with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. ICBC will promptly (within one Business Day) following the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or of any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, advise Sovereign of the material terms thereof and will keep Sovereign reasonably apprised of any material developments related thereto.  

  (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent ICBC or its board of directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (or any similar communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or from making any legally required disclosure to stockholders with regard to an Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, a communication by ICBCs board of directors pursuant to Rule 14d-9(e)(3) and any similar communication shall not be deemed to constitute a Change in ICBC Recommendation.  

  7.5. _ _Legal Conditions to Merger.__  (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Sovereign and ICBC shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other parties to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party which is required to be obtained by ICBC or Sovereign or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  

  (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Sovereign and ICBC agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, including using reasonable best efforts to lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and defend any litigation seeking to enjoin, prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeking material damages.  

  7.6. _ _Employee Benefits and Retention Bonuses__   

  (a) _ _Employee Benefits, Generally; Continuation of Compensation.__  

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) Subject to the other provisions of this  Section 7.6
set forth below, and without limiting any  additional rights that any
employees of ICBC and its  Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the  " _ICBC Employees_ ") may have under any Plan, on  and
after the Effective Time, the employee pension and welfare  benefit plans of
Sovereign and ICBC (as well as any other plan  of ICBC providing for benefits
not subject to ERISA) may, at  Sovereigns election and subject to the
requirements of the  Code, continue to be maintained separately,
consolidated, frozen  or terminated.  
      
      |   (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision  in this Agreement, Sovereign shall, or shall cause the Surviving 
Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, for the period  commencing at the  ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   Effective Time and ending at the time in calendar year 2007
that  annual compensation reviews are completed and base and incentive 
compensation levels are established for all ICBC Employees in  respect of
such calendar year (which review process and  compensation levels established
will be the same as the process  and compensation levels as provided to
similarly situated  employees of Sovereign and Sovereign Bank), to continue
to  provide rates of annual base salary or wages, as applicable, to  the
ICBC Employees that are the same as those provided to the  ICBC Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time.  
    

  (b) _ _Service Credit; Waiver of Waiting Periods, Pre-Existing Conditions; Deductibles and Co-Payments.__  With respect to each employee benefit plan maintained by Sovereign or a Subsidiary thereof in which any ICBC Employee becomes eligible to participate any time on or after the Effective Time (a " _Sovereign Plan_ "),  _other_ _than_ the Sovereign ESOP (as such term is defined below), for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, entitlement to benefits (other than for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) and vacation entitlement, service with ICBC or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of ICBC or any of its Subsidiaries) shall be treated as service with Sovereign;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Such service also shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of any pre-existing condition limitations with respect to any Sovereign Plan. Each Sovereign Plan shall waive pre-existing condition limitations to the same extent waived under the applicable ICBC Plan. ICBC Employees shall be given full credit for amounts paid under a corresponding ICBC or any Subsidiary benefit plan for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Sovereign Plan during the applicable plan year in which the Closing Date occurs.  

  (c) In addition to the foregoing, actions shall be taken by the relevant parties hereto to provide for the following: 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) _ _Sovereign Employee Stock Ownership Plan 
Provisions of the Sovereign Retirement Plan ("Sovereign  ESOP").__ All ICBC
Employees shall become entitled to  participate in the Sovereign ESOP in
accordance with its terms  by treating them as newly employed individuals
without any prior  service credit under such plan. ICBC Employees will not
receive  credit for service with ICBC or a Subsidiary of ICBC for  purposes
of eligibility to participate or for vesting purposes  under the Sovereign
ESOP.  
      
      |   (ii) _ _Sovereign 401(k) Provisions of the Sovereign 
Retirement Plan ("Sovereign 401(k) Plan").__   Each ICBC Employee shall
commence participation in the Sovereign  401(k) Plan in accordance with its
terms, as soon as  administratively feasible following the Effective Time,
upon  completion by such ICBC Employee of six (6) months of  service with
any combination of ICBC or a Subsidiary of ICBC (or  any predecessor of ICBC
or any of its Subsidiaries), Sovereign,  or a Subsidiary of Sovereign
(whether or not such service  commenced before the Effective Time).  
      
      |   (iii) _ _ICBC 401(k) Savings Plan ("ICBC 401(k) 
Plan").__ After the Effective Time, Sovereign shall  amend the ICBC 401(k)
Plan to freeze participation and  contributions under such plan. After the
Effective Time,  Sovereign will continue to maintain the individual
participant  accounts under ICBCs 401(k) Plan. Thereafter, Sovereign  shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to combine the  ICBC 401(k) Plan and
the Sovereign 401(k) Plan on such terms as  it deems appropriate and in
accordance with applicable law.  
      
      |   (iv) _ _ICBC Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ICBC

to its terms. As soon as practicable  following the Effective Time, Sovereign
shall cause the  Surviving Corporation to file all necessary documents with
the  Internal Revenue Service for a favorable determination letter in 
respect of such termination of the ICBC ESOP. As soon as  practicable after
the receipt of a favorable determination  letter for termination from
Internal Revenue Service, the  account balances in the ICBC ESOP, including
any surplus in the  suspense account after full payment of the ESOP loan and
all  ICBC ESOP administrative expenses, shall be distributed to 
participants and beneficiaries in accordance with applicable law  and the

Plans.__ Effective as of the Effective Time, ICBC will  freeze future
participation and benefit accruals under those  certain nonqualified deferred
compensation Plans set forth on  Section 7.6(c)(v) of the ICBC Disclosure
Schedule (the  " _NDC Plans_ "). The freezing of participation and  benefit
accruals under such NDC Plans shall be effected in such  a manner that no
person receives redundant benefits, loses  existing benefits, or results in
an acceleration of payment of  benefits unless a participants prior election
form so  provides. The parties hereto agree that the intent of the 
preceding sentence is that affected ICBC Employees generally  shall be
entitled only to the benefits accrued under such NDC  Plans as of the
Effective Time.  
      
      |   (vi) _ _Welfare Benefit Plans.__ (I) For the  period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending at the close  of business on
December 31, 2006, Sovereign shall, or shall  cause the Surviving Corporation
to, continue to provide welfare  benefits to the ICBC Employees pursuant to
the applicable Plans  that are the same as those provided to such ICBC
Employees  immediately prior to the Effective Time and (II) effective  as of

employees elected to so enroll during the  regular enrollment period for such
plans) in the same welfare  Sovereign Plans (as such term is defined below)
as shall be  provided to similarly situated employees of Sovereign and 
Sovereign Bank.

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (A) _ _Payment of 2005 Annual Bonuses.__ If the

Bonuses_ ")  pursuant to the terms of the applicable annual bonus Plans 
identified in Section 4.12(a) of the ICBC Disclosure  Schedule (the " _Annual
Bonus Plans_ "), ICBC shall  be entitled to pay the 2005 Annual Bonuses in
such amounts as  may be determined in a manner consistent with past
practice  under similar historic annual bonus programs; provided, however, 
that aggregate payment of all 2005 Annual Bonuses shall not  exceed the
amount set forth in Section 7.6(c)(vii)(A) of  the ICBC Disclosure Schedule.
If as of the Effective Time, the  2005 Annual Bonuses have not yet been paid,
ICBC and/or  Independence Bank shall, immediately prior to the Effective

subject to the aggregate limitation as set forth  above in this Section
7.6(c)(vii)(A).

Effective Time occurs after January 1, 2006, on or  immediately prior to the
Effective Time, ICBC shall (or, if  applicable, Sovereign shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to)  pay a pro rated portion (based on the number of
days occurring  in 2006 relative to 365) of the target annual bonuses payable

on December 31, 2006 under the Annual Bonus  Plans (which annual bonus
amounts will have been accrued on the  financial statements of ICBC and/or
applicable ICBC Subsidiaries  through such payment date in a manner
consistent with the with  the past practice under similar historic annual
bonus programs).

shall cause the Surviving  Corporation to, continue to maintain, without
change other than  changes required by law, the tax-qualified defined

participated in such Plan immediately prior to the Effective  Time;
_provided_ that this covenant shall only be effective  if, on or before the
Effective Time, ICBC can provide evidence,  reasonably satisfactory to
Sovereign, that the ICBC Employees  Retirement Plan has satisfied the
requirements of  Section 410(b) of the Code for the plan year ending 
December 31, 2005 and for the period beginning  January 1, 2006 and ending
immediately prior to the  Effective Time.

  7.7. _ _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance.__ (a) From and after the Effective Time, in the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer, employee or agent of ICBC or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties"_ ) is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of ICBC, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or was prior to the Effective Time serving at the request of any such party as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, trust or other enterprise or (ii) this Agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and all actions taken by an Indemnified Party in connection herewith, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, Sovereign shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by law upon receipt of an undertaking, to the extent required by the DGCL, from such Indemnified Party to repay such advanced expenses if it is determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification hereunder), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.  

  (b) Sovereign shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section 7.7 to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.  

  (c) Without limiting anything contained in Section 7.7(a) or any other provision of this Agreement, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (i) the Indemnified Parties will be provided with indemnification from and after the Effective Time that is no less favorable to their rights to indemnification presently set forth in the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or equivalent documents of ICBC or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, in each case as in effect on the date hereof, and (ii) Sovereign shall honor and perform under all indemnification agreements entered into by ICBC or any of its Subsidiaries.  

  (d) Sovereign shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the persons covered by ICBCs directors and officers liability insurance policy immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date by the directors and officers liability insurance policy or policies maintained by Sovereign with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, _provided_  that Sovereigns policy or policies provide at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous to such directors and officers of ICBC than the terms and conditions of the existing directors and officers liability insurance policy of ICBC. Sovereign will not be required to expend, in respect of its obligations to such covered persons as described in the preceding sentence, in any one year an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by ICBC for the insurance covering the officers and directors of ICBC (the " _Insurance Amount"_ ),  _provided_ , that if such expenditure would exceed the Insurance Amount, Sovereign shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount. The provisions of this Section 7.7(d) shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained by ICBC prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide the persons covered by ICBCs directors and officers liability insurance policy immediately prior to the Effective Time with coverage for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ such prepaid policies shall not be obtained by ICBC at a cost per annum that is higher than the Insurance Amount. If such prepaid policies have been obtained by ICBC prior to the Effective Time, Sovereign shall maintain such policies in full force and effect and continue to honor ICBCs obligations thereunder.  

  (e) The provisions of this Section 7.7 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.   ##### 

  

  (f) If Sovereign or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Sovereign shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.7.  

  7.8. _ _Advice of Changes.__ Sovereign and ICBC shall promptly advise the other party of any change or event (i) which, individually or in the aggregate with other such changes or events, has or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (in the case of ICBC) or a material adverse effect on its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on a timely basis (in the case of Sovereign) or (ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause a condition to Closing not to be satisfied or satisfaction thereof to be materially delayed;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any noncompliance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.8 shall not constitute failure of a condition set forth in Article VIII or give rise to any right of termination under Article IX unless the underlying change or event shall independently constitute such a failure or give rise to such a right.  

  7.9. _ _Actions Relating to Investment Agreement.__ Sovereign shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, (i) take any action that would require any vote of the stockholders of Sovereign to be taken prior to the Effective Time with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Investment Agreement or (ii) seek any vote of its stockholders prior to the Effective Time with respect to any of the transactions or matters contemplated by this Agreement or the Investment Agreement.

Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of ICBC; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by such stockholders without such further approval.

  10.4. _ _Interpretation__. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and Section references are to this Agreement unless otherwise specified. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to require ICBC, Sovereign or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates to take any action which would violate or conflict with any applicable law (whether statutory or common), rule or regulation.  

  10.5. _ _Counterparts__. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.  

  10.6. _ _Entire Agreement__. This Agreement (together with the documents and the instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.  

  10.7. _ _Governing Law__. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to choice of law principles thereof).   ##### 

  

  10.8. _ _Severability__. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, and if any provision of this Agreement is determined to be so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, in all cases so long as neither the economic nor legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or its stockholders. Upon any such determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the original intent of the parties.  

  10.9. _ _Publicity__. Sovereign and ICBC shall consult with each other before issuing any press release with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and neither Sovereign (or any of its Subsidiaries) nor ICBC (or any of its Subsidiaries) shall issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Sovereign or ICBC may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances) issue such press release or make such public statement as may upon the advice of outside counsel be required by law or the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (in the case of such a release or statement by Sovereign) or the Nasdaq National Market (in the case of such a release or statement by ICBC) or as may be permitted pursuant to Section 7.3 or 7.4. Without limiting the reach of the preceding sentence, Sovereign and ICBC shall cooperate to develop all public announcement materials and shall make appropriate management available at presentations related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as reasonably requested by the other party.  

  10.10. _ _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries__. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of any party hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as otherwise expressly provided for herein (including Section 7.7 hereof), this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.  

  10.11. _ _Specific Performance; Jurisdiction__. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware and (iv) consents to service being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 10.3. Each of Sovereign, Merger Sub and ICBC hereby agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective addresses set forth in Section 10.3 shall be effective service of process for any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.  

  10.12. _ _Guarantee by Sovereign__. Sovereign agrees to take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to perform all of its respective agreements, covenants and obligations under this Agreement. Sovereign unconditionally guarantees to ICBC the full and complete performance by Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, of its respective obligations under this Agreement and shall be liable for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Merger Sub or the   ##### 

  

 Surviving Corporation, as applicable, under this Agreement. This is a
guarantee of payment and performance and not collectability. Sovereign hereby
waives diligence, presentment, demand of performance, filing of any claim,
any right to require any proceeding first against Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, protest, notice and all
demands whatsoever in connection with the performance of its obligations set
forth in this Section 10.12. 

  

  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Sovereign, Merger Sub and ICBC have caused this Agreement to be executed by their respective officers hereunto duly authorized as of the date first above written.
