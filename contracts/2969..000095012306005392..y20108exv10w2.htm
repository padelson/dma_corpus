independent accountants ("Buyers Accountants"), shall be less than the
lesser of (A) the Target Net Working Capital and (B) the Estimated Net
Working Capital; or the Purchase Price shall be increased on a dollar-for-
dollar basis to the extent that the Closing Date Net Working Capital, as
determined by Buyers Accountants, shall be more than the greater of (A) the
Target Net Working Capital and (B) the Estimated Net Working Capital. Buyer
shall cause Buyers Accountants to perform the Net Working Capital Valuation
within 30 days after the Closing Date. Within 10 days after the completion of
the Net Working Capital Valuation, Buyer shall give the Stockholders
Representatives notice (the "Working Capital Notice") of the results of the
Net Working Capital Valuation and whether such results provide for any
increase or decrease in the Purchase Price. In the event that the Working
Capital Notice reflects an increase or decrease in the Purchase Price, then,
within 20 days of receipt of the Working Capital Notice, or, in the
alternative, within 20 days of the final resolution of any dispute of the Net
Working Capital Valuation, the Stockholders shall pay to Buyer an amount
equal to the amount by which the Closing Date Net Working Capital is less than
the lesser of (A) the Target Net Working Capital and (B) the Estimated Net
Working Capital or Buyer shall pay to the Stockholders an amount equal to the

During the 20 days after the day on which any Dispute Notice is given, the Stockholders Representatives and Buyer shall attempt to resolve such dispute in good faith. If they fail to reach a written agreement regarding the dispute, the Stockholders Representatives shall refer the matter to a firm of certified independent accountants (the "Stockholders Accountants") that is different from the firm that initially prepared the Net Working Capital Valuation, and request the Stockholders Accountants to also determine the Closing Date Net Working Capital (the "Second Working Capital Valuation"). Buyer shall be entitled to have its independent accountants or other representatives observe the Second Working Capital Valuation. The Stockholders Representatives shall give Buyer prompt notice of the results of the Second Working Capital Valuation. If Buyer and the Stockholders Representatives are unable to agree upon the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the amounts remaining in dispute shall be submitted to a third independent accounting firm of national reputation mutually agreeable to Buyer and Stockholders Representatives for resolution (the "Third Accounting Firm"), which firm shall, within 30 days after such submission, determine and report to Buyer and Stockholders Representatives upon such remaining disputed amounts, and such report shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties hereto. The fees and disbursements of the Third Accounting Firm shall be allocated among Buyer and the Stockholders so that Stockholders share of such fees and disbursements shall be in   ##### 

  

  

  

the same proportion that the aggregate amount of such remaining disputed
amounts so submitted to the Third Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully
disputed by Stockholders Representatives (as finally determined by the Third
Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such remaining disputed amounts
so submitted to the Third Accounting Firm. Stockholders shall pay the
fees portion of the fees and expenses of the Third Accounting Firm for which
they are responsible, as well as the fees and expenses of Stockholders
Accountants, in connection with this Section 2.5(b). The resolution procedure
set forth in this Section 2.5(b), including the standard for paying costs, is

hereunder shall be adjusted by all prior payments made under this Section
2.7. Stockholders calculation(s) of the Recomputed Aggregate Income Tax
Liability and the Recomputed Income Tax Benefits shall be final, binding, and

 4.20 _ERISA_. 

  

 (a) Schedule 4.20 contains a complete list of all Benefit Plans that are sponsored or maintained by any Company Group Member or ERISA Affiliate or under which any Company Group Member is obligated (each, a "Company Benefit Plan"). The Company Group Members have delivered to Buyer (i) accurate and complete copies of all Company Benefit Plan documents and all other material documents relating thereto, including (if applicable) all summary plan descriptions, summaries of material modification, trust agreements, summary annual reports and insurance policies or contracts, (ii) accurate and complete detailed summaries of all unwritten Company Benefit Plans and any funding arrangements therefor, (iii) accurate and complete copies of the most recent financial statements and actuarial reports with respect to all Company Benefit Plans for which financial statements or actuarial reports are required or have been prepared, and (iv) accurate and complete copies of all annual reports for all Company Benefit Plans (for which annual reports are required) prepared within the last three years and all other filings required by ERISA or the Code. Each Company Benefit Plan providing benefits that are funded through a policy of insurance is indicated by the word "insured" placed by the listing of the Benefit Plan in Schedule 4.20. 

   

 (b) All Company Benefit Plans conform (and at all times have conformed), and are being administered and operated (and have at all time been administered and operated) in compliance with, the requirements of ERISA, the Code and 

    ##### 

  

    

all other applicable Laws, including without limitation the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990, the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993 and the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. All material returns,
reports and disclosure statements required to be made under ERISA and the
Code with respect to all Company Benefit Plans have been timely filed or
delivered. There have not been any "prohibited transactions," as such term is
defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA involving any of
the Company Benefit Plans and any Company Group Member officer, director or
employee, or to the knowledge of the Company, involving any other party, that
could subject any Company Group Member to any material penalty or tax imposed
under the Code or ERISA. 

   

 (c) Except as is set forth in Schedule 4.20, any Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be so qualified (or is a prototype plan subject to an opinion letter that may be relied on) or an application for such determination is pending. Any such determination that has been obtained remains in effect and has not been revoked, and with respect to any application that is pending, the Company Group Members have no reason to suspect that such application for determination will be denied. Nothing has occurred since the date of any such determination that is reasonably likely to affect adversely such qualification or exemption, or result in the imposition of excise taxes or income taxes on unrelated business income under the Code or ERISA with respect to any such Company Benefit Plan. 

   

 (d) No Company Group Member now sponsors or has ever sponsored any defined benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or has ever contributed to any multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), nor does any Company Group Member have a current or contingent obligation to contribute to any multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA). No Company Group Member has any liability with respect to any employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) other than in accordance with the terms of the Company Benefit Plans. 

   

 (e) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, any threatened claims by or on behalf of any Company Benefit Plans, or by or on behalf of any individual participants or beneficiaries of any such Benefit Plans, alleging any breach of fiduciary duty on the part of any Company Group Member or any of its officers, directors or employees under ERISA or any other applicable Law, relating to the Company Benefit Plans, nor is there, to the knowledge of the Company, any basis for such claim. The Company Benefit Plans are not the subject of any pending (or to the knowledge of the Company, any threatened) investigation or audit by the Internal Revenue Service or the Department of Labor. 

   

 (f) Each Company Group Member and ERISA Affiliate has timely made all required contributions under the Company Benefit Plans. 

   

 (g) With respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA) (a "Welfare Plan") 

    ##### 

  

    

and except as specified in Schedule 4.20, (i) each Welfare Plan for which
contributions are claimed by any Company Group Member as deductions under any
provision of the Code complies with all applicable requirements pertaining to
such deduction, (ii) with respect to any welfare benefit fund (within the
meaning of Section 419 of the Code) related to a Welfare Plan, there is no
disqualified benefit (within the meaning of Section 4976(b) of the Code) that
would result in the imposition of a tax under Section 4976(a) of the Code,
(iii) any Benefit Plan that is a group health plan (within the meaning of
Section 4980B(g)(2) of the Code) complies, and in each and every case has
complied, with all of the applicable requirements of Section 4980B of the
Code, ERISA, Title XXII of the Public Health Service Act and the Social
Security Act, and (iv) all Welfare Plans may be amended or terminated by the
Buyer at any time on or after the Closing Date. Except as specified in
Schedule 4.20, no Company Benefit Plan provides any health, life or other
welfare coverage to employees of Company Group Member beyond termination of
their employment with any Company Group Member by reason of retirement or
otherwise, other than coverage as may be required under Section 4980B of the
Code or Part 6 of ERISA, or under the continuation of coverage or conversion
provisions of the Laws of any state or locality. 

   

 (h) Except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 4.20, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions will (i) result in any payment to be made by an Affiliate of any Company Group Member (including severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute (as defined in Code Section 280G or otherwise)) becoming due to any employee or former employee, officer or director, or (ii) increase or vest any benefits payable under any Benefit Plan. 

   

 (i) Except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 4.20, any amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of any of the Transactions by any employee, officer or director of Company Group Member who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any employment, severance or termination agreement, other compensation arrangement or Benefit Plan currently in effect would not be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280(b)(1) of the Code). 

   

 4.21 _Corporate Records_. The books of account, minute books, stock record books and other records of each Company Group Member, all of which have been made available to Buyer, contain complete, correct and current copies of its Charter Documents and of all minutes of formal meetings, resolutions and other proceedings of its stockholders, Board of Directors and committees of such Board of Directors, and have been maintained in the ordinary course of business, and in accordance with sound business practices, and no formal meeting of any such stockholders, Board of Directors, or committee has been held for which minutes have not been prepared and are not contained in such minute books. At the Closing, all of those original books and records will be in the possession of the Company Group Members. 

  

 4.22 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.22 or as contemplated by this Agreement, the Business has been conducted in the ordinary course

the respective customers that were, in the aggregate, the 20 largest

4.24 also specifies for each year of the three years ending December 31, 2003,
2004 and 2005, the names of the respective suppliers that were, in the
aggregate, the 20 largest suppliers in terms of dollar value of products or

such representations and warranties shall be made only as of such particular
date) as follows:

 5.3 _Consents and Approvals_. Except for compliance with the HSR Act, neither the execution and delivery by Buyer of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, nor the performance of the Transactions performed or to be performed by Buyer, require any filing, consent or approval, constitute a Default or cause any payment obligation to arise under (a) any Law or Court Order to which Buyer is subject, (b) the Charter Documents or bylaws of Buyer or (c) any Contract, Governmental Permit or other document to which Buyer is a party or by which the material properties or other material assets of Buyer may be bound. 

  

 5.4 _Investment Intent._ The Closing Shares are being acquired by Buyer for investment only and not with the view to resale or other distribution. Buyer acknowledges that such securities have not been registered under the Securities Act or any applicable state securities (or "blue sky") Laws and, therefore, cannot be resold unless so registered or exempted from such registration.

Tax Return, with such materiality determined prior to such election or change.

Upon notice to the Stockholders specifying in reasonable detail the basis thereof, Buyer may seek indemnification to which it may be entitled under this Section 10 against the Escrow Funds by filing a claim with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and complying with the resolution procedure identified in such Escrow Agreement. The failure to give a notice of a Claim under the Escrow Agreement will not constitute an election of remedies or limit Buyer in any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it. 

  

 10.4 _Procedure for Claims_. 

  

 (a) Any Person who desires to seek indemnification under any part of this Section 10 (each, an "Indemnified Party") shall give written notice in reasonable detail (a "Claim Notice") to each Party responsible or alleged to be responsible for indemnification hereunder (an "Indemnitor") and the Escrow Agent prior to any applicable Expiration Date (as defined in Section 10.5). Such notice shall briefly explain the nature of the claim and the parties known to be involved, and shall specify the amount thereof. If the matter to which a claim relates shall not have been resolved as of the date of the Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party shall estimate the amount of the claim in the Claim Notice, but also specify therein that the claim has not yet been liquidated (an "Unliquidated Claim"). If an Indemnified Party gives a Claim Notice for an Unliquidated Claim, the Indemnified Party shall also give a second Claim Notice (the "Liquidated Claim Notice") within 60 days after the matter giving rise to the claim becomes finally resolved, and the Second Claim Notice shall specify the amount of the claim. Each Indemnitor to which a Claim Notice is given shall respond to any Indemnified Party that has given a Claim Notice (a "Claim Response") within 30 days (the "Response Period") after the later of (i) the date that the Claim Notice is given or (ii) if a Claim Notice is first given with respect to an Unliquidated Claim, the date on which the Liquidated Claim Notice is given. Any Claim Response shall specify whether or not the Indemnitor giving the Claim Response disputes the claim described in the Claim Notice. If any Indemnitor fails to give a Claim Response within the Response Period, such Indemnitor shall be deemed not to dispute the claim described in the related Claim Notice. If any Indemnitor elects not to dispute a claim described in a Claim Notice, whether by failing to give a timely Claim Response in accordance with the terms hereof or otherwise, then the 

   ##### 

  

    

amount of such claim shall be conclusively deemed to be an obligation of such
Indemnitor. 

  

 (b) If any Indemnitor shall be obligated to indemnify an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 10, such Indemnitor shall pay to such Indemnified Party the amount to which such Indemnified Party shall be entitled within 15 Business Days after the day on which such Indemnitor became so obligated to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party shall be an Indemnified Buyer Party, it shall first seek payment of the Damages to which it is entitled under this Section 10 from the Escrow Funds, but only to the extent that the Escrow Funds are not subject to other claims for indemnification; thereafter, if the amount of the Escrow Funds available for payment of Damages is less than the amount of Damages to which such Indemnified Buyer Party is entitled, such Indemnified Buyer Party shall seek indemnification directly from the Stockholders. If any Indemnitor fails to pay all or part of any indemnification obligation when due, then such Indemnitor shall also be obligated to pay to the applicable Indemnified Party interest on the unpaid amount for each day during which the obligation remains unpaid at an annual rate equal to LIBOR plus 3% (three percent). 

   

 (c) If, during the Response Period, an Indemnified Party receives a Claim Response from the Indemnitor, then for a period of 45 days (the "Resolution Period") after the Indemnified Partys receipt of such Claim Response, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall endeavor to resolve any dispute arising therefrom. If such dispute is resolved by the parties during the Resolution Period, the amount that the parties have specified as the amount to be paid by the Indemnitor, if any, as settlement for such dispute shall be conclusively deemed to be an obligation of such Indemnitor. If the parties are unable agree upon a resolution to such dispute prior to the expiration of the Resolution Period (or any extension thereto to which the Indemnitor and Indemnified Party agree in writing), the issue shall be resolved in accordance with Section 13.2 hereof. 

   

 (d) If the Indemnified Party is an Indemnified Buyer Party and, pursuant to Section 10.4(b), such Indemnified Buyer Party is obligated to seek any portion of the funds to which such Indemnified Buyer Party is entitled from the Escrow Funds, then, within two Business Days from the date on which such Indemnified Buyer Party became entitled to such funds, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall provide written instructions to Escrow Agent as to (i) the amount of funds, if any, to be dispersed from the Escrow Funds, and (ii) instructions as to the manner in which such funds shall be dispersed to the Indemnified Buyer Party. 

   

 (e) No Party will have any liability (for indemnification or otherwise) for any Damages for punitive, exemplary or special damages of any nature, except to the extent such punitive, exemplary or special damages are awarded to a third party against an Indemnified Party in circumstances in which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 10, except as provided below in this subparagraph (f), the Indemnified Buyer Party, on the one hand, 

   ##### 

  

    

and the Indemnified Seller Parties on the other hand, shall be entitled to
indemnification hereunder by Seller Parties or by Buyer, respectively, only
when the aggregate of all Damages to such Indemnified Buyer Parties exceeds
*** (the "Deductible Amount") and then only to the extent of such excess
amount; provided, however, that the Deductible Amount shall not apply
with respect to (i) a breach of Seller Parties representations or warranties
under Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.14 or 4.26 or in the related provisions of
the Closing Certificates, a breach of Buyers representations or warranties
under Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.5 or 5.6, or a breach of any representations
or warranty of a Party to this Agreement made with an intent to mislead or
defraud, (ii) a breach of any covenants hereunder or (iii) a claim for
indemnification under Section 10.1.2(C). In addition, the calculation of the
Deductible Amount shall include any Damages incurred by an Indemnified Party
for which the Indemnified Party would have been entitled to
claim indemnification under this Section 10 with respect to a breach of a
representation or warranty but for such Claim being excluded as a result of
the qualification of such representation or warranty by materiality or
similar qualifications or exceptions. The maximum amount of Damages for
which the Stockholders or Buyer, respectively, shall be liable under this
Agreement shall be limited to the following (the "Indemnification Cap"): 

   

 (w) as to any claim for which a Claim Notice is given on or before the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date  ***; 

   

 (x) as to any claim for which a Claim Notice is given with respect to Section 10.1(c) after the 18-month anniversary, but on or before the third anniversary, of the Closing Date  ***; 

   

 (y) as to any claim for which a Claim Notice is given with respect to Section 10.1(b) after the 18-month anniversary, but on or before the 24-month anniversary, of the Closing Date  ***; and 

   

 (z) as to any claim for which a Claim Notice is given with respect to Section 10.1(b) after the 24-month anniversary, but on or before the fifth anniversary, of the Closing Date  ***; 

 

provided, however, the foregoing limitations of the Indemnification Cap shall
not apply to (a) any breach of the Seller Parties representations or
warranties under Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.13, 4.14, or 4.26 or in the
related provisions of the Closing Certificates, (b) a breach of
any representations or warranty of a Party to this Agreement made with an
intent to mislead or defraud, (c) a breach of any of the parties covenants

 (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 10, the Stockholders shall not have an obligation to indemnify or hold harmless the Indemnified Buyer Parties or any other obligation with respect to (i) any Environmental Liability (including any Environmental Liability arising out of the discovery of any environmental matter or condition) that is first discovered as a result of any Unreasonable Action by or on behalf of Buyer; (ii) that portion of any Damages or Environmental Liability that arises from any act or omission by Buyer or any other person or entity after the Closing that exacerbates any Environmental Liability, including any environmental matter or condition, in existence on or before Closing; and (iii) any Remedial Action except to the extent such Remedial Action is required under applicable Environmental Law or by the relevant Governmental Entity. 

   

 (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 10, with respect to matters which are subject to the indemnification provisions of Section 10.1(b), 

    

 (i) Buyer shall be entitled to control any Remedial Action (including Cleanup), any Legal Proceeding relating to an Environmental Claim and, any other Legal Proceeding; 

   

 (ii) with respect to the pending request to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (the "WDNR") for closure of the environmental condition referenced on Schedule 4.15(b) (the "Referenced Condition"), in the event the WDNR requires additional Remedial Action of the Referenced Condition as a condition of closure, the costs associated with such Remedial Actions, including, but not limited to, the costs of monitoring well closures, shall be borne by the Stockholders without being subject to the Deductible Amount; 

   

 (iii) Buyer shall pursue the request for closure of the Referenced Condition with the WDNR and shall close all associated monitoring wells reasonably promptly upon receipt of authorization from the WDNR to do so; 

   

 (iv) all Remedial Actions shall be performed in a commercially reasonable manner and in a manner consistent with applicable Environmental Laws. All Remedial Actions shall be performed in a manner employing the most cost-effective means available that is acceptable to the relevant Governmental Entity, including the use of Impositions where such does not unreasonably impair or impede Buyers use of the Real Property as a chemical manufacturing or chemical research and development facility. Remedial Actions shall be deemed to be complete when (A) Buyer provides written confirmation to the Stockholders Representative that the Remedial Action has been completed, which confirmation shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, or (B) upon issuance of a No Further Action Determination; 

   ##### 

  

   

 (v) Buyer shall keep the Stockholders Representative apprised of the progress and performance of all Remedial Actions, including, without limitation, providing the Stockholders Representative with copies of any and all testing results, reports, agency notices, correspondence to or from any Governmental Entity and other material documents related to any Environmental Liability or Remedial Actions; and 

   

 (vi) The Stockholders may retain, at the Stockholders expense, any environmental consultant(s) as they select, in their sole discretion ("Stockholders Consultants"), to consult with Buyer, Buyers consultants and any Governmental Entity with respect to Remedial Actions. The Stockholders Representative and Stockholders Consultants, if retained, shall not assume the control of or responsibility for any Remedial Actions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly agreed that, to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances, the Stockholders Representative shall have the right (and shall be provided a reasonable opportunity) to review and comment upon any document(s) to be submitted to a Governmental Entity which relate in any way to any Remedial Actions To the extent reasonably possible in the circumstances, Buyer shall give the Stockholders Representative prompt written notice of, and the Stockholders Representative and/or the Stockholders Representatives representative(s) shall have the right to participate in, any phone call or meeting with any Governmental Entity at which any Remedial Action is to be substantively discussed or addressed. 

  

 (i) Whenever there is an event, condition or a circumstance (a "Possible Breach") the subject matter of which is covered by more than one of the representations and warranties contained in Section 4 or Section 5 (the "Applicable Representations") and one or more of such representations (the "Specifically Applicable Representations") more specifically relate to the subject matter of the Possible Breach, then if such Possible Breach would cause a breach of any Specifically Applicable Representations, the fact that a breach may have occurred with respect to any of the more general Applicable Representations shall not affect an Indemnified Partys ability to claim a breach of the Specifically Applicable Representations. 

   

 10.5 _Claims Period_. Any claim for indemnification under this Agreement shall be made by giving a Claim Notice under Section 10.4 on or before the applicable "Expiration Date" specified below in this Section 10.5, or the claim under this Section 10 shall be invalid. The following claims shall have the following respective "Expiration Dates": (a) eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date - any claims that are not specified in any of the succeeding clauses; (b) the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date  any claims for indemnification under Section 10.1(c); (c) the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date  any claims for indemnification under Section 10.1(b), (d) the date on which the applicable statute of limitations expires plus thirty (30) days  any claim for Damages related to (i) a breach of any covenant or agreement, (ii) a breach of the Seller Parties representations or warranties under Sections 4.13 or 4.26, a breach of Buyers representations or warranties under Section 5.6, or a breach of any representations or warranties of a Party to this Agreement that were made with an intent to mislead or defraud, or (iii) any claims for indemnification under Section 10.1.2, and 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) in perpetuity  a breach of the Seller Parties representations or warranties under Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 or a breach of Buyers representations or warranties under Sections 5.1 or 5.2. If more than one of such Expiration Dates applies to a particular claim, the latest of such Expiration Dates shall be the controlling Expiration Date for such claim. So long as an Indemnified Party gives a Claim Notice for an Unliquidated Claim on or before the applicable Expiration Date, such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to pursue its rights to indemnification regardless of the date on which such Indemnified Party gives the related Liquidated Claim Notice. 

  

 10.6 _Third Party Claims_. An Indemnified Party that desires to seek indemnification under any part of this Section 10 with respect to any actions, suits or other administrative or judicial proceedings (each, an "Action") that may be instituted by a third party shall give each Indemnitor prompt notice of a third partys institution of such Action. After such notice, any Indemnitor may, or if so requested by such Indemnified Party, any Indemnitor shall, participate in such Action or assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such Indemnified Party; provided, however, that such Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate at its own expense in the defense of such Action; and provided, further, that no Party shall consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement, except with the written consent of the Indemnitor or the Indemnified Party, as applicable (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). Any failure to give prompt notice under this Section 10.6 shall not bar an Indemnified Partys right to claim indemnification under this Section 10, except to the extent that an Indemnitor shall have been harmed by such failure. 

  

 10.7 _Effect of Investigation or Knowledge_. Any claim by Buyer for indemnification shall not be adversely affected by any investigation by or opportunity to investigate afforded to Buyer, nor shall such a claim be adversely affected by Buyers knowledge on or before the Closing Date of any breach of the type specified in the first sentence of Section 10.1 or of any state of facts that may give rise to such a breach. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not adversely affect the right to indemnification, payment of Damages or other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants or obligations. 

  

10.8 _General Rules on Payments by Stockholders_  

  

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, except
as specifically provided in this Section 10.8, the obligation of each
Stockholder with respect to the payment of any amount to any Indemnified
Buyer Party for any matter subject to this Section 10 shall be several in
proportion to such Stockholders respective Indemnification Share and not
joint. *** shall be jointly and severally liable for all Stockholders with
respect to (i) any obligation to pay any amount under Section 2.5, (ii) any
obligation to pay any amount under Sections 2.6 and 2.7 and (iii) all Escrow
Funds. Further, (v) *** shall be jointly and severally liable for all
Stockholders with respect to all indemnification obligations under Section
10.1(c) as to any claim for which 

   ##### 

  

  

  

a Claim Notice is given on or before the 18-month anniversary of the Closing
Date, (w) *** jointly and severally, shall be solely liable for all
Stockholders with respect to all indemnification obligations under Section
10.1(c) as to any claim for which a Claim Notice is given after the 18-month
anniversary, but on or before the 24-month anniversary, of the Closing Date,
(x) *** shall be jointly and severally liable for each such Stockholders
Indemnification Share with respect to all indemnification obligations under
this Agreement, (y) *** shall be jointly and severally liable for each such
Stockholders Indemnification Share with respect to all indemnification
obligations under this Agreement, and (z) *** shall be jointly and severally
liable for each such Stockholders Indemnification Share and
the Indemnification Share of *** with respect to all indemnification
obligations under this Agreement. Except as expressly provided in this
Section 10.8, nothing herein shall be deemed to restrict any Indemnified Buyer
Party from exercising all rights and remedies against any Stockholder with
respect to the payment of any amounts concurrently or in such order as the
Indemnified Buyer Party shall elect, in its sole and absolute discretion. 

   

 10.9 _Stockholder s Representative_. 

  

 (a) *** shall act as the Stockholders representative (the "Stockholders Representative") and as exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of any Stockholder with respect to any and all matters, claims, controversies, or disputes arising out of the terms of this Agreement. The Stockholders Representative shall have the power to take any and all actions which the Stockholders Representative believes are necessary or appropriate or in the best interests of the Stockholders, as fully as if each such Stockholder was acting on its, his or her own behalf with respect to all matters concerning the Stockholders or any of them following the Closing Date, including for the purpose of administering the Escrow Agreement, settling on behalf of the Stockholders any indemnification claims made by any Indemnified Buyer Party under Section 10, representing the Stockholders in connection with the determination of the Net Working Capital Valuation under Section 2.5, and taking any other action that is specifically delegated to the Stockholders Representative hereunder. An Indemnified Buyer Party shall give notice under this Section 10.9 of any claim for indemnification against the Stockholders to the Stockholders and the Stockholders Representative, and only the Stockholders Representative shall be empowered, following such notice, to respond to or take any other action on behalf of the Stockholders with respect to the claim. The Stockholders shall be bound by any and all actions taken on their behalf by the Stockholders Representative in accordance with this Agreement, and in particular, the Stockholders shall be bound by the Escrow Agreement being executed by the Stockholders Representative to the same extent as if they were signatories thereto. The Stockholders Representative is expressly authorized to execute, deliver and perform the Escrow Agreement.  ##### 

  

     

 (b) The authority granted hereunder is deemed to be coupled with an interest. Buyer shall have the right to rely on any actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Stockholders Representative as being the act or omission of any Stockholder, without the need for any inquiry, and any such actions or omissions shall be binding upon each Stockholder, and shall not be liable in any manner whatsoever for any action taken or not taken in reliance upon the actions taken or not taken or communications or writings given or executed by the Stockholders Representative. Except as specifically contemplated by the Escrow Agreement, Buyer shall be entitled to disregard any notices or communications given or made by the Stockholders unless given or made through the Stockholders Representative. 

   

 (c) In the event of the death of the Stockholders Representative or his inability to perform his functions hereunder, the Stockholders shall choose a successor Stockholders Representative by a plurality vote of such Stockholders based upon Closing Shares held immediately prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (d) The Stockholders Representative shall not be liable to any Stockholder or any other Party for any action taken or omitted to be taken by him in his capacity as Stockholders Representative except in the case of willful misconduct or gross negligence. The Stockholders shall jointly indemnify the Stockholders Representative and hold him harmless from and against any loss, liability or expense of any nature incurred by the Stockholders Representative arising out of or in connection with the administration of his duties as Stockholders Representative, including reasonable legal fees and other costs and expenses of defending or preparing to defend against any claim or liability in the premises, unless such loss, liability or expense shall be caused by such Stockholders Representatives willful misconduct or gross negligence. 

   

11\. _Termination_. 

   

 11.1 _Grounds for Termination_. The Parties may terminate this Agreement at any time before the Effective Time as provided below: 

  

 (a) by mutual written consent of each of the Seller Parties and Buyer; 

   

 (b) by any Party, if the Closing shall not occurred on or before the Termination Date; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 11.1(b) shall not be available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the Termination Date; 

   

 (c) by any Party, if a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall have issued a Court Order (which Court Order the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to lift) that permanently restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the Transactions, and such Court Order shall have become final and non-appealable; 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) by Buyer, if any of Seller Parties shall have breached, or failed to comply with, any of its obligations under this Agreement or any representation or warranty made by Seller Parties shall have been incorrect when made, and such breach, failure or misrepresentation is not cured within 20 days after notice thereof, and in either case, any such breaches, failures or misrepresentations, individually or in the aggregate, results or would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Business; 

   

 (e) by Seller Parties, if Buyer shall have breached, or failed to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement or any representation or warranty made by it shall have been incorrect when made, and such breach, failure or misrepresentation is not cured within 20 days after notice thereof, and in either case, any such breaches, failures or misrepresentations, individually or in the aggregate, results or would reasonably be expected to affect materially and adversely the benefits to be received by Buyer hereunder; or 

   

 11.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1, the agreements contained in Section 7.7 shall survive the termination hereof and any Party may pursue any legal or equitable remedies that may be available if such termination is based on a breach of another Party. 

  

12\. _General Matters_. 

   

 12.1 _Contents of Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the other Transaction Documents, sets forth the entire understanding of the Parties with respect to the Transactions and supersedes all prior agreements or understandings among the parties regarding those matters. There have been no representations or warranties, written or oral, other than as provided in this Agreement and/or the other Transaction Documents, and Buyer is relying solely on the representations and warranties provided in this Agreement and/or the other Transaction Documents. 

  

 12.2 _Amendment, Parties in Interest, Assignment, Etc_. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by a written instrument duly executed by each of the Parties. If any provision of this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns of the Parties. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer any rights upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns, except as provided in Section 10\. No Party shall assign this Agreement or any right, benefit or obligation hereunder. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the Party entitled to the benefit thereof by a written instrument duly executed by such Party. 

   ##### 

  

  

 12.3 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Closing, the Parties shall execute and deliver any and all documents and take any and all other actions that may be deemed reasonably necessary by their respective counsel to complete the Transactions. 

  

 12.4 _Interpretation_. Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise, (a) references to the plural include the singular, the singular the plural, the part the whole, (b) references to any gender include all genders, (c) "including" has the inclusive meaning frequently identified with the phrase "but not limited to," and (d) references to "hereunder" or "herein" relate to this Agreement. The section and other headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not control or affect the construction of this Agreement or the interpretation thereof in any respect. Section, subsection, Schedule and Exhibit references are to this Agreement unless otherwise specified. Each accounting term used herein that is not specifically defined herein shall have the meaning given to it under GAAP. Any reference to a Partys being satisfied with any particular item or to a Partys determination of a particular item presumes that such standard will not be achieved unless such Party shall be satisfied or shall have made such determination in good faith in its sole or complete discretion. 

  

 12.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be binding as of the date first written above, and all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. Each such copy shall be deemed an original, and it shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement to produce or account for more than one such counterpart. 

  

 12.6 _Disclosure Schedules_. Any items listed or described on the Disclosure Schedules shall be listed or described under a caption that specifically identifies the Section(s) of this Agreement to which the item relates (which, in each case, shall constitute the only valid disclosure with respect to such Section(s)). 

  

13\. _Remedies_. 

   

 13.1 _Exclusive_. Other than with respect to the Non-Competition Agreements, the Consulting Agreements and the Escrow Agreement, (i) the indemnification rights provided for in this Agreement are the exclusive and the sole remedy (absent fraud or breach of this Agreement made by the Party with knowledge, and except for claims asserted under the Securities Law or other applicable securities Laws) available to a Party in enforcing any rights with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and (ii) an indemnity claim under Section 10.1(b) by Buyer against Stockholders shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer to recover from the Stockholders for any Damages or other claims or Liabilities arising from any Environmental Liabilities, Remedial Actions, Hazardous Substances, or Hazardous Activities.. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party hereby expressly acknowledges that the other Parties may be irreparably damaged if this Agreement is not specifically enforced. Upon a breach or threatened breach of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement by a Party, the non-breaching Parties shall, in addition to all other remedies, be entitled to seek a temporary or permanent 

   ##### 

  

    

injunction, without showing any actual damage, or a decree for specific
performance, in accordance with the provisions hereof. 

  

 13.2 _Dispute Resolution_. 

  

 (a) The Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute, controversy or claim among them arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including without limitation any dispute over the breach, termination, interpretation, or validity thereof (the " _Dispute_ "). Any party may request through written notice that the Dispute be referred to senior executives of the parties who have authority to resolve the Dispute. For purposes hereof, the Stockholders Representative shall be deemed a senior executive for the Seller Parties. The executives shall attempt to resolve the Dispute by agreement within thirty (30) days of such notice. 

   

 (b) If the Parties to the Dispute are unable to resolve the Dispute as provided in Section 12.1(a) above, they may try in good faith to resolve the Dispute by mediation and may use any mediator upon which they mutually agree. If the parties to the Dispute are unable to mutually agree upon a mediator, the Dispute shall be referred to the Chicago office of JAMS or such other mediation service as the parties to the Dispute may agree. The cost of the mediator will be split equally between the parties to the Dispute unless they agree otherwise. 

   

 (c) If the Parties have not (i) successfully resolved their Dispute through good faith discussions; (ii) appointed a mediator; or (iii) where a mediator has been duly appointed, resolved their dispute through mediation, each within 90 days of the Dispute notice in Section 12.1(a) being issued, the Dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration. The Parties shall select a mutually agreed upon single arbitrator and may utilize any format and set of rules for the binding arbitration upon which such parties may mutually agree. If the parties to the Dispute are unable to agree on a format and set of rules for the arbitration within 10 days, the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Should such parties be unable to agree on a choice of arbitrator within thirty (30) days from the demand for arbitration, then the arbitrator will be appointed by the Chicago office of JAMS (provided that any JAMS appointed mediator under paragraph (b) is not selected as an arbitrator under this paragraph (c)). 

   

 (d) The costs of the arbitration shall be borne equally among the Parties. Each party shall bear its own expenses for attorneys fees, expert fees, witness fees, travel costs and other arbitration-related costs. In no event is the arbitrator authorized or empowered to award punitive or exemplary damages. In no event is the arbitrator authorized or empowered to award damages in excess of the limitations set forth in this Agreement. 

   

 (e) Judgment upon an award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. The arbitrator may issue interim orders of protection as necessary or appropriate to maintain the status quo, safeguard property or prevent irreparable injury. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Party may seek injunctive relief in 

   ##### 

  

 

   

a court of competent jurisdiction, which relief shall last until the
arbitrator renders its decision. 

  

14\. _Notices_. 

   

 All notices that are required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be sufficient if personally delivered or sent by registered or certified mail, facsimile message (with receipt confirmed) or Federal Express or other nationally recognized overnight delivery service. Any notices shall be deemed given upon the earlier of the date when received at, or the third day after the date when sent by registered or certified mail or the day after the date when sent by Federal Express or facsimile to, the address or facsimile number set forth below, unless such address or facsimile number is changed by notice to the other Parties:

capacity as stockholders. Accordingly, Buyer acknowledges that the Company
shall not, upon Closing, obtain any right, title or interest in the work
