12.1(a) </B>above, they may try in good faith to resolve the Dispute by mediation and may use any
mediator upon which they mutually agree. If the parties to the Dispute are unable to mutually agree
upon a mediator, the Dispute shall be referred to the Chicago office of JAMS or such other
mediation service as the parties to the Dispute may agree. The cost of the mediator will be split
equally between the parties to the Dispute unless they agree otherwise.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;If the Parties have not (i)&nbsp;successfully resolved their Dispute through good faith
discussions; (ii)&nbsp;appointed a mediator; or (iii)&nbsp;where a mediator has been duly appointed, resolved
their dispute through mediation, each within 90&nbsp;days of the Dispute notice in Section&nbsp;12.1(a) being
issued, the Dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration. The Parties shall select a mutually
agreed upon single arbitrator and may utilize any format and set of rules for the binding
arbitration upon which such parties may mutually agree. If the parties to the Dispute are unable
to agree on a format and set of rules for the arbitration within 10&nbsp;days, the arbitration shall be
conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association. Should such parties be unable to agree on a choice of arbitrator within thirty (30)
days from the demand for arbitration, then the arbitrator will be appointed by the Chicago office
of JAMS (provided that any JAMS appointed mediator under paragraph (b)&nbsp;is not selected as an
arbitrator under this paragraph (c)).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;The costs of the arbitration shall be borne equally among the Parties. Each party shall
bear its own expenses for attorneys&#146; fees, expert fees, witness fees, travel costs and other
arbitration-related costs. In no event is the arbitrator authorized or empowered to award punitive
or exemplary damages. In no event is the arbitrator authorized or empowered to award damages in
excess of the limitations set forth in this Agreement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;Judgment upon an award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court with
jurisdiction. The arbitrator may issue interim orders of protection as necessary or appropriate to
maintain the status quo, safeguard property or prevent irreparable injury. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any Party may seek injunctive relief in
