owe from or to any pipeline, gatherer, transporter, processor, co-owner or
purchaser in connection with any natural gas or crude oil underdeliveries or
overdeliveries attributable to the ownership, operation or use of the
Facilities prior to the Effective Time. The Final Pipeline Imbalance Amount
shall be calculated based upon the applicable average price per unit for sales
of production during the month immediately preceding the Effective Time being
multiplied by the net underdelivery or overdelivery imbalance, as applicable,
in the appropriate units of measurement consistent with such applicable
average sales price. Sellers shall provide Buyer with data, documentation and
other materials reasonably requested by Buyer to verify such measurements and
value determination.

(ii) No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Operator
shall submit in writing to Buyer its good faith estimate of the dollar value

Buyer to perform its due diligence review and for the purpose of effecting the

complementary to Sellers' obligations under Section 9.14. Subject to the
consent and cooperation of Third Parties, Sellers, as applicable, will assist
Buyer in Buyer's efforts to obtain, at Buyer's expense, such additional

cause Sellers to contravene any applicable Law or fiduciary duty; provided,
that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any title opinions. If

sentence, Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate, without violating privilege, in
good faith to implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit
the disclosure of such information in a manner to remove the basis for the
objection if possible. Additionally, during the Interim Period, Operator shall

"Environmental Inspection"). If Buyer or its agents prepared an environmental
assessment of any of the Assets, Buyer agrees to keep such assessment
confidential and to furnish copies thereof to Sellers. Such information may be
disclosed to Buyer's Representatives and used in Buyer's evaluation of the
Assets. Notwithstanding the preceding, Buyer's obligation of confidentiality

SUCH CLAIMS, INJURIES OR DAMAGES ARISE IN WHOLE OR IN PART OF OUT SELLERS'
NEGLIGENCE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT FOR INJURIES OR DAMAGES CAUSED BY SELLERS' OR

ownership, operation or use of the Assets in compliance with this Section 9.1
and Section 9.2. Without limiting the generality of the preceding, during the
Interim Period Operator shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (a)
maintain the material tangible Assets in their normal operating condition
consistent with past practices or, if necessary, consistent with past
practices, repair or replace the material tangible Assets with parts and
materials of similar grade, quality and condition or as is otherwise required
in accordance with applicable Laws or in accordance with Operator's capital



and expense budgets existing as of the Execution Date and (b) preserve the
business relationships with Third Parties (including Asset Workers,
Governmental Authorities, customers, suppliers and service providers) related
thereto consistent with past practices; provided, however, nothing contained
herein will obligate Operator to maintain inventory of a quantity in excess of
past practices. Operator will keep Buyer timely informed of all matters it
considers in good faith to be material developments affecting any of the
Assets.

9.2 Restriction on Operations. During the Interim Period, Operator will
promptly inform Buyer of all requests for commitments to expend funds in
excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) with respect to the Assets.
Without limiting Operator's obligations under Section 9.1, during the Interim
Period and without the prior written consent of Buyer, Operator (and in the
case of Section 9.2(c) below, Sellers) shall not:

(a) commit to or incur any expenditures in excess of one hundred thousand
dollars ($100,000) with respect to any part of the Assets, except for
emergency events requiring immediate action to protect life, preserve the
Assets or otherwise comply with Laws;

(b) subject to Section 9.12, modify or terminate any of the Material
Agreements or waive or relinquish any right thereunder or enter into any
agreement that, if in existence as of the execution date hereof, would be a
Material Agreement;

(c) encumber, sell, remove from the Real Property, or otherwise dispose of any
of the Assets, other than personal property that is replaced by equivalent
property or consumed in the normal operation of the Assets, or is equipment
which was worthless or not usable consistent with its manufactured and
intended use and is replaced by equivalent equipment;

(d) except where necessary to prevent the termination of a Material Agreement,
propose (i) the conducting of any operations which require consent under the
applicable operating agreement or (ii) the conducting of any other operations
other than the normal operation of the existing Facilities;

(e) other than as contemplated on Schedule 9.2(e), amend, terminate, or fail
to renew or preserve any Assigned Permit;

(f) hire or terminate (other than for cause) any management-level Asset Worker
or make any material changes in headcount;

(g) adopt any new Benefit Plan or any material change to the rules of the
Seller Plans currently in effect or to the labor policies currently enforced
at the Assets; or

(h) approve or authorize or commit or agree to take any of the foregoing.

9.3 Notification of Claims. Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer of any Claim
or Legal Action that relates to the Assets or that might, in Sellers'
reasonable judgment, result in impairment



or loss of Sellers' title to any portion of the Assets or the value thereof or
that might hinder or impede the operation of the Facilities arising or
threatened prior to the Closing.

9.4 Assigned Permits. Operator shall use reasonable efforts to cause all
Assigned Permits to be transferred to Buyer and Buyer shall use reasonable
efforts to assist with such transfers. Operator shall not be obligated to
expend any funds in obtaining such transfers other than fees and expenses of
Operator's counsel.

9.5 Consents. Operator, upon Buyer's request, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, any consent of, or any
other action by, any Third Party in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions ("Third Party Consents"), including with respect to the
assignment of any Material Agreements to Buyer or its Affiliates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Operator is not required to incur any Liability
or provide any financial accommodations in order to obtain, or cause to be
obtained, any Third Party Consent.

9.6 Replacement Bonds and Instruments. At Closing, Buyer shall provide
replacement instruments for each bond or similar contingent obligation given
by Sellers securing its, or its contract operator's, obligations relating to
the Assets, set forth on Schedule 9.6 (collectively, the "Instruments"). As
soon as practical after Closing, Buyer (with reasonable assistance of Operator
as requested by Buyer) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
release of the Assets or Sellers from the Instruments.

9.7 Confidentiality.

(a) Survival. Upon the Closing, the provisions of this Section 9.7 shall
supersede and replace the terms and conditions of (i) that certain
Confidentiality Agreement dated July 6, 2016 between Operator and Tesoro
Logistics GP, LLC, an Affiliate of Buyer, and (ii) that certain Joinder and
Amendment to Confidentiality Agreement dated October 28, 2016 among Non-
Operator, Operator and Tesoro Logistics GP, LLC ((i) and (ii) collectively,
the "Confidentiality Agreement"). All data and information, whether written,
electronic or oral, obtained from Sellers in connection with the Transactions,
including the Records, whether obtained by Buyer before or after the execution
of this Agreement, and data and information generated by Buyer in connection
with the Transactions (collectively, the "Information"), is deemed by the
Parties to be confidential and proprietary to Sellers until the Closing.

(b) Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in
effect following the Parties' execution and delivery of this Agreement until
the Closing or, if the Closing does not occur, until such time as provided
therein

(c) Injunctive Relief. Buyer agrees that Sellers will not have an adequate
remedy of Laws if Buyer violates any of the terms of Sections 9.7(a) or
9.7(b). In such event, Sellers will have the right, in addition to any other
rights they may have, to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any breach or
threatened breach of the terms of Sections 9.7(a) or 9.7(b), or to obtain
specific enforcement of such terms.



9.8 Cure Period for Breach. If prior to the Closing any Party believes any
other Party has breached the terms of this Agreement, the Party who believes
the breach has occurred shall give written notice to the breaching Party of
the nature of the breach and give the breaching Party fifteen (15) days to
cure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 9.8 shall not apply to
breach of the Parties' obligations at Closing and shall not operate to delay
Closing and failure to provide such notice shall not diminish or limit the
rights of the non-breaching Party.

9.9 Notice of Breach. If either Sellers or Buyer has knowledge that the other
Party breached a representation or warranty under this Agreement, that Party
shall promptly inform the other Party of such breach so that it may attempt to
remedy or cure such breach prior to Closing.

9.10 Regulatory Matters. Each Seller and Buyer shall (a) make or cause to be
made appropriate filings of Notification and Report Forms pursuant to the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act") with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than two (2) Business Days, after the Execution Date, and Sellers
and Buyer shall each bear their own costs and expenses incurred in connection
with such filings, provided that Buyer, on the one hand, and each Seller, on
the other hand, shall pay 50% of any filing fees in connection with any such
filings that the given Party is required to make or cause to be made, (b) use
commercially reasonable efforts to respond at the earliest practicable date to
any requests for additional information made by the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") or
any other Governmental Authority, and (c) use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other Laws to terminate
or expire at the earliest possible date, to resist in good faith, at each of
their respective cost and expense, any assertion that the Transactions
constitute a violation of Laws, and to eliminate every impediment under any
Laws that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority so as to enable the
Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, all to the end of expediting
consummation of the Transactions. In connection with this Section, the Parties
shall, to the extent permitted by Laws, (i) cooperate in all respects with
each other in connection with any filing, submission, investigation or
inquiry, (ii) promptly inform the other Parties of any communication received
by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the DOJ, FTC or any other
Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case, regarding the
Transactions, (iii) have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each shall consult the other on, any filing made with, or written
materials to be submitted to, the DOJ, FTC or any other Governmental Authority
or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, any other person, in
connection with the Transactions, and (iv) consult with each other in advance
of any meeting, discussion, telephone call or conference with the DOJ, FTC or
any other Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, with any other Person, and to the extent not expressly
prohibited by the DOJ, FTC or any other Governmental Authority or person, give
the other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings
and conferences, in each case, regarding the Transactions. Notwithstanding the
preceding to the contrary, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall be
required (including with respect to the Assets) to: (A) sell, divest or
dispose of any businesses, assets, product lines or properties of Buyer or any
of its Affiliates, (B) terminate, or divest relationships, ventures,
contractual rights or obligations or (C) otherwise take or commit to take any
action that would limit Buyer's or its Affiliates' freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, directly



or indirectly, any businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or
properties of Buyer or its Affiliates' or any equity interest in any joint
venture held by Buyer or its Affiliates.

9.11 Employee Matters.

(a) During the Interim Period, Operator shall make available to Buyer during
normal business hours and on reasonable advance notice all of the Asset
Workers to discuss potential employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer
contingent upon the Closing occurring (such entity that makes any employment
offers pursuant to this Section is herein referred to as the "Buyer
Employer"). Buyer shall provide Operator, in writing, not later than fifteen
(15) Business Days after the Execution Date, a list of those Asset Workers to
whom a Buyer Employer intends to make offers of employment (collectively, the
"Designated Employees"). The date as of which employment with a Buyer Employer
is to begin in accordance with such offers shall be as of the Effective Time.
The Buyer Employer's determination as to which Asset Workers shall be
Designated Employees, and the proposed terms and conditions of employment
offered by the Buyer Employer, if any, shall be within the sole discretion of
the Buyer Employer; provided, however, that its election and determination
shall be made in accordance with all Laws. Buyer and its Affiliates shall have
no obligation under this Agreement to employ any of the Asset Workers. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Buyer Employer will not have any obligation to offer
employment to any Asset Worker who is on long-term disability, unauthorized
leave of absence or lay-off with or without recall rights. The Buyer Employer
will hire each Designated Employee who accepts the Buyer Employer's offer of
employment, is legally eligible for employment and signs the Buyer Employer's
normal new-hire documents (such as acknowledgment of company policies), and,
except as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law, consents to the release to
the Buyer Employer of such employee's Required Employee Records held by
Operator. Those Designated Employees who accept the Buyer Employer's
employment offers and become active employees of the Buyer Employer pursuant
to the preceding provisions of this paragraph are referred to herein as the
"Transferred Employees." Operator will provide incentives, the scope and
nature of which shall be determined by Operator in its sole discretion, to all
Designated Employees to accept the Buyer Employer's offer to become
Transferred Employees. In accordance with applicable wage and hour Laws,
Operator will pay each Transferred Employee the remaining balance of such
Transferred Employee's earned and unused vacation or paid time off accrued as
of the Closing Date. All Asset Workers that do not become Transferred
Employees shall remain employees of Operator, unless terminated by Operator.

(b) The provisions of this Section are solely for the benefit of the Parties
and nothing in this Section, express or implied, shall confer upon any Asset
Worker, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or
remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for any
specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever
under this Agreement. Nothing in this Section, express or implied, shall be
deemed an amendment of any Benefit Plan providing benefits to any Asset
Worker, or construed to prevent Operator or any of its Affiliates or Buyer or
any of its Affiliates from terminating or modifying to any extent or in any
respect any Benefit Plan that Buyer or any of its Affiliates may establish or
maintain.



9.12 Amendment and Restatement of Material Agreements.

(a) Existing Agreements. The Facilities are subject to (i) that certain
Agreement for the Construction, Ownership and Operation of the Robinson Lake
Gas Plant and Related Facilities dated June 4, 2009, between Whiting and Non-
Operator (successor-in-interest to Kaiser-Francis Mid-Continent Limited
Partnership), as amended (the "Existing Robinson Lake Operating Agreement"),
(ii) that certain Gas Purchase, Gathering and Processing Agreement dated
effective June 1, 2008, between Whiting, as seller, and Whiting, as
buyer/processer, as amended (the "Existing Robinson Lake Whiting Gas
Processing Agreement") and (iii) that certain Gas Purchase, Gathering and
Processing Agreement dated effective June 1, 2008, between Non-Operator (as
successor by merger to Kaiser-Francis Mid-Continent Limited Partnership), as
seller, and Whiting, as buyer/processer, as amended (the "Existing Robinson
Lake GBK Gas Processing Agreement").

(b) Termination of Operating Agreement. Upon Closing, Operator and Non-
Operator will terminate the Existing Robinson Lake Operating Agreement as to
the Facilities.

(c) Amended and Restated Gas Purchase, Gathering and Processing Agreements.
Upon Closing, (i) Whiting and Buyer shall execute the AandR Robinson Lake
Whiting Gas Processing Agreement, which shall amend and restate the Existing
Robinson Lake Whiting Gas Processing Agreement, a memorandum of which shall be
recorded by Buyer and Whiting within thirty (30) days following the Closing
Date, and (ii) Non-Operator shall execute and Buyer shall execute the AandR
Robinson Lake GBK Gas Processing Agreement, which shall amend and restate the
Existing Robinson Lake GBK Gas Processing Agreement, a memorandum of which
shall be recorded by Non-Operator and Whiting within thirty (30) days
following the Closing Date.

(d) Liability for Certain Agreements and Operations. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, it is expressly
agreed that Buyer shall not have any Liability to Sellers with respect to (i)
obligations arising pursuant to the Existing Robinson Lake Whiting Gas
Processing Agreement, (ii) obligations arising pursuant to the Existing
Robinson Lake GBK Gas Processing Agreement or (iii) the Existing Robinson Lake
Operating Agreement.

9.13 Gas Marketing Commitments. Operator and Rainbow Gas Company are parties
to those certain letter agreements dated October 2, 2013, August 12, 2014 and
March 18, 2015 pursuant to which Operator guaranteed certain obligations of
Rainbow Gas Company (the "Rainbow Gas Letters"). Before Closing, or within a
reasonable period of time after Closing, Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause Rainbow Gas Company to execute a novation of the
obligations under the Rainbow Gas Letters such that (a) Operator is released
from any and all liabilities, duties and obligations under the Rainbow Gas
Letters to the extent attributable to any time period at or after the Closing;
(b) effective as of the Closing, Buyer is substituted in place of Operator as
a party under Rainbow Gas Letters and Buyer shall be subject to each of the
terms and conditions contained in and pursuant to the Rainbow Gas Letters and
(c) Buyer assumes all the duties, liabilities and obligations of Whiting under
the Rainbow Gas Letters to the extent attributable



to any time period at or after the Closing. The foregoing novation shall be in
a form acceptable to Operator, and Operator shall be a party to such novation.

9.14 Cooperation with Respect to Financial Statements. During the Interim
Period and after the Closing, Operator shall (and shall cause its Affiliates
to) provide such reasonable cooperation as may be requested by Buyer with
respect to Buyer's preparation, at Buyer's expense, of such other financial
information in such form and for such periods as may be required pursuant to
the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission
or other applicable U.S. federal securities Laws relating to Buyer's
acquisition of the Assets. Any such cooperation shall be provided at Buyer's
expense for Third Party fees and expenses. Operator's obligations under this
Section 9.14 shall terminate three (3) years after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, (a) Operator's obligations under
this Section 9.14 shall be limited to providing such reasonable information as
it exists in Operator's computer systems and (b) in no event shall Operator be
required to prepare stand-alone carve out financial statements for Buyer.

9.15 Title Policies and Surveys. Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, shall
procure owner's title insurance policies (the "Title Policies") from the Title
Company with respect to such portions of the Owned Real Property as selected
by Buyer. At Buyer's request, Operator shall cooperate with and assist Buyer
with any reasonable request in Buyer's efforts to obtain such Title Policies
and shall execute and deliver to the Title Company such affidavits,
certificates and other documentation as are customary and reasonably requested
to cause the Title Company to issue one or more Owner's ALTA Form 2006 title
insurance policies with extended coverage for the Real Property. Prior to
Closing, Buyer may, at its sole cost and expense, obtain and update any
surveys pertaining to the Owned Real Property; provided, however, that any
such surveys and survey updates shall be performed by a surveyor reasonably
acceptable to Operator. Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of any and
all title charges, including costs and charges associated with any title
searches and examinations, title commitment updates and premiums (including
the cost of any endorsements) for the Title Policies and all escrow charges.
Buyer agrees that it shall look first to its Title Policies to defend against
any title challenges before seeking to file a claim against Sellers'
warranties, if any, under the deeds.

9.16 Casualty and Condemnation.

(a) Notice. If, after the execution of this Agreement and prior to Closing, a
portion of the Assets is damaged or destroyed by fire, earthquake, flood,
wind, tornado, explosion, vandalism, theft, or other casualty or is taken in
condemnation or under right of eminent domain (a "Casualty Event") and the
associated repair or replacement costs would reasonably be expected to exceed
two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000), then Operator shall promptly
advise Buyer thereof in writing which shall include: (i) a reasonable
description of the facts and circumstances surrounding the Casualty Event; and
(ii) Operator's preliminary assessment of the effect of the Casualty Event on
the Facilities and the estimated time within which to make repairs.

(b) Repair or Replacement. In the event of a Casualty Event, (i) Sellers shall
negotiate with Buyer to determine the amount by which to reduce the Purchase
Price to



reflect the cost to repair or replace, as applicable, the applicable Assets
(with equipment, properties, or assets of at least a similar age, grade and
utility) (such cost, the "Estimated Casualty Loss") or (ii) either Seller, at
its sole option, may elect to cure the loss associated with such Casualty
Event (the "Casualty Loss") to the extent pertaining to personal property by
notifying Buyer in writing prior to Closing and replacing (at such Seller's
expense and without charge therefor under Section 3.3) any personal property
that is the subject of such Casualty Loss with personal property of at least a
similar age, grade and utility, unless otherwise approved by Buyer in its
reasonable discretion. A Seller that elects to cure a Casualty Loss pursuant
to the foregoing clause (ii) shall retain all rights to insurance,
condemnation awards, and other claims against Third Parties with respect to
the casualty or taking except to the extent the Parties otherwise agree in
writing. In the event of a Casualty Loss, Buyer's obligations at Closing shall
be deferred until the later of (A) if a Seller has elected to cure a Casualty
Loss, five (5) Business Days after such Casualty Loss has been cured to
Buyer's reasonable satisfaction or (B) five (5) Business Days after the amount
of the Estimated Casualty Loss which has not been cured has been established
pursuant to Section 9.16(c).

(c) Establishment of Estimated Casualty Loss.

(i) If Sellers and Buyer agree on the Estimated Casualty Loss within fifteen
(15) days after Buyer's receipt of Sellers' notice of Casualty Loss (the
"Casualty Loss Negotiation Period"), the Purchase Price shall be reduced by
the amount of such Estimated Casualty Loss.

(ii) If Sellers and Buyer do not agree on the Estimated Casualty Loss within
the Casualty Loss Negotiation Period, then either Sellers, on the one hand, or
Buyer, on the other hand, may request that an independent engineering company,
jointly selected by Sellers and Buyer, evaluate the affected Assets and
deliver to Sellers and Buyer its written estimate of the Estimated Casualty
Loss (the "Third Party Estimate") within ten (10) Business Days after the end
of the Casualty Loss Negotiation Period.

(A) If the Third Party Estimate is less than sixty-seven million five hundred
thousand dollars ($67,500,000), the Estimated Casualty Loss shall be equal to
the Third Party Estimate and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount
of such Estimated Casualty Loss.

(B) If the Third Party Estimate is equal to or greater than sixty-seven
million five hundred thousand dollars ($67,500,000), Buyer, on the one hand,
or Sellers, on the other hand, may elect, by giving written notice of such
election to Sellers or Buyer, respectively, within five (5) Business Days of
receipt of such Third Party Estimate, to terminate this Agreement. If Buyer,
on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, waive their rights to
terminate or do not deliver any written notice of termination, the Estimated
Casualty Loss shall be equal to the Third Party Estimate and the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the amount of such Estimated Casualty Loss. In



the event multiple Casualty Events occur, then the Third Party Estimates shall
be aggregated to determine if the aggregate amount exceeds the above threshold
for Party's or Parties' right to terminate this Agreement.

(d) Purchase Price Adjustment. To the extent the Purchase Price is reduced at
Closing pursuant to Sections 9.16(b) and 9.16(c) to reflect an Estimated
Casualty Loss, then promptly after Buyer determines the actual cost to repair
or replace, as applicable, the Assets affected by a Casualty Loss (such cost,
the "Actual Casualty Loss"), Buyer shall give written notice thereof to each
of the Sellers. If the Actual Casualty Loss is more than the Estimated
Casualty Loss, Sellers shall collectively pay Buyer the amount of such
difference (with each Seller paying one-half of the amount of such
difference). If the Actual Casualty Loss is less than the Estimated Casualty
Loss, Buyer shall pay to each of the Sellers one-half of the amount of such
difference. Any such payment by a Party shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within five (5) days following Buyer's notice of
the Actual Casualty Loss.

(e) Condemnation Awards. If any action for condemnation or taking under the
right of eminent domain is pending or threatened with respect to any Asset or
portion thereof after the Execution Date, but no taking of such Asset or
portion thereof occurs prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall nevertheless be
required to Close and each of the Sellers, at Closing, shall assign, transfer
and set over to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to each of the Seller's right, title
and interest (if any) in such condemnation or eminent domain action, including
any future awards therein, insofar as they are attributable to the Assets
threatened to be taken, except that each of the Sellers shall reserve and
retain (and Buyer shall assign to each of the Sellers) all right, title,
interest and claims against Third Parties for the recovery of each of the
Seller's costs and expenses incurred prior to the Closing in defending or
asserting rights in such action with respect to the Assets.

9.17 Rolling Stock.

(a) At or promptly following the Closing, Operator shall transfer and assign
to Buyer the vehicles comprising the Rolling Stock which are leased by Third
Parties to Operator as of the Closing Date. To the extent allowed under the
applicable contractual and/or leasehold arrangements, Buyer shall assume the
existing leases with respect to such Rolling Stock (but only such obligations
which are performable from and after the Effective Time for such Rolling
Stock) and upon such assignment and assumption and consent by the applicable
lessor(s) Buyer shall pay to Sellers any remaining positive equity values in
such Rolling Stock in an amount not to exceed the amounts set forth in
Schedule 9.17(a).

(b) At or promptly following the Closing, Operator shall execute and deliver
to Buyer title transfer forms transferring title to the owned Rolling Stock to
Buyer, duly executed by Operator, and certificates of title for such vehicles
evidencing that title to such vehicles is held by Operator free of Liens, duly
endorsed by Operator. Any Transfer Taxes incurred for the transfer of such
Rolling Stock shall be apportioned as provided pursuant to Section 10.1.



9.18 Unrecorded Easements. Within fifteen (15) days after the Execution Date,
Whiting shall identify and notify Buyer of any Easement in the name of either
Seller that has not been properly recorded as of the Execution Date with the
appropriate Governmental Authority in which the real property subject to such
Easement is located (each such unrecorded Easement, an "Unrecorded Easement").
If such Easement is identified as an Unrecorded Easement and Whiting has the
original easement agreement evidencing such Unrecorded Easement in its
possession, then, to the extent such original easement agreement has not
already been submitted to the applicable Governmental Authority for recording,
Whiting will promptly file for recording such Unrecorded Easement agreement
and notify Buyer of such filing. If an Easement is identified as an Unrecorded
Easement and Whiting does not have the original easement agreement evidencing
such Unrecorded Easement in its possession, but has a copy of such easement
agreement in its possession, Whiting will promptly determine whether the
recording of such copy is permitted by the applicable Governmental Authority.
If the recording of such copy is permitted, Whiting will promptly file for the
copy of such Unrecorded Easement and notify Buyer of such filing. If the
recording of such copy is not permitted or if Whiting does not have a copy of
such Unrecorded Easement in its possession, then during the period commencing
on the Execution Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
Whiting will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the grantor
under such Unrecorded Easement (or such grantor's successor landowner) either
a recordable ratification and acknowledgement of the existing Unrecorded
Easement or a new original easement agreement containing rights of way and
other terms and conditions that are substantially similar to those contained
in the Unrecorded Easement or that are otherwise satisfactory to Buyer in its
reasonable discretion. Buyer shall provide Whiting with such assistance as
reasonably requested by Whiting in obtaining any such ratification or
replacement easement agreement. If such ratification or new replacement
easement agreement is obtained, Whiting will promptly file for recording such
ratification or replacement Easement with the appropriate Governmental
Authority. All Third Party costs and expenses of the Parties incurred in
connection with the actions contemplated in this Section 9.18 shall be borne
by Buyer.

ARTICLE 10 
TAX MATTERS

10.1 Transfer Taxes. Sellers and Buyer believe that the purchases and sales
contemplated by this Agreement are exempt from or are otherwise not subject to
Transfer Taxes. If Transfer Taxes do apply to the purchases and sales
contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer, on the one hand, shall be responsible
for one-half of any Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the
Transactions, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall collectively be
responsible for one-half of the remaining Transfer Taxes incurred in
connection with the Transactions. Each Party shall timely file or caused to be
filed all documents required to be filed by it with respect to Transfer Taxes
under applicable Law. Prior to, or in no event later than Closing, each Party
shall provide to the other Parties, as applicable, copies of any applicable
and available exemption certificates, including sale for resale exemption
certificates or other similar documentation necessary to establish the right
to any exemption from Transfer Taxes. Each Party shall thereafter provide the
other Parties, as applicable and available, with any additional exemption
certificates and other documentation as may be required by the Taxing
Authority having jurisdiction for such purpose. Sellers shall reasonably
cooperate with Buyer, including providing Buyer with reasonable access to
relevant information contained in



Seller's books, records, and such other data as Buyer may reasonably request
in order to support all applicable exemptions from Transfer Taxes.

10.2 Ad Valorem Taxes. Any Ad Valorem Taxes with respect to the Assets for any
Straddle Period will be apportioned between the portion of such Straddle
Period up to and including the day before the Closing Date (such portion, a
"Pre-Closing Straddle Period") and the portion of such Straddle Period that
begins the day of the Closing Date (such portion, a "Post-Closing Straddle
Period") on a per diem basis, with such Ad Valorem Taxes apportioned to the
Pre-Closing Straddle Period to be borne by Sellers equally and those
apportioned to the Post-Closing Straddle Period to be borne by Buyer. For
purposes of this Section 10.2, any exemption, deduction, credit or other item
that is calculated on an annual basis will be allocated to the Straddle Period
in the same manner. The Party that has the legal obligation to pay any Ad
Valorem Taxes with respect to Assets for any Straddle Period will timely pay
such Ad Valorem Taxes and file any required Tax Returns in connection
therewith.

10.3 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Each Party will furnish or cause to be
furnished to the other Party, upon the other Party's reasonable request, as
promptly as practicable, such information and assistance related to the Assets
as is reasonably necessary for (a) the filing of any Tax Return, (b) the
preparation for and conduct of any audit, and (c) the prosecution or defense
of any Legal Action related to any proposed adjustment. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other Party's request) the provision of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or
Tax proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder.

subject, at the option of Buyer, to the satisfaction or written waiver at or
prior to the Closing of the following conditions precedent:

(a) The Seller Fundamental Representations shall be true and correct in all
respects as of the Execution Date and as of the Closing (except to the extent

specified date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be
true and correct as of such specified date) except where the failure of such
representations and warranties of Sellers to be true and correct, individually

required by this Agreement to be performed and complied with by Sellers prior
to or at the Closing in all material respects;

jurisdiction over the Parties or the subject matter of this Agreement

which if successful would have the effect of, any of the foregoing;

(e) The waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the
Transactions under the HSR Act shall have expired or earlier been terminated
and there shall not be pending or threatened in writing any Legal Action

Buyer after the Closing;

the Parties to proceed to Closing; and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, no changes in commodity pricing, volumes deliverable to the Assets
or changes in the financial condition of a Party shall be a condition on which
a Party may elect not to Close the Transactions.

ARTICLE 12 
RIGHT OF TERMINATION

12.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated:

(a) by written mutual consent of Sellers and Buyer;



(b) either by Sellers by collective written notice to Buyer or by Buyer by
written notice to Sellers in the event the Closing has not occurred as of
April 30, 2017;

(c) by Sellers by collective written notice to Buyer (so long as Sellers are
not then in material breach of any of their representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement), if there has been a
breach of any of Buyer's representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement that would result in the failure of a condition
set forth in Sections 11.1(a) or 11.1(b), and which breach has not been cured
or cannot be cured within fifteen (15) days following the delivery to Buyer by
Sellers of a written notice of such breach specifying particularly such
breach;

(d) by Buyer by written notice to Sellers (so long as Buyer is not then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement), if there has been a breach of any of
Sellers' representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement that would result in the failure of a condition set forth in
Sections 11.2(a) or 11.2(b), and which breach has not been cured or cannot be
cured within fifteen (15) days following the delivery to Sellers by Buyer of a
written notice of such breach specifying particularly such breach;

(e) by Buyer, on the one hand, or Sellers, on the other hand, pursuant to
Section 9.16(c)(ii); or

(f) by either Buyer, on the one hand, or Sellers, on the other hand, by
written notice to the other following termination of the Belfield PSA for any
reason as set forth in such agreement.

12.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 12.1, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no further
force and effect, except as provided in this Section 12.2 and except for the
provisions of Section 12.3 (Remedies) and Article 16 (Miscellaneous), which
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

12.3 Remedies.

(a) Buyer's Breach. If (i) Sellers terminate this Agreement under Section
12.1(c) or (ii) either Buyer, on the one hand, or Sellers, on the other hand,
terminate this Agreement under Section 12.1(f) following a termination of the
Belfield PSA under Section 12.1(c) thereof by the sellers thereunder, then
Sellers shall be entitled to retain the Deposit and all earnings related
thereto as liquidated damages and not as a penalty. The remedy set forth in
this Section 12.3(a) shall, following Sellers' termination of this Agreement
under the circumstances described in this Section 12.3(a), be Sellers' sole
and exclusive remedy for Buyer's breach of this Agreement and as full and
final settlement of all liabilities associated with Buyer's breach of this
Agreement. The Parties agree that the retention of the Deposit as set forth in
this Section 12.3(a) will be deemed liquidated damages and that the amount of
liquidated damages is reasonable considering all of the circumstances existing
as of the date of this Agreement and constitute the Parties' good faith
estimate of the actual damages reasonably expected to result from Buyer's
failure to tender performance under



this Agreement. In no event shall Sellers have the right to (A) seek or
otherwise obtain specific performance of the obligations of Buyer at Closing
under this Agreement, or (B) retain the Deposit more than once.

(b) Sellers' Breach. Upon either Seller's breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements contained in this
Agreement, together with such Seller's failure to remedy such breach, such
that Buyer would be entitled to terminate this Agreement under Section 12.1(d)
absent a waiver of such breach by Buyer (which waiver Buyer may give or
withhold in its sole discretion), Buyer, at its sole option, shall either (i)
enforce specific performance of this Agreement or (ii) terminate this
Agreement and Buyer shall be entitled to the Deposit and all earnings related
thereto, in which case Sellers shall return the Deposit and such earnings to
Buyer immediately following such termination. If Buyer terminates this
Agreement under the circumstances described in this Section 12.3(b), Buyer's
right to receive back the Deposit shall be Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy
for Sellers' breach of this Agreement and Buyer's receipt of the Deposit shall
constitute full and final settlement of all liabilities associated with the
Sellers' breach of this Agreement. The Parties agree that the payment of the
Deposit as elected by Buyer as set forth in this Section 12.3(b) will be
deemed liquidated damages and that the amount of liquidated damages is
reasonable considering all of the circumstances existing as of the date of
this Agreement and constitute the Parties' good faith estimate of the actual
damages reasonably expected to result from Sellers' failure to tender
performance under this Agreement.

(c) Other Circumstances. If Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other
hand, terminate this Agreement under Section 12.1 other than in the
circumstances described in Sections 12.1(c) or 12.1(d) or 12.1(f) following a
termination of the Belfield PSA under Section 12.1(c) thereof by the sellers
thereunder, then (i) Buyer shall be entitled to receive back the Deposit and
any earnings related thereto, in which case Sellers shall return the Deposit
and such earnings to Buyer immediately following such termination, and (ii) no
Party shall have any liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination.

ARTICLE 14 
POST-CLOSING COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

14.1 Post-Closing Adjustments.

(a) Final Settlement Statement. As soon as practicable after the Closing, but
in no event later than sixty (60) days following termination of the accounting
services provided pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, Operator will
prepare and deliver to Buyer a settlement statement (the "Final Settlement
Statement") setting forth each applicable adjustment or payment pursuant to
Section 3.3 and Section 3.4 that had either not accrued or was not finally
determined as of the Closing and showing the calculation of such adjustment
and the resulting Purchase Price (the "Final Purchase Price"). After receipt
of the Final Settlement Statement, Buyer shall have thirty (30) days (the
"Final Settlement Statement Review Period") to review the Final Settlement
Statement, and during the Final Settlement Statement Review Period, Buyer and
its accountants shall have full access to the books and records of, the
personnel of, and work papers prepared by Operator or Operator's accountants
to the extent they relate to the Final Settlement Statement. As soon as
practicable after receipt of the Final Settlement Statement, but in no event
later than the last day of the Final Settlement Statement Review Period, Buyer
shall deliver to Sellers a written notice of any disagreements that Buyer has
to components of the Final Settlement Statement, setting forth such
disagreements in reasonable detail. Buyer's failure to deliver to Sellers a
written notice of disagreement to the Final Settlement Statement by that date
shall be deemed an acceptance by Buyer of the Final Settlement Statement as
submitted by Operator. The Parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
Buyer's disagreements no later than thirty (30) days after receipt by Sellers
of Buyer's notice of such disagreements. The date upon which such agreement is
reached or upon which the Final Purchase Price is established shall be herein
called the "Final Settlement Date." If the Final Purchase Price is more than
the Closing Date Payment, Buyer shall pay the amount of such difference to
each Seller as set forth on the Final Settlement Statement. If the Final
Purchase Price is less than the Closing Date Payment, Sellers shall each pay
to Buyer their respective portion of the amount of such difference as set
forth on the Final Settlement Statement. Any payment by Buyer or Sellers, as
the case may be, shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds
within five (5) days of the Final Settlement Date. If Buyer, on the one hand,
and Sellers, on the other hand, are unable to resolve a dispute as to the
Final Purchase Price by thirty (30) days after Sellers' receipt of Buyer's
proposed changes, the Parties shall resolve such dispute pursuant to Section
14.1(b).



(b) Dispute Resolution. If the Parties are unable to resolve a dispute as to
the Final Purchase Price in the time period contemplated in the last sentence
of Section 14.1(a), then either Party may elect to submit all amounts
remaining in dispute to the Neutral Auditor. Upon such election, Buyer and
Sellers will direct the Neutral Auditor to render a determination within
forty-five (45) days of its retention, and Buyer and Sellers will cooperate
with the Neutral Auditor during its engagement. The Neutral Auditor will
consider only those items and amounts that Buyer and Seller are unable to
resolve; provided that each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the
other hand, shall be entitled to make a presentation to the Neutral Auditor
regarding the items and amounts that they are unable to resolve and neither
Buyer nor Sellers will meet separately with the Neutral Auditor. In making its
determination, the Neutral Auditor shall (i) be bound by the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including Sections 3.3 and 3.4 and this Section
14.1(b), and (ii) not assign any value with respect to a disputed amount that
is greater than the highest value for such amount claimed by either Sellers,
on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, or that is less than the lowest
value for such amount claimed by either Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on
the other hand. The determination of the Neutral Auditor will be conclusive
and binding upon Sellers and Buyer. The costs of the Neutral Auditor shall be
split equally between Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand.

14.2 Records. Sellers shall deliver the Records to Buyer as soon as
practicable but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date
except to the extent such Records are utilized by Operator in providing
services pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement which in such case
Operator shall deliver such Records to Buyer as soon as practicable but in no
event later than ten (10) Business Days after the termination of the last
services under the Transition Services Agreement. Sellers may retain copies of
the Records, and Sellers shall have the right to review and copy the Records,
during standard business hours and at such Seller's expense upon reasonable
notice for so long as Buyer retains the Records. Buyer agrees that the Records
will be maintained in compliance with all Laws governing document retention.
Buyer will not destroy or otherwise dispose of Records for a period of four
(4) years after Closing, unless Buyer first gives Sellers reasonable notice
and an opportunity to copy the Records to be destroyed.

14.3 Possession/Operations After Closing. Sellers agree to transfer possession
of the Assets to Buyer at the Closing. All operations in respect of the Assets
performed by Operator after the Closing Date shall be pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement.

14.4 Further Assurances. From time to time after Closing, Sellers, on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall each execute, acknowledge and
deliver to the other such further instruments and take such other action as
may be reasonably requested in order to accomplish more effectively the
purposes of the Transactions, including, if requested by Buyer, the conveyance
or assignment of any Asset that is generally described in Article 2 and would
have otherwise been conveyed to Buyer except for the fact that it was not
specifically listed on the Exhibits.

14.5 Payment of Certain Expenses Due and Payable After the Closing Date.





(a) Buyer shall pay, as and when due, utility bills that are due and payable
after the Closing Date, and Sellers shall reimburse Buyer within thirty (30)
days after invoice for any amounts under such bills attributable to any period
prior to the Effective Time. Sellers shall pay, as and when due, utility bills
that are due and payable prior to the Closing Date, and Buyer shall reimburse
Sellers, pursuant to the Final Settlement Statement or otherwise, for any
amounts under such bills attributable to any period on or after the Effective
Time.

(b) If a Party makes any payment to a Third Party pursuant to an Assigned
Contract and either (i) such payment is made or the Liability incurred is in
respect of work to be performed, services provided or goods delivered during
the Interim Period or (ii) the Effective Time occurs between the making of
such payment and the performance of the work or services or delivery of goods,
the Parties will allocate the burden of such payment or such Liability in a
manner that reflects the relative benefit of such work performed, services
provided or goods delivered to each Party; provided, however, it shall be
presumed that any work performed, services provided or goods delivered prior
to the Effective Time are for the benefit of and shall be paid by Sellers and
any work performed, services provided or goods delivered after the Effective
Time are for the benefit of and shall be paid by Buyer.

14.6 Proceeds and Invoices for Property Costs Received After the Final
Settlement Date. After the Final Settlement Date, those proceeds attributable
to the Assets received by a Party or invoices received for, or Property Costs
or Taxes paid by, one Party for or on behalf of the other Party with respect
to the Assets which were not already included in and settled by the Final
Settlement Statement, shall be settled as follows:

(a) Proceeds. Any proceeds received by Buyer with respect to the ownership,
operation or use of the Assets or performance of the Assigned Contracts prior
to the Effective Time shall be remitted or forwarded to Sellers, on a 50/50
basis. Any proceeds received by Sellers with respect to the ownership,
operation or use of the Assets or performance of the Assigned Contracts after
the Effective Time shall be forwarded to Buyer.

(b) Property Costs. Invoices for Property Costs received by Buyer that relate
to the period of time prior to the Effective Time shall be forwarded to
Sellers, or if already paid by Buyer, invoiced by Buyer to Sellers on a 50/50
basis. Invoices for Property Costs received by Sellers that relate to the
period of time after the Effective Time shall be forwarded to Buyer by
Sellers, or if already paid by Sellers, invoiced by Sellers to Buyer. Any
invoices for Property Costs received by Buyer or Sellers that relate to the
period of time both prior to and after the Effective Time shall be paid by the
Party or Parties that receive such invoices, and the portion of such Property
Costs for which such Party or Parties are not responsible shall be invoiced by
the receiving Party or Parties to the other Parties or Party, as applicable,
under this Agreement.

(c) Taxes. If any Party pays Taxes and such payment includes another Party's
share thereof determined under this Agreement, the other Party will, as
promptly as practicable, and in any event within five (5) Business Days,
following delivery to it of written notice thereof, accompanied by reasonably
detailed supporting documentation, reimburse such Party for its share of such
Taxes.



14.7 Non-Solicitation. During the one-year period after the Closing Date,
neither Seller will, and each will cause each of its respective Affiliates not
to, directly or indirectly, at any time solicit (except by way of general
advertisement not directed to such employees), induce or encourage any
Transferred Employee to leave such employment, or hire, employ or otherwise
engage any such individual, without obtaining written consent of Buyer prior
to such action; provided, that Buyer's written consent shall not be required
for either Seller or any of their Affiliates to hire, employ, or otherwise
engage any such person who contacts such Seller or any such Affiliate as a
result of general advertisements not directed to such person. Sellers
acknowledge and agree that the remedies at law available to Buyer for breach
of any of the obligations under this Section 14.7 would be inadequate;
therefore, in addition to any other rights or remedies that Buyer may have at
law or in equity, temporary and permanent injunctive relief may be granted in
any proceeding that may be brought to enforce any provision contained in this
Section 14.7, without the necessity of proof of actual damage or the posting
of any bond or other security.

14.8 Post-Closing Confidentiality. Subject to Section 16.5, during the two-
year period after the Closing Date, each Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, hold, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its or their respective representatives to hold, in confidence all
information, whether written or oral, that primarily relates to the Assets or
the performance of the Assigned Contracts, except to the extent that such
Seller can show that such information (a) is generally available to or known
by the public through no fault of Sellers, any of their Affiliates, or their
respective representatives, (b) is lawfully acquired by such Seller, any of
its Affiliates, or their respective representatives from and after the Closing
from sources which are not prohibited from disclosing such information by a
legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation or (c) is independently developed
by Sellers without reference to such information. If a Seller or any of its
Affiliates or their respective representatives are compelled to disclose any
such information by judicial or administrative process or by other
requirements of any Law, such Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing
and shall disclose only that portion of such information which such Seller is
advised by its counsel in writing is legally required to be disclosed.

14.9 IT Transition. In addition to and without limiting Section 14.4,
following the Closing, Operator and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate to
implement the IT Transition Plan attached hereto as Exhibit I.

ARTICLE 15

15.1 Survival. All representations and warranties of the Parties contained in

agreements that by their express terms are to be performed



or complied with at or prior to the Closing, which will survive for one
hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing Date) will survive the Closing
until fully performed in accordance with their respective terms. No Party will
have any Liability for indemnification claims made under this Article 15 with
respect to any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement unless a
Claim Notice with respect thereto is given to such Party in accordance with
Section 15.5(b) prior to the expiration of any applicable survival period for
such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, as the case may be.

15.2 Sellers' Indemnification of Buyer. Subject to the other provisions of
this Article 15, from and after Closing, Sellers shall, severally and not
jointly, indemnify and defend Buyer, its Affiliates, and the officers and
directors (or Persons in any similar capacity if such Person is not a
corporation), employees, consultants and agents of Buyer and its Affiliates
and their respective successors (each, a "Buyer Indemnified Party") against
and agree to hold each Buyer Indemnified Party harmless from any and all
Losses incurred or suffered by such Buyer Indemnified Party to the extent
resulting or arising from, or attributable to, any of the following matters:

(i) any breach as of the Execution Date or as of the Closing of any

by the amount of Ad Valorem Taxes and Transfer Taxes taken into account as a

14.6(c);

providing services pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, then the
later of the termination date of the Transition Services Agreement or, if such
Asset Worker is a Transferred Employee, the date that such Transferred
Employee becomes employed by the Buyer Employer; provided, however, except for
the Retained Environmental Liabilities, the foregoing shall not be interpreted
to require Sellers to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified
Party from Losses arising from Liabilities asserted by an



employee of Operator or its Affiliates (including Asset Workers) that relate
to or arise from such employee's (including Asset Worker's) exposure to
Hazardous Materials while performing services at or with respect to the
Facilities prior to the Effective Time;

(vii) any Benefit Plan of Sellers or their Affiliates;

(viii) any Indebtedness of either Seller or their Affiliates; and

With respect to an Indemnity Event arising under Section 15.2(i), if the
representation or warranty giving rise to such Indemnity Event is made by or
with respect to (I) a single Seller, and such single Seller is in breach of
such representation or warranty, then such single Seller shall be responsible
for 100% of the Buyer Indemnified Party's Losses arising from such breach,
(II) both Sellers, but only one Seller is in breach of such representation or
warranty, then such breaching Seller shall be solely responsible for 100% of
the Buyer Indemnified Party's Losses arising from such breach and (III) both
Sellers, and each Seller is in breach of such representation or warranty, then
each Seller shall be responsible for 50% of the Buyer Indemnified Party's
Losses arising from such breach. With respect to an Indemnity Event arising
under Section 15.2(ii), if the covenant or agreement giving rise to such
Indemnity Event is made by or with respect to (x) a single Seller, and such
single Seller is in breach of such covenant or agreement, then such single
Seller shall be responsible for 100% of the Buyer Indemnified Party's Losses
arising from such breach, (y) both Sellers, but only one Seller is in breach
of such covenant or agreement, then such breaching Seller shall be solely
responsible for 100% of the Buyer Indemnified Party's Losses arising from such
breach and (z) both Sellers, and both Sellers are in breach of such covenant
or agreement, then each Seller shall be responsible for 50% of the Buyer
Indemnified Party's Losses arising from such breach. With respect to an
Indemnity Event arising under Sections 15.2(iv) and (v), Sellers shall be
severally and not jointly liable on a 50/50 basis.

15.3 Buyer's Indemnification of Sellers. Subject to the other provisions of
this Article 15, from and after Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and defend
Sellers, their Affiliates, and the officers and directors (or Persons in any
similar capacity if such Person is not a corporation), employees, consultants
and agents of Sellers and their Affiliates and their respective successors
(each, a "Seller Indemnified Party") against, and agrees to hold each Seller
Indemnified Party harmless from, any and all Losses incurred or suffered by
such Seller Indemnified Party to the extent resulting or arising from, or
attributable to, any of the following matters:

(i) any breach as of the Execution Date or as of the Closing of any
representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement, the
Transaction Certificates or the Conveyances;

(ii) any breach or any non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement on the
part of Buyer contained in this Agreement;



(iii) the Assumed Liabilities; and

(iv) all Liabilities for (A) Taxes attributable to the Assets for (x) any
taxable period beginning on or after the Closing Date or (y) any Post-Closing
Straddle Period, including all Ad Valorem Taxes payable by Buyer under Section
10.2 and (B) Transfer Taxes payable by Buyer under Section 10.1; provided,
that the amount of such Liabilities shall be reduced by the amount of Ad
Valorem Taxes and Transfer Taxes taken into account as an increase in the
determination of the Final Purchase Price and amounts of such Taxes otherwise
paid by Buyer under Sections 10.1, 10.2, or 14.6(c); provided, further, that
such Liabilities shall not include any Liability for (A) Taxes resulting from
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other
than Transfer Taxes and Ad Valorem Taxes), including income Taxes of Sellers
resulting from the sale of the Assets to Buyer, or (B) Taxes (if any)
otherwise described in this paragraph (iv) for which Sellers are indemnifying
Buyer under Section 15.2.

15.4 Indemnification Limitations. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, after the Closing:

(a) Seller Thresholds, Deductibles, and Caps.

(i) No Buyer Indemnified Party seeking indemnification pursuant to Section
15.2(i) shall make any claim for, or be entitled to, indemnification from any
Seller with respect to a matter involving less than two hundred and fifty
thousand dollars ($250,000) (the "De Minimis Amount") of Losses arising out of
the same occurrence or matter or any series of related occurrences or matters;

(ii) no indemnification shall be payable by any Seller pursuant to Section
15.2(i) to any Buyer Indemnified Party unless and until the total of all
Losses (excluding all Losses not exceeding the De Minimis Amount) for which
such Seller would otherwise have an indemnification obligation pursuant to
Section 15.2(i) exceeds nine million dollars ($9,000,000) in the aggregate
(the "Deductible Amount"), whereupon the Buyer Indemnified Parties may claim
indemnification for the amount of such claims, or portion thereof, in excess
of the Deductible Amount but in no event shall such claims include the De
Minimis Amounts;

(iii) in no event shall the Buyer Indemnified Parties recover (A) with respect
to Operator pursuant to Section 15.2(i) an aggregate amount greater than
twenty-two million five hundred thousand dollars ($22,500,000) (the "Operator
Indemnity Cap") and (B) with respect to Non-Operator pursuant to Section
15.2(i) an aggregate amount greater than twenty-two million five hundred
thousand dollars ($22,500,000) (the "Non-Operator Indemnity Cap" and each of
the Operator Indemnity Cap and the Non-Operator Indemnity Cap may be referred
to as a "Seller Indemnity Cap");



(iv) notwithstanding the preceding to the contrary, the limitations on
Sellers' indemnification obligations set forth in Sections 15.4(a)(i),
15.4(a)(ii) and 15.4(a)(iii) shall not apply to Losses resulting from (A) any
breach by Sellers of the Seller Fundamental Representations or the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 6.6 (Tax Matters), Section
7.10 (Taxes) or the Conveyances or (B) Fraud by Sellers in the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement;

(v) in no event shall the aggregate liability of any Seller for
indemnification of the Buyer Indemnified Parties under Section 15.2(i) exceed
the Base Price, as adjusted, actually received by such Seller; provided, that
the limitations on Sellers' indemnification obligations set forth in this
Section 15.4(a)(v) shall not apply to Losses resulting from Fraud by such
Seller in the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement;

(vi) in no event shall any Buyer Indemnified Party be entitled to recover or
obtain payment, reimbursement, restitution or indemnity against an
Indemnifying Party more than once in respect of any one Loss or related group
of Losses; and

(vii) for the avoidance of doubt, each of the De Minimis Amount, the
Deductible Amount, and the applicable Seller Indemnity Cap shall be determined
and applied separately as to each Seller.

(b) Calculation of Losses.

(i) For purposes of determining whether a breach has occurred in connection
with a claim for indemnification under this Article 15 for breaches of
representations and warranties, each of the representations and warranties
herein that contains any qualifications as to "material" or "Material Adverse
Effect" will be determined with regard to such "material" or "Material Adverse
Effect" qualifier contained in the terms of such representation and warranty;
provided, however, that if the representation or warranty is breached (after
taking into consideration such "material" or "Material Adverse Effect"
qualifier) then the calculation of the amount of Losses arising out of such
breach will be determined without regards to such "material" or "Material
Adverse Effect" qualifier (except with respect to the term "Material
Agreements" which shall be read without excluding such qualification for
purposes of this Section 15.4(b)).

(ii) Losses subject to indemnification under this Article 15 shall be reduced
by any amounts recovered prior to indemnification under this Article 15 by an
Indemnified Party under insurance policies or from Third Parties with respect
to such Losses, in each case net of any out-of-pocket costs incurred in
connection with such recovery that are not reimbursed or paid for under such
insurance policies or from Third Parties. In the event an Indemnified Party
recovers under insurance policies or from Third Parties any amount in respect
of a Loss for which such Indemnified Party was previously indemnified pursuant
to Section 15.2 or Section 15.3, as applicable, then such Indemnified Party
shall promptly pay over to the



applicable Indemnifying Party or Indemnifying Parties the amount so recovered
(after deducting therefrom the amount of the out-of-pocket costs incurred by
such Indemnified Party in procuring such recovery that are not reimbursed or
paid for under such insurance policies or from Third Parties) but only to the
extent the net amount so recovered under such insurance policies or from Third
Parties when added to the amounts previously paid to such Indemnified Party
for such Loss pursuant to Section 15.2 or Section 15.3, as applicable, exceeds
the full amount of the Loss incurred by the Indemnified Party.

(iii) Losses subject to indemnification under this Article 15 for a matter
that was also the subject of a post-Closing adjustment pursuant to Section
14.1 shall be adjusted accordingly, such that no Party shall be entitled to
make duplicative recoveries against a Party with respect to a Loss.

(c) Mitigation. Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate the amount and nature of Losses suffered by such Person
after becoming aware of such Loss.

(d) Limitation on Damages. FROM AND AFTER THE CLOSING NEITHER BUYER NOR
SELLERS SHALL BE LIABLE TO SELLERS OR BUYER, RESPECTIVELY, FOR SPECIAL,
INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECULATIVE, REMOTE, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
SUFFERED BY SUCH PARTY RESULTING FROM OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
BREACH THEREOF OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER TORT,
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, INDEMNITY OR
OTHERWISE, INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, INCREASED COST OF OPERATIONS, BUSINESS
INTERRUPTIONS, DIMINUTION IN VALUE OR MULTIPLES OF EARNINGS DAMAGES OR ANY
OTHER DAMAGES BASED ON ANY TYPE OF MULTIPLE; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THE FOREGOING
SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS LIMITING AN OBLIGATION OF BUYER AND SELLERS TO
INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS SELLERS AND BUYER, RESPECTIVELY, AGAINST
(I) CLAIMS ASSERTED BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING THIRD PARTY CLAIMS FOR ANY OF
THE FOREGOING TYPES OF DAMAGES, (II) CLAIMS OF FRAUD OR (III) CLAIMS FOR
BREACH OF SECTIONS 9.7 OR 14.8.

15.5 Procedure. The indemnifications contained in Sections 15.2 and 15.3 shall
be implemented as follows:

(a) Coverage. Such indemnity shall extend to all Losses suffered or incurred
by the indemnified Person.







(b) Claim Notice. The Person seeking indemnification under the terms of this
Agreement ("Indemnified Party") shall submit a written "Claim Notice" to the
Party or Parties responsible hereunder to indemnify the Indemnified Party
("Indemnifying Party" or "Indemnifying Parties"), which Claim Notice shall
provide to the extent then reasonably known by such Indemnified Party: (i) the
amount of each payment claimed by an Indemnified Party to be owing and (ii)
the basis for such Claim, with supporting documentation. The amount claimed
shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the extent required herein within
thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim Notice, or after the amount of
such payment has been finally established pursuant to Section 16.7, whichever
last occurs.

(c) Information. If the Indemnified Party receives written notice of a Claim
or Legal Action that may result in a Loss for which indemnification may be
sought under this Article 15 (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party
shall endeavor to give written notice of such Third Party Claim to the
Indemnifying Party as soon as is practicable. If the Indemnifying Party or its
counsel so requests, the Indemnified Party shall furnish the Indemnifying
Party with copies of all pleadings and other information with respect to such
Third Party Claim. At the election of the Indemnifying Party made within sixty
(60) days after receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall permit the
Indemnifying Party to assume control of such Third Party Claim (to the extent
only that such Third Party Claim, legal action or other matter relates to a
Loss for which the Indemnifying Party is liable), including the determination
of all appropriate actions, the negotiation of settlements on behalf of the
Indemnified Party, and the conduct of litigation through attorneys of the
Indemnifying Party's choice; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party
shall not have the right to assume control of the Claim if, in the reasonable
opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (i) there are legal defenses
available to the Indemnified Party that are materially different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party, or (ii) a conflict of
interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party exists in
respect of such Claim that would make representation of the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party impermissible under applicable standards of
professional conduct, and in either of those events the reasonable fees and
expenses of one separate counsel for all Indemnified Parties shall be paid by
such Indemnifying Party; provided, further, however, that any settlement of
the Third Party Claim by the Indemnifying Party may not result in any
liability or cost to the Indemnified Party without its prior written consent,
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Indemnifying
Party elects to assume control, (y) any expense incurred by the Indemnified
Party thereafter for investigation or defense of the matter shall be borne by
the Indemnified Party, and (z) the Indemnified Party shall give all reasonable
information and assistance, other than pecuniary, that the Indemnifying Party
shall deem necessary to the proper defense of such Third Party Claim. In the
absence of such an election, the Indemnified Party will use its reasonable
best efforts to defend, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, any Third Party
Claim or other matter to which such other Party's indemnification under this
Article 15 applies until the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense. If the
Indemnifying Party fails to assume such defense within the time period
provided above or fails to diligently defend such defense, the Indemnified
Party may settle the Third Party Claim, in its reasonable discretion, at the
Indemnifying Party's expense (subject to it being agreed or determined
pursuant to Section 16.7 that the



Indemnifying Party has an indemnification obligation with respect thereto). If
such a Third Party Claim requires immediate action, both the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party will cooperate in good faith to take appropriate
action so as not to jeopardize defense of such Third Party Claim or any
Party's position with respect to such Third Party Claim.

(d) Joint Indemnification Matters.

(i) In the event both Sellers are an Indemnifying Party hereunder in respect
of the same Third Party Claim (a "Joint Indemnification Matter") and either
Seller determines to assume control of the defense of such Joint
Indemnification Matter under Section 15.5(c), then Sellers shall (A) jointly
agree upon and select counsel to defend such Joint Indemnification Matter, and
(B) jointly agree upon the litigation strategy and all actions taken to defend
such Joint Indemnification Matter. If the Sellers cannot agree upon and select
counsel to defend any such Joint Indemnification Matter as required by the
preceding sentence, then each Seller shall select counsel to defend their
respective interests with respect to the Joint Indemnification Matter.

(ii) The Parties agree that the admission of liability, consent to judgement
or entry into settlement with respect to any Third Party Claim, or consent to
entry of any judgment or entry into any settlement with respect to a Joint
Indemnification Matter by one Seller shall not be binding on the other Seller
and shall not in any event whatsoever be deemed or construed to be an
admission of liability of the other Seller with respect to such matter or
evidence that such other Seller is liable with respect to such matter.

15.6 No Insurance; Subrogation. The indemnifications provided in this Article
15 shall not be construed as a form of insurance. Buyer and Sellers hereby
waive for themselves, their respective successors or assigns, including any
insurers, any rights to subrogation for Losses for which each of them is
respectively liable or against which each respectively indemnifies the other,
and, if required by applicable policies, Buyer and Sellers shall obtain waiver
of such subrogation from their respective insurers.

15.7 Reservation as to Non-Parties. Nothing herein is intended to limit or
otherwise waive any recourse Buyer or Sellers may have against any non-Party
for any obligations or liabilities that may be incurred with respect to the
Assets.

15.8 Express Negligence. THE FOREGOING ASSUMPTIONS AND INDEMNIFICATIONS SHALL
APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DUTIES, OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITIES, OR SUCH CLAIMS
ARISE OUT OF (A) NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING SOLE NEGLIGENCE, SINGLE NEGLIGENCE,
CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXPRESSLY NOT
INCLUDING FRAUD, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR INTENTIONAL VIOLATION
OF APPLICABLE LAW) OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY, OR (B) STRICT LIABILITY. THIS
STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND IS CONSPICUOUS.



15.9 Characterization of Certain Payments . The Parties agree that any
payments made pursuant to this Article 15 shall be treated for all Tax
purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price unless otherwise required by
Law.

15.10 Exclusive Remedies. If the Closing occurs, the indemnity obligations set
forth in this Article 15 and the rights to specific performance and equitable
remedies contemplated in Section 16.13 shall, in the absence of Fraud in the
negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement, be the exclusive
remedies for the Parties for the breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, the Transaction
Certificates or the Conveyances or any Claim arising out of, resulting from or
related to the Transactions, other than the Ancillary Agreements (which shall
be subject to the remedies set forth therein between the parties thereto).

ARTICLE 16

assignment, the references in this Agreement to such assigning Party will also
apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires. This
Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and

16.5 Press Releases and Public Announcements. Notwithstanding Section 14.8 or

issue press releases or make public announcements relating to the Transactions
following consultation with and notifications to the other Parties, including
any public disclosure such Party believes in good faith is required by

Transactions to securities regulators and stock exchanges, its advisors
(including underwriters and their counsel), financial institutions, potential
investors, and their respective advisors, and the investing public, whether by
way of prospectus, information memorandum, filing with securities regulatory
authorities or otherwise.



16.6 Counterparts/Fax Signatures. This Agreement may be executed by Buyer and
Sellers in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original instrument, but all of which together shall constitute but one and
the same instrument. The exchange of copies of this Agreement and of signature
pages by facsimile or by electronic image scan transmission in .pdf format
shall constitute effective execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the
Parties and may be used in lieu of the original Agreement for all purposes.
Signatures of the Parties transmitted by facsimile or electronic image scan
transmission in .pdf format shall be deemed to be their original signatures
for all purposes. Any Party that delivers an executed counterpart signature
page by facsimile or by electronic scan transmission in .pdf format shall
promptly thereafter deliver a manually executed counterpart signature page to
the other Parties; provided, however, that the failure to do so shall not
affect the validity, enforceability, or binding effect of this Agreement.

16.7 Governing Law/Venue.

(a) This Agreement and the Transactions shall be construed in accordance with,
and governed by, the Laws of the State of Delaware except to the extent that
the subject matter of the dispute involves the validity or conveyance of, or
any representations and warranties with respect to, the Real Property and the
Easements in which case the Law of the jurisdiction in which such Real
Property and Easements are located shall apply to the limited extent necessary
to resolve the validity or conveyance of, or any representations and
warranties with respect to, the Real Property and the Easements.

(b) The Parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal
or state court sitting in Denver, Colorado, for purposes of all legal disputes
or proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the obligations
contemplated hereby, and agree that such courts shall be the exclusive forum
resolving any dispute or controversy under or with respect to this Agreement.
The Parties hereby irrevocably waive any objection which they may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue or any such proceeding brought in
such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each Party further agrees that it
will not bring suit with respect to any disputes based upon, arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the Transactions in any court other than in
Denver, Colorado. The preceding sentence will not limit the rights of the
Parties to obtain execution of a judgment in any other jurisdiction.

(c) THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THEY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY DISPUTES BASED ON, ARISING OUT OF OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREES THAT ANY SUCH
DISPUTE WILL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES MAY
FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE
PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

16.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules attached
hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire understanding
between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, superseding all
written or oral negotiations and discussions, and prior agreements and
understandings relating to such subject matter.



16.9 Knowledge. The "Knowledge" of a Party shall mean, for purposes of this
Agreement, the actual knowledge, with respect to each Seller, as applicable,
and Buyer, only of the persons listed on Schedule 16.9. For the avoidance of
doubt, where the context refers to the "Knowledge" of one or both Sellers
(including in Article 6 and Article 7), the actual knowledge of a person
listed for one Seller on Schedule 16.9 (a) shall be attributed only to the
Seller for which such person is listed and (b) shall not be attributed to the
other Seller (unless such person is also listed as a person with actual
knowledge on Schedule 16.9 for such other Seller). "Actual knowledge" for
purposes of this Section 16.9 means information actually personally known by
such identified persons without any duty of inquiry.

16.10 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to
the benefit of, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

16.11 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as expressly provided in Article 15
this Agreement is intended to benefit only the Parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns and there are no other Third Party
beneficiaries to this Agreement.

16.12 Identity of Whiting and Operator. Whiting is described in this Agreement
alternatively as the "Operator" and as a "Seller." For the avoidance of doubt,
there is no division, difference or distinction between Whiting identified
herein as "Operator" or as "Seller" with respect to Buyer's rights and
remedies under this Agreement or with respect to the covenants, performance
obligations, representations and warranties made by Whiting as "Operator" or
as "Seller" in this Agreement and the other documents executed at Closing.

16.13 Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges and hereby agrees that any
breach of this Agreement may give rise to irreparable harm for which monetary
damages may not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, subject to the provisions
of Section 12.3, (a) the Parties acknowledge and agree that in the event of
any breach or threatened breach by Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the
other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in
this Agreement, Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement, and to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other
under this Agreement and (b) Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, hereby agree not to raise any objection to the availability of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement, by Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer,
on the other hand, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of
this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the Parties under this
Agreement.
