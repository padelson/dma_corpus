Schulman, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( _"Parent"_ ), Wildcat Spider, LLC, a Texas limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ( _"Merger Sub"_ ), and ICO, Inc., a Texas corporation (the _"Company"_ ). 

  

W I T N E S S E T H:  

  

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company and Parent have each determined that a business combination between Parent and the Company is in the best interests of their respective companies and stockholders and, accordingly, have agreed to effect the merger of the Company with and into the Merger Sub (the _"Merger"_ ), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Texas Business Organizations Code (the  _"TBOC"_ ), whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, no par value per share, of the Company ( _"Company Common Stock"_ ), other than Dissenting Shares and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent or held in the treasury of the Company, will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined in  _Section 2.1_); 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that the Merger is advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger; and 

  

 WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that (i) the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the _"Code"_ ) and the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (the _"Treasury Regulations"_ ), and any comparable provisions of state or local Law, (ii) Merger Sub be disregarded as an entity separate from Parent and (iii) this Agreement be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the Code and Treasury Regulations. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the _"Closing"_ ) will take place at a time and on a date to be specified by the parties hereto, which is to be no later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver by the party entitled to the benefit thereof of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but subject to the fulfillment or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver by the party entitled to the benefit of those conditions) set forth in _Article VI_ , unless another time or date is agreed to by the parties hereto. The Closing will be held at the offices of Jones Day, 901 Lakeside Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44114, or such other location to which the parties hereto agree in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the _"Closing Date_. _"_  

  

 Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, (i) as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by delivering to the Secretary of State of the State of Texas (the _"Texas Secretary of State"_ ) a certificate of merger (the _"Certificate of Merge_ r") in such form as is required by and executed in accordance with Section 10.151 of the TBOC and (ii) as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, the parties shall make all other filings or recordings required under the TBOC. The Merger will become effective when the Certificate of Merger is accepted by the Texas Secretary of State or at such later date and time or on the occurrence of a future event or fact as the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective is hereinafter referred to as the _"Effective Time"_ ). 

  

 Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger will have the effects set forth in Section 10.008 of the TBOC and all other applicable provisions of the TBOC. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub will be vested in the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company. 

  

 Section 1.5 _Certificate of Formation and Limited Liability Company Agreement_. Subject to _Section 5.5_, at the Effective Time, the certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, will be the certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

  

 Section 1.6 _Managers and Officers of the Surviving Company_. The managers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the managers of the Surviving Company, until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving Company, until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 

   #####

It is intended by the parties hereto that (i) the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and Treasury Regulations, and any comparable provisions of applicable state or local Law, and (ii) Merger Sub be disregarded as an entity separate from Parent. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the Code and Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the Treasury Regulations, and for all relevant tax purposes.

Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent or any direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time and any Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.2(e)_, each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other than shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares, will be converted into the right to receive (i) the Cash Consideration, without interest and (ii) a number of validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Parent ( _"Parent Common Stock"_ ) equal to the Exchange Ratio (the " _Stock Consideration_ "). The Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration, and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by _Section 2.2(e)_ are referred to collectively as the " _Merger Consideration_." The _"Cash Consideration"_ shall be equal to the quotient, rounded down to the nearest whole cent, obtained by dividing the Cash Pool by the Outstanding Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The _"Exchange Ratio"_ shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the Fixed Parent Stock Number by the Outstanding Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The _"Outstanding Shares"_ shall (A) for purposes of this _Section 2.1(c)_, be the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the time of such calculation (ignoring for this purpose any shares of Company Common Stock canceled pursuant to  _Section 2.1(b)_) less the number of Dissenting Shares and (B) for purposes of _Section 2.1(e)_ , be the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the time of such calculation (ignoring for this purpose any shares of Company Common Stock canceled pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_), calculated on a fully diluted basis using the treasury stock method, less the number of Dissenting Shares. _"Cash Pool"_ shall (A) for 

   ##### 

  

    

purposes of this _Section 2.1(c)_ , be equal to $105,000,000 less any cash
amounts paid or to be paid pursuant to  _Section 2.1(e)_ (including any
applicable withholding in respect thereof) and less any cash amounts paid by
the Company to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company Common Stock
or other equity securities (including Company Stock Options) of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries, in each case, after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ , that the Cash Pool shall be
reduced by the product of the number of any Dissenting Shares multiplied by
the sum of (x) the Cash Consideration calculated as if there were no such
Dissenting Shares and (y) the product of the Exchange Ratio calculated as if
there were no such Dissenting Shares multiplied by the Average Closing Price
and (B) for purposes of _Section 2.1(e)_ , be equal to $105,000,000 less any
cash amounts paid by the Company to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
Company Common Stock or other equity securities (including Company
Stock Options) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, in each case, after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that
the Cash Pool shall be reduced by the product of the number of any Dissenting
Shares multiplied by the sum of (x) the Cash Consideration calculated as if
there were no such Dissenting Shares (or, for the avoidance of doubt, cash
amounts paid or to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_ (including any
applicable withholding in respect thereof)) and (y) the product of the
Exchange Ratio calculated as if there were no such Dissenting Shares
multiplied by the Average Closing Price. _"Fixed Parent Stock Number"_ shall
be equal to 5,100,000. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall (i) the
aggregate amount of cash paid pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ exceed
$105,000,000 and (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock
issued pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ exceed the Fixed Parent Stock
Number. 

  

 (d) _Cancellation of Shares of Company Common Stock_. As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock, other than Dissenting Shares, shall no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate formerly representing any shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Certificate_ ") or book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, certain dividends or other distributions, if any, upon surrender of such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, in each case, in accordance with this _Article II_, without interest. 

  

 (e) _Treatment of Outstanding Company Stock Options_. Each holder of a Company Stock Option that is not exercised prior to the Effective Time shall have the right, following the termination of the holders unexercised Company Stock Options as of the Effective Time, to receive from the Surviving Company in respect thereof an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously subject to such Company Stock Option, and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration Value over the exercise price per share previously subject to such Company Stock Option, without interest and reduced by any applicable withholding. For this purpose, _"Merger Consideration Value"_ equals the sum of (i) the Cash Consideration and (ii) the product of the Average Closing Price and the Exchange Ratio. 

  

 Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will designate a national bank or trust company, that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to act as agent of Parent for purposes of, among other things, mailing and receiving transmittal letters and 

   ##### 

  

    

distributing the Merger Consideration to the Company stockholders (the
_"Exchange Agent"_ ). Parent and the Exchange Agent shall enter into an
agreement which will provide that Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent as of the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this _Article
II_, through the Exchange Agent, (i) immediately available funds sufficient
to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration for all of the Outstanding Shares and
(ii) certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock (such
cash and such shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto with a record date after the Effective
Time and any cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock, being hereinafter referred to as the _"Exchange Fund"_ )
issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1_ in exchange for all of the Outstanding
Shares. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. 

   

 (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any case within five Business Days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Company Certificate or Book-Entry Share whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and such letter of transmittal will be in such customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify consistent with this Agreement) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (ii) After the Effective Time, and upon surrender in accordance with this _Article II_ of a Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration in the form of (A) a certificate or book-entry share representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_, after taking into account all the  shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder under all such Book-Entry Shares or Company Certificates so surrendered and (B) a cash payment for the full amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_, including the Cash Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and certain dividends or other distributions, if any, in accordance with _Section 2.2(c),_ and the Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered will forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Company Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered (the  _"Transferee"_ ) if such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Share is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and the Transferee pays any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such payment to a person other 

   ##### 

  

    

than the registered holder of such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
or establishes to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.2(b)_, each Company Certificate and each Book-Entry Share will
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration that the holder thereof
has the right to receive in respect of such Company Certificate pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article II_ and certain dividends or other
distributions, if any, in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_. No interest will
be paid or will accrue on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of
Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this 
_Article II_. 

  

 (c) _Dividends; Other Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares will be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_, and all such dividends, other distributions and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and will be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar Laws, following surrender of any such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance herewith, there will be paid to the holder of the certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, in addition to all other amounts to which such holder is entitled under this _Article II_, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued and all Cash Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ (and any cash paid pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and _Section 2.2(e)_) will be deemed to have been issued or paid, as the case may be, in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Company Certificates and such Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving Companys obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions, in each case with a record date (i) prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or (ii) prior to the date of this Agreement, and in each case which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and there will be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they will be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_. 

   ##### 

   

  

 (e) _No Fractional Shares_. 

   

 (i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no dividend or distribution of Parent will relate to such fractional share interests and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. 

   

 (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent and without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such former holder would otherwise be entitled (rounded up to the nearest ten thousandth when expressed in decimal form) by (B) the average closing price for a share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ , or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source) for the ten consecutive trading days ending with the fifth complete trading day prior to, but not including, the Closing Date (the " _Average Closing Price_ "). 

   

 (iii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock with respect to any fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such holders of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock subject to and in accordance with the terms of _Section 2.2(c)_. 

   

 (iv) The parties hereto acknowledge that the payment of cash in lieu of fractional  shares is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent of issuing and maintaining fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained for consideration. 

  

 (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for twelve months after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ may thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration and dividends or distributions, if any, with respect to Parent Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 (g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent will be liable to any person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock, any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any cash from the Exchange Fund, in each case, delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, on a daily basis, provided, that, (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days, or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments will be paid to Parent. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. 

  

 (i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Company Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate, the Merger Consideration and, if applicable, any unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, in each case, due to such person pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 2.3 _Certain Adjustments_. If, after the date of this Agreement and at or prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock are changed into a different number of shares or type of securities by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, stock split, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend payable in stock or other securities is declared thereon or rights issued in respect thereof with a record date within such period, or any similar event occurs (any such action, an _"Adjustment Event"_ ), the Merger Consideration will be adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such Adjustment Event. 

  

 Section 2.4 _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any person that is entitled to demand and properly demands payment of the fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to, and that complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 10.356 of the TBOC, and does not properly withdraw such demand in accordance with Section 10.357 of the TBOC or otherwise become ineligible for such payment pursuant to Section 10.367 of the TBOC, in each case prior to the Effective Time (the _"Dissenting Shares"_ ), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.1(c)_, but, instead, such person shall be entitled to such rights (but only such rights) as are granted by Section 10.354 of the TBOC. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and automatically shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and, except as otherwise provided by applicable Law, each 

   ##### 

  

    

holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to
the Dissenting Shares, other than such rights as are granted by Section
10.354 of the TBOC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such person (i)
shall have failed to establish entitlement to relief as a dissenting
stockholder as provided in Section 10.361 of the TBOC, (ii) shall
have effectively withdrawn demand for relief as a dissenting stockholder with
respect to such Dissenting Shares under Section 10.357 of the TBOC or lost
the right to relief as a dissenting stockholder under Section 10.356 of the
TBOC or (iii) shall have failed to file a petition with the appropriate court
seeking relief as to the determination of the value of all such Dissenting
Shares within the time provided in Section 10.361 of the TBOC, such person
shall forfeit or, in the event a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such person is not entitled to the relief provided by Section
10.361 of the TBOC, lose the right to relief as a dissenting stockholder with
respect to such Dissenting Shares, and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed
to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.1(c)_
without interest. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock and any
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the TBOC and received by the Company relating to stockholder
dissent rights, and Parent shall have the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

  

 Section 2.5 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Company will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Company any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Company as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger. 

  

 Section 2.6 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Company, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are properly withheld and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority by the Surviving Company, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such amounts withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Company, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. Parent shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all amounts so withheld to the appropriate taxing authority within the period required under applicable Law.

   ##### 

  

    

reference to the representations and warranties to which such exceptions and
qualifications relate) on the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to
Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the _"Company Disclosure

disclosure that such disclosure applies to or qualifies such other
representation or warranty, and except as set forth in the Recent SEC
Reports, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub
as follows: 

  

 (a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_.

The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company has made available to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement complete and correct copies of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as amended to date (the _"Company Charter"_ ) and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company, as amended to date (the _"Company Bylaws"_ ).

The Company does not, directly or indirectly, own more than 20% but less than 100% of the capital stock or other equity interest in any person.

payment based on the revenues, earnings or financial performance of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or assets or calculated in accordance
therewith. 

  

 Except for the Credit Agreement dated October 27, 2006, as amended, among the Company, Bayshore Industrial L.P., ICO Polymers North America, Inc., Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, KeyBank, National Association, and the other lending institutions named therein (the _"Company Credit Agreement"_ ), and except for the other agreements set forth on _Section 3.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, no indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company or any Company Subsidiary contains any restrictions (other than customary notice provisions) upon (i) the prepayment of any indebtedness of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) the incurrence by the Company or any Company Subsidiary of any indebtedness for borrowed money, or (iii) the ability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to grant any Lien on the properties or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 (i) The Company has timely filed all required reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the _"Securities Act"_ ) and the Exchange Act with the SEC since September 30, 2007 (as such reports, schedules, forms, statements and documents have been amended since the time of their 

   ##### 

  

    

filing, collectively, the _"Company SEC Documents"_ ). As of their respective
dates, or if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of
the last such amendment, the Company SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Documents, and none of the Company
SEC Documents when filed, or as so amended, contained any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date
of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment
letters received from the staff of the SEC. 

   

 (ii) The financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents comply as to form, as of their respective date of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( _"GAAP"_ ) (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated statements of income, cash flows and stockholders equity for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal recurring year-end audit adjustments). No Company Subsidiary is required to make any filings with the SEC. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed since September 30, 2008 and prior to the date of this Agreement (the _"Recent SEC Reports"_ ), since September 30, 2008, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have not incurred any liabilities (direct, contingent or otherwise) that are of a nature that would be required to be disclosed on a balance sheet of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or the footnotes thereto prepared in conformity with GAAP, other than (A) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and (B) liabilities that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. 

   

 (iii) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or their accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom) except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described in the following sentence. As and to the extent described in the Company SEC Documents, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company (A) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as required by Rule 13a-15(a) of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material 

    ##### 

   

   

information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries,
is made known to the management of the Company by others within those
entities, and (B) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
the date hereof, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the
Companys Board of Directors (1) any significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Companys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and has
identified for the Companys auditors any material weaknesses in internal
controls and (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal
controls. The Company has made available to Parent a summary of any
such disclosure made by Company management to the Companys auditors or audit
committee of the Companys Board of Directors since September 30, 2007. 

  

 (f) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC by Parent in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger (the _"Form S-4"_) will, at the time the Form S-4 becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or (ii) the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the Companys stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. 

  

 (g) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except for liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, since September 30, 2008, (i) each of the Company Entities has conducted its respective operations only in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, (ii) there has not been any event, circumstance, change, occurrence or state of facts that has had or would reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company, and (iii) no Company Entity has engaged in any material transaction or entered into any material agreement or commitment outside the ordinary course of business (except for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). 

  

 (h) _Compliance with Applicable Laws; Litigation_. 

   

 (i) Since January 1, 2007, the operations of the Company Entities have not been and are not being conducted in violation of any Law (including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001) or any Permit necessary for the conduct of their respective businesses as currently conducted, except where such violations, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. None of the Company 

   ##### 

  

    

Entities has received any written notice, or has knowledge, of any claim
alleging any such violation. 

   

 (ii) The Company Entities hold all licenses, permits, variances, consents, authorizations, waivers, grants, franchises, concessions, exemptions, orders, registrations and approvals of Governmental Entities or other persons ( _"Permits"_ ) necessary for the conduct of their respective businesses as currently conducted, except where the failure to hold such Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. None of the Company Entities has received written notice that any such Permit will be terminated or modified or cannot be renewed in the ordinary course of business, and the Company has no knowledge of any reasonable basis for any such termination, modification or nonrenewal, except for such terminations, modifications or nonrenewals as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not violate any such Permit, or result in any termination, modification or nonrenewals thereof, except for such violations, terminations, modifications or nonrenewals thereof as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. 

   

 (iii) There is no suit, action or proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, except for any such suit, action or proceeding that challenges or seeks to prohibit the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or against the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their properties or assets that would reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no suit, action or proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the Company or any Company Subsidiary challenging or seeking to prohibit the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (i) _Employee Benefit Plans_. 

   

 (i) The Company has made available to Parent a true and complete list of (A) each material bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase, stock option, equity compensation, retirement, vacation, employment, disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical insurance, life insurance, welfare, severance or other employee benefit plan, agreement, arrangement or understanding maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary contributes or is obligated to contribute or with respect to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any material liability, and (B) each change of control agreement and each material employment or severance agreement providing benefits (other than those benefits required by applicable Law or customarily provided in such jurisdiction) to any current or former employee, officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, to 

   ##### 

  

    

which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company
or any Company Subsidiary is bound (collectively, the _"Company Benefit
Plans"_ ). With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, no event has occurred
and there exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary could be subject to any liability
that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have
or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liability (including contingent
liability) with respect to any plan, agreement, arrangement or understanding
of the type described in this paragraph other than the Company Benefit Plans,
other than liability which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the
Company. 

   

 (ii) Each Company Benefit Plan has been administered in accordance with its terms, all applicable Laws, including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ( _"ERISA"_ ), and the Code, and the terms of all applicable collective bargaining agreements, except for any failures so to administer any Company Benefit Plan that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company and all Company Benefit Plans are in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws and the terms of all applicable collective bargaining agreements, except for any failures to be in such compliance that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a), 401(k) or 4975(e)(7) of the Code has received a favorable determination and/or opinion letter from the IRS as to its qualified status and, to the knowledge of the Company, there exist no facts or circumstances that have caused or could cause a failure to be so qualified under Section 401(a), 401(k) or 4975(e)(7) of the Code. No fact or event has occurred which is reasonably likely to affect adversely the qualified status of any such Company Benefit Plan or the exempt status of any such trust, except for any occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. All contributions to, and payments from, the Company Benefit Plans that are required to have been made in accordance with such Company Benefit Plans, ERISA or the Code have been timely made other than any failures that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. All trusts providing funding for Company Benefit Plans that are intended to comply with Section 501(c)(9) of the Code are exempt from federal income taxation and, together with any other welfare benefit funds (as defined in Section 419(e)(1) of the Code) maintained in connection with any of the Company Benefit Plans, have been operated and administered in compliance with all applicable requirements such that neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary, any Company Benefit Plan nor such trust or fund is subject to any taxes, penalties or other liabilities imposed as a consequence of failure to comply with such requirements. No welfare benefit fund (as defined in Section 419(e)(1) of the Code) maintained in connection with any of the Company Benefit Plans has provided any "disqualified benefit" (as defined in Section 4976(b)(1) of the Code) for which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has or had any liability for the excise tax imposed by Section 4976 of the Code which has not been paid in full. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) Other than as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company, neither the Company nor any trade or business, whether or not incorporated, which, together with the Company, would be deemed to be a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA or Section 414(b) or 414(c) of the Code (a  _"Company ERISA Affiliate"_ ) has incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than for premiums pursuant to Section 4007 of ERISA which have been timely paid) or Section 4971 of the Code, and no condition exists that presents a risk to the Company or any Company ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such liability or failure. Each Company Benefit Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan) to which Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA applies has satisfied the requirements of Sections 412, 430 and 436 of the Code and Sections 302 and 303 of ERISA, and no such Company Benefit Plan is in "at-risk status" within the meaning of Section 430(i)(4) of the Code or Section 303(i)(4) of ERISA or subject to the limitations of Section 436 of the Code. No Company Benefit Plan has or has incurred an accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, nor has any waiver of the minimum funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code been requested of or granted by the Internal Revenue Service with respect to any Company Benefit Plan, nor has any Lien in favor of any Company Benefit Plan arisen under Sections 412(n) or 430(k) of the Code or Sections 302(f) or 303(k) of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any Company ERISA Affiliate has been required to provide security to any defined benefit pension plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code or Sections 306 or 307 of ERISA. With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Sections 412 or 4971 of the Code that is not a Multiemployer Plan, the fair market value of the assets of such Company Benefit Plan equals or exceeds the actuarial present value of all accrued benefits under such Company Benefit Plan (whether or not vested), based upon the actuarial assumptions used to prepare the most recent actuarial report for such Company Benefit Plan and, to the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred which would be reasonably expected to change any such funded status. There has been no "reportable event" within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations and interpretations thereunder which has not been fully and accurately reported in a timely fashion, as required, or which, whether or not reported, would constitute grounds for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the _"PBGC"_ ) to institute termination proceedings with respect to any Company Benefit Plan. The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any Company Benefit Plan. 

   

 (iv) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company, no Company Benefit Plan provides medical or life insurance benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to current or former employees or officers or directors after retirement or other termination of service, other than any such coverage required by Law, and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have reserved all rights necessary to amend or terminate each of the Company Benefit Plans without the consent of any other person. 

   

 (v) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another event, (A) entitle any current or former employee, officer or director of the Company or the Company 

   ##### 

  

    

Subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment,
except as expressly provided in this Agreement, or (B) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any such
employee, officer or director. 

   

 (vi) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any agreement, contract or arrangement (including this Agreement) that could result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. No Company Benefit Plan provides for the reimbursement of excise taxes under Section 4999 of the Code or any income taxes under the Code. The deductions taken by the Company or any Company Subsidiary related to compensation paid to its named executive officers under any Company Benefit Plan have been made in material compliance with or pursuant to exceptions from the limitations set forth in Section 162(m) of the Code. 

   

 (vii) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has delivered or made available to Parent a true and complete copy of: (A) each writing constituting a part of such Company Benefit Plan, including all Company Benefit Plan documents and trust agreements; (B) the three most recent Annual Reports (Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedules, if any; (C) the most recent annual financial report, if any; (D) the most recent actuarial report, if any; and (E) the most recent determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, if any. Except as specifically provided in the foregoing documents delivered or made available to Parent, there are no material amendments to any Company Benefit Plan that have been adopted or approved nor has the Company or any Company Subsidiary undertaken to make any such material amendments or to adopt or approve any new Company Benefit Plan. 

   

 (viii) No Company Benefit Plan is a multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a _"Multiemployer Plan"_ ) or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a _"Multiple Employer Plan"_ ). None of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Company ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan. None of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Company ERISA Affiliates has incurred any material withdrawal liability under a Multiemployer Plan that has not been satisfied in full, nor does the Company have any material contingent liability with respect to any withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan. None of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Company ERISA Affiliates would incur any material withdrawal liability (within the meaning of Part 1 of Subtitle E of Title I of ERISA) if the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Company ERISA Affiliates withdrew (within the meaning of Part 1 of Subtitle E of Title I of ERISA) on or prior to the Closing Date from each Multiemployer Plan to which the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Company ERISA Affiliates has an obligation to contribute on the date of this Agreement. No Multiemployer Plan to which the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Company ERISA Affiliates contributes or otherwise has any liability (contingent or otherwise) has incurred an accumulated funding deficiency within the 

   ##### 

  

    

meaning of Section 431(a) of the Code or Section 304(a) of ERISA, is
insolvent, is in reorganization (within the meaning of Section 4241 of
ERISA), is reasonably likely to commence reorganization, is in "endangered"
or "critical" status (as such terms are defined in Section 432 of the Code)
or is reasonably likely to be in endangered or critical status. 

   

 (ix) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, or to the Companys knowledge, no set of circumstances exists that may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Company Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Company Benefit Plans that could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the United States Department of Treasury, the United States Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, any Company Benefit Plan, any participant in a Company Benefit Plan, any employee benefit plan with respect to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any contingent liability, or any participant in an employee benefit plan with respect to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any contingent liability. 

   

 (x) There have been no prohibited transactions or breaches of any of the duties imposed on "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA with respect to the Company Benefit Plans that could result in any liability or excise tax under ERISA or the Code being imposed on the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, except as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. 

   

 (xi) All contributions, transfers and payments for the benefit of U.S. employees in respect of any Company Benefit Plan, other than transfers incident to an incentive stock option plan within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, have been or are fully deductible under the Code, except as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. 

   

 (xii) With respect to any insurance policy that has, or does, provide funding for benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, to the knowledge of the Company, no insurance company issuing any such policy is in receivership, conservatorship, liquidation or similar proceeding and, to the knowledge of the Company, no such proceedings with respect to any insurer are imminent. 

   

 (xiii) For purposes of this _Section 3.1(i)_ only, the term _"employee"_ will be considered to include individuals rendering personal services to the Company or any Company Subsidiary as independent contractors. 

   

 (xiv) _"Company Foreign Plan"_ means any Company Benefit Plan that is maintained outside of the United States. Each Company Foreign Plan complies with all applicable Law (including applicable Law regarding the form, funding and operation of the Foreign Plan), except as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. The financial statements of the Company 

   ##### 

  

    

included in the Company SEC Documents accurately reflect the Company Foreign
Plan liabilities and accruals for contributions required to be paid to the
Company Foreign Plans, in accordance with applicable generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. All
contributions required to have been made to all Company Foreign Plans as of
the Closing will have been made as of the Closing. There are no actions, suits
or claims pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened with respect to
the Company Foreign Plans (other than routine claims for benefits), except as
would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse
effect on the Company. There have not occurred, nor are there continuing any
transactions or breaches of fiduciary duty under applicable Law with respect
to any Company Foreign Plan which would reasonably be expected to have or
result in a material adverse effect on the Company. 

  

 (j) _Taxes_. (i) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has filed all Tax Returns required to be filed, and all such returns are materially correct and complete; (ii) the Company and each Company Subsidiary has paid all Taxes due whether or not shown on any Tax Return; (iii) there are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, audits, examinations, investigations or other proceedings in respect of Taxes relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary; (iv) there are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, other than Liens for Taxes not yet due and Liens for Taxes that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings; (v) neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has any liability for Taxes of any person (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any comparable provision of Law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise; (vi) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any agreement or arrangement relating to the allocation, sharing or indemnification of Taxes; (vii) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has taken any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and Treasury Regulations; (viii) no deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against the Company or any Company Subsidiary for which adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP have not been created; (ix) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary will be required to include any adjustment in taxable income for any Tax period ending after the Closing Date (a _"Post-Closing Tax Period"_ ) under Section 481(c) of the Code (or any comparable provision of Law) as a result of a change in method of accounting for any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending prior to the Closing Date (a _"Pre-Closing Tax Period"_ ) or pursuant to the provisions of any agreement entered into with any taxing authority with regard to the Tax liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period; (x) the financial statements included in the Company SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve in accordance with GAAP for all Taxes for which the Company or any Company Subsidiary may be liable for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date hereof; (xi) no person has granted any extension or waiver of the statute of limitations period applicable to any Tax of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any affiliated, combined or unitary group of which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is or was a member, which period (after giving effect to such extension or waiver) has not yet expired, and there is no currently effective "closing agreement" pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code (or any similar provision of foreign, state or local Law); (xii) the Company and each Company

stockholder, or other third party; (xiii) neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has distributed the stock of another person or has had its stock
distributed by another person, in a transaction that was purported or
intended to be governed in whole or in part by Section 355 of the Code; (xiv)
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has participated in any
transaction that has been identified by the Internal Revenue Service in
any published guidance as a reportable transaction; and (xv) the consolidated
federal income Tax Returns of the Company have been examined, or the statute
of limitations has closed, with respect to all taxable years through and
including 2005. 

  

 (k) _Environmental Matters_. 

   

 (i) Except where noncompliance, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company, the Company Entities are and have been for the past three years in compliance with all applicable Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Environmental Permits. 

   

 (ii) There are no written Environmental, Health and Safety Claims pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the Company or any Company Subsidiary and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no existing conditions, circumstances or facts which could give rise to an Environmental, Health and Safety Claim, other than Environmental, Health and Safety Claims or conditions, circumstances or facts as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. 

   

 (iii) The Company has made available to Parent all material information, including such studies, reports, correspondence, notices of violation, requests for information, audits, analyses and test results and any other documents, in the possession, custody or control of the Company Entities relating to (A) the Company Entities compliance or noncompliance with Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Environmental Permits within the previous three years, and (B) Environmental Conditions on, under or about any of the properties or assets owned, leased, operated or otherwise used by any of the Company Entities at the present time or for which any of the Company Entities may be responsible or liable. 

   

 (iv) No Hazardous Substance has been generated, treated, stored, disposed of, used, handled or manufactured at, or transported, shipped or disposed of from, currently or previously owned, leased, operated or otherwise used properties in violation of applicable Environmental, Health and Safety Laws or Environmental Permits that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company, and there have been no Releases of any Hazardous Substance in, on, under, from or affecting any currently or previously owned, leased, operated or otherwise used properties that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. 

   

 (v) None of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries has received from any Governmental Entity or other third party any written (or, to the knowledge of 

   ##### 

  

    

the Company, other) notice that any of them or any of their predecessors is or
may be a potentially responsible party in respect of, or may otherwise bear
liability for, any actual or threatened Release of any Hazardous Substance at
any site or facility that is, has been or could reasonably be expected to be
listed on the National Priorities List, the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Information System, the National
Corrective Action Priority System or any similar or analogous federal,
state, provincial, territorial, municipal, county, local or other domestic or
foreign list, schedule, inventory or database of Hazardous Substance sites or
facilities. 

   

 (vi) Neither this Agreement nor the transactions contemplated hereby will result in any requirement for environmental disclosure, investigation, cleanup, removal or remedial action, or notification to or consent of any Governmental Entity or third party, with respect to any property owned, leased, operated or otherwise used by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, pursuant to any Environmental, Health and Safety Law, including any so-called "property transfer law." 

   

 (vii) None of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries has assumed, undertaken or otherwise become subject to any liability of any other person relating to or arising from Environmental, Health and Safety Laws, except as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. 

   

 (viii) There exist no Environmental Conditions relating to any currently or previously owned, leased, operated or otherwise used properties which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. 

  

 (l) _Real Property; Assets_. 

   

 (i) The Company or a Company Subsidiary has good and marketable title to each parcel of, or interest in, real property owned by the Company or a Company Subsidiary (the _"Company Owned Real Property"_ ). 

   

 (ii) The Company Owned Real Property and all real property leased by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (the _"Company Leased Real Property"_ ) constitute all of the real property occupied or used by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in connection with the operation of their respective businesses as currently conducted. The Company or a Company Subsidiary has a valid leasehold interest in or valid rights to all material Company Leased Real Property. The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of all material leases of the Company Leased Real Property (the _"Company Leases"_ ). No option, extension or renewal has been exercised under any Company Lease except options, extensions or renewals that would not have a material and adverse impact on the Companys ability to conduct its operations as a whole or whose exercise has been evidenced by a written document, a true and complete copy of which has been made available to Parent with the corresponding Company Lease. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has complied in all material respects with the terms of all Company Leases to which it is a party and under which it is in occupancy, and all such Company Leases are in full force and effect. To the knowledge of the Company, the lessors under the Company Leases to 

   ##### 

  

    

which the Company or a Company Subsidiary is a party have complied in all
material respects with the terms of their respective Company Leases. Each of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries enjoys peaceful and undisturbed
possession under all such Company Leases, except where a failure to do so,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or
result in a material adverse effect on the Company.

 (n) _Labor Agreements and Employee Issues_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have made available to Parent all collective bargaining agreements or other agreements with any union or labor organization to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in material compliance with each such collective bargaining agreement or other agreement.

Neither the Company nor the Company Subsidiaries is a party to, or is otherwise bound by, any consent decree with any Governmental Entity relating to employees or employment practices of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries. 

  

 (o) _Certain Contracts_. _Section 3.1(o)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and correct list of each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding to which the Company or a Company Subsidiary is a party to or is bound (i) which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC); (ii) that contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (or which, following the consummation of the Merger, could restrict the ability of the Surviving Company or any of its affiliates) to compete in any business or with any person or in any geographic area or distribution or sales channel, or to sell, supply or distribute any service or product, in each case, that could reasonably be expected to be material to the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii) for each business unit of the Company and its subsidiaries that is a top five customer or a top five raw material supplier, in 

   ##### 

  

    

each case in terms of dollar amount, relating to making payments or receipt of
payments during fiscal year 2009, and in each case without identifying the
name of the third party; or (iv) which would prohibit or delay the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each
of the foregoing, a _"Company Material Contract"_ ). Each Company Material
Contract is valid and binding on the Company and any Company Subsidiary that
is a party thereto and, to the knowledge of the Company, each other party
thereto and is in full force and effect. There is no default under any
Company Material Contract by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or, to the
knowledge of the Company, by any other party, and no event has occurred that
with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a
default thereunder by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or, to the
knowledge of the Company, by any other party, in each case except as
would not reasonably be expected to have or result in, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company. All contracts,
agreements, arrangements or understandings of any kind between any affiliate
of the Company (other than any wholly owned Company Subsidiary), on the one
hand, and the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the other hand, are on
terms no less favorable to the Company or to such Company Subsidiary than
would be obtained with an unaffiliated third party on an arms-length
basis. 

  

 (p) _Insurance_. The Company has made available to Parent copies of all insurance policies in force as of, and covering matters as of, the date of this Agreement that are owned by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or which names the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as an insured (or loss payee), including those which pertain to the Companys or any of the Company Subsidiaries assets, employees or operations. All such insurance policies are in full force and effect, are in such amounts and cover such losses and risks as are consistent with industry practice and, in the reasonable judgment of senior management of the Company, are adequate to protect the properties and businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and all premiums due thereunder have been paid. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has received notice of permanent cancellation of any such insurance policies. 

  

 (q) _Interested Party Transactions_. No event has occurred since December 31, 2007 that would be required to be reported by the Company pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act. 

  

 (r) _Voting Requirement_. The affirmative vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock to approve this Agreement is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the Companys capital stock necessary to adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the _"Company Stockholder Approval"_ ). 

  

 (s) _State Takeover Statutes_. The Board of Directors of the Company has taken all necessary action so that no "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other anti-takeover Law (each, a _"Takeover Statute"_ ) (including the interested stockholder provisions codified in Article 13.03 of the Texas Business Corporation Act (the " _TBCA_ ")) or any anti-takeover provision in the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws is applicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Board of Directors of the Company has (i) duly and validly approved this Agreement, (ii) determined that 

   #####

be taken by the Board of Directors of the Company for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (t) _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Company has received the opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. to the effect that, as of the date thereof, the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of shares of Company Common Stock is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, a written copy of which opinion will be provided solely for information purposes to Parent upon receipt by the Company. 

  

 (u) _Brokers_. Except for J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., no broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company. The Company has furnished to Parent true and complete copies of all agreements under which any such fees, commissions or expenses are payable and all indemnification and other agreements related to the engagement, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, of the persons to whom such fees, commissions or expenses are payable. 

  

 (v) _Absence of Indemnifiable Claims_. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no pending suits, actions or proceedings by or before any Governmental Entity that would reasonably entitle any director or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to indemnification by the Company or any Company Subsidiary under applicable Law, the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational or governance documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries, any issuance policy maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any indemnity or similar agreements of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

Subject only to those exceptions and qualifications listed and described (including an identification by section reference to the representations and warranties to which such exceptions and qualifications relate) on the disclosure letter delivered by Parent and Merger Sub to the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (the _"Parent Disclosure Letter"_ ),  _provided_ , _however_ , that a matter disclosed in the Parent Disclosure Letter with respect to one representation or warranty shall also be deemed to be disclosed with respect to each other representation or warranty to the extent it is reasonably apparent from the text of such disclosure that such disclosure applies to or qualifies such other representation or warranty, and except as set forth in the Recent Parent SEC Reports, each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company as follows: 

  

 (a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. Parent is a corporation and Merger Sub is a limited liability company, and each of them is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the requisite corporate or limited liability company power, as the case may be, and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in 

    ##### 

  

  

good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such
concept)  in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be
so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material
adverse effect on Parent. Parent has made available to the Company prior to
the execution of this Agreement complete and correct copies of the Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Parent, as amended to date (the
_"Parent Charter"_ ) and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Parent, as

    #####

voting agreement with respect to the voting of any such securities. Except as
otherwise provided in this _Section 3.2(c)_ and for payments under Parent
Benefit Plans, there are no agreements, arrangements or commitments of any
character (contingent or otherwise) pursuant to which any person is or may be
entitled to receive from Parent or a Parent Subsidiary any payment based on
the revenues, earnings or financial performance of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary or assets or calculated in accordance therewith. 

   

 (d) _Authority; Noncontravention_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate or limited liability company power, as the case may be, and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or limited liability company action, as the case may be, on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, respectively. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws generally affecting the rights of creditors and subject to general equity principles. The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement will not, (i) conflict with the articles of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of any of the Parent Entities, (ii) result in any breach, violation or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or creation or acceleration of any obligation or right of a third party or loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of any of the Parent Entities under any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, license or similar authorization applicable to any of the Parent Entities or their respective properties or assets, or (iii) subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in the following sentence, conflict with or violate any judgment, order, decree or Law applicable to any of the Parent Entities or their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any such conflicts, breaches, violations, defaults, rights, losses or Liens that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent.

Undisclosed Liabilities; Internal Controls_.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

   

 (i) Parent has timely filed all required reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act with the SEC since August 31, 2008 (as such reports, schedules, forms, statements and documents have been amended since the time of their filing, collectively, the _"Parent SEC Documents"_ ). As of their respective dates, or if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment, the Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents when filed, or as so amended, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the staff of the SEC. 

   

 (ii) The financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents comply as to form, as of their respective date of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated statements of income, cash flows and stockholders equity for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal recurring year-end audit adjustments). No Parent Subsidiary is required to make any filings with the SEC. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents filed since August 31, 2009 and prior to the date of this Agreement (the _"Recent Parent SEC Reports"_ ), since August 31, 2009, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have not incurred any liabilities (direct, contingent or otherwise) that are of a nature that would be required to be disclosed on a balance sheet of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries or the footnotes thereto prepared in conformity with GAAP, other than (x) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and (y) liabilities that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. 

   

 (iii) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Parent or the Parent 

   ##### 

  

   

Subsidiaries or their accountants (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom) except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that
would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse
effect on the system of internal accounting controls described in the
following sentence. As and to the extent described in the Parent
SEC Documents, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Parent (A) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as required
by Rule 13a-15(a) of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material
information relating to Parent, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is
made known to the management of Parent by others within those entities, and
(B) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date
hereof, to Parents auditors and the audit committee of Parents Board
of Directors (1) any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and has identified for Parents auditors
any material weaknesses in internal controls and (2) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Parents internal controls. Parent has made available to
the Company a summary of any such disclosure made by the Parent management to
the Parents auditors or audit committee of the Parents Board of Directors
since August 31, 2008.

The Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, as the case may be. 

   

 (g) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

    ##### 

  

  

 (h) _Compliance with Applicable Laws; Litigation_. 

    

 (i) Since January 1, 2007, the operations of the Parent Entities have not been and are not being conducted in violation of any Law (including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001) or any Permit necessary for the conduct of their respective businesses as currently conducted, except where such violations, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. None of the Parent Entities has received any written notice, or has knowledge, of any claim alleging any such violation. 

   

 (ii) The Parent Entities hold all Permits necessary for the conduct of their respective businesses as currently conducted, except where the failure to hold such Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. None of the Parent Entities has received written notice that any such Permit will be terminated or modified or cannot be renewed in the ordinary course of business, and Parent has no knowledge of any reasonable basis for any such termination, modification or nonrenewal, except for such terminations, modifications or nonrenewals as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not violate any such Permit, or result in any termination, modification or nonrenewals thereof, except for such violations, terminations, modifications or nonrenewals thereof as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. 

   

 (iii) There is no suit, action or proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, except for any such suit, action or proceeding that challenges or seeks to prohibit the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party or against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any of their properties or assets that would reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no suit, action or proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary challenging or seeking to prohibit the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (i) _Employee Benefit Plans_. 

    

 (i) Parent has made available to the Company a true and complete list of (A) each material bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase, stock option, equity compensation, retirement, vacation, employment, disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical insurance, life insurance, welfare, severance or other employee benefit plan, agreement, arrangement or understanding maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary contributes or is obligated to contribute or with respect to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has any material liability, and (B) each change of control agreement and each material employment or severance agreement providing 

   ##### 

  

   

benefits (other than those benefits required by applicable Law or customarily
provided in such jurisdiction) to any current or former employee, officer or
director of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, to which Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary is a party or by which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is bound
(collectively, the _"Parent Benefit Plans"_ ). With respect to each Parent
Benefit Plan, no event has occurred and there exists no condition or set
of circumstances in connection with which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
could be subject to any liability that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect
on Parent. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has any liability
(including contingent liability) with respect to any plan,
agreement, arrangement or understanding of the type described in this
paragraph other than the Parent Benefit Plans, other than liability which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or
result in a material adverse effect on Parent. 

   

 (ii) Each Parent Benefit Plan has been administered in accordance with its terms, all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code, and the terms of all applicable collective bargaining agreements, except for any failures so to administer any Parent Benefit Plan that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. Parent and all Parent Benefit Plans are in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws and the terms of all applicable collective bargaining agreements, except for any failures to be in such compliance that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. Each Parent Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a), 401(k) or 4975(e)(7) of the Code has received a favorable determination and/or opinion letter from the IRS as to its qualified status and, to the knowledge of Parent, there exist no facts or circumstances that have caused or could cause a failure to be so qualified under Section 401(a), 401(k) or 4975(e)(7) of the Code. No fact or event has occurred which is reasonably likely to affect adversely the qualified status of any such Parent Benefit Plan or the exempt status of any such trust, except for any occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. All contributions to, and payments from, the Parent Benefit Plans that are required to have been made in accordance with such Parent Benefit Plans, ERISA or the Code have been timely made other than any failures that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. All trusts providing funding for Parent Benefit Plans that are intended to comply with Section 501(c)(9) of the Code are exempt from federal income taxation and, together with any other welfare benefit funds (as defined in Section 419(e)(1) of the Code) maintained in connection with any of the Parent Benefit Plans, have been operated and administered in compliance with all applicable requirements such that neither Parent, any Parent Subsidiary, any Parent Benefit Plan nor such trust or fund is subject to any taxes, penalties or other liabilities imposed as a consequence of failure to comply with such requirements. No welfare benefit fund (as defined in Section 419(e)(1) of the Code) maintained in connection with any of the Parent Benefit Plans has provided any "disqualified benefit" (as defined in Section 4976(b)(1) of the Code) for which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has or had any liability for the excise tax imposed by Section 4976 of the Code which has not been paid in full. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) Other than as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent, neither Parent nor any trade or business, whether or not incorporated, which, together with Parent, would be deemed to be a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA or Section 414(b) or 414(c) of the Code (a _"Parent ERISA Affiliate"_ ) has incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than for premiums pursuant to Section 4007 of ERISA which have been timely paid) or Section 4971 of the Code, and no condition exists that presents a risk to Parent or any Parent ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such liability or failure. Each Parent Benefit Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan) to which Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA applies has satisfied the requirements of Sections 412, 430 and 436 of the Code and Sections 302 and 303 of ERISA, and no such Parent Benefit Plan is in "at-risk status" within the meaning of Section 430(i)(4) of the Code or Section 303(i)(4) of ERISA or subject to the limitations of Section 436 of the Code. No Parent Benefit Plan has or has incurred an accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, nor has any waiver of the minimum funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code been requested of or granted by the Internal Revenue Service with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan, nor has any Lien in favor of any Parent Benefit Plan arisen under Sections 412(n) or 430(k) of the Code or Sections 302(f) or 303(k) of ERISA. Neither Parent nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate has been required to provide security to any defined benefit pension plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code or Sections 306 or 307 of ERISA. With respect to each Parent Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Sections 412 or 4971 of the Code that is not a Multiemployer Plan, the fair market value of the assets of such Parent Benefit Plan equals or exceeds the actuarial present value of all accrued benefits under such Parent Benefit Plan (whether or not vested), based upon the actuarial assumptions used to prepare the most recent actuarial report for such Parent Benefit Plan and, to the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred which would be reasonably expected to change any such funded status. There has been no "reportable event" within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations and interpretations thereunder which has not been fully and accurately reported in a timely fashion, as required, or which, whether or not reported, would constitute grounds for the PBGC to institute termination proceedings with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan. The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any Parent Benefit Plan. 

   

 (iv) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent, no Parent Benefit Plan provides medical or life insurance benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to current or former employees or officers or directors after retirement or other termination of service, other than any such coverage required by Law, and Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have reserved all rights necessary to amend or terminate each of the Parent Benefit Plans without the consent of any other person. 

   

 (v) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another event, (A) entitle any current or former employee, officer or director of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment, except as expressly 

   ##### 

  

   

provided in this Agreement, or (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting,
or increase the amount of compensation due any such employee, officer or
director. 

   

 (vi) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a party to any agreement, contract or arrangement (including this Agreement) that could result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. No Parent Benefit Plan provides for the reimbursement of excise taxes under Section 4999 of the Code or any income taxes under the Code. The deductions taken by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary related to compensation paid to its named executive officers under any Parent Benefit Plan have been made in material compliance with or pursuant to exceptions from the limitations set forth in Section 162(m) of the Code. 

   

 (vii) With respect to each Parent Benefit Plan, Parent has delivered or made available to the Company a true and complete copy of: (A) each writing constituting a part of such Parent Benefit Plan, including all Parent Benefit Plan documents and trust agreements; (B) the three most recent Annual Reports (Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedules, if any; (C) the most recent annual financial report, if any; (D) the most recent actuarial report, if any; and (E) the most recent determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, if any. Except as specifically provided in the foregoing documents delivered or made available to the Company, there are no material amendments to any Parent Benefit Plan that have been adopted or approved nor has Parent or any Parent Subsidiary undertaken to make any such material amendments or to adopt or approve any new Parent Benefit Plan. 

   

 (viii) No Parent Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple Employer Plan. None of Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Parent ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan. None of Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Parent ERISA Affiliates has incurred any material withdrawal liability under a Multiemployer Plan that has not been satisfied in full, nor does Parent have any material contingent liability with respect to any withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan. None of Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Parent ERISA Affiliates would incur any material withdrawal liability (within the meaning of Part 1 of Subtitle E of Title I of ERISA) if Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or any of their respective Parent ERISA Affiliates withdrew (within the meaning of Part 1 of Subtitle E of Title I of ERISA) on or prior to the Closing Date from each Multiemployer Plan to which Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or any of their respective Parent ERISA Affiliates has an obligation to contribute on the date of this Agreement. No Multiemployer Plan to which Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or any of their respective Parent ERISA Affiliates contributes or otherwise has any liability (contingent or otherwise) has incurred an accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 431(a) of the Code or Section 304(a) of ERISA, is insolvent, is in reorganization (within the meaning of Section 4241 of ERISA), is reasonably likely to commence reorganization, is in "endangered" or "critical" status (as such terms are defined in Section 432 of the Code) or is reasonably likely to be in endangered or critical status. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ix) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, or to Parents knowledge, no set of circumstances exists that may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the Parent Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Parent Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Parent Benefit Plans that could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of Parent or any Parent Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the United States Department of Treasury, the United States Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, any Parent Benefit Plan, any participant in a Parent Benefit Plan, any employee benefit plan with respect to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has any contingent liability, or any participant in an employee benefit plan with respect to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has any contingent liability. 

   

 (x) There have been no prohibited transactions or breaches of any of the duties imposed on "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA with respect to the Parent Benefit Plans that could result in any liability or excise tax under ERISA or the Code being imposed on Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, except as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. 

   

 (xi) All contributions, transfers and payments for the benefit of U.S. employees in respect of any Parent Benefit Plan, other than transfers incident to an incentive stock option plan within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, have been or are fully deductible under the Code, except as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. 

   

 (xii) With respect to any insurance policy that has, or does, provide funding for benefits under any Parent Benefit Plan, to the knowledge of Parent, no insurance company issuing any such policy is in receivership, conservatorship, liquidation or similar proceeding and, to the knowledge of Parent, no such proceedings with respect to any insurer are imminent. 

   

 (xiii) For purposes of this _Section 3.2(i)_ only, the term _"employee"_ will be considered to include individuals rendering personal services to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary as independent contractors. 

   

 (xiv) _"Parent Foreign Plan"_ means any Parent Benefit Plan that is maintained outside of the United States. Each Parent Foreign Plan complies with all applicable Law (including applicable Law regarding the form, funding and operation of the Foreign Plan), except as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. The financial statements of the Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents accurately reflect the Parent Foreign Plan liabilities and accruals for contributions required to be paid to the Parent Foreign Plans, in accordance with applicable generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied, except as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. All contributions required to have been made to all Parent Foreign Plans as of the Closing will have been made as of the Closing. There are no actions, suits or claims pending or, to the Parents knowledge, threatened with respect to the Parent Foreign Plans (other than 

   ##### 

  

   

routine claims for benefits), except as would not reasonably be expected to
have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. There have not
occurred, nor are there continuing any transactions or breaches of fiduciary
duty under applicable Law with respect to any Parent Foreign Plan which would
reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on
Parent. 

  

 (j) _Taxes_. (i) Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has filed all Tax Returns required to be filed, and all such returns are materially correct and complete; (ii) Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has paid all Taxes due whether or not shown on any Tax Return; (iii) there are no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, audits, examinations, investigations or other proceedings in respect of Taxes relating to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary; (iv) there are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, other than Liens for Taxes not yet due and Liens for Taxes that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings; (v) neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries has any liability for Taxes of any person (other than Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any comparable provision of Law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise; (vi) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a party to any agreement or arrangement relating to the allocation, sharing or indemnification of Taxes; (vii) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has taken any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and Treasury Regulations; (viii) no deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary for which adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP have not been created; (ix) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary will be required to include any adjustment in taxable income for any Post-Closing Tax Period under Section 481(c) of the Code (or any comparable provision of Law) as a result of a change in method of accounting for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or pursuant to the provisions of any agreement entered into with any taxing authority with regard to the Tax liability of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period; (x) the financial statements included in the Parent SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve in accordance with GAAP for all Taxes for which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary may be liable for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date hereof; (xi) no person has granted any extension or waiver of the statute of limitations period applicable to any Tax of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any affiliated, combined or unitary group of which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is or was a member, which period (after giving effect to such extension or waiver) has not yet expired, and there is no currently effective "closing agreement" pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code (or any similar provision of foreign, state or local Law); (xii) Parent and each Parent Subsidiary have withheld and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority all Taxes required to have been withheld and remitted in connection with any amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or other third party; (xiii) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has distributed the stock of another person or has had its stock distributed by another person, in a transaction that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part by Section 355 or Section 361 of the Code; (xiv) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has participated in any transaction that has been identified by the Internal Revenue Service in any published guidance as a reportable transaction; (xv) the consolidated federal income Tax Returns of Parent have been examined, or the statute of limitations has closed, with respect to all taxable years through and including 2005; and (xvi) for United States federal tax purposes, Merger Sub

Section 301.7701-3(b)(1)(ii). 

   

 (k) _Environmental Matters_. 

    

 (i) Except where noncompliance, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent, the Parent Entities are and have been for the past three years in compliance with all applicable Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Environmental Permits. 

   

 (ii) There are no written Environmental, Health and Safety Claims pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary and, to the knowledge of Parent, there are no existing conditions, circumstances or facts which could give rise to an Environmental, Health and Safety Claim, other than Environmental, Health and Safety Claims or conditions, circumstances or facts as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. 

   

 (iii) Parent has made available to the Company all material information, including such studies, reports, correspondence, notices of violation, requests for information, audits, analyses and test results and any other documents, in the possession, custody or control of the Parent Entities relating to (A) the Parent Entities compliance or noncompliance with Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Environmental Permits within the previous three years, and (B) Environmental Conditions on, under or about any of the properties or assets owned, leased, operated or otherwise used by any of the Parent Entities at the present time or for which any of the Parent Entities may be responsible or liable.

   ##### 

  

   

 (vi) Neither this Agreement nor the transactions contemplated hereby will result in any requirement for environmental disclosure, investigation, cleanup, removal or remedial action, or notification to or consent of any Governmental Entity or third party, with respect to any property owned, leased, operated or otherwise used by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, pursuant to any Environmental, Health and Safety Law, including any so-called "property transfer law." 

   

 (vii) None of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries has assumed, undertaken or otherwise become subject to any liability of any other person relating to or arising from Environmental, Health and Safety Laws, except as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. 

   

 (viii) There exist no Environmental Conditions relating to any currently or previously owned, leased, operated or otherwise used properties which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. 

  

 (l) _Real Property; Assets_. 

    

 (i) The Parent or a Parent Subsidiary has good and marketable title to each parcel of, or interest in, real property owned by Parent or a Parent Subsidiary (the _"Parent Owned Real Property"_ ). 

   

 (ii) The Parent Owned Real Property and all real property leased by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries (the _"Parent Leased Real Property"_ ) constitute all of the real property occupied or used by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries in connection with the operation of their respective businesses as currently conducted. Parent or a Parent Subsidiary has a valid leasehold interest in or valid rights to all material Parent Leased Real Property. Parent has made available to the Company true and complete copies of all material leases of the Parent Leased Real Property (the _"Parent Leases"_ ). No option, extension or renewal has been exercised under any Parent Lease except options, extensions or renewals that would not have a material and adverse impact on Parents ability to conduct its operations as a whole or whose exercise has been evidenced by a written document, a true and complete copy of which has been made available to the Company with the corresponding Parent Lease. Each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries has complied in all material respects with the terms of all Parent Leases to which it is a party and under which it is in occupancy, and all such Parent Leases are in full force and effect. To the knowledge of Parent, the lessors under the Parent Leases to which Parent or a Parent Subsidiary is a party have complied in all material respects with the terms of their respective Parent Leases. Each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such Parent Leases, except where a failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent.

All such properties, assets and rights are in all material respects adequate for the purposes for which such assets are currently used or held for use, and are in reasonably good repair and operating condition (subject to normal wear and tear), except where such failure would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. 

  

 (m) _Parent Intellectual Property_. 

    

 (i) The term _"Parent Intellectual Property"_ means all of the following that is owned by, issued or licensed to Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries or used in the business of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries, including: (A) all patents, trademarks, trade names, trade dress, assumed names, service marks, logos, copyrights, Internet domain names and corporate names together with all applications, registrations, renewals and all goodwill associated therewith; (B) all trade secrets and confidential information (including customer lists, know-how, formulae, manufacturing and production processes, research, financial business information and marketing plans); (C) information technologies (including software programs, data and related documentation); and (D) other intellectual property rights and all copies and tangible embodiments of any of the foregoing in whatever form or medium.

 (iii) (A) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not reasonably expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the right, title and interest of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries in and to the Parent Intellectual Property; and (B) Parent or each of the Parent Subsidiaries, as the case may be, has taken all necessary action to maintain and protect the material Parent Intellectual Property and, 

   ##### 

  

   

until the Effective Time, shall continue to maintain and protect the material
Parent Intellectual Property. 

  

 (n) _Labor Agreements and Employee Issues_. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have made available to the Company all collective bargaining agreements or other agreements with any union or labor organization to which Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries is a party. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are in material compliance with each such collective bargaining agreement or other agreement. Parent is unaware of any effort, activity or proceeding of any labor organization (or representative thereof) to organize any other of its or their employees. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are not, and have not since August 31, 2008, been subject to any pending, or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened (i) unfair labor practice charges and/or complaint, (ii) grievance proceeding or arbitration proceeding arising under any collective bargaining agreement or other labor agreement to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party, (iii) claim, suit, action or governmental investigation relating to employees, including discrimination, wrongful discharge, or violation of any state and/or federal statute relating to employment practices, (iv) strike, lockout or dispute, slowdown or work stoppage or (v) claim, suit, action or governmental investigation, in respect of which any director, officer, employee or agent of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries is or may be entitled to claim indemnification from Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, except for the foregoing which, in the case of clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. Neither Parent nor the Parent Subsidiaries is a party to, or is otherwise bound by, any consent decree with any Governmental Entity relating to employees or employment practices of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries. 

   

 (o) _Certain Contracts_. _Section 3.2(o)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and correct list of each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding to which Parent or a Parent Subsidiary is a party to or is bound (i) which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC); (ii) that contains covenants that limit the ability of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries (or which, following the consummation of the Merger, could restrict the ability of the Surviving Company or any of its affiliates) to compete in any business or with any person or in any geographic area or distribution or sales channel, or to sell, supply or distribute any service or product, in each case, that could reasonably be expected to be material to the business of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii) for each business unit of Parent and its subsidiaries that is a top five customer or a top five raw material supplier, in each case in terms of dollar amount, relating to making payments or receipt of payments during the 12-month period prior to the date hereof, and in each case without identifying the name of the third party; or (iv) which would prohibit or delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each of the foregoing, a _"Parent Material Contract"_ ). Each Parent Material Contract is valid and binding on Parent and any Parent Subsidiary that is a party thereto and, to the knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto and is in full force and effect. There is no default under any Parent Material Contract by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of Parent, by any other party, and no event has occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a default thereunder by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or, to the knowledge of Parent, by any other party, in each case except as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Parent. All contracts, 

     ##### 

  

    

agreements, arrangements or understandings of any kind between any affiliate
of Parent (other than any wholly owned Parent Subsidiary), on the one hand,
and Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, on the other hand, are on terms no less
favorable to Parent or to such Parent Subsidiary than would be obtained with
an unaffiliated third party on an arms-length basis. 

   

 (p) _Insurance_. Parent has made available to the Company copies of all insurance policies in force as of, and covering matters as of, the date of this Agreement that are owned by Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries or which names Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries as an insured (or loss payee), including those which pertain to Parents or any of the Parent Subsidiaries assets, employees or operations. All such insurance policies are in full force and effect, are in such amounts and cover such losses and risks as are consistent with industry practice and, in the reasonable judgment of senior management of Parent, are adequate to protect the properties and businesses of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries and all premiums due thereunder have been paid. Neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries has received notice of permanent cancellation of any such insurance policies. 

   

 (q) _Interested Party Transactions_. No event has occurred since December 31, 2007 that would be required to be reported by Parent pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act. 

   

 (r) _Brokers_. Except for UBS Securities LLC, no broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent. Parent has furnished to the Company true and complete copies of all agreements under which any such fees, commissions or expenses are payable and all indemnification and other agreements related to the engagement, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, of the persons to whom such fees, commissions or expenses are payable. 

   

 (s) _No Vote_. No vote or approval of the holders of any class of securities of Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any consent as may be required by the listing requirements of the Nasdaq. 

   

 (t) _Availability of Funds_. Parent will have at the Effective Time available cash in an amount sufficient for Parent and Merger Sub to timely pay the Cash Consideration and all fees, expenses and other amounts contemplated to be paid by Parent or its affiliates by this Agreement. 

   

 (u) _Absence of Indemnifiable Claims_. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no pending suits, actions or proceedings by or before any Governmental Entity that would reasonably entitle any director or officer of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to indemnification by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary under applicable Law, the Parent Charter, the Parent Bylaws or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational or governance documents of any of the Parents Subsidiaries, any issuance policy maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any indemnity or similar agreements of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary.

proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Company Takeover Proposal (other than contacting or engaging in discussions
with the person making a Company Takeover Proposal or its representatives for
the sole purpose of clarifying such Company Takeover Proposal); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Company Takeover
Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or could reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Proposal, and which Company Takeover Proposal was
made after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of this
_Section 4.2_ (other than from an immaterial breach of this _Section 4.2_,
the effect of which is not material), the Company may, subject to compliance
with _Section 4.2(c)_, (i) furnish information with respect to the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries to the person making such Company
Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such person than the

such information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided
to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided
to such person, (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with the
person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its representatives)
regarding such Company Takeover Proposal and (iii) take any action permitted

to be a breach of this _Section 4.2_ by the Company.

As used herein, (i) _"Superior Proposal"_ means a bona fide written proposal from any person to acquire, directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, at least 75% of the combined voting power of the Company then outstanding or 75% of the assets of the Company (including stock of its subsidiaries) that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment (after consulting with outside counsel and a nationally recognized investment banking firm), taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation), would be more favorable to the stockholders of the Company than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by Parent in response to such Company Takeover Proposal) and is reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed and (ii) _"Company Takeover Proposal"_ means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person (other than Parent and its affiliates) relating to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 25% or more of the net revenues, net income or the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 25% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, (C) any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 25% or more of the voting equity securities of the Company, or (D) any merger, consolidation, business combination, asset purchase, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company, in each case, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) _Actions by the Company_. Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Company Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a _"Company Adverse Recommendation Change"_ ) or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 4.2(a)_ ) (an _"Acquisition Agreement"_ ). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, it may (A) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ and cause the Company to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (which was made after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of this _Section 4.2_) or (B) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, if: (i) the Company provides written notice (a _"Notice of Adverse Recommendation"_ ) advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including, if applicable, the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Board of Directors (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation); (ii) for a period of five Business Days following Parents receipt of a Notice of Adverse Recommendation the Company negotiates with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger and not make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change (it being understood that such negotiation need not be exclusive); and (iii) if applicable, at the end of such five Business Day period, the Board of Directors of the Company continues to believe that the Company Takeover Proposal, if any, constitutes a Superior Proposal (after taking into account such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement). No Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall change the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company for purposes of causing any state takeover Law (including Article 13.03 of the TBCA or Section 21.606 of the TBOC) or other similar state Law that purports to limit or restrict business combinations to be inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Such notice shall be made 

    ##### 

  

    

orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the material terms and
conditions thereof and the identity of the other party or parties involved
and promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub a copy of any such written
inquiry, request or proposal. The Company agrees that it shall keep Parent

amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request, Company Takeover
Proposal or inquiry and keep Parent fully informed in all material respects
as to any information requested of or provided by the Company and as to all
discussions or negotiations with respect to any such request, Company Takeover

 (f) _Return or Destruction of Confidential Information_. The Company agrees that within five Business Days following the execution of this Agreement it shall request each person which has at any time after January 1, 2009 executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with such persons consideration of acquiring the Company to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such person by or on the Companys behalf.

Parent shall also take any action (other than 

    ##### 

  

    

qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified or to file a general consent to service of process) required to be
taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the
issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger and the Company shall furnish
all information concerning the Company and the holders of the Company Common
Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. The
Company, in connection with a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, may
amend or supplement the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement (including by

Change. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be
made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement will be made by the Company or Parent, in each case, without
providing the other party and its respective counsel the reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon and giving due consideration to
such comments. The parties shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of
any comments from the SEC or its staff and any request by the SEC or its
staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or
for additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all
correspondence between such party or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement, the Form S-4 or the Merger. Parent will advise the
Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form
S-4 has become effective, the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of
the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of
their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information must be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to
the stockholders of the Company. 

   

 (b) _Company Stockholders Meeting_. 

   

 The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, at its option, either an annual or special meeting of its stockholders (the _"Company Stockholders Meeting"_ ) in accordance with applicable Law, the Company Charter and Company Bylaws for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and, in the case of an annual meeting of stockholders, for the such other purposes as may be appropriate for an annual meeting of stockholders.

communication to the Company or its stockholders of any Company Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent with the Companys stockholder
list as and when requested by Parent, including at any time and from time to
time following a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. 

   

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with Parent, may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting (A) to the extent it believes in good faith it is necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to its stockholders, (B) if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock, as applicable, represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such meeting or (C) to the extent it believes in good faith it is necessary to solicit additional votes in order to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such adjournment or postponement shall not exceed ten Business Days.

The Company shall hold, and shall cause their respective affiliates and the Parent Representatives to hold, any nonpublic information in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary shall be obligated to provide any such access or information to the extent that doing so (x) may cause a waiver of an attorney-client privilege

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company agrees to make an appropriate filing under HSR with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event within fifteen Business Days following the date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. 

   

 (b) _No Takeover Statutes Apply_. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that no Takeover Statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) if any Takeover Statute or similar Law becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other transactions 

    ##### 

  

    

contemplated hereby, take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (c) _Opinions Regarding Tax Treatment_. Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other in obtaining the opinions of Jones Day, counsel to Parent, for the benefit of Parent, and Baker Botts L.L.P., counsel to the Company, for the benefit of the Companys stockholders, respectively, dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that the Merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and Treasury Regulations. In connection therewith, each of Parent and the Company shall deliver to Jones Day and Baker Botts L.L.P. customary representation letters in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such counsel, and at such time or times that may be reasonably requested by such counsel (the representation letters referred to in this sentence are collectively referred to as the _"_ _Tax Certificates_ _"_ ). 

   

 (d) _Information Cooperation_. In connection with the efforts referenced in _Section 5.3(a)_ to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act, and to obtain all such approvals and authorizations under any other applicable Antitrust Law, including those contemplated by _Section 6.1(e)_, each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other party promptly informed in all material respects of any material communication (and, if in writing, provide a copy of such communication) received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity and of any material communication (and if in writing, provide a copy of such communication) received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) permit the other party to review any material communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, any such Governmental Entity or in connection with any proceeding by a private party, (iv) consult and cooperate with the other party and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates to any such Governmental Entity or private party and (v) not participate in any substantive meeting or have any substantive communication with any Governmental Entity unless it has given the other parties a reasonable opportunity to consult with it in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other the opportunity to attend and participate therein. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and any attorney-client, work product or other privilege, each of the parties hereto will coordinate and cooperate fully with the other parties hereto in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as such other parties may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act. Any competitively sensitive information that is disclosed pursuant to this _Section 5.3(d)_ will be limited to each of Parents and the Companys respective counsel pursuant to a separate customary confidentiality agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this  _Section 5.3_, if any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or if any suit is instituted or threatened to be instituted by any Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Law or which would otherwise prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable. Neither the Company nor Parent shall, and they shall cause their respective subsidiaries not to, acquire or agree to acquire any assets, business, securities, person or subdivision thereof, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such acquisition could reasonably be expected to materially delay or materially increase the risk of not obtaining the applicable action, nonaction, waiver, clearance, consent or approval with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Laws. 

   

 Section 5.4 _Stock Options and Restricted Stock_. 

   

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Company Board of Directors will take (or will cause to be taken) all actions necessary (including providing such notices, adopting such amendments to the Company Stock Plans and taking such other actions as are reasonably requested by Parent) such that: 

    

 (i) All Company Stock Options that are not otherwise exercisable will become exercisable and, if elected by the holder, will be exercised effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the effect that the Company Common Stock into which they are converted will be deemed for all purposes to be issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (ii) Without limiting the generality or effect of _Section 5.4(a)(i)_, the holders of all Company Stock Options will be notified that Company Stock Options may be exercised at any time during the period that commences on the date of this Agreement and ends on the day before the Effective Time (the " _Exercise Period_ "), provided that (A) any such exercise, to the extent that it relates to a Company Stock Option that would become exercisable only at the Effective Time, will be contingent until, and will become effective only upon, the occurrence of the Effective Time and (B) no Company Stock Option may be exercised after the Exercise Period. 

   

 (iii) Company Stock Options that are not exercised before the end of the Exercise Period will terminate at the Effective Time and the holders thereof will be entitled to the payments provided for in _Section 2.1(e)_. 

   

 (iv) All Company Stock Plans will terminate at the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) _Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding unvested share of restricted Company Common Stock issued under a Company Stock Plan (each, a _"Restricted Share"_ ) shall become vested and no longer subject to restrictions, and as a result shall be considered a share of Company Common Stock for purposes of _Section 2.1_. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) _Withholding_. All amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ shall be subject to any required withholding of federal, state, local or foreign taxes and shall be paid without interest. 

   

 Section 5.5 _Indemnification_. 

   

 (a) _Rights Assumed by Surviving Company_. Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles of incorporation, bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) or in any agreement between the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any current or former director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the other hand, will be assumed by the Surviving Company without further action, as of the Effective Time, and will survive the Merger and will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms and such rights will not be amended, or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of individuals who on or prior to the Effective Time were directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company, unless such modification is required by Law. In the event that any claim for indemnification is asserted or made prior to the Effective Time or within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of such claim shall continue until the final disposition of such claim. 

   

 (b) _Indemnification Under this Agreement_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law in effect on the date hereof or provided under the articles of incorporation, bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) or agreements of the type described in _Section 5.5(a)_ as of the Effective Time, indemnify, defend, hold harmless and advance expenses to each present and former director and officer of the Company (including any director or officer of the Company who is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, employee, agent, or similar functionary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, inquiries, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission in their capacity as such (including any claim arising out of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), whether occurring before or after the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, for a period of six years after the Effective Time (and shall pay any expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, upon receipt from the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced of any undertaking to repay such advances required under applicable Law). In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel (including local counsel) satisfactory to them, the reasonable fees and expenses of which shall be paid by Parent and the Surviving Company promptly after statements therefor are received and 

    ##### 

  

    

(ii) Parent and the Surviving Company shall cooperate in or use reasonable
best efforts in the vigorous defense of any such matter; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Company shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without their respective written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); and
provided, further, that the Surviving Company shall not be obligated pursuant
to this subsection (b) to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of more than
one counsel (plus appropriate local counsel) for all Indemnified Parties in
any single action unless there is, as determined by counsel to
the Indemnified Parties, under applicable standards of professional conduct,
a conflict or a reasonable likelihood of a conflict on any significant issue
between the positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties, in which case
such additional counsel (including local counsel) as may be required to avoid
any such conflict or likely conflict may be retained by the Indemnified
Parties at the expense of the Surviving Company. The Surviving Company shall
pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may
be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this _Section 5.5_. 

   

 (c) _Successors and Assigns of Surviving Company_. In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Company assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.5_. 

   

 (d) _Continuing Coverage_. From the Effective Time and for a period of six years thereafter, Parent and the Surviving Company shall maintain in effect directors and officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (a copy of which has been heretofore delivered to Parent) on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such current insurance coverage;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will Parent or the Surviving Company be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance (the " _Maximum Premium_ "); and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that, if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount; and _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that at Parents option in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, the Surviving Company or Parent may purchase six-year "tail" insurance coverage that provides coverage identical in all material respects to the coverage described above. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if two Business Days prior to the Effective Time, Parent has not completed the actions contemplated by the last proviso of the preceding sentence, the Company may, with prior notice to Parent, purchase six-year "tail" insurance coverage that provides coverage identical in all material respects to the coverage described above, provided that the Company does not pay in excess of the Maximum Premium. 

   

 (e) _Intended Beneficiaries_. The provisions of this _Section 5.5_ are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and, in the case of _Section 5.5(a)_, current and former directors and officers of the Company and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

provisions of this _Section 5.5_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger
and expressly are intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Parties. 

   

 Section 5.6 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before holding any press conferences, analysts calls or other meetings or discussions and before issuing any press release or other public announcements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger. The parties will provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any press release or other public announcement or statement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or other public announcement or statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange, including the Nasdaq. The parties agree that the initial press release or releases to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be mutually agreed upon prior to the issuance thereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company agrees that it will not compromise or settle any litigation commenced against it or its directors or officers relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) for payments in excess of $500,000 from any source (including insurance) without Parents prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

   

 Section 5.9 _Tax Treatment_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code and Treasury Regulations and to obtain the opinions of counsel referred to in _Sections 6.2(d)_ and _6.3(d)_ , including forbearing from taking any action (or failing to take any action) that could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to so qualify or that could reasonably be expected to cause to be untrue, incorrect or incomplete any statement or representation made in their respective Tax Certificates. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to file all Tax Returns consistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and, in particular, as a 

    ##### 

  

    

transaction described in Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code and Treasury

valuable as the severance benefits provided under the applicable Company
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent hereby
acknowledges that a "Change in Control" within the meaning of the Companys
Change in Control Severance Plan will occur at the Effective Time, and Parent
shall assume and honor all of the terms and conditions of the Change in
Control Severance Plan. 

   

 (c) _Service Credit_. If Company Employees are included in any benefit plan maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (a " _Parent Plan_ " ) following the Effective Time, such Company Employees shall receive credit for service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their predecessors prior to the Effective Time to the same extent such service was counted under similar Company Benefit Plans for purposes of eligibility, vesting, and level of benefits under such Parent Plan, or if there is no such similar Company Benefit Plan, to the same extent such service was recognized under the applicable Companys retirement or savings plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that (i) such recognition of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefits payable to the Company Employee with respect to the same period of service, (ii) service of the employees of the Surviving Company and any Company Subsidiary at the Effective Time subject to collective bargaining agreements or obligations (the " _CBA Company Employees_ ") shall be determined under such collective bargaining agreements or obligations, (iii) in no event will such recognition of service for purposes of benefit levels apply for any purpose under a defined benefit pension plan of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary except to the extent that the Company Employee participates in a defined benefit plan of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as of the Closing Date and only with respect to such defined benefit plan, (iv) in no event will such recognition of service be taken into account for purposes of determining a Company Employees eligibility to participate in a retiree medical benefit plan maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, and (v) this _Section 5.12(c)_ shall not require that any Company Employee or CBA Company Employee who terminates employment with the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any affiliate thereof post-Closing following the Effective Time and after a period of nonemployment with the Company and its affiliates subsequently becomes employed by the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent or any affiliate thereof receive credit for service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their predecessors prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) _Welfare Benefits_. If Company Employees or their dependents are included in any medical, dental or health plan of Parent or any of its affiliates (a " _Successor Plan_ " ) other than the plan or plans in which they participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Prior Plan_ " ), any such Successor Plan shall not include any restrictions or limitations with respect to pre-existing condition exclusions or any actively-at-work requirements (except to the extent such exclusions were applicable under any similar Prior Plan at the Effective Time) and if the Successor Plan has the same plan year as the Prior Plan any eligible expenses incurred by any Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of such Prior Plan ending on the date such Company Employees participation in such Successor Plan begins shall be taken into account under such Successor Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Successor Plan; provided however, that the rights under a Successor Plan of any CBA Company Employee subject to collective bargaining agreements or obligations shall be determined pursuant to such collective bargaining agreements or obligations. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) _Retention Pool; Annual Bonuses_. The Company may provide up to $700,000 as a retention pool (the " _Retention Pool_ ") for the purpose of retaining the services of key Company Employees. The Retention Pool shall be distributed to the key Company Employees listed on  _Schedule 5.12(e)_ on the basis and substantially in the ranges set forth on such schedule. In addition, the Company may pay to each Company Employee eligible to participate in an annual incentive program an annual bonus in respect of the Companys fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 on or before December 15, 2009 in an amount not to exceed $1,100,000 in the aggregate.

Any Company Employee whose employment with the Company and all of its affiliates is terminated by the Company or any of its affiliates (other than for cause, as defined in the ICO Severance Policy) prior to the completion of the Companys 2010 fiscal year shall be entitled to receive, based on the number of days worked by the Company Employee in fiscal year 2010 prior to such termination, the pro rata portion of the bonus payment, if any, that such Company Employee would have received had such Company Employee remained employed by the Company through the completion of fiscal year 2010. 

   

 (f) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this _Section 5.12_ shall (i) confer any rights upon any person, including any Company Employee or former employees of the Company, other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, (ii) constitute or create an employment agreement, or (iii) constitute or be treated as the amendment, modification or adoption of any employee benefit plan of Parent, the Company of any of their Affiliates.

The directors designated pursuant to this _Section 5.13_ shall meet the independence standards of the listing standards of the Nasdaq.

7.3(c)_, the amount of such Out-of-Pocket Expenses so reimbursed will be
offset against the Company Termination Fee payable. 

   

 (d) _Failure to Pay Fees and Expenses_. Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither party would enter into this Agreement.

The parties accordingly agree that the parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or a Delaware state court, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity or under this Agreement. 

   

 Section 8.10 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time before or after the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after such approval, there is not to be made any amendment that by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. 

   

 Section 8.11 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company, on one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso of _Section 8.10_, waive compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such rights. 

   

 Section 8.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.
