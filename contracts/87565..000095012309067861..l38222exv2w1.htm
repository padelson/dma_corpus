applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws and the terms of all
applicable collective bargaining agreements, except for any failures to be in such
compliance that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have
or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. Each Company Benefit Plan that is
intended to be qualified under Section&nbsp;401(a), 401(k) or 4975(e)(7) of the Code has received
a favorable determination and/or opinion letter from the IRS as to its qualified status and,
to the knowledge of the Company, there exist no facts or circumstances that have caused or
could cause a failure to be so qualified under Section&nbsp;401(a), 401(k) or 4975(e)(7) of the
Code. No fact or event has occurred which is reasonably likely to affect adversely the
qualified status of any such Company Benefit Plan or the exempt status of any such trust,
except for any occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. All contributions
to, and payments from, the Company Benefit Plans that are required to have been made in
accordance with such Company Benefit Plans, ERISA or the Code have been timely made other
than any failures that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. All trusts providing funding
for Company Benefit Plans that are intended to comply with Section&nbsp;501(c)(9) of the Code are
exempt from federal income taxation and, together with any other welfare benefit funds (as
defined in Section&nbsp;419(e)(1) of the Code) maintained in connection with any of the Company
Benefit Plans, have been operated and administered in compliance with all applicable
requirements such that neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary, any Company Benefit Plan

consequence of failure to comply with such requirements. No welfare benefit fund (as

Benefit Plans has provided any &#147;disqualified benefit&#148; (as defined in Section&nbsp;4976(b)(1) of

excise tax imposed by Section&nbsp;4976 of the Code which has not been paid in full.

for premiums pursuant to Section&nbsp;4007 of ERISA which have been timely paid) or Section&nbsp;4971

ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such liability or failure. Each Company Benefit Plan

Neither the Company nor any Company ERISA Affiliate has been required to provide security to
any defined benefit pension plan pursuant to Section&nbsp;401(a)(29) of the Code or Sections&nbsp;306

Section&nbsp;302 of ERISA or Sections&nbsp;412 or 4971 of the Code that is not a Multiemployer Plan,
the fair market value of the assets of such Company Benefit Plan equals or exceeds the
actuarial present value of all accrued benefits under such Company Benefit Plan (whether or
not vested), based upon the actuarial assumptions used to prepare the most recent actuarial
report for such Company Benefit Plan and, to the knowledge of the Company, no event has
occurred which would be reasonably expected to change any such funded status. There has
been no &#147;reportable event&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;4043 of ERISA and the regulations

fashion, as required, or which, whether or not reported, would constitute grounds for the

or Sections&nbsp;412 or 4971 of the Code that is not a Multiemployer Plan, the fair market value
of the assets of such Parent Benefit Plan equals or exceeds the actuarial present value of
all accrued benefits under such Parent Benefit Plan (whether or not vested), based upon the
actuarial assumptions used to prepare the most recent actuarial report for such Parent
Benefit Plan and, to the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred which would be
reasonably expected to change any such funded status. There has been no &#147;reportable event&#148;
within the meaning of Section&nbsp;4043 of ERISA and the regulations and interpretations
thereunder which has not been fully and accurately reported in a timely fashion, as
required, or which, whether or not reported, would constitute grounds for the PBGC to
institute termination proceedings with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan. The PBGC has not
instituted proceedings to terminate any Parent Benefit Plan.

forth a true and correct list of each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding to which
Parent or a Parent Subsidiary is a party to or is bound (i)&nbsp;which is a &#147;material contract&#148; (as such
term is defined in Item&nbsp;601(b)(10) of Regulation&nbsp;S-K of the SEC); (ii)&nbsp;that contains covenants that
limit the ability of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries (or which, following the consummation
of the Merger, could restrict the ability of the Surviving Company or any of its affiliates) to
compete in any business or with any person or in any geographic area or distribution or sales
channel, or to sell, supply or distribute any service or product, in each case, that could
reasonably be expected to be material to the business of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole; (iii)&nbsp;for each business unit of Parent and its subsidiaries that is a top five customer
or a top five raw material supplier, in each case in terms of dollar amount, relating to making
payments or receipt of payments during the 12-month period prior to the date hereof, and in each
case without identifying the name of the third party; or (iv)&nbsp;which would prohibit or delay the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each of the foregoing,
a <B><I>&#147;Parent Material Contract&#148;</I></B>). Each Parent Material Contract is valid and binding on Parent and
any Parent Subsidiary that is a party thereto and, to the knowledge of Parent, each other party
thereto and is in full force and effect. There is no default under any Parent Material Contract by
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of Parent, by any other party, and no event
has occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a default
thereunder by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or, to the knowledge of Parent, by any other party,
in each case except as would not reasonably be expected to have or result in, individually or in
the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Parent. All contracts,
