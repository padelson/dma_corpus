(ii) counterparts of each Transaction Agreement to which a Buyer Party is a

(a) No later than five Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
Seller shall deliver to Buyer: (i) a statement (the " _Estimated Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth an estimated balance sheet of the Company as of

accordance with the Accounting Principles, consistently applied (the "
_Estimated Balance Sheet_ ") and showing Sellers calculations of (A) the
Closing Statutory Value (the " _Estimated Closing Statutory Value_ ") and (B)
the Recapture Adjustment Amount (the " _Estimated Recapture Adjustment Amount_
") and (C) the Adjusted Initial Amount based on (A) and (B); and (ii)
reasonable supporting documentation with respect to the calculation of the

(b) In addition to the deliveries contemplated by _Section 2.3_, at the
Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller or its designee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller an amount equal
to the Adjusted Initial Amount; _provided_ , that Buyer may choose to have a
portion of the Adjusted Initial Amount paid to Seller or its designee by the
Escrow Agent out of the Escrow Funds pursuant to a joint written instruction
of Buyer and Seller so long as Buyer pays the remaining portion of the
Adjusted Initial Amount directly to Seller or such designee.

 



 

SECTION 2.5. _Post-Closing Payments_.

 



 

(a) The Final Adjustment Amount shall be determined as set forth in
subsections (b) and (c) of this _Section 2.5_. If the Final Adjustment Amount
is a positive number, then Buyer shall pay such Final Adjustment Amount to
Seller or its designee within five Business Days after the final determination
thereof. If the Final Adjustment Amount is a

 



      
 

 



 

negative number, then Seller shall pay the absolute value of such Final
Adjustment Amount to Buyer within five Business Days after the final
determination thereof. Any payments required to be made by either party
pursuant to this _Section 2.5(a)_ shall (i) be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds and (ii) include interest on the amount required
to be paid at the Applicable Rate, compounded annually on the basis of a year
of 365 days, from (and including) the Closing Date to (but excluding) the date
such payment is made.

 



 

(b) No later than 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to
Seller: (i) a statement (the " _Final Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth
the balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date prepared in good faith
from the Books and Records in accordance with the Accounting Principles,
consistently applied (the " _Subject Balance Sheet_ ") and showing Buyers
calculations of (A) the Closing Statutory Value, (B) the Recapture Adjustment
Amount and (C) the Final Adjustment Amount based on (A) and (B); and (ii)
reasonable supporting documentation with respect to the calculation of the
amounts set forth in the Final Adjustment Statement. Seller shall, during such
period of no longer than 90 days after the Closing Date, provide Buyer and the
Company and their Representatives with reasonable access to the employees of
Seller to the extent such employees have knowledge about the Company Business
and to all documentation, records and other information of the Company or
Seller, as Buyer, the Company or any of their Representatives may reasonably
request and that are necessary to facilitate the preparation of the Final
Adjustment Statement; _provided_ , that such access does not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of Seller and that such access and
cooperation shall not, in the event of any dispute arising out of this
Agreement, serve to prejudice Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

(c) (i) Seller shall have 45 days from the date on which the Final Adjustment
Statement is delivered to it to review the Final Adjustment Statement, the
Subject Balance Sheet and the calculations of (A) the Closing Statutory Value,
(B) the Closing Recapture Adjustment Amount, and (C) the Final Adjustment
Amount based on (A) and (B) (the " _Review Period_ "). In furtherance of such
review, Buyer and the Company shall provide Seller and its Representatives
with reasonable access during such 45 day period to the employees of Buyer and
the Company (including to the Chief Financial Officer of Buyer) and to all
documentation, records and other information of Buyer and the Company as
Seller or any of its Representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ , that
such access does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business
of Buyer or the Company and that such access and cooperation shall not, in the
event of any dispute arising out of this Agreement, serve to prejudice Buyer
or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

(ii) If Seller disagrees with the Final Adjustment Statement (including any
amount or computation set forth therein) in any respect and on any basis,
Seller may, on or prior to the last day of the Review Period, deliver a notice
to Buyer setting forth, in reasonable detail, each disputed item or amount and
the basis for Sellers disagreement therewith (the " _Dispute Notice_ "). The
Dispute Notice shall set forth, with respect to each disputed item, Sellers
position as to the correct amount or computation that should have been
included in the Final Adjustment Statement and as to the Final Adjustment
Amount.

 



 

(iii) If no Dispute Notice is received by Buyer with respect to any item in
the Final Adjustment Statement on or prior to the last day of the Review
Period, the

 



       
 

 



 

amount or computation with respect to such item as set forth in the Final
Adjustment Statement shall be deemed accepted by Seller, whereupon the amount
or computation of such item or items shall be final and binding on the
parties.

 



 

(iv) For a period of 10 Business Days beginning on the date that Buyer
receives a Dispute Notice (the " _Resolution Period_ "), if any, Buyer and
Seller shall endeavor in good faith to resolve by mutual agreement all matters
identified in the Dispute Notice. In the event that the parties are unable to
resolve by mutual agreement any matter in the Dispute Notice within such 10
Business Day period, Buyer and Seller shall jointly engage
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") to make a
determination with respect to all matters in dispute. If
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is unwilling or unable to serve, Seller and Buyer
shall cooperate in good faith to appoint, within 30 days after Seller and
Buyer receive notice from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP of its refusal or
inability to act as the Independent Accounting Firm, an independent certified
public accounting firm of national recognition mutually acceptable to Buyer
and Seller, in which event such firm shall be the "Independent Accounting
Firm."

 



 

(v) Buyer and Seller will direct the Independent Accounting Firm to render a
determination within 30 days after its retention, and Buyer, Seller and their
respective employees and agents will cooperate with the Independent Accounting
Firm during its engagement. Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other
hand, shall promptly (and in any event within 10 Business Days) after the
Independent Accounting Firms engagement, each submit to the Independent
Accounting Firm their respective computations of the disputed items identified
in the Dispute Notice and information, arguments and support for their
respective positions, and shall concurrently deliver a copy of such materials
to the other party. Each party shall then be given an opportunity to
supplement the information, arguments and support included in its initial
submission with one additional submission to respond to any arguments or
positions taken by the other party in such other partys initial submission,
which supplemental information shall be submitted to the Independent
Accounting Firm (with a copy thereof to the other party) within five Business
Days after the first date on which both parties have submitted their
respective initial submissions to the Independent Accounting Firm. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall thereafter be permitted to request
additional or clarifying information from the parties, and each of the parties
shall cooperate and shall cause their Representatives to cooperate with such
requests of the Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall determine, based solely on the materials so presented by the parties and
upon information received in response to such requests for additional or
clarifying information and not by independent review, only those issues in
dispute specifically set forth in the Dispute Notice and shall render a
written report to Buyer and Seller (the " _Adjustment Report_ ") in which the
Independent Accounting Firm shall, after considering all matters set forth in
the Dispute Notice, determine what adjustments, if any, should be made to the
amounts and computations set forth in the Final Adjustment Statement solely as
to the disputed items and shall determine the appropriate Final Adjustment
Amount on that basis.

 



      
 

 



 

(vi) The Adjustment Report shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the
Independent Accounting Firms determination with respect to each of the
disputed items or amounts specified in the Dispute Notice, and the revisions,
if any, to be made to the Final Adjustment Statement, together with supporting
calculations. In resolving any disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm
(i) shall be bound to the principles of this _Section 2.5_ and the terms of
this Agreement, (ii) shall limit its review to matters specifically set forth
in the Dispute Notice and (iii) shall not assign a value to any item higher
than the highest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the
lowest value for such item claimed by either party.

 



 

(vii) All fees and expenses relating to the work of the Independent Accounting
Firm shall be shared equally by Buyer and Seller. The Adjustment Report shall
be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller, and shall be deemed a final
arbitration award that is binding on each of Buyer and Seller, and, absent
fraud, no party shall seek further recourse to courts, other tribunals or
otherwise, other than to enforce the Adjustment Report.

 



 

(viii) The final form of the balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing
Date as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ is referred to
herein as the " _Final Balance Sheet_ ", the amount of the Closing Statutory
Value calculated therefrom is referred to as the " _Final Closing Statutory
Value_ " and the amount of the Recapture Adjustment Amount calculated
therefrom is referred to as the " _Closing Recapture Adjustment Amount_."
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
provisions of this _Section 2.5_ represent the sole and exclusive method for
determining the Final Balance Sheet, the Final Closing Statutory Value and the
Closing Recapture Adjustment Amount.

 



 

SECTION 2.6. _Additional Post-Closing Payments_. If Seller or any of its
Affiliates exercises the right under _Section 5.25_ to subscribe for class A
limited partnership or other equity interests of Parent, Buyer shall at the
Closing pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Seller, an amount equal to 10% of the aggregate capital
commitment contemplated by the related subscription agreement entered into
pursuant to the exercise of such right; _provided_ , that such payment shall
not exceed $6,000,000 in the aggregate. Any payment made pursuant to this
_Section 2.6_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

 



 

Subject to and as qualified by the matters set forth in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule in accordance with _Section 10.3_, Seller represents and warrants to

specified herein), as follows:

 



 

SECTION 3.1. _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_.

 



 

(a) Seller is an insurance company duly incorporated, validly existing and in

incorporated or organized (as the case may be), validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization. The Company is an insurance company duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Nebraska. Each of
Seller and the Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease or otherwise hold the assets and properties owned, leased or otherwise
held by it and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where
the failure to have such power and authority would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of
Seller and the Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes
such qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing (individually or in the
aggregate) would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate,
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) Seller has made available to Buyer true, correct and complete copies of
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other organizational
documents) (collectively, the " _Organizational Documents_ "), each as amended
to the date hereof, of the Company.

 



 

SECTION 3.2. _Capital Structure_.

 



 

(a) The issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company consists of 25,000
shares, $100.00 par value per share, which constitute the Shares. There are
30,000 authorized shares of capital stock of the Company. Except for the
Shares, no securities of the Company are issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding. All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company were duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable, and are
not subject to any preemptive rights. Except as set forth in Section 3.2 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, there are no securities (whether convertible,
exchangeable or otherwise), options, warrants, rights, commitments or
agreements of any kind to which either Seller or the Company is a party or by
which either of them is bound obligating either of them to issue, sell,
deliver or redeem shares of capital stock or other equity interests of the
Company.

 



 

(b) There are no restrictions upon the voting or transfer of the Shares
pursuant to the Organizational Documents of the Company or any agreement to
which Seller or the Company is a party.

 



 

(c) Seller is the record and beneficial owner of all of the shares of capital
stock of the Company, free and clear of all Liens, other than any restrictions
on transfer generally imposed under applicable securities laws. Upon
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
execution and delivery of the documents to be delivered at Closing, Buyer
shall be vested at the Closing with good and valid title in and to all of the
shares of capital stock of the Company, free and clear of all Liens, other
than any restrictions on transfer generally imposed under applicable
securities laws.

 



 

SECTION 3.3. _Subsidiaries_. The Company does not own any shares of the
capital stock of, or other voting or equity interest in, including any
securities exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into shares of
capital stock of or other voting or equity interest in,

 



      
 

 



 

any Person, except for Investment Assets acquired and held in the ordinary
course of the investment activities of the Company.

 



 

SECTION 3.4. _Authority_. Each Seller Party has the requisite corporate power
and authority to enter into the Transaction Agreements to which it is or will
be a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
The execution and delivery by each Seller Party of the Transaction Agreements
to which it is or will be a party and the consummation by each Seller Party of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been and, with respect
to the Transaction Agreements to be executed and delivered after the date of
this Agreement, will be, duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of such Seller Party. Each of the Transaction Agreements to which a
Seller Party is or will be a party has been or, with respect to the
Transaction Agreements to be executed and delivered after the date of this
Agreement, will be, duly executed and delivered by such Seller Party and,
assuming the Transaction Agreements constitute valid and binding agreements of
the Buyer Parties party thereto, constitute valid and binding obligations of
such Seller Party, enforceable against such Seller Party in accordance with
their terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now
or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights generally and (ii) the
remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable
relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court
before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

 



 

SECTION 3.5. _Noncontravention; Consents_. Except as disclosed in Section 3.5
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of the
Transaction Agreements by each Seller Party that is or will be a party
thereto, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby by such Seller Party, do not and will not (i) conflict with any of the
provisions of the Organizational Documents of any of the Seller Parties, (ii)
subject to the matters referred to in the next sentence, conflict with, result
in a breach of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both)
under, give any contracting party the right to terminate, cancel, accelerate
or receive any additional payment under, or result in the creation of any Lien
(other than a Permitted Lien) on any property, asset or right of the Company
under, any contract or commitment that is binding on the Company or (iii)
subject to the matters referred to in the next sentence, contravene any
Applicable Law, which, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. No consent, approval or authorization of, or declaration or
filing with, or notice to, any third party or Governmental Entity is required
by or with respect to any Seller Party in connection with the execution and
delivery of the Transaction Agreements by the Seller Parties, or the
consummation by the Seller Parties of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, except for the consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations,
filings and notices set forth in Section 3.5 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule.

 



 

SECTION 3.6. _Financial Statements; Insurance Reserves; Internal Controls_.

 



 

(a) Seller has previously delivered to Buyer a true, correct and complete copy
of the unaudited pro forma balance sheet of the Company as of December 31,
2012 prepared after giving pro forma effect to the Recapture and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to take place at or prior to the
Closing Date but, for the avoidance of doubt, without giving effect to the
application of Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-36(d) with respect to the

 



      
 

 



 

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Reference Balance Sheet_
"). The Reference Balance Sheet was prepared in good faith from the Books and
Records in accordance with the Accounting Principles, using the amounts set
forth in the Statutory Statements as the "actual" column and making pro forma
adjustments to give effect to assumptions that provide a reasonable basis for
presenting the significant effects of the Recapture and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, the
effect of the application of Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-36(d) on the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

 



 

(b) Seller has previously delivered to Buyer true, correct and complete copies
of (i) the audited annual statutory financial statements of the Company as of
and for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 and (ii) the
unaudited interim statutory financial statements of the Company as of and for
the three-month period ending March 31, 2013 (collectively, the " _Statutory
Statements_ "). Except as set forth in Section 3.6(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, the Statutory Statements were prepared in accordance with SAP and
fairly present, in all material respects, the admitted assets, liabilities and
capital and surplus of the Company at their respective dates and the results
of operations, changes in surplus and cash flows of the Company at and for the
periods indicated, subject, in the case of the financial statements referenced
in clause (ii) above, to normal recurring year-end adjustments. Section 3.6(b)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete list of all permitted
practices used by the Company in the preparation of the Statutory Statements.

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 10.9(c)_, except as set forth in Section 3.6(b) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Insurance Reserves reflected on the
Statutory Statements with respect to the Recaptured Business as of their
respective dates: (i) have been computed in all material respects in
accordance with presently accepted actuarial standards consistently applied;
(ii) were fairly stated in accordance with sound actuarial principles; (iii)
have been based on actuarial assumptions which produced reserves at least as
great as those called for in any contract provision as to reserve basis and
method, and are in accordance with all other contract provisions; (iv) met, in
all material respects, all requirements of SAP; and (v) include provisions for
all actuarial reserves and related statement items which ought to be
established, in each case, as required to be certified by the actuaries of the
Company, pursuant to Applicable Law.

 



 

(d) Each of the Company and Seller (with respect to the Company Business) has
devised and maintained a system of internal accounting controls with respect
to its business sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that: (i)
transactions are executed according to the managements general or specific
authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with SAP and to maintain
accountability for assets; (iii) access to its assets is permitted only in
accordance with managements general or specific authorization; and (iv)
recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences.

 



 

SECTION 3.7. _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. The Company does not have any
Liability that is required to be reflected in a balance sheet (or the notes
thereto) of the Company prepared in accordance with SAP except (i) those
Liabilities provided for, disclosed or reflected in the Statutory Statements
or in the notes thereto, (ii) Liabilities disclosed in Section 3.7 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule and (iii) Liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business

 



      
 

 



 

consistent with past practice since December 31, 2012. This _Section 3.7_
does not relate to Tax matters (which are the subject of _Section 3.10_).

 



 

SECTION 3.8. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as disclosed in
Section 3.8 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, from December 31, 2012 through
the date hereof, the Company (i) has conducted its business in the ordinary
course, and there has not been any event or change having, or that would
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, from December 31, 2012 through the date
hereof, the Company has not, except as set forth in Section 3.8 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, taken any action or failed to take any action that would
have required Buyers consent under clauses (vi), (vii), (viii), (ix), (x),
(xi), (xii) and (xvi) (with respect to any of the actions contemplated by such
identified clauses) of _Section 5.1(a)_ had such action or omission occurred
during the period from the date hereof to the Closing.

 



 

SECTION 3.9. _Employees and Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) Section 3.9(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule includes a list of all
material Company Benefit Plans. With respect to each such Company Benefit
Plan, Seller has delivered or made available to Buyer true, correct and
complete copies of (i) each writing constituting such Company Benefit Plan
(including, any and all amendments thereto) or, if unwritten, a summary
thereof, and (ii) the most recent summary plan description for each Company
Benefit Plan for which such a summary plan description is required.

 



 

(b) Except as disclosed in Section 3.9(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
there are no material claims or disputes pending or, to the Knowledge of
Seller, threatened by any Producer or former Producer with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan, other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course of
business.

 



 

(c) Except as disclosed in Section 3.9(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or
to the extent required by COBRA, no Company Benefit Plan provides any Producer
or any former Producer medical, dental or life insurance coverage or any other
welfare benefits after termination of such persons service for the Company.

 



 

(d) Except as disclosed in Section 3.9(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
the Company does not participate in, sponsor or maintain (i) any multiemployer
plan within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA or any Employee Benefit Plan
that has two or more contributing sponsors, at least two of whom are not under
common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA, (ii) any Employee
Benefit Plan subject to Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA, (iii) any "multiple
employer welfare arrangement" as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA, (iv) any
Employee Benefit Plan funded by a voluntary employees beneficiary association
within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, or (v) any other Employee
Benefit Plan subject to Section 412 of the Code, Section 430 of the Code or
Title IV of ERISA. There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist
that could result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a Liability
of the Company following the Closing.

 



 

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan in which or under which any Producer or former
Producer participates or is otherwise entitled to receive a benefit based on
services

 



      
 

 



 

rendered to or for the Company that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code is subject to a favorable determination by the Internal
Revenue Service and, to the Knowledge of Seller, no event has occurred and no
condition exists that has adversely affected or would reasonably be expected
adversely to affect the qualification of any such Company Benefit Plan. Each
Company Benefit Plan in which or under which any Producer or former Producer
participates or is otherwise entitled to receive a benefit based on services
rendered to or for the Company (i) has been administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and (ii) is in compliance in all
material respects with all Applicable Laws.

 



 

(f) Each Company Benefit Plan (i) in which or under which any Producer or
former Producer participates or is otherwise entitled to receive a benefit
based on services rendered to or for the Company and (ii) that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code, and any award under any such Company Benefit Plan that
is subject to Section 409A of the Code, has, in each case, been operated in
compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of the Code since
January 1, 2009. No Producer or former Producer of the Company is entitled to
receive any additional payment (including any tax gross-up or other payment)
from the Company as a result of the imposition of any taxes arising under
Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(g) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will result in, cause the accelerated
vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any
payment or benefit to any Producer or former Producer. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in
property or in the form of benefits) by the Company to any Producer in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby will be an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

was purported by the Company to apply to such Insurance Contract in written
materials provided by the Company to such purchaser, holder or intended
beneficiary at the time such Insurance Contract was initially sold or issued
or subsequently modified or (ii) for which policies, products or contracts of
that type were designed by the Company to qualify at such time or were
reasonably expected, based on written materials provided by the Company to

ARTICLE IV. 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

 



 

Subject to and as qualified by the matters set forth in the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule, Buyer represents and warrants to Seller, as of the date hereof and
as of the Closing Date (or such other date specified herein), as follows:

 



 

SECTION 4.1. _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. Buyer is a
corporation, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of Delaware. Each other Buyer Party is an entity duly incorporated or
organized (as the case may be), validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization. Buyer has the
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease or otherwise hold the
assets and properties owned, leased or otherwise held by it and to carry on
its business as now being conducted. Buyer is duly qualified as a foreign
corporation to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
(individually or in the aggregate) would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to materially impair the ability of Buyer to
consummate any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

SECTION 4.2. _Authority_. Each Buyer Party has the requisite corporate power
and authority to enter into the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The
execution and delivery by each Buyer Party of the Transaction Agreements to
which it is or will be a party and the consummation by each Buyer Party of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been and, with respect to
the Transaction Agreements to be executed and delivered after the date of this
Agreement, will be, duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of such Buyer Party. Each of the Transaction Agreements to which a Buyer
Party is or will be a party has been duly executed and delivered by such Buyer
Party and, assuming such Transaction Agreements constitute the valid and
binding agreement of the Seller Parties party thereto, constitute valid and
binding obligations of such Buyer Party, enforceable against such Buyer Party
in accordance with their terms except that (i) such enforcement may be subject
to applicable bankruptcy,

 



      
 

 



 

insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter
in effect, affecting creditors rights generally and (ii) the remedy of
specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be
subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which
any proceeding therefor may be brought.

 



 

SECTION 4.3. _Noncontravention; Consents_. Except as disclosed in Section 4.3
of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of the
Transaction Agreements by each Buyer Party that is or will be a party thereto
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby by such Buyer
Party do not and will not (i) conflict with any of the provisions of the
Organizational Documents of any Buyer Party, (ii) subject to the matters
referred to in the next sentence, conflict with, result in a breach of or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, give rise to
a right of termination under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other
than a Permitted Lien) on any property or asset of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any agreement, permit, license or instrument to which
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (iii) subject to the matters
referred to in the next sentence, contravene any Applicable Law, which, in the
case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, would materially impair the ability of
Buyer to consummate any of the transactions contemplated hereby. No consent,
approval or authorization of, or declaration or filing with, or notice to, any
third party or other Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to any
Buyer Party in connection with the execution and delivery of the Transaction
Agreements by the Buyer Parties or the consummation by the Buyer Parties of
any of the transactions contemplated thereby. To the Knowledge of Buyer, no
fact or circumstance relating to Buyer or its Affiliates (including their
plans for funding the purchase of the Shares or financing or operating the
Company from and after the Closing) exists as of the date hereof that would
render Buyer or its Affiliates, as applicable, unable promptly to obtain any
approval, authorization or consent of any Governmental Entity required to be
obtained to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements.

 



 

SECTION 4.4. _Compliance with Applicable Laws_. Except as disclosed in Section
4.4 of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, since its formation, Buyer has been in
compliance in all material respects with all Applicable Laws. Except as
disclosed in Section 4.4 of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, Buyer has not
received any written notice or other written communication from any
Governmental Entity regarding any (i) actual or alleged violation of, or
failure on the part of Buyer to comply with, any Applicable Laws or (ii)
investigation by any Governmental Entity of any such violation or failure to
comply, in each case other than any such item that has been cured or otherwise
resolved to the satisfaction of such Governmental Entity or that is no longer
being pursued by such Governmental Entity following a response by Buyer.

 



 

SECTION 4.5. _Purchase Not for Distribution_. The Shares to be acquired under
the terms of this Agreement will be acquired by Buyer for its own account and
not with a view to distribution. Buyer will not resell, transfer, assign,
pledge or otherwise dispose of any Shares, except in compliance with the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and any
applicable state securities laws, or pursuant to an available exemption
therefrom.

 



 

SECTION 4.6. _Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the Knowledge of
Buyer, threatened in writing against or affecting Buyer or any Affiliate of
Buyer that (i) seeks to

 



       
 

 



 

restrain or enjoin the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (ii) would reasonably be expected to impair materially the
ability of Buyer to consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Financing. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
nor, to the Knowledge of Buyer, any officer, director or employee of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates has been permanently or temporarily enjoined or barred
by any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Entity from engaging in
or continuing any conduct or practice in connection with the business
conducted by the Company or otherwise that would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the
ability of any Buyer Party to consummate any of the transactions contemplated
by any Transaction Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 4.7. _Financial Ability_.

 



 

(a) Attached as _Exhibit I_ are true, correct and complete copies of: (i) the
executed commitment letter, dated as of July 17, 2013 among Buyer, Royal Bank
of Canada, RBC Capital Markets, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and RBS
Securities Inc. (as amended, supplemented or replaced in compliance with this
Agreement, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Royal Bank of Canada
and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc have agreed to lend the amounts set forth
therein to Buyer for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the " _Debt Financing_ "); (ii) the executed equity commitment
letter, dated as of July 17, 2013 among Buyer, Parent and Resolution Life GP
Ltd. (as amended, supplemented or replaced as permitted by this Agreement, the
" _Equity Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth therein, Parent has committed to invest in Buyer
the cash amount set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ "), and which
makes Seller an express third-party beneficiary to the Equity Commitment
Letter entitled to enforce the obligations of Parent and the General Partner
(as defined in the Equity Commitment Letter) thereunder, subject to the
limitations set forth therein; and (iii) the executed commitment letter, dated
as of July 17, 2013 between Buyer and Hannover Life Reassurance Company of
America (as amended, supplemented or replaced as permitted by this Agreement,
the " _NER Commitment Letter_ " and together with the Debt Commitment Letter
and the Equity Commitment Letter, the " _Commitment Letters_ "), pursuant to
which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein,
Hannover Life Reassurance Company of America has agreed to provide financing
for certain of the Financed Amounts (the " _NER Financing_ " and together with
the Debt Financing and the Equity Financing, the " _Financing_ "). Buyer has
made available to Seller true and complete copies of (A) the subscription
agreements executed prior to the date hereof by the Investors, including the
amendments thereto executed on or prior to the date hereof, whereby they have
committed to become limited partners of Parent and to make the capital
contributions contemplated thereby and (B) the fully executed Limited
Partnership Agreement of Parent that is in effect as of the date hereof.

 



 

(b) None of the Commitment Letters has been amended or modified prior to the
date of this Agreement (provided that the existence or exercise of "flex"
provisions (if any) in the Fee Letter (as defined below) or in the NER
Commitment Letter shall not constitute an amendment or modification of the
Commitment Letters), and, as of the date hereof, the respective commitments
contained in the Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn, terminated or
rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, each Commitment Letter (x) is
in

 



      
 

 



 

full force and effect and (y) is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Buyer and, to the Knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto and is
enforceable against Buyer and, to the Knowledge of Buyer, each of the other
parties thereto, in each case except that (A) such enforceability may be
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights
generally and (B) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other
forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the
discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.
Other than as set forth in the Commitment Letters and the Fee Letter, there
are no conditions related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing
(including any "flex" provisions) (or, in the case of the NER Financing,
related to the closing of such Financing) under any agreement relating to the
Financing to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party. Buyer has fully
paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the
Commitment Letters that have become due and payable thereunder. No event has
occurred and no circumstance exists that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Buyer or any
of its Affiliates or, to the Knowledge of Buyer, on the part of any other
party to any Commitment Letter, under any term or condition of any Commitment
Letter. Assuming the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ will be satisfied at
or prior to the Closing, and assuming compliance in all material respects by
Seller with its obligations under this Agreement, Buyer has no reason to
believe that Buyer or any of its Affiliates will be unable to satisfy on a
timely basis any term or condition that is required to be satisfied by it or
any of its Affiliates as a condition to the funding of the Financing (or, in
the case of the NER Financing, to the closing of such Financing) by the
Financing Sources, or that the Financing will not be made available to Buyer
on the Closing Date. There are no side letters or other agreements, contracts
or arrangements, written or oral, related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Financing, other than the fee letter in
connection with the Debt Financing (the " _Fee Letter_ "), a true, correct and
complete copy of which has been provided by Buyer to Seller prior to the date
hereof, with only the fee amounts and the economic terms of any market "flex"
(none of which would adversely affect the amount or availability of the Debt
Financing) redacted.

 



 

(c) The funding commitments under the Commitment Letters, assuming the
commitment under the NER Commitment Letter were limited to $450,000,000 in
Financed Amounts, are in an amount sufficient to permit the Buyer Parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Transaction
Agreements and to perform their obligations under this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements, including the payment by Buyer of the Purchase Price
at the Closing as contemplated to be paid by _Section 2.1_ , to ensure that
the Company is adequately capitalized at the Closing in an amount sufficient
to support the ongoing administration of the Company Business following the
Closing and to pay all fees and expenses payable by them in connection with
this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements.

 



 

(d) No consent, approval or authorization of, or declaration or filing with,
or notice to, any third party or other Governmental Entity is required by or
with respect to any equity investor in Parent (the " _Investors_ ") in
connection with (A) the execution and delivery of the Transaction Agreements
by the Buyer Parties or the consummation by the Buyer Parties of any of the
transactions contemplated thereby, or (B) the execution and delivery of the
Equity Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement with respect to the
Equity Financing by any Buyer Party or any Investor or the consummation by any
Buyer Party or any Investor of the

 



      
 

 



 

Financing, except for the consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations,
filings and notices set forth in Section 4.7(d) of the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule.

 



 

SECTION 4.8. _Solvency_. Buyer is not entering into the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud
either present or future creditors of Buyer or the Company. Immediately
following the Closing and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Agreements, including the payment of the Adjusted Initial
Amount as contemplated by _Section 2.4_ and the payment of all other amounts
required to be paid by the Company or by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements
and all related fees and expenses, each of Buyer and the Company will be
solvent. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ ," when used
with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (i)
the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as
of such date, exceed (x) the value of all "liabilities of such Person,
including a reasonable estimate of contingent and other liabilities," as of
such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with
Applicable Law governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (y)
the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such
Person with respect to its existing debts (including contingent and other
liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (ii) such Person will
not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged
following such date and (iii) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities,
as of such date, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.
For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of
capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed
to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including a
reasonable estimate of contingent and other liabilities" means that such
Person will be able to generate enough cash to meet its obligations as they
become due.

 



 

SECTION 4.9. _Brokers_. Buyer is solely responsible for the payment of the
fees and expenses of any broker, investment banker, financial adviser or other
Person acting in a similar capacity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Buyer or any Affiliate.

and shall cause the Company to, furnish to Buyer such information that relates

case, to the extent that the applicable party is required to disclose such
information by judicial or administrative process or pursuant to Applicable
Law (provided that such party has given the other party written notice of such

may seek an appropriate order or other remedy protecting such information from
disclosure) or such information can be shown to have been in the public domain

practicable, all necessary permits, orders or other consents, approvals or
authorizations of Governmental Entities and consents or waivers of all other

transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, including the
Financing (including those set forth in Section 3.5 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule or Section 4.3 of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule but excluding those
contemplated by _Section 5.4(c)_ ); _provided_ , that Buyer and Seller shall
share equally in the costs (including any license or other fees and expenses)
associated with obtaining any such consents or waivers from such other third
parties. In connection therewith, Seller and Buyer shall make and cause their
respective Affiliates to make all legally required filings as promptly as
practicable in order to facilitate prompt consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements (including the Financing), shall
provide and shall cause their respective Affiliates to provide such
information and communications to Governmental Entities as such Governmental

to take all steps that are necessary, proper or advisable to avoid any Action
by any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by

in good faith any Action brought against such Person or any of its Affiliates
by any third party (including any Governmental Entity), whether judicial or
administrative, challenging any of the Transaction Agreements or the
transactions contemplated thereby (including the Financing), or that could
otherwise prevent, impede, interfere with, hinder or delay in any material
respect the consummation of any such transaction, including by using its
reasonable best efforts to have vacated or reversed any stay or temporary
restraining order entered with respect to any such transaction by any
Governmental Entity, and shall consent to and comply with any condition
imposed by any Governmental Entity on its grant of any such permit, order,
consent, approval or authorization, other than any such condition that, (i) in
the case of Buyer, would have a Material Adverse Effect or require the Company
immediately after the Closing to maintain a level of total adjusted capital
(as defined in the RBC Instructions) in excess of the Maximum Capital Amount
(such condition, a " _Buyer Burdensome Condition_ ") or (ii) in the case of
Seller, would require Seller to provide or maintain any guarantee or keepwell
or incur any Liability with respect to the Company after the Closing Date,
require Seller to make any capital contribution (whether through the
acquisition of surplus notes or equity securities or otherwise) to the Company
that would not be repaid in full prior to or at the Closing or restrict in any
material respect the ability of Seller or any of its Affiliates to conduct
their respective businesses after the Closing Date (a " _Seller Burdensome
Condition_ "). Each of the parties shall provide to the other party copies of
all applications or other communications to Governmental Entities in
connection with this Agreement in advance of the filing or submission thereof.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, within 20 Business Days
after the date hereof, each party shall file with all applicable Insurance
Regulators requests for approval of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements (including the Financing but excluding the Recapture),
which requests shall include applications from any Investors if and to the
extent such Investors are required to be included in such filings under
Applicable Law and all required exhibits; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, the following shall apply with respect to the NER Financing:
Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to file a complete package of
materials for approval of the NER Financing substantially contemporaneously
with the filing of its "Form A" statement with Nebraska; _provided_ , further
that Buyer may require up to 30 Business Days after the date hereof in order
to make such filing. Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates,
Representatives and Financing Sources not to,

 



      
 

 



 

make any written or oral request for approval from any Governmental Entity for
the NER Financing to include financing of more than $513,000,000 in Financed
Amounts, subject to Section 4.3 of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule. Buyer shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to, in connection
with seeking to obtain any permit, order, consent, approval or authorization
of any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, request approval to operate the Company at or after the
Closing at a level of total adjusted capital (as defined in the RBC
Instructions) that would correspond to an RBC Ratio below 300%. Seller
acknowledges that Buyer may request in its "Form A" filing the approval of the
Nebraska Department of Insurance for the payment immediately prior to, on or
immediately after the Closing of a dividend by the Company in an amount that,
after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
occur on or prior to the Closing, would not cause the Closing RBC Ratio to be
less than the Specified Capital Amount; _provided_ , that obtaining approval
from the Nebraska Department of Insurance for all or any portion of such
dividend (either alone or as part of Buyers request for approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) is not a condition to the
Closing. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with Buyers reasonable requests in seeking approval for such dividend;
_provided_ that, in connection with the foregoing, Seller shall not be
required to take any action that would adversely affect Seller or any of its
Affiliates, including by delaying in any material respect the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or negatively affecting the
likelihood that any applicable Governmental Entity will approve the repayment
in full by the Company, prior to or at the Closing, of any capital contributed
to the Company by Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with the
Recapture or pursuant to any keepwell entered into in connection with the
Recapture. Unless it would be prohibited to do so under Applicable Law, Buyer
shall cause any presentation provided to the Governmental Entities in the
State of Nebraska with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be substantially consistent with the presentation provided by
Buyer to the Lead Arrangers (as such term is defined in the Debt Commitment
Letter) on or prior to the date hereof, including with respect to initial
capitalization. Buyer shall enforce its rights under the Equity Commitment
Letter to cause Parent to exercise its rights under the Subscription Agreement
and the Limited Partnership Agreement to cause any Investors to furnish any
information, representations, certifications, applications, affidavits, forms
and other documents, make any filings and take such other actions, as may be
required under Applicable Law or that otherwise may be requested or required
by any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including as necessary to complete and make any regulatory
filing in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. A
reasonable time prior to furnishing any written materials to any Insurance
Regulator in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements (including the Financing), each party shall furnish the other a
copy thereof, and the receiving party shall have a reasonable opportunity to
provide comments thereon. Each party shall give to the other party prompt
written notice if it (or any of its Affiliates) receives, and Buyer shall give
Seller written notice if any of the Investors receive, any notice or other
communication from any Insurance Regulator in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements (including the Financing) promptly
after becoming aware of such notice or communication, and, in the case of any
such notice or communication which is in writing, shall furnish the other
party with a copy thereof promptly after receipt thereof. If any Insurance
Regulator requires that a hearing be held in connection with any such
approval, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange for such
hearing to be held

 



      
 

 



 

promptly after the notice that such hearing is required has been received by
such party. Each party shall give to the other party reasonable prior written
notice of the time and place when any meetings, telephone calls or other
conferences (other than immaterial non-substantive matters or matters that are
time-sensitive and for which reasonable prior notice cannot be given) may be
held by it with any Insurance Regulator in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, and the other party shall have the
right to have a representative or representatives attend or otherwise
participate in any such meeting, telephone call or other conference.

 



 

(c) Seller shall, and, to the extent reasonably requested by Seller, Buyer
shall cooperate in Sellers efforts to, as promptly as practicable after the
date hereof, but in no event later than 20 Business Days after the date
hereof, file with all applicable Governmental Entities requests for approval
of the Recapture to be completed pursuant to the terms of the Recapture
Agreement effective as of July 1, 2013 or such other date as may be mutually
agreed by the parties (it being agreed that, if any permit, order, consent,
approval or authorization of any Governmental Entity that is required in
connection with effecting the Recapture as of July 1, 2013 cannot be obtained,
then the parties shall negotiate in good faith and use commercially reasonable
efforts to agree to an alternative date as proximate as possible to July 1,
2013 for effecting the Recapture that is acceptable to such Governmental
Entity and mutually acceptable to both parties; _provided_ , that neither
party may object to any other effective date if implementing the Recapture as
of such date would not have a material adverse effect on the aggregate
economic benefits, taken as a whole, that such party reasonably expects to
derive from the implementation of the Recapture as of July 1, 2013). Promptly
after receipt of all applicable orders, consents, approvals and authorizations
of any Governmental Entity required in connection with the consummation of the
Recapture, Seller shall, and shall cause the Company to, execute the Recapture
Agreement and amend the Existing Seller Reinsurance Agreements as and to the
extent necessary to reflect the Recapture. From the time at which the
Recapture is consummated until the Closing, Seller shall continue to
administer the Company Business pursuant to existing intercompany
arrangements. In the event that, in connection with its grant of any order,
consent, approval or authorization with respect to the consummation of the
Recapture, any Governmental Entity requires Seller or any of its Affiliates to
make a capital contribution to the Company (whether through the acquisition of
surplus notes or equity securities or otherwise), to provide any guarantee or
keepwell to the Company or to enter into any other agreement or arrangement
with respect to the Company or the Recapture, Buyer and Seller shall each use
reasonable best efforts to obtain approval from all applicable Governmental
Entities for (A) in the event that a capital contribution is required, a
dividend, distribution or other payment in the full amount of such capital
contribution to be made in cash by the Company to Seller prior to or at the
Closing, (B) in the event that a guarantee or keepwell is required, a
termination of such guarantee or keepwell prior to or at the Closing and a
repayment in cash of any amounts paid under such guarantee or keepwell between
the date hereof and the Closing, and (C) in the event that any such other
agreement or arrangement with respect to the Company or the Recapture is
required, an unwinding or termination of such agreement or arrangement prior
to or at the Closing.

 



 

(d) From the date hereof to the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall each use
its reasonable best efforts, and shall cooperate fully with each other, to
cause the reinsurer under each Ceded Reinsurance Contract pursuant to which
such reinsurer reinsures both risk included

 



       
 

 



 

in the Company Business and risk that is not included in the Company Business
(each, a " _Shared Reinsurance Agreement_ ") to (i) enter into (A) a novation
to Seller or one or more of its Affiliates of the portion of such Shared
Reinsurance Agreement comprising risk that is not included in the Company
Business or (B) an amendment of such Shared Reinsurance Agreement to exclude
the risk that is not included in the Company Business together with a new
reinsurance arrangement with Seller or one or more of its Affiliates pursuant
to which such risk will be reinsured by such reinsurer on the same terms as
those applicable under the Shared Reinsurance Agreement (each of (A) and (B),
an " _Alternative Reinsurance Arrangement_ ") and (ii) waive any right to
terminate such Shared Reinsurance Agreement pursuant to its terms as a result
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ that neither party shall be required to compromise any right, asset
or benefit or expend any amount, incur any Liability or provide any other
consideration in connection with obtaining the consent of any reinsurer to any
Alternative Reinsurance Arrangement. The Amended and Restated Reinsurance
Agreement will provide that, if the parties are unable to effect an
Alternative Reinsurance Arrangement with respect to any Shared Reinsurance
Agreement and such Shared Reinsurance Agreement remains in effect after the
Closing, the Company will assign to Seller all rights to the reinsurance
recoveries under such Shared Reinsurance Agreement that relate to the business
reinsured to Seller or the Vermont Captive, and Seller will administer the
business that is subject to such Shared Reinsurance Agreement and is not
included in the Company Business under the Administrative Services Agreement.

 



 

(e) From the date hereof to the Closing Date, Seller shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the reinsurer under each Ceded Reinsurance Contract that
covers only Specified Life Business, or that otherwise covers only business
that is not Company Business, to enter into either (i) a novation of such
Ceded Reinsurance Contract from the Company to Seller or one of its Affiliates
or (ii) a termination of such Ceded Reinsurance Contract together with the
concurrent entry into a new reinsurance contract with Seller on the same terms
covering such Specified Life Business or such other business; _provided_ that
neither party shall be required to compromise any right, asset or benefit or
expend any amount, incur any Liability or provide any other consideration in
connection with obtaining the consent of any reinsurer to any such alternative
arrangement. If the parties are unable to effect an alternative arrangement
with respect to any such Ceded Reinsurance Contract and such Ceded Reinsurance
Contract remains in effect after the Closing Date, Buyer shall assign to
Seller all rights to the reinsurance recoveries under such Ceded Reinsurance
Contract and Seller will administer the business that is subject to such Ceded
Reinsurance Contract under the Administrative Services Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 5.5. _Public Announcements_. Each of Buyer and Seller, and their
respective Affiliates, shall consult with each other before issuing, and
provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public announcement with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements (including regarding its plans
relating to employees, Producers or other third parties or with respect to the
funding or operation of the business of the Company) and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public announcement with respect to such
matters without the advance approval of the other party following such
consultation (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
except as may be required by Applicable Law or by the requirements of any
securities exchange; _provided_ , that, in the event that any party is
required under Applicable Law or the requirements of any securities exchange
to issue any such press release or make any public announcement and

 



      
 

 



 

it is not feasible to obtain the advance approval of the other party hereto as
required by this _Section 5.5_, the party that issues such press release or
makes such statement shall provide the other party with notice and a copy of
such press release or statement as soon as reasonably practicable and will
make any correction that may be reasonably required by the other party.

 



 

SECTION 5.6. _Related Party Agreements_. Except as set forth in Section 5.6
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, all of the intercompany arrangements
between Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company), on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, will be terminated immediately prior to
the Closing, including by terminating the Companys participation in all
agreements between more than one of the Companys Affiliates, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, and Seller shall cause all intercompany
balances between Seller and its respective Affiliates (other than the
Company), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, to be paid in
full and settled immediately prior to the Closing or as soon thereafter as is
reasonably practicable.

 



 

SECTION 5.7. _Use of Name; Domain Name Assignments_.

 



 

(a) Prior to or at the Closing, the Company shall transfer any and all right,
title or interest, including all associated goodwill, which it may have in or
to the names, trademarks and service marks set forth in Section 5.7(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule or any name, trademark, service mark, acronym or
logo incorporating any of such names, trademarks or service marks
(collectively, the " _Seller Trademarks_ "), to Seller or as Seller may
direct.

 



 

(b) Prior to or at the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
(other than the Company) to, transfer any and all right, title or interest,

Disclosure Schedule or any name, trademark, service mark, acronym or logo
incorporating any of such names, trademarks or service marks that does not
also contain all or a portion of a Seller Trademark (collectively, the "
_Company Trademarks_ "), to the Company.

 



 

(c) Following the Closing Date, except as otherwise provided in this _Section
5.7_, Buyer shall cause the Company promptly to cease and discontinue any and
all uses of the Seller Trademarks, whether or not in combination with other
words, symbols or other distinctive or non-distinctive elements, and all
trade, corporate or business names, trademarks, tag lines, identifying logos,
trade dress, monograms, slogans, service marks, domain names, brand names and
other name or source identifiers that are derivations, translations,
adaptations, combinations or variations of the Seller Trademarks; _provided_ ,
that the Company may use Seller Trademarks in accordance with the Intellectual
Property License. Buyer, for itself and its Affiliates, agrees that, except as
provided in this _Section 5.7_ and the Intellectual Property License, any and
all rights of the Company to the Seller Trademarks, including any such rights
licensed to the Company pursuant to any agreements or other arrangements,
whether written or oral, with Seller or its Affiliates, shall terminate on the
Closing Date without recourse by Buyer or the Company. Neither Buyer nor any
of its Affiliates shall seek to register in any jurisdiction any trade,
corporate or business name, trademark, tag-line, identifying logo, trade
dress, monogram, slogan, service mark, domain name, brand name or other name
or source identifier that is a derivation, translation, adaptation,
combination or variation of the Seller Trademarks.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The Company hereby grants to Seller and the Vermont Captive a perpetual,
irrevocable fully paid-up right and license for the Vermont Captive to
continue to use the name "Lincoln Benefit" in its legal name and for
associated uses requiring reference to such legal name. For the avoidance of
doubt, no right is granted to use the name "Lincoln Benefit" as a brand in
connection with the advertising, promotion, marketing, sale or distribution of
products or services, except in connection with products or services
associated with the Company, but such entity shall be permitted to identify
itself as the seller of its products and services in an informational context.
Upon the request of Buyer after the Closing Date, Seller will use its
reasonable best efforts as promptly as practicable after receiving such
request to change the name of the Vermont Captive to a name that does not
include "Lincoln Benefit" or any confusingly similar name.

 



 

(e) Prior to or at the Closing, the Company shall transfer any and all right,
title or interest which it may have in or to any Internet domain name
containing all or a portion of a Seller Trademark to Seller or as Seller may
direct. Seller may, from and after the Closing, maintain in effect the
Internet domain name "allstatelincoln.com", and may cause such Internet domain
name to redirect to an Internet domain name owned by Seller or any of its
Affiliates that does not include a Company Trademark. Prior to or at Closing,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (other than the Company) to,
transfer any and all right, title or interest which it or they may have in or
to any Internet domain name containing all or a portion of a Company Trademark
that does not also contain a Seller Trademark, as set forth in Section 5.7(e)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, to the Company. Except as contemplated
above, nothing in this Agreement requires Seller to assign any rights in or
to, or grant the Company a right or license to use, any domain name that
includes "Allstate" in its name, and nothing in this Agreement requires the
Company to assign any rights in or to, or grant Seller a right or license to
use, any domain name that includes the Lincoln Benefit name in it.

provisions of the Transaction Agreements and consummate or implement
expeditiously the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements and
(ii) shall refrain from taking any actions that could reasonably be expected
to impair, delay or impede the Closing.

 



 

(b) On and after the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause

additional documents, instruments or conveyances of any kind which may be
reasonably necessary to carry out any of the provisions hereof, so as to put
Buyer and its Affiliates in full possession and operating control of the
Company Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall be obligated
pursuant to this _Section 5.8_ to execute or deliver, or cause to be executed
or delivered, any document, certificate, agreement, instrument, conveyance or
other writing, or take, cause to be taken, any action, if the effect thereof
would be to increase the Liability or obligations of such party in any
material respect, other than as contemplated elsewhere in this Agreement or
the other Transaction Agreements.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 5.9. _Access to Books and Records_. Until the later of the sixth
anniversary of the Closing or such time as the information and access
described below is no longer reasonably required by Seller ( _provided_ , that
Buyer shall give 30 days notice to Seller prior to destroying any records to
permit Seller, at its expense, to examine, duplicate or repossess such books
and records), Buyer shall afford promptly to Seller and its Representatives
access to the books, records, officers, employees, auditors and other advisors
of the Company, and provide information with respect to the Company in a
readily accessible form (including financial information in a form consistent
with the Companys historical practice for the preparation of such financial
information), to the extent reasonably required by Seller for any lawful
business purpose, including litigation, disputes, compliance, financial
reporting (including financial audits of historical information), loss
reporting, regulatory, Tax and accounting matters (including for any such
matters related to the Transition Services Agreement), and including all
reasonable purposes relating to the Variable Annuity Transaction and the
ongoing relationship between Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
the VA Buyer, on the other hand, and Buyer shall cooperate fully with Seller
and its Representatives to furnish such books and records and information and
make available such officers, employees, auditors and other advisors of the
Company; _provided_ , that such access does not unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of the business of Buyer or the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, access to records relating to Taxes shall be governed exclusively
by _Section 8.4_.

any MBA Group or other Producer to terminate its relationship with the
Company, (iii) induce any MBA Group or other Producer, or solicit any holder

to any insurance or annuity policy or contract included in the Company
Business.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 5.10(a)_,
and without implication that the following activities otherwise would be

does not have the right to designate a majority of the members of the board of
directors or other governing body of such entity or otherwise to direct the

securities) of such entity, excluding any investment held in a general account
or separate account of any insurance company or in any portfolio managed for

(iii) selling any of its assets or businesses to a Person engaged in a
Competing Business or any business that competes with a Competing Business; or

 



 

(iv) acquiring any assets, or acquiring, merging or combining with any Person
that would cause Seller or any of its Affiliates (as then constituted) to be
engaged in Competing Business (" _After-Acquired Business_ "); _provided_ ,
that either (A) at the time of such acquisition, merger or combination, the
revenues derived from the Competing Business by the After-Acquired Business
(the " _Competing After-Acquired Revenues_ ") constitute no more than 20% of
the gross revenues of the After-Acquired Business (for the avoidance of doubt,
including the revenues of all Persons directly or indirectly acquired as a
result of such acquisition, merger or combination) in the most recently
completed fiscal year immediately prior to the date of such acquisition,
merger or combination (the " _Aggregate After-Acquired Revenues_ "), or (B) if
at the time of such acquisition, merger or combination, the Competing After-
Acquired Revenues constitute more than 20% of the Aggregate After-Acquired
Revenues then, within one year after such acquisition, merger or combination,
(i) Seller or such Affiliate of Seller signs a definitive agreement to
dispose, and subsequently disposes of, the relevant portion of the business or
securities of such After-Acquired Business or (ii) Seller or such Affiliate of
Seller otherwise modifies the After-Acquired Business such that the Competing
After-Acquired Revenues constitute not more than 20% of the Aggregate After-
Acquired Revenues.

 



 

SECTION 5.11. _Non-Solicitation_. For a period of 24 months following the
Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Seller, neither Buyer nor
any of its Affiliates shall, whether directly or indirectly, solicit for
employment, employ or contract for the services of any Person who is employed
by or engaged in the business of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than
any individuals identified in a writing signed by Buyer and Seller on or after
the date hereof); _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.11_ shall
prohibit Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company) from engaging
in general solicitations not directed at such Persons or from soliciting,
employing or contracting for the services of any such Person whose employment
with or engagement by Seller and its Affiliates has been terminated by Seller
or its applicable Affiliate or who has otherwise ceased to be employed or
engaged by Seller or any of its Affiliates for a period of at least six months

respective Affiliates shall have any responsibility, liability or obligation
for, and shall not be deemed to have assumed or to become responsible for, any
such Excluded Employee Liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt, "Excluded

their capacities as employees of the Company or of Seller or any of its
Affiliates) or any Liabilities relating to any deferred compensation plan
sponsored by the Company for the benefit of Producers.

disclosed, transferred or licensed to agree to restrictions on replacements of
VA Contracts substantially equivalent to the restriction set forth in _Section
5.13(b)_ and not to disclose, transfer or license such information to an

maintain the appointment of such Exclusive Producer to act as an insurance
agent on behalf of the Company, (ii) provide such information to such
Exclusive Producer as is necessary to permit such Exclusive Producer to offer
Designated Company Conversion Policies (as defined in the Administrative
Services Agreement) on behalf of the Company to the holder of such Reinsured
Convertible Policy and (iii) pay commissions to such Exclusive Producer for
the placement of such Designated Company Conversion Policy (including with

Reinsured Convertible Policy or any Designated Company Conversion Policy
issued pursuant to this _Section 5.14_ for replacement with another policy
written by the Company or any other Person other than in accordance with the
terms of this _Section 5.14_.

 



 

(b) Following the Closing Date, at Sellers sole cost and expense, Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Company to, provide such information to any
Exclusive Provider as is necessary to permit such Exclusive Provider to
service customers with respect to any insurance policy or contract produced by
such Exclusive Provider, and none of Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall,
whether directly or indirectly, support or sponsor a program with the intended
or reasonably expected result to be the replacement of any Exclusive Provider.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Seller shall promptly reimburse Buyer and the Company for its reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred in complying with the obligations
in this _Section 5.14_.

 



 

(d) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, directly or indirectly,
sell, convey or transfer 50% or more of the outstanding capital stock of the
Company or all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person,
in one transaction or a series of transactions that are part of a common plan,
or any transaction that constitutes the functional equivalent of any of the
foregoing, unless the acquiring Person in such transaction or transactions
expressly agrees pursuant to an agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to
Seller to assume all of the obligations of Buyer under this _Section 5.14_.

 



 

SECTION 5.15. _Specified Capital Charge_.

 



 

(a) From and after the date hereof, each of Seller and Buyer shall cooperate

reasonable best efforts, both prior to and after the Closing, to ensure that
no Specified Capital Charge is imposed on the Company; _provided_ , that,
except as provided in _Section 5.15(b)_, neither party shall be required to
make any capital contribution to the Company or agree to any limitation on
dividends in order to comply with the foregoing.

 



 

(b) If, at any time after the Closing but prior to the earlier of (i) the
completion of the Companys first triennial examination that is completed by
the Nebraska Insurance Department after the Closing Date and (ii) the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date, a Specified Capital Charge is imposed on the
Company, then Seller shall either (A) purchase from the Company surplus notes
or preferred stock having the terms set forth in the term sheet attached as
_Exhibit J_ in an aggregate principal amount or with an aggregate liquidation
preference, as applicable, equal to the amount by which the Required Capital
Amount as of the date on which such Specified Capital Charge is imposed on the
Company is increased directly as a result of such Specified Capital Charge,
but only to the extent that such Required Capital Amount exceeds the Specified
Capital Amount or (B) choose to amend the terms of the Amended and Restated
Reinsurance Agreement and the Reinsurance Trust (or the composition of the
assets held in the trust account established pursuant to the Reinsurance
Trust) in order to eliminate the effect of such Specified Capital Charge. If
Seller elects to effect any amendment contemplated by clause (B) of the
immediately preceding sentence, the parties shall amend or modify such
agreements to eliminate the effect of such Specified Capital Charge, and each
party shall agree to any such amendment or modification so long as it would
not adversely affect such party. The obligations of Seller under this
_Section 5.15_ shall not apply from and after any date on which Parent is no
longer the direct or indirect owner of at least a majority of the outstanding
equity securities of the Company (except as a result of an initial public
offering of Parent or any Affiliate of Parent that controls the Company) or
the Company is no longer domiciled in the State of Nebraska.

obligations under _Section 5.15_ remain in effect or (ii) Seller holds any
shares of preferred stock of the Company, permit the Companys Organizational
Documents to be amended in any manner that would affect the Companys ability

(a) Promptly after the date hereof, and in any event within 60 days hereafter,
Seller and Buyer shall each appoint a transition team to:

 



 

(i) cooperate in good faith to develop a separation plan for separating the
Company Business from the businesses of Seller and its Affiliates (including
the Company) that is not Company Business so as to minimize the adverse impact
of such separation on each partys businesses, and

 



 

(ii) review, revise and update, where appropriate, the schedules to the
Transition Services Agreement, the Administrative Services Agreement and the
Agent Servicing Agreement between the date hereof and the Closing and any such
mutually agreed upon revised and updated schedules will replace the
corresponding schedules attached to the form of Transition Services Agreement,
the form of Administrative Services Agreement or the form of the Agent
Servicing Agreement, as applicable.

 



 

(b) Seller may, between the date hereof and the Closing Date, take any actions
necessary or appropriate to cause the Companys participation under the
agreement identified in Section 5.17(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to
be terminated as of or prior to the Closing Date and for the Company no longer
to be a party to such agreement from and after such date; _provided_ that
Seller shall arrange for the Company to have direct or indirect access to the
retained asset account that is the subject of such agreement for the term
specified in the Transition Services Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 5.18. _Certain Business_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller may cause
the Company to recapture from Seller the business identified on Section 5.18
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and cause the Company to cede such business
to an Affiliate of Seller on reinsurance terms that are substantially similar
to the terms pursuant to which the Vermont Captive Business is ceded by the
Company to the Vermont Captive provided, however, that such recapture does not
result in any adverse effect to the Company that is not reimbursed by Seller
or otherwise subject to indemnification by Seller under this Agreement,
including without limitation with respect to the risk based capital treatment
of such reinsurance. In addition, any such business shall only be recaptured
to the extent of actual payments by the captive, it being the intent that
Seller shall retain the financial risk of any uncollected or uncollectible
amount with respect to such reinsurance. If Seller does not effect the
recapture and reinsurance transactions described in the previous sentence
prior to the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, at Sellers
request and sole cost and expense, cooperate with Seller to cause such
recapture and reinsurance transactions to be effected after the Closing Date
and take all reasonable actions, and execute all documents, certificates,
agreements, instruments or conveyances or other writings of any kind, that may
be reasonably necessary to carry out and give effect to such recapture and
reinsurance transactions, including using reasonable best efforts

 



       
 

 



 

to obtain, at Sellers sole cost and expense, any consents, approvals or
authorizations of Governmental Entities that may necessary to effect such
recapture and reinsurance transactions.

 



 

SECTION 5.19. _Investment Assets_. From June 30, 2013 and until the Closing,
Seller shall cause the Investment Assets held by the Company and the

") to be managed in accordance with the investment guidelines set forth in
Section 5.19 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

SECTION 5.20. _Resignations_. At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver

SECTION 5.22. _Annuity Administration_. After the date hereof, Seller may
negotiate and execute agreements relating to the administration by se2 of the
annuity contracts included in the Company Business and may take any other
actions that may be reasonably necessary to transition the administration of
such annuity contracts to se2. Buyer acknowledges that such transition might
not be completed prior to the Closing and agrees that it shall, and shall
cause the Company to, cooperate with Seller to effect such transition after
the Closing. The costs and expenses of such transition shall be borne by the
parties in the manner contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 5.23. _Buyer Financing_.

efforts to (A) obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters and (B) close the NER
Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the NER Commitment Letter.
Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, use reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment
Letter and the NER Commitment Letter in accordance with their terms, (ii)
satisfy as promptly as practicable (or obtain the waiver of) all conditions
applicable to obtaining the Debt Financing and NER Financing that are within
the control of Buyer or any of its Affiliates on terms set forth in the
applicable Commitment Letters or in any definitive documents with respect to
such Financing, (iii) enter into, as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof, definitive documents with respect to the Debt Financing on terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters and (iv) use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing Sources to fund the Debt
Financing at or prior to the Closing and close the NER Financing immediately
after the Closing (including by commencing Actions against the Financing
Sources to enforce the terms of the applicable Commitment Letters or any
definitive documents relating to such Financing). Buyer shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, comply with all of their obligations under the Commitment
Letters and any definitive documents relating to the Financing.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller, permit any
amendment or modification to be made to the Debt Commitment Letter or any
definitive document relating to the Debt Financing that would (A) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (without a corresponding increase in
another portion of the Financing effected in compliance with this _Section
5.23_), including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount of the Debt Financing), (B) impose new or additional conditions, or
otherwise amend, modify or expand the conditions, to the drawdown of the Debt
Financing in a manner that, in the reasonable expectation of Buyer, would
delay or prevent the Closing or make the drawdown of the Debt Financing (or
the satisfaction of the conditions to such drawdown) less likely to occur;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may replace, amend or modify the Debt
Commitment Letter to add or replace Financing Sources, lead arrangers,
syndication agents, bookrunners or similar entities.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller, permit any
amendment or modification to be made to the NER Commitment Letter that would
(A) change the aggregate amount of the NER Financing, including by changing
the amount of fees to be paid, (B) impose new or additional conditions, or
otherwise amend, modify or expand the conditions, to the closing of the NER
Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent
the Closing; _provided_ , that Buyer may replace, amend or modify the NER
Commitment Letter to add or replace Financing Sources.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller, permit any
amendment or modification to be made to the Equity Commitment Letter, and
shall cause its Affiliates to use reasonable best efforts to obtain the
proceeds of the Equity Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Equity Commitment Letter.

 



 

(e) Buyer shall not release or consent to the termination of the obligations
of any Financing Source under any Commitment Letter or any definitive document
with respect to the Financing without Sellers prior written consent, provided
for the avoidance of doubt that no such consent is required in connection with
any release or termination in connection with the replacement of one or more
Financing Sources as permitted under this _Section 5.23_.

 



 

(f) Buyer shall give Seller reasonably prompt notice of (I) any termination of
the Commitment Letters or material breach by any party thereto of which Buyer
becomes aware, (II) the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Financing Source regarding any actual or alleged
breach, default, termination or repudiation of any Commitment Letter or any
definitive document with respect to the Financing by any party thereto and
(III) any reason Buyer believes in good faith that it will not be able to
obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from
the sources contemplated by the Commitment Letters or the definitive documents
relating thereto. Buyer shall provide any information reasonably requested by
Seller relating to any of the circumstances described in the foregoing
sentence as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within three
Business Days, after the date that Seller delivers to Buyer a written request
for such information. Buyer shall consult with and keep Seller reasonably
informed upon request of the status of its efforts to arrange for and
consummate the Financing, and shall promptly provide Seller true, correct and
complete copies of any definitive documents that are executed in connection
with the Financing. If any portion of the Debt Financing or NER Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and

 



      
 

 



 

conditions set forth in the applicable Commitment Letters, Buyer shall (1)
promptly notify Seller of such unavailability and the reasons therefor and (2)
use its reasonable best efforts, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, to arrange for and obtain, and negotiate and enter
into definitive documents with respect to, alternative financing from
alternative sources (" _Alternative Financing_ ") in an amount sufficient to
permit the Buyer Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and pay all related costs and
expenses required to be paid by them in connection therewith; _provided_ that
(i) in no event may any Alternative Financing involve a public offering that
is registered with, or require any filings with, the Securities and Exchange
Commission or under the securities laws of any jurisdiction and (ii) in no
event shall Buyer be required to enter into any Alternative Financing on terms
that, taken in the aggregate, are materially less favorable to it than the
terms of the Equity Financing, Debt Financing or the NER Financing, as the
case may be.

 



 

(g) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that obtaining neither the Debt
Financing nor the Equity Financing is a condition to the Closing and reaffirms
its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
irrespective and independently of the availability of the Debt Financing and
the Equity Financing, subject only to the fulfillment of the conditions set
forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_ (or waiver thereof as provided in _Sections
6.1_ and _6.2_ ). Buyer further acknowledges and agrees that the closing or
consummation of the NER Financing shall not be a condition to the Closing and
reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement notwithstanding that the NER Financing has not been consummated,
subject only to the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_
and _6.2_ (or waiver thereof as provided in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_ ),
including obtaining the prior approval of the Governmental Entities set forth
on Section 4.3 of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule with respect to the NER
Financing. The closing of the NER Financing will not occur until after the
Closing.

personnel and advisors to use their reasonable best efforts to), as promptly
as reasonably practicable, cooperate with and provide such assistance to Buyer
as is reasonably requested by Buyer in Buyers efforts to obtain (i) the Debt
Financing and the NER Financing on the terms contemplated herein and in the
respective Commitment Letters and (ii) additional equity financing through the
admission of new investors to Parent as limited partners on the terms
contemplated under the Limited Partnership Agreement (" _Additional Equity
Financing_ ").

 



 

(b) The cooperation and assistance contemplated by _Section 5.24_(a) shall

provided to the Financing Sources prior to the date hereof, collectively, the
" _Required Financial Information_ "); (vi) subject to receipt of assurances
of confidentiality in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller,

diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies on reasonable advance
notice; (vii) filing all required applications and requests for approval with
all applicable Governmental Entities required in connection with the NER
Financing (which will be prepared by Buyer and whose form and substance will
be subject to the approval of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); and (viii) taking such corporate actions as
shall be reasonably requested of Seller or the Company by Buyer to permit the
consummation of the Financing or Additional Equity Financing to permit the
proceeds thereof to be made available at the Closing and permit the Closing of
the NER Financing to occur immediately after the Closing, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller and, until the Closing occurs, the Company shall not
(1) have any Liability or any obligation under any agreement or document
related to the Financing or any Additional Equity Financing or (2) be required
to incur any Liability in connection with the Financing or Additional Equity
Financing other than out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with its
compliance with this _Section 5.24_, which shall promptly be reimbursed by
Buyer. Without limitation to the foregoing, Seller shall provide, and shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its and the Companys
Representatives, including legal, tax, regulatory and accounting to provide,
all other information and cooperation reasonably requested by the Financing
Sources or Buyer. Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall have any
obligation to provide any representations, warranties, assurances or opinions
to any Person as to the accuracy or completeness of any information made
available to any Financing Source, potential lender, equity or other
investors, rating agencies, Governmental Entity or any other Person, and,
except for the rights of the Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to _Section
7.2(a)(i)_ (subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement), Seller
shall have no Liability or obligation with respect to any information provided

in all respects, and the other Buyer Fundamental Representations that are not
so qualified shall be true and correct in all material respects, in each case
on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as though made on and as of
the Closing Date (except for representations and warranties that are made as
of a specific date, which representations and warranties shall be true and
correct at and as of such earlier date).

 



 

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Buyer_. Buyer shall have performed and
complied in all material respects with all agreements, obligations and
covenants required to be performed or complied with by it under this Agreement
on or prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) _Closing Deliveries_. Buyer shall have delivered or caused to have

keepwell required to be provided by Seller or any of its Affiliates to the
Company in connection

 



      
 

 



 

with or as a result of the consummation of the Recapture shall have been
terminated and (ii) any other agreements or arrangements with respect to the
Company or the Recapture that Seller or any of its Affiliates was required to
enter into in connection with or as a result of the Recapture shall have been
unwound or terminated; _provided_ that any order, consent, approval or
authorization of any Insurance Regulator or other Governmental Entity that may
have been required in order to effect any of the foregoing shall have been
obtained without the imposition of a Seller Burdensome Condition.

 



 

ARTICLE VII. 
INDEMNIFICATION

 



 

SECTION 7.1. _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.

 



 

(a) The representations and warranties of Seller and Buyer contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of this _Article VII_
and shall terminate and expire on the earlier of March 31, 2015 or 30 days
after receipt by Buyer of an audit report with respect of the annual financial
statements of the Company for the year ending December 31, 2014, after which
time no claim for indemnification with respect thereto may be brought;
_provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Buyer Fundamental
Representations, the Seller Fundamental Representations and the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.10_ shall survive
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations plus 60 days,
after which time no claim for indemnification with respect thereto may be
brought, (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.15_
shall (subject to _Section 7.9_) survive until the fourth anniversary of the
Closing Date, after which time no claim for indemnification with respect
thereto may be brought and (iii) the representations and warranties set forth
in _Section 3.6(a)_ shall not survive the Closing.

 



 

(b) To the extent that it is to be performed after the Closing, each covenant
in this Agreement will survive and remain in effect in accordance with its
terms plus a period of six months thereafter, after which no claim for
indemnification with respect thereto may be brought hereunder. All covenants
in this Agreement that by their terms are required to be fully performed prior
to the Closing will survive the Closing for a period of six months, after
which time no claim for indemnification with respect thereto may be brought
hereunder.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claim for indemnification with respect
to any breach of any representation, covenant or agreement in respect of which
indemnity may be sought under this Agreement shall survive the time at which
it would otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding paragraphs (a) and (b)
of this _Section 7.1_ if such claim has been properly made pursuant to this
_Article VII_ prior to such time.

 



 

SECTION 7.2. _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its directors,
officers, employees and Affiliates (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified
Persons_ ") from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses to the extent
directly or indirectly resulting from or arising out of:

 



 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller made in this
Agreement;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant of Seller under
this Agreement; or

 



 

(iii) any Excluded Liabilities.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its directors,
officers, employees and Affiliates (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified
Persons_ ") from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses to the extent
directly or indirectly resulting from or arising out of:

 



 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer made in this
Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant of Buyer under
this Agreement.

 



 

(c) For purposes of this _Article VII_ (i) a breach of a representation or
warranty shall be deemed to exist either if such representation or warranty is
actually inaccurate or breached or would have been inaccurate or breached if
such representation or warranty had not contained any qualification as to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect (which, in each case, instead will be
read as any adverse effect or change) or similar language, and (ii) the amount
of Indemnifiable Losses in respect of a breach resulting from the application
of clause (i) above shall be determined without regard to any limitation or
qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect (which instead will
be read as any adverse effect or change) or similar language set forth in such
representation or warranty, in each case other than any such limitation or
qualification contained in _Sections 3.8_ , _3.13(a)_ , _3.18(a)_ , the first
sentence of _Section 3.9(a)_, the second sentence of _Section 3.11(b)_, the
second sentence of _Section 3.17_ or the first sentence of _Section
3.20(e)_, or that is inherent in SAP or in the methods, procedures and
practices that constitute the Accounting Principles for purposes of _Section
3.6_.

 



 

SECTION 7.3. _Certain Limitations_.

 



 

(a) No party shall be obligated to indemnify and hold harmless its respective
Indemnitees under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ (in the case of Seller) or _Section
7.2(b)(i)_ (in the case of Buyer) (i) with respect to any claim or claims
based on a series of substantially similar facts, events or circumstances,
unless such claim or claims involved Indemnifiable Losses in excess of $75,000
(the " _Threshold Amount_ ") (nor shall any claim that does not exceed the
Threshold Amount be applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the
amount of Indemnifiable Losses for which the Indemnitor is responsible under
clause (ii) below) and (ii) unless and until the aggregate amount of all
Indemnifiable Losses of the Indemnitees under such _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ or
such _Section 7.2(b)(i)_, as the case may be, exceeds 1.5% of the Purchase
Price for all such Indemnifiable Losses (the " _Deductible_ "), at which point
such Indemnitor shall be liable to its respective Indemnitees for the value of
the Indemnitees claims under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 7.2(b)(i)_, as
the case may be, that is in excess of the Deductible, subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Article VII_. Subject to _Section 7.3(c)_,
the maximum aggregate Liability of Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer on the
other hand, to their respective Indemnitees for any and all Indemnifiable
Losses under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_, in the case of Seller, or _Section
7.2(b)(i)_, in the case of Buyer, shall be 20% of the Purchase Price (the "
_Cap_ "); _provided_ , that the maximum

 



      
 

 



 

aggregate Liability of Seller to all Buyer Indemnified Persons for any or all
Indemnifiable Losses under this Agreement shall not exceed the Purchase Price.
The limitations in this _Section 7.3_ shall not apply to claims made in
respect of the Excluded Liabilities or under _Article VIII_ or to
Indemnifiable Losses arising from breaches of _Section 3.10_, and the
Deductible shall not apply with respect to any Indemnifiable Losses resulting
from or arising out of any breach of any representation or warranty set forth
in _Section 3.15_, which shall instead be subject to the terms of _Section
7.9(e)_.

 



 

(b) If any Indemnitee actually recognizes a Tax benefit in respect of an
Indemnifiable Loss as described in the proviso in the definition of
"Indemnifiable Losses" set forth in _Section 7.4(iii)_ subsequent to an
Indemnity Payment made by an Indemnitor to an Indemnitee with respect to such
Indemnifiable Loss, then such Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the Indemnitor
the amount of such Tax benefit recognized by such Indemnitee up to the amount
of such Indemnity Payment received by the Indemnitee, net of any expenses
incurred by such Indemnitee in pursuing such Tax benefit, within 15 days after
the Indemnitee recognizes such Tax benefit in the form of cash actually
received or reduction in cash Taxes actually paid. If any Tax benefit (or
portion thereof) in respect of an Indemnifiable Loss as described in the
proviso in the definition of "Indemnifiable Losses" set forth in _Section
7.4(iii)_, that either (i) reduces the Indemnity Payments made by an
Indemnitor prior to the time such payment is made or (ii) obligates an
Indemnitee to make payments to the Indemnitor under the immediately preceding
sentence of this _Section 7.3(b)_, is disallowed as a result of an audit or
otherwise, the applicable Indemnitor shall promptly pay to the applicable
Indemnitee the amount of such disallowed Tax benefit within 30 days after the
Indemnitee notifies the Indemnitor that the adjustment with respect to such
disallowance has been paid or otherwise taken into account.

 



 

(c) In the case of Indemnifiable Losses resulting from or arising out of
breaches of _Section 3.15_, the Cap shall, with respect to Indemnifiable
Losses subject to indemnification by Seller under this Agreement, be increased
by fifty (50) million dollars, provided that the maximum aggregate Liability
of Seller with respect to Liabilities other than those resulting from or
arising out of any breach of _Section 3.15_ shall still be as described in
_Section 7.3(a)_ (and not increased by this _Section 7.3(c)_).

 



 

SECTION 7.4. _Definitions_. As used in this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Indemnitee_ " means any Person entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement;

 



 

(ii) " _Indemnitor_ " means any Person required to provide indemnification
under this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) " _Indemnifiable Losses_ " means any and all damages, losses,
liabilities, obligations, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses); _provided_ , that any Indemnity Payment (x) shall in no
event include any amounts constituting consequential, incidental, indirect,
special or punitive damages (except to the extent actually paid to a third
party in connection with a Third Party Claim), or any damages for lost
profits, unless: (1) such damages for lost profits do not constitute
consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive damages of any Buyer
Indemnified

 



       
 

 



 

Person; (2) such damages for lost profits are recoverable under the laws of
the State of New York; (3) the Indemnitee satisfies all elements necessary for
proof of such damages for lost profits under such laws; and (4) such lost
profits can be demonstrated by reference to the Actuarial Report and therefore
to be within the reasonable contemplation of the parties (it being understood
that nothing in this _Section 7.4_ is intended to limit the effect of the
statement set forth in the proviso to the last sentence of _Section 3.17_,
and that lost profits damages with respect to the reduction or elimination of
any profits contemplated by the Actuarial Report shall in no event exceed the
present value ascribed to any such remaining profits contemplated by the
Actuarial Report as of the date of the Indemnifiable Loss giving rise to the
related claim, calculated based on the assumptions on which the Actuarial
Report was prepared and discounted using a discount rate of 12%), and (y)
shall be net of any (A) net amounts recovered by the Indemnitee or any of its
Affiliates for the Indemnifiable Losses for which such Indemnity Payment is
made under any insurance policy, reinsurance agreement, warranty or indemnity
or otherwise from any Person other than a party hereto, and the Indemnitee
shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitor for any such net amount that is
received by it or any of its Affiliates from any such other Person with
respect to any Indemnifiable Losses after any indemnification with respect
thereto has actually been paid pursuant to this Agreement, (B) amounts
included in the calculation of the Final Closing Statutory Value and (C) as
determined pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_, Tax benefits actually recognized by
the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates in respect of any Indemnifiable Losses
for which such Indemnity Payment is made (it being understood that no
Indemnity Payment to be made hereunder may be withheld or otherwise delayed
due to the fact that an anticipated Tax benefit has not actually been
recognized by the applicable Indemnitee).

 



 

(iv) " _Indemnity Payment_ " means any amount of Indemnifiable Losses required
to be paid pursuant to this Agreement; and

 



 

(v) " _Third Party Claim_ " means any claim, action, suit, or proceeding made
or brought by any Person that is not a party to this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 7.5. _Procedures for Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) If any Indemnitee receives notice of assertion or commencement of any
Third Party Claim against such Indemnitee in respect of which an Indemnitor
may be obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the
Indemnitee shall give such Indemnitor reasonably prompt written notice (but in
no event later than 30 days after becoming aware) thereof and such notice
shall include a reasonable description of the claim based on the facts known
at the time and any documents relating to the claim and an estimate of the
Indemnifiable Loss and shall reference the specific sections of this Agreement
that form the basis of such claim; _provided_ , that no delay on the part of
the Indemnitee in notifying any Indemnitor shall relieve the Indemnitor from
any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnitor
is actually prejudiced by such delay (except that the Indemnitor shall not be
liable for any expenses incurred during the period in which the Indemnitee
failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the Indemnitee shall deliver to the
Indemnitor, within five calendar days after the Indemnitees receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnitee relating to the Third Party Claim.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel selected by the Indemnitor. Should the Indemnitor so elect to assume
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall not as long as it
conducts such defense be liable to the Indemnitee for legal expenses incurred
by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof subsequent to the
Indemnitor notifying the Indemnitee in writing of its election to assume such
defense. If the Indemnitor assumes such defense, the Indemnitee shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnitor, it being
understood that the Indemnitor shall control such defense. The Indemnitor
shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by
the Indemnitee for any period during which the Indemnitor has not assumed the
defense thereof (other than during any period in which the Indemnitee shall
have not yet given notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above). If the
Indemnitor chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, all of the parties hereto
shall cooperate in the defense thereof. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the Indemnitors request) the provision to the Indemnitor
of records and information that are relevant to such Third Party Claim, and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Whether or not the Indemnitor shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnitee shall not admit any Liability with respect to, or pay,
settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
Indemnitors prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the Indemnitor has assumed the defense
of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor may only pay, settle, compromise or
discharge a Third Party Claim with the Indemnitees prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ , that the Indemnitor may pay, settle, compromise or discharge such
a Third Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnitee if such
settlement (i) includes a release of the Indemnitee from all Liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim, (ii) does not subject the Indemnitee to any
injunctive relief or other equitable remedy and (iii) does not include a
statement or admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf
of the Indemnitee. If the Indemnitor submits to the Indemnitee a bona fide
settlement offer with respect to a Third Party Claim that has been accepted by
all Persons bringing such Third Party Claim and otherwise satisfies the
requirements set forth in the proviso of the immediately preceding sentence
and the Indemnitee refuses to consent to such settlement, then thereafter the
Indemnitors liability to the Indemnitee with respect to such Third Party
Claim shall not exceed the Indemnitors portion of the settlement amount
included in such settlement offer.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall
have the right to represent the interests of the Company and settle all
issues, and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense, in any audit or
other examination or administrative or court proceeding relating to Taxes for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period; _provided_ , that Seller
shall not pay, discharge, settle, compromise, litigate, or otherwise dispose
of any item subject to such Tax proceedings with respect to a Straddle Period
or, in the case of any such Tax proceedings relating to the treatment of the
Recapture or the calculation of any attribute reduction of the Company arising
out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on the Closing Date, without obtaining the prior
written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to Sellers
rights set forth in the preceding

 



      
 

 



 

sentence, Buyer shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in the
conduct of any Tax audit and any judicial or administrative proceeding
relating to any such Tax audit and to be kept reasonably informed of the
conduct and progress thereof.

 



 

SECTION 7.6. _Direct Claims_. The Indemnitor will have a period of 30 days
within which to respond in writing to any claim by an Indemnitee on account of
an Indemnifiable Loss that does not result from a Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnitor does not so respond within such 30 day period, the Indemnitor will
be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which event the Indemnitee will be
entitled to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnitee.

 



 

SECTION 7.7. _Sole Remedy_.

 



 

(a) Except for (i) the right of Seller to an injunction, specific performance
or other equitable relief pursuant to _Section 10.10_ and (ii) the right of
Seller to receive the Termination Fee pursuant to _Article X_, prior to the
Closing, the Escrow Account shall be the sole and exclusive source of recovery
and remedy of Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to any breach by
Buyer, Parent or any of their Affiliates of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or the Equity Commitment
Letter and, as such, the obligations of Buyer, Parent and their Affiliates
hereunder and thereunder are non-recourse to any other Buyer Related Party
that is not a party hereto or thereto in all respects.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, except as set forth in
_Section 10.10_ and except for any claims relating to or affecting the Final
Balance Sheet or the Final Closing Statutory Value (including claims relating
to or arising out of _Section 3.6)_, which shall be resolved and determined
in accordance with _Section 2.5_, if the Closing occurs, their sole and
exclusive remedy following the Closing with respect to any and all claims
arising out of or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be pursuant to the provisions set forth in this _Article VII_ or
_Article VIII_, as applicable.

 



 

SECTION 7.8. _Certain Other Matters_.

 



 

(a) Upon making any Indemnity Payment, Indemnitor will, to the extent of such
Indemnity Payment, be subrogated to all rights of Indemnitee against any third
Person (other than any Tax authority) in respect of the Indemnifiable Loss to
which the Indemnity Payment related. Without limiting the generality or effect
of any other provision hereof, each such Indemnitee and Indemnitor will duly
execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and
perfect the above-described subrogation rights.

 



 

(b) The rights and remedies of any party in respect of any inaccuracy or
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall in no way
be limited by the fact that the act, omission, occurrence or other state of
facts or circumstances upon which any claim of any such inaccuracy or breach
is based may also be the subject matter of any other representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement as to which there is no inaccuracy or breach. The
representations, warranties and covenants of Seller, and the Buyer Indemnified
Persons rights to indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected
or deemed waived by reason of (and the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall be
deemed to have relied upon the representations and warranties of Seller set
forth herein notwithstanding) (i) any investigation made by or on

 



      
 

 



 

behalf of any of the Buyer Indemnified Persons (including by any of its
advisers, consultants or representatives) or by reason of the fact that any of
the Buyer Indemnified Persons or any of such advisers, consultants or
representatives knew or should have known that any such representation or
warranty is, was or might be inaccurate, regardless of whether such
investigation was made or such knowledge was obtained before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or (ii) Buyers waiver of any
condition set forth in _Article VI_. The representations, warranties and
covenants of Buyer, and the Seller Indemnified Persons rights to
indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived
by reason of (and the Seller Indemnified Persons shall be deemed to have
relied upon the representations and warranties of Buyer set forth herein
notwithstanding) (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any of the
Seller Indemnified Persons (including by any of its advisers, consultants or
representatives) or by reason of the fact that any of the Seller Indemnified
Persons or any of such advisers, consultants or representatives knew or should
have known that any such representation or warranty is, was or might be
inaccurate, regardless of whether such investigation was made or such
knowledge was obtained before or after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or (ii) Sellers waiver of any condition set forth in _Article VI_.

 



 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not be required to indemnify any
Buyer Indemnified Person for any Liability to the extent it was reserved for
on the Final Balance Sheet or to the extent it was included in the calculation
of the Final Closing Statutory Value.

 



 

SECTION 7.9. _Product Tax Claims_.

 



 

(a) The Buyer Indemnified Persons may, within the applicable time period
specified in _Section 7.1(a)_ but subject to _Section 7.9(b)(ii)_, bring a
claim pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ that relates to a breach of a
representation or warranty under _Section 3.15_ even if no related Third
Party Claim has first been asserted or made against Buyer or the Company with
respect thereto (a " _Direct Product Tax Claim_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any Direct Product Tax Claim must be based on the good faith
determination by Buyer that a breach of a representation or warranty under
_Section 3.15_ has occurred. If any Buyer Indemnified Person brings a Direct
Product Tax Claim, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to determine
whether any breach of a representation or warranty under _Section 3.15_ has
occurred and, if necessary, to develop corrective measures that are
appropriate, reasonable, cost-efficient and effective, taking into account all
of the relevant facts and circumstances then applicable.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect
to any breach of _Section 3.15_:

 



 

(i) Seller shall have no liability except to the extent that the relevant
representation or warranty was breached based on the facts that existed and
the Applicable Law (and interpretations thereof) as in effect as of or before
the Closing Date;

 



 

(ii) Subject to _Section 7.9(c)_, Seller shall only be required to indemnify
the Buyer Indemnified Persons for Indemnifiable Losses with respect to Direct
Product Tax Claims to the extent that such Indemnifiable Losses arise out of a
circumstance identified in a written notice (describing in reasonable detail
the circumstances giving rise to the claim of a breach of the representations
and warranties

 



      
 

 



 

made in _Section 3.15_) delivered to Seller on or prior to the later of
December 31, 2015 and (a) with respect to any annuity contracts that are part
of the Company Business, the date that is one year after the substantial
completion of the conversion of the administration of the annuity contracts to
se2 as contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement or (b) with respect
to life contracts that are part of the Company Business, the date that is one
year after the substantial completion of the migration of the life contracts
as provided in the Transition Services Agreement; and

 



 

(iii) Seller shall have no liability with respect to any insurance or annuity
policy or contract issued after the Closing Date other than any insurance or
annuity policy or contract that is part of the Company Business, an
application for which has been submitted prior to the Closing Date and that is
issued by the Company on the terms set forth in such application on or within
30 days after the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) If, with respect to a Direct Product Tax Claim, Seller and Buyer cannot
agree as to whether a breach of a representation or warranty under _Section
3.15_ has occurred, then (i) if Seller promptly (and in any event within 30
Business Days) after receiving a written notice with respect to such Direct
Product Tax Claim delivers or causes to be delivered to Buyer an opinion
addressed to Buyer and issued by a reputable nationally recognized law firm,
accounting firm or actuarial firm that is familiar with analyzing matters of
the type covered by the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
3.15_ to the effect that it is more likely than not that no such breach has
occurred with respect to the Direct Product Tax Claim then in dispute, then
Seller shall not be required to indemnify Buyer with respect to such disputed
Direct Product Tax Claim unless and until either a Third Party Claim with
respect thereto subsequently arises, such opinion is subsequently withdrawn or
qualified, the parties otherwise agree that such opinion is no longer
controlling or such opinion is not subsequently reaffirmed or re-issued
promptly upon the reasonable request of Buyer (other than as a result of a
change in Applicable Law) in which case (A) Seller shall, as provided in
_Section 7.2(a)(i)_ but subject to _Section 7.9(e)_, the Cap and the other
limitations set forth in this Agreement (other than as specified below),
indemnify Buyer for any Indemnifiable Loss attributable to a breach of a
representation or warranty under _Section 3.15_ (including any penalties or
fees imposed by the IRS) resulting from or arising out of the matters set
forth in such disputed Direct Product Tax Claim, regardless of whether the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.15_ shall have
otherwise expired pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_, _Section 7.9(b)(ii)_ or any
other provision of this Agreement and (ii) if Seller does not deliver or cause
to be delivered to Buyer any such opinion within such 30-Business Day period,
then such breach of a representation or warranty set forth in _Section 3.15_
that is alleged by Buyer shall be deemed conclusively to have been established
with respect to such Direct Product Tax Claim. If Seller and Buyer cannot
agree with respect to the appropriate, reasonable, cost efficient and
effective corrective measures, the disagreement shall be resolved by a
recognized law firm, accounting firm or actuarial firm selected by mutual
agreement of Buyer and Seller, and any such determination by such law firm,
accounting firm or actuarial firm shall be final. The parties shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause such law firm, accounting firm or actuarial
firm to render a determination within 60 days of the referral of such matter
for resolution. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm, law firm or
actuarial firm shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) In the event that the corrective measures described in this _Section 7.9_
include making any request to the IRS for relief with respect to such failure,
Buyer and Seller shall jointly participate in all discussions or other
proceedings with the IRS, including attendance at meetings and joint approval
of all written submissions. Buyer shall control the decision of whether or not
to enter into a closing agreement or other arrangement with the IRS in
connection with such discussions or other proceedings; _provided_ that if the
closing agreement or other arrangement involves any admission that would
reasonably be expected to form the basis of a claim against Seller under this
Agreement, then Buyer may not enter into any such closing agreement or other
arrangement without the consent of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer shall control the implementation of
the corrective measures described in this _Section 7.9_.

 



 

(e) Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Person
under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ with respect to any claim for Indemnifiable Losses
resulting from or arising out of any breach of any representation or warranty
set forth in _Section 3.15_ unless and until the aggregate amount of all such
Indemnifiable Losses exceeds $7,500,000, at which point Seller shall be liable
for all Indemnifiable Losses that are in excess of such amount, subject to the
Cap and the other applicable limitations set forth in _Section 7.3_.

SECTION 8.1. _Indemnification for Taxes_.

 



 

(a) Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Persons
from any and all Indemnifiable Losses to the extent arising out of the
following:

 



 

(i) Taxes with respect to the Company for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, except
to the extent of any accrued liability for Taxes taken into account in the
calculation of the Final Adjustment Amount; and

 



 

(ii) liability for Taxes of any Person other than the Company pursuant to any
provision of joint and several liability under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 and any corresponding provision of state, local, or foreign law.

from and against any and all liabilities for Taxes that are not subject to
indemnification by Seller pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_.

allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period
in the following manner:

 



 

(i) in the case of Taxes based on or measured by income, gain, or receipts, or
related to the actual or deemed sale or transfer of property, or which are
withholding Taxes, such Taxes shall be allocated based on an interim closing
of the books as of the Closing Date; and

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) in the case of Taxes calculated on a periodic basis, the portion of such
Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount
of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Straddle Period.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Seller
Indemnified Persons shall not be liable for (and Buyer shall indemnify the
Seller Indemnified Persons against) any Taxes resulting from any transaction
or event that is outside the ordinary course of business and occurs after the
Closing but on the Closing Date, unless such transaction or event is initiated
by Seller or the Company before the Closing.

 



 

SECTION 8.2. _Filing of Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) (i) Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all Consolidated Returns that include the Company, regardless of
when such Tax Returns are required to be filed.

 



 

(ii) Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns for the Company for taxable periods that end on or
before the Closing Date and that are required to be filed prior to the Closing
Date (taking into account any extensions) other than Tax Returns described in
_Section 8.2(a)(i)_.

 



 

(iii) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company to provide
Seller and its Affiliates in a timely fashion in accordance with past practice
all filing information relating to the Company necessary for the preparation
and filing of the Consolidated Returns.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, Tax Returns for the Company for taxable periods that end on or before
the Closing Date that are not described in _Section 8.2(a)_ and for any
Straddle Period. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with the positions taken, and with accounting methods used, on the Tax Returns
filed by or with respect to the Company prior to the date on which the Closing
occurs, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law or agreed by Seller and
Buyer. Buyer shall deliver any such Tax Return to Seller for Sellers review
at least 30 days (or, in the case of premium tax returns, 10 days) prior to
the date such Tax Return is required to be filed and shall accept all
reasonable comments of Seller consistent with Applicable Law in respect of
such Tax Returns. To the extent consistent with Applicable Law, Buyer shall,
or shall cause the Company to, file all Tax Returns for any Straddle Period on
the basis that the relevant Tax period ended as of the Closing Date, unless
the relevant Tax authority will not accept a Tax Return filed on that basis.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause the Company to prepare and
timely file, all Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the
Company for any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Except to the extent otherwise required by Applicable Law, Buyer shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, without the prior written
consent of Seller, which

 



      
 

 



 

consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, amend any
Tax Returns of the Company relating in whole or in part to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period.

 



 

SECTION 8.3. _Tax Refunds_. Any Tax refund, credit, or similar benefit
(including any interest paid or credited with respect thereto) (a " _Tax
Refund_ ") relating to the Company for Taxes paid for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be the property of Seller except to the extent such Tax Refund
was taken into account in calculating the Final Adjustment Amount. If received
by Buyer or the Company, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay such
Tax Refund promptly to Seller, net of any Tax cost to Buyer or any of its
Affiliates attributable to the receipt of such refund. In the event that any
such Tax Refund is subsequently contested by any Tax authority, such contest
shall be handled in accordance with the procedures in _Section 7.5_. Any
additional Taxes resulting from the contest shall be indemnified in accordance
with _Section 8.1_.

 



 

SECTION 8.4. _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. Seller and Buyer shall
provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of them or
their respective Affiliates may reasonably request of the other in filing any
Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for Tax Refund, determining a
liability for Taxes or a right to a Tax Refund, or participating in or
conducting any contest in respect of Taxes (a " _Tax Contest_ "). Such
cooperation and information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax
Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related
work papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by Tax
authorities. Each party and its Affiliates shall make its employees available
on a basis mutually convenient to both parties to provide explanations of any
documents or information provided hereunder. Each of Seller and Buyer shall
retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents
in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Company for each Tax period
first ending after the Closing Date and for all prior Tax periods until the
later of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the Tax period to
which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to
extensions except to the extent notified in writing of such extensions for the
respective Tax periods, or (ii) three years following the due date (without
extension) for such Tax Returns. Any information obtained under this _Section
8.4_ shall be kept confidential except as otherwise may be necessary in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for Tax Refunds or in
conducting a contest or as otherwise may be required by Applicable Law or the
rules of any stock exchange.

 



 

SECTION 8.5. _Conveyance Taxes_. Buyer or Seller, as appropriate, shall
execute and deliver all instruments and certificates necessary to enable the
other to comply with any filing requirements relating to any sales, use,
transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer,
recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes (" _Conveyance
Taxes_ ") which become payable in connection with the purchase of Shares by
Buyer or the consummation of any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and shall file such applications and documents as shall permit
any Conveyance Taxes to be assessed and paid. Any Conveyance Taxes incurred in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller.

 



 

SECTION 8.6. _Pre-Closing Tax Payment_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, prior to the Closing, the Company shall make a
payment to Seller to

 



      
 

 



 

fund its full share of the Tax liability of the Seller Group for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period, including the Companys income related to the Recapture.

 



 

SECTION 8.7. _Miscellaneous_.

 



 

(a) Seller and Buyer agree to treat all payments (other than interest on a
payment) made by either of them to or for the benefit of the other or the
others Affiliates or the Company under this _Article VIII_ and under other
indemnity provisions of this Agreement as adjustments to the Purchase Price
for Tax purposes and that such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof to
the extent permissible under Applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations of Seller to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified
Persons, as well as the obligations of Buyer to indemnify and hold harmless
the Seller Indemnified Persons, pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall
terminate on the later of three months after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (taking into account any applicable extensions or
tollings thereof) with respect to the Tax liabilities in question or 60 days
after the final administrative or judicial determination of such Tax
liabilities, except for any indemnity obligations as to which a claim has been
made before the expiration of the applicable period.

 



 

(c) In the event of any Tax Contest, the conduct of the parties shall be
governed by the provisions of _Section 7.5_.

 



 

(d) In the event of any inconsistency between _Article VII_ and _Article
VIII_ with respect to indemnification under this Agreement for or with respect
to any Taxes of the Company, _Article VIII_ shall control.

 



 

(e) Should it be necessary, equitable adjustments will be made to prevent
duplicate recovery for indemnification with respect to the same item.

 



 

(f) Buyer shall not withhold any amounts pursuant to any Tax law; _provided_ ,
that Seller has delivered or caused to be delivered on or prior to the Closing
Date to Buyer a certificate, in compliance with Treasury Regulations Section
1.1445-2(b)(2), certifying that the transactions contemplated hereby are
exempt from withholding under Section 1445 of the Code.

 



 

(g) Seller will cause all Tax sharing, allocation, indemnity and similar
agreements or arrangements between the Company, on the one hand, and Seller or
any Affiliates of Seller, on the other hand, to be terminated effective prior
to or as of the Closing Date, and after the Closing Date the Company shall
have no obligation or rights under any such agreement or arrangement for any
past, present or future period.

 



 

(h) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates shall be obligated to make any election under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-36 in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE IX. 
TERMINATION PRIOR TO CLOSING

 



 

SECTION 9.1. _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing:

 



 

(a) by Seller or Buyer in writing, if there shall be any order, injunction or
decree of any Governmental Entity that prohibits or restrains any party from
consummating the transactions contemplated hereby, and such order, injunction
or decree shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , that the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(a)_
shall have performed in all material respects its obligations under this
Agreement, acted in good faith and, if binding on such party, used reasonable
best efforts to prevent the entry of, and to remove, such order, injunction or
decree in accordance with its obligations under this Agreement;

 



 

(b) by Seller or Buyer in writing, if the Closing has not occurred on or prior
to May 1, 2014 (as it may be extended, the " _Outside Date_ "), unless the
failure of the Closing to occur is the result of a material breach of this
Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement; _provided_ , that
(i) if on the Outside Date either of the conditions set forth in _Section
6.1(a)_ or _Section 6.1(b)_ has not been satisfied then, upon the written
notice of Seller to Buyer, the Outside Date shall be extended to a date and
time that is not later than 5:00 pm, New York City time, on August 1, 2014 and
(ii) the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)_
will not be available (A) to any party if the other party has, in good faith,
filed an action seeking, and is then pursuing, specific performance as
permitted by _Section 10.10_ or (B) Buyer until the first Business Day after
the end of the cure period contemplated by _Section 9.1(d)_, if any such cure
period is applicable.

 



 

(c) by either Seller or Buyer (but only so long as Seller or Buyer, as
applicable, is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement)
in writing, if a breach of any provision of this Agreement that has been
committed by the other party would cause the failure of any mutual condition
to Closing or any condition to Closing for the benefit of the non-breaching
party and such breach is not capable of being cured or is not cured within 20
calendar days after the breaching party receives written notice from the non-
breaching party that the non-breaching party intends to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)_;

 



 

(d) by Seller if (i) all of the conditions to Buyers obligations under this
Agreement set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_ have been satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing; _provided_ , that such conditions must be capable of being satisfied
assuming, for this purpose, that the Closing Date were the date that valid
notice of termination of this Agreement is delivered by Seller to Buyer
pursuant to this _Section 9.1(d)_), (ii) Seller has confirmed in writing to
Buyer that all of the conditions to Sellers obligations under this Agreement
set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.3_ (other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or
will be waived and that Seller is ready and willing to proceed with the
Closing and (iii) Buyer fails to comply with its obligations under _Article
II_ to consummate the Closing by the time specified in _Section 2.2_,
_provided_ that in the event the sole reason Buyer has failed to consummate
the Closing is the result of a failure of the Financing Sources under the Debt
Commitment Letter to

 



       
 

 



 

provide the Debt Financing, Buyer shall have 30 days to cure such failure and
Seller shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement until the end of such
cure period.

 



 

(e) by Seller, if (i) any Governmental Entity imposes any condition in
connection with its grant of any permit, order, consent, approval or
authorization required in connection with the Recapture that requires Seller
or any of its Affiliates to incur any Liability or take any action other than
(A) enter into a keepwell for the benefit of the Company or (B) make a capital
contribution to the Company with a simultaneous commitment from such
Governmental Entity that it will permit the Company to repay such capital
contribution through a cash dividend to Seller or such Affiliate prior to the
Closing or (ii) Seller is required to make a payment under any keepwell
entered into pursuant to clause (i) above; or

 



 

(f) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer.

 



 

SECTION 9.2. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to _Section 9.1_, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no further
force and effect without Liability of either party (or any Representative of
such party) to the other party to this Agreement; _provided_ , that no such
termination shall relieve a party from Liability for any fraud or intentional
breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, _Section 1.1_,
_Section 5.5_, this _Section 9.2_ and _Article X_ shall survive termination
hereof pursuant to _Section 9.1_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 9.1_, all confidential information received by Buyer with respect to
the Company or the Company Business (including any confidential information
relating to the Variable Annuity Transaction) shall be treated in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and
effect notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE X. 
GENERAL PROVISIONS

 



 

SECTION 10.1. _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Except as provided below in this _Section 10.1_, whether or not the
purchase and sale of the Shares is consummated, each party hereto shall,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, pay its own Transaction
Expenses incident to preparing for, entering into and carrying out the
Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby.

 



 

(b) In the event Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.1(c)_ or pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_ (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, as a result of the unavailability of the Financing, whether or not such
unavailability was caused by Buyer or any of its Affiliates) (any such
termination, a " _Specified Termination_ "), then Buyer shall pay, or Buyer
and Seller shall execute a joint written instruction pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement to cause the Escrow Agent to pay out of the Escrow Funds on behalf
of Buyer, to Seller a non-refundable fee in the amount of $60,000,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ "), by wire transfer of same-day funds to an account
designated by Seller, no later than two Business Days after such termination.

 



 

(c) If Buyer fails to promptly pay the Termination Fee when due, Seller takes
any action to collect the Termination Fee and the Termination Fee is
subsequently paid, Buyer

 



      
 

 



 

shall promptly reimburse Seller for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket fees and expenses incurred by Seller in connection with any such
actions taken by Seller to collect the Termination Fee (including reasonable
and documented fees and expenses of all attorneys, consultants and other
experts retained by Seller).

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
the Termination Fee is paid in accordance with _Section 10.1(b)_, payment
thereof shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller against Buyer,
Parent, the Financing Sources and any of their respective Affiliates, with
respect to (i) any loss or damage suffered, directly or indirectly, as a
result of the failure of any of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements to be consummated, (ii) the termination of this
Agreement, (iii) any liabilities or obligations arising under this Agreement
or (iv) any claims or actions arising out of or relating to any breach,
termination or failure of or under this Agreement. Buyer and Seller
acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this _Section 10.1_
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements, and that, without these agreements, neither Buyer nor Seller would
enter into this Agreement, and that the Termination Fee is not a penalty but
rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Seller in circumstances in which the Termination Fee is paid for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating and
seeking to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Seller
effects a Specified Termination (which Specified Termination may be effected
by Seller in its sole discretion in the circumstances contemplated by _Section
9.1_), then Sellers and its Affiliates sole and exclusive remedy (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against Buyer, Parent and
any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers,
employees, agents, general or limited partners, managers, members,
stockholders, Affiliates or assignees or any former, current or future
director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager,
member, stockholder, Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Buyer Related Parties_ ") for any breach, loss or
Liability, shall be to receive payment of the Termination Fee and the fees and
expenses referred to in _Section 10.1(c)_ and none of the Buyer Related
Parties will have any additional Liability, commitment or obligation to Seller
or any of its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Equity Commitment Letter, through Buyer, whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Buyer
against the Parent or any other Buyer Related Party, by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute,
regulation or other Applicable Law, or otherwise. The foregoing shall not be
construed as or deemed to be a waiver or election of remedies by either party,
each of whom, subject to _Section 7.7(a)_ and _Section 10.1(d)_, expressly
reserves any and all rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity
in the event of any breach by the other party under this Agreement prior to
the Closing.

SECTION 10.3. _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to

Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. All
references herein to any agreement, instrument, statute, rule or regulation
are to the agreement, instrument, statute, rule or regulation as amended,
modified, supplemented or replaced from time to time (and, in the case of
statutes, includes any rules and regulations promulgated under said statutes)
and to any section of any statute, rule or regulation including any successor
to said section. Disclosure of any item in the Buyer Disclosure Schedule or
Seller disclosure schedule, as the case may be, shall be deemed disclosed in
all other sections of such disclosure schedule to the extent the applicability
of such fact or item to such other section of such disclosure schedule is
reasonably apparent. Disclosure of any item in the Buyer Disclosure Schedule
or Seller Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, shall not be deemed an
admission that such item represents a material item, fact, exception of fact,
event or circumstance or that occurrence or non-occurrence of any change or
effect related to such item would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Whenever the singular is used herein, the same shall include the
plural, and whenever the plural is used herein, the same shall include the
singular, where appropriate. Whenever the word "Dollars" or the "$" sign
appear in this Agreement, they shall be construed to mean United States
Dollars, and all transactions under this Agreement shall be in United States
Dollars. This Agreement has been fully negotiated by the parties hereto and
shall not be construed by any Governmental Entity against either party by
virtue of the fact that such party was the drafting party.

 



 

SECTION 10.4. _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including all exhibits and schedules hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement
and the other Transaction Agreements constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all prior agreements, understandings, representations and
warranties, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. Except as set forth in (i) _Section 5.11_
with respect to Affiliates of Seller and (ii) _Articles VII_ and _VIII_ with
respect to the Buyer Indemnified Persons and the Seller Indemnified Persons,
this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies.

 



 

SECTION 10.5. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any dispute arising
hereunder shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of New York, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern
under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

 



 

SECTION 10.6. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise (other than following the Closing by
operation of law in a merger), by either party without the prior written
consent of the other party, and any such assignment that is not

 



      
 

 



 

consented to shall be null and void; _provided_ , that Buyer may, without the
prior written consent of Seller, assign its right to acquire the Shares, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, to a wholly owned
subsidiary of Buyer, _provided further_ , that no such assignment shall limit,
or relieve Buyer of, any of Buyers duties or obligations under any
Transaction Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

SECTION 10.7. _Jurisdiction; Enforcement_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court of the United States or any state
court, which in either case is located in the City of New York (each, a " _New
York Court_ ") for purposes of enforcing this Agreement or determining any
claim arising from or related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In any such action, suit or other proceeding, each of the parties
hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to assert by way
of motion, as a defense or otherwise any claim that it is not subject to the
jurisdiction of any such New York Court, that such action, suit or other
proceeding is not subject to the jurisdiction of any such New York Court, that
such action, suit or other proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or
that the venue of such action, suit or other proceeding is improper;
_provided_ , that nothing set forth in this sentence shall prohibit any of the
parties hereto from removing any matter from one New York Court to another New
York Court. Each of the parties hereto also agrees that any final and
unappealable judgment against a party hereto in connection with any action,
suit or other proceeding will be conclusive and binding on such party and that
such award or judgment may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction,
either within or outside of the United States. A certified or exemplified copy
of such award or judgment will be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount
of such award or judgment. Any process or other paper to be served in
connection with any action or proceeding under this Agreement shall, if
delivered or sent in accordance with _Section 10.2_, constitute good, proper
and sufficient service thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the determination of the Final Adjustment
Amount or any other amount to be calculated or derived from the Final Balance
Sheet, or any dispute relating to the Final Balance Sheet, the Reference
Balance Sheet or any amounts required to be calculated therefrom, shall be
governed by the terms of _Section 2.5_.

 



 

(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OR ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
10.7_.

 



 

(c) Parent hereby designates, appoints and empowers Buyer with offices at the
address set forth in _Section 10.2(a)_ as its authorized agent (Buyer in such
capacity, the

 



      
 

 



 

" _Process Agent_ ") to receive for it and on its behalf service of summons or
other legal process in any action, suit or proceeding relating to this
Agreement in the State of New York. Such service may be made by mailing or
delivering a copy of such process to the Process Agent at the Process Agents
above address, and Parent hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the
Process Agent to accept such service on its behalf. Parent covenants and
agrees that, for so long as this Agreement continues in effect, it shall
maintain a duly appointed agent for the service of summons and other legal
process in New York, New York, United States of America, for the purposes of
any legal action, suit or proceeding brought by any party in respect of this
Agreement and shall keep Seller advised of the identity and location of such
agent. If for any reason Parent does not at any time have an authorized agent
for service of process in New York, such entity irrevocably consents to the
service of process out of any New York Court by mailing copies thereof by
registered United States air mail to it at its address specified in _Section
10.2(a)_. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of Seller to
commence legal proceedings or otherwise sue Parent in the country in which it
is domiciled or in any other court having jurisdiction over such entity in
order to enforce the judgment of any New York Court or to serve process upon
such entity in any manner authorized by the laws of any such jurisdiction.

 



 

SECTION 10.8. _Severability; Amendment; Modification; Waiver_.

 



 

(a) Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under Applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under
any Applicable Law in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability will not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed
and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision or portion of any provision had never been contained herein.

 



 

(b) This Agreement may be amended or a provision hereof waived only by a
written instrument signed by each of Buyer and Seller.

 



 

(c) No delay on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on
the part of any party of any right, power or privilege, nor any single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.

 



 

SECTION 10.9. _Certain Limitations_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the other
Transaction Agreements, the Seller Disclosure Schedule or any of the Schedules
or Exhibits hereto or thereto, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including the Company), nor any
Representative of any of them, makes or has made, and Buyer has not relied on,
any inducement or promise to Buyer except as specifically made in this
Agreement or any representation or warranty to Buyer, oral or written, express
or implied, other than as expressly set forth in _Article III_ and that the
Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, other than as
expressly set forth in _Article III_, no Person has made any

 



      
 

 



 

representation or warranty to Buyer with respect to the Company, the Shares or
any other matter, including with respect to (i) merchantability, suitability
or fitness for any particular purpose, (ii) the operation of the Company by
Buyer after the Closing, (iii) the probable success or profitability of the
Company after the Closing or (iv) any information, documents or material made
available to Buyer, its Affiliates or their respective Representatives in any
"data rooms," information memoranda, management presentations, functional
"break-out" discussions or in any other form or forum in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any estimation,
valuation, appraisal, projection or forecast with respect to the Company.

 



 

(b) Buyer further acknowledges and agrees that it (i) has made its own inquiry
and investigation into and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment
concerning the Company and the Company Business, (ii) has been provided
adequate access to such information as it has deemed necessary to enable it to
form such independent judgment, (iii) has had such time as it deems necessary
and appropriate fully and completely to review and analyze such information,
documents and other materials and (iv) has been provided an opportunity to ask
questions of Seller with respect to such information, documents and other
materials and has received answers to such questions that it considers
satisfactory.

 



 

(c) Seller makes no express or implied representation or warranty under this
Agreement as to the future experience, success or profitability of the Company
Business, whether or not conducted or administered in a manner similar to the
manner in which the Company Business was conducted prior to the Closing or
that the Insurance Reserves held by or on behalf of the Company or otherwise
with respect to the Company Business or the assets supporting such Insurance
Reserves have been or will be adequate or sufficient for the purposes for
which they were established.

 



 

SECTION 10.10. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, including any partys failure to take all actions as are
necessary on such partys part in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. It is
accordingly agreed that, without the necessity of posting bond or any other
undertaking, the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including that Seller shall be
entitled to cause Buyer and its Affiliates to enforce their rights under the
Commitment Letters or any definitive documents relating to the Financing, or
to seek Alternative Financing as contemplated by _Section 5.23_ in the event
that the Debt Financing or the NER Financing cannot be obtained), this being
in addition (subject to the terms of this Agreement) to any other remedy to
which such party is entitled at law or in equity (except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement). In the event that any Action is brought in equity to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party hereto shall allege, and
each party hereto hereby waives any defense or counterclaim, that there is an
adequate remedy at law. The foregoing shall not be construed as or deemed to
be a waiver or election of remedies by either party, each of whom, subject to
_Section 7.7(a)_ and _Section 10.1(d)_, expressly reserves any and all
rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity in the event of any
breach by the other party under this Agreement prior to the Closing. If a
court of competent jurisdiction (as contemplated by _Section_ 

 



      
 

 



 

 _10.7_ ) (i) declines to grant an injunction or other form of specific
performance or equitable relief to require Buyer to cause the Financing to be
funded and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (including by
granting monetary damages in lieu of such injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief) or (ii) grants Seller such injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief but the Financing nonetheless fails to
be funded such that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement cannot be
consummated, Seller shall continue to be entitled to effect a Specified
Termination and receive the Termination Fee pursuant to the terms of _Article
IX_ and _Section 10.1_. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Seller
be permitted to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in
the occurrence of the Closing and the payment of the Termination Fee.

 



 

SECTION 10.11. _No Offset_. No party to this Agreement may offset any amount
due to the other party hereto or any of such other partys Affiliates against
any amount owed or alleged to be owed from such other party or its Affiliates
under this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement without the written
consent of such other party.

 



 

SECTION 10.12. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties. Each party may deliver its signed counterpart
of this Agreement to the other parties by means of electronic mail or any
other electronic medium utilizing image scan technology, and such delivery
will have the same legal effect as hand delivery of an originally executed
counterpart.

 



 

 **[** Remainder of page intentionally left blank **]**

 



      
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Seller and Buyer have caused this Agreement to be signed
by their respective duly authorized officers, all as of the date first written
above.

_Schedule A_ , other than the Retained Services (the " _Administrative
Services_ "). At all times during the term of this Agreement, the
Administrator shall hold, possess and maintain, either directly or through the
appointment of Subcontractors permitted pursuant to _Section 3.3_, any and
all licenses, franchises, permits, privileges, immunities, approvals and
authorizations from any Governmental Entity that are necessary to perform the
Administrative Services.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Violations of Applicable Law and Applicable Contracts_.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company shall have the right to direct the Administrator to perform any action
necessary for the Administered Business or the administration thereof to
comply with Applicable Law or the terms of the LBL Contracts, Ceded
Reinsurance Contracts or Vermont Captive Contracts, or to cease performing any
action that constitutes a violation of Applicable Law or the terms of the LBL
Contracts, Ceded Reinsurance Contracts or Vermont Captive Contracts, to the
extent such action, inaction or administration is within the control of the
Administrator, taking into account the recommendations of the Administrator
provided to the Company hereunder, which the Company shall only reject in good
faith and in light of the intent of the parties to and the stated purposes of
the Stock Purchase Agreement, this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements. The Administrator shall have the right to direct the Company to
perform any action necessary for the Administered Business or the
administration thereof to comply with Applicable Law or the terms of the LBL

 



      
 

 



 

Contracts, Ceded Reinsurance Contracts or Vermont Captive Contracts, or to
cease performing any action that constitutes a violation of Applicable Law or
the terms of the LBL Contracts, Ceded Reinsurance Contracts or Vermont Captive
Contracts, in either case to the extent such action, inaction or
administration constitutes a Retained Service.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Retained Services_. The Parties hereby agree that,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall, for the
term of this Agreement, continue to provide on its own behalf (i) those
administrative services described in _Schedule B_ , (ii) those administrative
services that the Company is required by Applicable Law to perform without the
Administrator or a third party acting on its behalf and (iii) the preparation
of accounting reports, tax returns, guaranty fund reports, and other reports
and certifications contemplated in _Articles XI_ and _XII_ , in each instance
based on information with respect to the LBL Contracts and Vermont Captive
Contracts provided by the Administrator as contemplated therein (collectively,
the " _Retained Services_ "), in each case, (i) in accordance with the
applicable terms of this Agreement, (ii) in compliance with Applicable Law,
(iii) in a professional, competent and workmanlike manner, with the skill,
diligence and expertise that would reasonably be expected from experienced and
qualified personnel performing such duties in like circumstances, and (iv) at
a level no lower than the service standards applied by the Company to other
comparable insurance business administered by the Company for its own account.
The Administrator shall have no obligation to provide such Retained Services
but shall provide assistance with respect to the Administered Business
reasonably requested by the Company in connection therewith in a timely manner
to enable the Company to perform such Retained Services. The Company shall not
be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement as a result of any failure to
perform, or inadequacy in the performance of, Retained Services hereunder to
the extent the performance of such Retained Services is reasonably dependent
upon Administrative Services or the performance by the Administrator or its
Affiliates of their obligations under the Transaction Agreements that have not
been performed. The Administrator shall promptly reimburse the Company for any
documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by it in
the performance of the Retained Services to the extent (a) such Retained
Services (1) relate solely to the Administered Business, (2) do not constitute
entity-level services required to be performed by or on behalf of the Company
and (3) are not in the ordinary course of business of the Company, and (b)
such out-of-pocket costs and expenses in aggregate exceed $15,000 in the
calendar month for which such costs and expenses are being sought for
reimbursement or $120,000 in the calendar year for which such costs and
expenses are being sought for reimbursement.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Power of Attorney_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein,
the Company hereby appoints and names the Administrator, acting through its
authorized Subcontractors, and each of their respective officers and
employees, as the Companys lawful attorney-in-fact, from and after the
Inception Date for so long as the Administrator is authorized to perform the
Administrative Services and solely to the extent necessary to provide the
Administrative Services, (a) to do any and all lawful acts that the Company
might have done with respect to the Administered Business, and (b) to proceed
by all lawful means (i) to perform any and all of the Companys obligations
with respect to the Administered Business, (ii) to enforce any right and
defend (in the name of the Company, when necessary) against any liability
arising with respect to the Administered Business, (iii) to sue or defend (in
the name of the Company, when necessary) any Action arising from or relating
to the Administered Business,

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) to collect any and all Recoveries due or payable under or relating to the
LBL Contracts, the Separate Account, the Shared Separate Account with respect
to the LBL Contracts, and the Ceded Reinsurance Contracts; (v) to collect any
and all amounts due or payable to the Company under or relating to the Vermont
Captive Contracts; (vi) to sign (in the Companys name, when necessary)
vouchers, receipts, releases and other papers in connection with any of the
foregoing matters, (vii) to enforce the rights and perform the obligations of
the Company under any agency, distribution or service arrangements to the
extent related to the LBL Contracts or the Vermont Captive Contracts; (viii)
to take actions necessary, as may be reasonably determined by the
Administrator, to maintain the Administered Business in compliance with
Applicable Law; (ix) to request rate and form changes for the LBL Contracts in

sufficient facilities and trained personnel of the kind necessary to perform

and the Administrator shall remain responsible for all obligations or
liabilities of such Subcontractor with respect to the providing of such
service or services as if provided by the Administrator.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Independent Contractor_. For all purposes hereof, except as

deemed an agent, lawyer, employee, representative, joint venturer or fiduciary
of one another, nor shall this Agreement or the Administrative Services or any
activity or any transaction contemplated hereby be deemed to create any
partnership or joint venture between the Parties or among their Affiliates.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Limitation on Services_. The Administrator shall not be deemed to
be in breach of this Agreement as a result of any failure to perform, or
inadequacy in the performance of, Administrative Services hereunder to the
extent the performance of such Administrative Services is reasonably dependent

(a) from the Inception Date until the first to occur of (i) the Underwriting
Termination Date or (ii) the termination of this Agreement, the Administrator
shall be authorized to (x) issue, in the name of the Company, life insurance
policies and annuity contracts of the types included in, and utilizing the
same forms, rates and prospectuses as are in use for, the Pre-Closing
Contracts, with amendments to such forms, rates and prospectuses from time to
time as

 



      
 

 



 

are necessary for the issuance of such policies or contracts to comply with
Applicable Law or for any other business purpose, and shall be authorized to
file and seek necessary approvals from applicable Governmental Entities, in
the name of the Company, with respect to any such amendments; _provided_ that
the Administrators authority to file amendments to any such rates shall be
subject to the prior written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), and (y) withdraw such products, forms,
rates and prospectuses. Life insurance policies issued by the Administrator
pursuant to this _Section 4.1(a)_ upon conversion of a Pre-Closing Policy or
a Post-Closing Policy produced by an Exclusive Producer are referred to herein
as " _Underwriting Period Conversion Policies_ ";

 



 

(b) the Administrator shall be authorized to issue, in the name of the Company
from and after the Inception Date, solely to the extent required to comply
with Applicable Law, life insurance policies and annuity contracts as required
to replace or remediate LBL Contracts or Vermont Captive Contracts.

 



 

Section 4.2 _Parties  Responsibilities_.

 



 

(a) The Administrator, at its sole cost and expense (but without duplication
of amounts payable under the Reinsurance Agreement), shall assume all
responsibility for (i) the provision of all applications and other
contractholder materials to agents and persons seeking to apply for Post-
Closing Policies (other than the Post-Underwriting Period Conversion
Policies), (ii) all underwriting necessary or appropriate with respect to such
applicants pursuant to the underwriting guidelines utilized by the Company as
of the Inception Date, or as may be otherwise agreed by the Parties (the
agreement of the Company not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), (iii) the processing of underwriting-related transactions in respect
of the Post-Closing Policies (other than the Post-Underwriting Period
Conversion Policies) and (iv) the issuance of Post-Closing Policies (other
than the Post-Underwriting Period Conversion Policies).

 



 

(b) The Company shall assume all responsibility for (i) the provision of all
applications and other contractholder materials to agents and persons seeking
to apply for Post-Underwriting Period Conversion Policies and Excluded
Conversion Policies, (ii) with respect to Post-Underwriting Period Conversion
Policies, all underwriting necessary or appropriate with respect to such
applicants pursuant to the underwriting guidelines as may be agreed by the
Parties (the agreement of the Parties not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), (iii) if needed, with respect to Excluded Conversion
Policies, all underwriting necessary or appropriate with respect to such
applicants, (iv) the processing of underwriting-related transactions in
respect of the Post-Underwriting Period Conversion Policies and Excluded
Conversion Policies and (v) the issuance of Post-Underwriting Period
Conversion Policies and Excluded Conversion Policies. Without limiting the
generality of _Article XV_ or any other provision of this Agreement, the
Administrator shall reasonably cooperate and provide all assistance,
information and records reasonably available to it as may reasonably be
requested by the Company in connection with the Companys performance of the
foregoing obligations.1

   

1 **Note to Draft:** Provision requiring the Company to administer the Post-
Underwriting Period Conversion Policies is subject to agreement as to expense
allowance payable to Company under the Reinsurance Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Administrator shall promptly notify the Company of all revisions to
the LBL Contracts and Vermont Captive Contracts made pursuant to _Section
4.1_ and shall, on behalf of the Company, prepare and provide to
Contractholders all such revisions to the LBL Contracts and Vermont Captive
Contracts to be made by the Company.

 



 

Section 4.3 _Conversion and Replacement_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Inception Date, the Administrator shall be entitled, to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, to offer to any holder of a Pre-
Closing Policy or a Post-Closing Policy, in each case that entitles the holder
thereof to convert such policy to another policy written by the Company (a "
_Reinsured Convertible Policy_ "), the opportunity to convert such Reinsured
Convertible Policy into a policy written by the Administrator or one of its
Affiliates (a " _Replacement Policy_ "). If such offer is not accepted, or if
no such offer is timely made, then subject to the terms of this _Article IV_,
(i) the Administrator shall issue, in the name of the Company, an Underwriting
Period Conversion Policy upon exercise by the policyholder of a Reinsured
Convertible Policy, on or prior to December 31, 2015, of such policyholders
right to receive a conversion policy issued by the Company, and (ii) the
Company shall issue a Post-Underwriting Period Conversion Policy upon exercise
by the policyholder of a Reinsured Convertible Policy, on or after January 1,
2016, of such policyholders right to receive a conversion policy issued by
the Company, as applicable.

 



 

(b) From and after January 1, 2016, the Company may (i) amend any of its
policy forms, rates and prospectuses from time to time, (ii) cease offering
any such policy forms, rates and prospectuses and (iii) withdraw any such
product, form, rate or prospectus, _provided_ , _however_ , that until such
time as no Reinsured Convertible Policies are outstanding, the Company shall
maintain in effect at least one (1) new life policy form and associated rate
filing developed jointly by the Parties, that meets the requirements of each
Reinsured Convertible Policy for a conversion policy issued by the Company. In
connection with the Companys requirement to maintain such policy form and
associated rate filings, after the Inception Date the Parties will work
together to develop and submit to appropriate Governmental Entities, as soon
as practicable, a life insurance policy form and associated rate filing that
meets the requirements of each Reinsured Convertible Policy for a conversion
policy (the " _New Conversion Policy Form_ "), _provided_ , that if such form
and associated rate filings have not been agreed to by the Parties by
[September 30, 2014] then the Administrators approval of any such policy form
and associated rate filing developed in good faith by the Company (after
providing the Administrator reasonable opportunity to comment thereon and
taking into account the recommendations of the Administrator) shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any policy issued on a New
Conversion Policy Form to meet the conversion requirements of a Reinsured
Convertible Policy originally produced by an Exclusive Producer shall
constitute a " _Post-Underwriting Period Conversion Policy_." Any amendments
to the New Conversion Policy Form (including the associated rate filing) shall
require the prior written consent of each Party in order for any such amended
policy to continue to be eligible for issuance as a Post-Underwriting Period
Conversion Policy. For the avoidance of doubt: (x) other than the New
Conversion Policy Form, no policy issued to satisfy the conversion
requirements of a Reinsured Convertible Policy produced by an Exclusive
Producer shall constitute a Post-Underwriting Period Conversion Policy, and
(y) subject to the Administrators rights pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_,
nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit the Companys right to
develop and maintain

 



       
 

 



 

policy forms, rates and prospectuses other than the New Conversion Policy
Form, or require the Company to discontinue offering any policy form,
associated rate or prospectus.

 



 

(c) Subject to the foregoing, the Administrator will share equally with the
Company the reasonable costs associated with the Company and Administrators
joint development, filing, approval and maintenance of a New Conversion Policy
Form, for use from and after December 31, 2015, which costs to the
Administrator shall not exceed five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000).

 



 

(d) The Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to,
target any LBL Contract for replacement with another policy written by the
Company or any other Person other than in accordance with the terms of this
_Article IV_, _provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions in this _Section
4.3(d)_ shall not restrict general marketing and solicitation activities (i)
not specifically targeted or directed to holders of LBL Contracts or (ii)
subject to clause (i), targeted or directed to holders of insurance policies
and contracts included in the Company Business regardless of whether such
holders are also holders of LBL Contracts. From and after the Inception Date,
Company shall not, directly or indirectly, sell, convey or transfer all or
substantially all of its properties or assets to, any Person, in one
transaction or a series of transactions that are part of a common plan, or any
transaction that constitutes the functional equivalent of any of the
foregoing, unless the acquiring Person in such transaction or transactions
expressly agrees to assume all of the obligations of the Company under this
_Section 4.3(d)_.

 



 

(e) Upon a specific written request by the Administrator, and at the
Administrators sole cost and expense, the Company shall provide such
information to Administrator for the use of the Exclusive Producers as is
reasonably necessary to permit Exclusive Producers to offer Designated Company
Conversion Policies on behalf of the Company to the holders of Reinsured
Convertible Policies.

 



 

Section 4.4 _Producers_. From and after the Inception Date, the Administrator
shall have the sole and exclusive right and obligation, on behalf of the
Company, to (i) appoint and enter into agreements with Exclusive Producers for
the LBL Contracts, (ii) monitor the performance and licensing of the Exclusive
Producers for the LBL Contracts to the extent required by Applicable Law,
(iii) calculate and pay all commissions to Exclusive Producers in respect of
the LBL Contracts and (iv) terminate Exclusive Producers authority and
agreements with Exclusive Producers with respect to the LBL Contracts,
_provided_ , that the Administrator shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses
incurred by any of them in connection with such actions.

 



 

 _ARTICLE V_

 



 

 _COLLECTIONS_

 



 

Section 5.1 _Collection Services_. From and after the Inception Date and
subject to _Section 2.3_, the Administrator shall assume all responsibility
for the receipt and processing of all premiums, deposits, policy loan interest
or repayments and other Recoveries with respect to the LBL Contracts and the
Vermont Captive Contracts and the allocation of such amounts between the
General Account of the Company and, if applicable, the Separate Account or
Shared Separate

 



      
 

 



 

Account in accordance with the terms of the LBL Contracts, the Vermont Captive
Contracts, the Reinsurance Agreement and this Agreement. The Administrator, on
behalf of the Company, shall process payment of any amounts to be paid out of
each Separate Account or Shared Separate Account in accordance with the terms
of the applicable LBL Contract or Vermont Captive Contract, to the extent of
sufficient funds therein. The Parties shall cooperate to establish procedures
to prevent the commingling of assets attributable to the Administered
Business, on the one hand, and the business of the Company that is not
Administered Business, on the other hand, including by establishment of
separate lockboxes with respect to the LBL Contracts and Vermont Captive
Contracts, on the one hand, and the business of the Company that is not
Administered Business, on the other hand, and otherwise to ensure that funds
are traceable to the appropriate Company insurance policy.

 



 

(a) The Company shall promptly remit to the Administrator all premiums,
deposits, policy loan interest and repayments, claims expenses, expense
allowance and all other Recoveries received by it with respect to the LBL
Contracts, the Separate Account, the Shared Separate Account with respect to
the LBL Contracts, the Vermont Captive Contracts or the Vermont Captive
Reinsurance Agreement and the Administrator shall promptly remit to the
Company all premiums, deposits, policy loans, interest and repayments received
by it with respect to the Company Business.

Section 6.1 _Claim Administration Services_. From and after the Inception
Date, subject to _Section 2.3_, the Administrator shall acknowledge,

").

 



 

Section 6.2 _Description of Claim Administration Services_. Without limiting
the foregoing, the Administrator shall:

connection therewith;

notice of or otherwise becomes aware of any examination or Action instituted

expense, in the name of the Company when necessary, subject to _Sections 2.3_
and clauses (b), (c) and (d) below. The Administrators supervision and
control of such examinations and Actions shall not constitute a waiver of any
right to indemnification or payment that it may have under the terms of the
Stock Purchase Agreement, the Reinsurance Agreement, this Agreement or any
other Transaction Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Company authorizes the Administrator to prepare, with a copy to the
Company, a response to any such examination or Action initiated by a
Governmental Entity with respect to the Administered Business within the
Governmental Entitys requested time frame for response or, if no such time
frame is provided, within the time frame as allowed by Applicable Law;
_provided_ , that, subject to meeting such time frames, the Administrator
shall provide its proposed response to the Company for its prior review and
comment; _provided_ , _further_ , that with respect to such examinations or
Actions that relate in part to the Company Business, the Administrator shall
not respond to any such examinations or Actions without taking into account in
good faith any recommendations of the Company provided to the Administrator
with respect to such matters and shall not unreasonably reject such
recommendations.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company,
upon written notice to the Administrator and at its own cost and expense,

defense and/or settlement of any examination or Action initiated by a
Governmental Entity that, if successful, would reasonably be expected to
materially interfere with the business, financial condition or reputation of
the Company or any of its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , the Company
shall not respond to any such examinations or Actions that relate to the
Administered Business without taking into account in good faith any
recommendation of the Administrator provided to the Company with respect to

 



      
 

 



 

such matters and shall not unreasonably reject such recommendation, and shall
not settle or compromise any such examinations or Actions without the
Administrators prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably

indemnification or payment that it may have under the terms of the Stock
Purchase Agreement, the Reinsurance Agreement, this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement.

 



 

(d) The Administrator shall not settle or compromise any examination or Action
described in _Section 7.2(a)_ without the Companys prior written consent

Affiliates, (ii) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in
full by the Administrator or its Affiliates and a full and complete release is

restriction or condition that would materially adversely affect the Company or
its Affiliates.

to the Administered Business by any Person other than a Governmental Entity,

necessary; and

 



 

(ii) keep the Company fully informed of the progress of all Actions supervised
or controlled by the Administrator in which the Company is a named party and,
at the Companys request, provide to the Company a report summarizing the
nature of such Action, the alleged actions or omissions giving rise to such
Actions and copies of any files or other documents that the Company may
reasonably request in connection with its review of such matters, in each case
other than such files, documents and other information as would, in the
judgment of counsel to the Administrator, lead to the loss or waiver of legal
privilege.

 



 

The Administrators supervision and control of such Actions shall not
constitute a waiver of any right to indemnification or payment that it may
have under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Reinsurance
Agreement, this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Company shall have the right to engage its own separate legal
representation, at its own expense, and to participate fully in the defense of
any Action (other than Actions brought by a Governmental Entity, which are the
subject of _Section 7.2_) relating to the Administered Business with respect
to which the Company is a named party if such Action, if successful,
reasonably could be expected to materially interfere with the business,
financial condition or reputation of the Company or any of its Affiliates,

indemnification or payment that it may have under the terms of the Stock
Purchase Agreement, the Reinsurance Agreement, this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement.

_Section 7.3(b)_ without the Companys prior written consent (which consent

sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the
Administrator or its Affiliates and a full and complete release is provided to
the Company and its Affiliates, (iii) the settlement does not encumber any of
the assets of the Company or its Affiliates or contain any restriction or
condition that would materially adversely affect the Company or its Affiliates

and expense, shall have the right at any time to assume sole and exclusive
control over the response, defense, settlement or other resolution of any
Action (other than Actions brought by a Governmental Entity, which are the
subject of _Section 7.2_) that, if successful, reasonably could be expected
to materially interfere with the business, financial condition or reputation
of the Company or any of its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , the Company
shall not respond to any such Actions without taking into account in good
faith any recommendation of the Administrator provided to the Company with
respect to such Actions and shall not unreasonably reject such recommendation,
and shall not settle or compromise any such Actions without the
Administrators prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). The Companys supervision and control of
such examinations and Actions shall not constitute a waiver of any right to
indemnification or payment that it may have under the terms of the Stock

respect to, or as a result of, the Shared Separate Account and the Separate

Section 8.2 _Changes to Fund Options_. Prior to the Separate Account
Separation, the Administrator may make recommendations to the Company as to
changes in Fund options for the Shared Separate Account from and after the
Inception Date and the Company shall not unreasonably reject such
recommendations, but the Administrator will not change Fund options for the
Shared Separate Account from and after the Inception Date and prior to the
Separate Account Separation unless such changes are made: (a) with the prior
written consent of the Company, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, (b) in fulfillment of the fiduciary obligations of the
Company or (c) by the Board of Trustees of a Fund to liquidate, merge or
remove a Fund pursuant to the terms of the then-existing fund participation
agreements or through a regulatory process. From and after the Separate

such recommendations would result in a breach of the Companys fiduciary
duties or result in a violation of Applicable Law or the applicable LBL
Contract. If the Administrator makes a change in the LBL Contracts, the Shared
Separate Account or the Separate Account in connection with the change of a
Fund option as permitted above, the Administrator shall, at its own expense,
prepare for signature by the Company and transmit on behalf of the Company to
the appropriate Governmental Entity any SEC exemptive application, no-action

Separation, the Administrator may propose changes to any fees or other amounts
receivable from or in respect of Fund options for the Shared Separate Account

after the Separate Account Separation, the Administrator may, in its sole
discretion, make changes to any fees or other amounts receivable from or in
respect of Fund options for the Separate Account to the extent related to the
LBL Contracts, except as would result in a violation of Applicable Law or the
applicable LBL Contract.

(a) From and after the Inception Date, subject to _Section 2.3_, the

to exercise any of the Companys rights with respect to trust accounts,
letters of credit or other security posted for the benefit of the Company in
respect of the LBL Contracts under any Ceded Reinsurance Contract that is not

that the Administrator materially fails to perform its obligations under this
_Section 9.1(a)_ with respect to any Shared Reinsurance Agreement, then upon
written notice to the Administrator, the Company may assume the authority and
responsibility to manage and administer the portion of such Shared Reinsurance
Agreement that relates to the LBL Contracts, and the Administrator shall use
reasonable best efforts timely to provide any data, information, premiums and
other amounts necessary in connection with such management and administration
and shall otherwise cooperate in good faith with the Company in connection
therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall reasonably
cooperate with Administrator, at Administrators expense, in the
administration of the Ceded Reinsurance Contracts to the extent that the
Companys participation is required thereunder or is reasonably requested by
the counterparty to any Ceded Reinsurance Contract.

 



 

(b) The Company shall have the authority and responsibility to, and shall,
manage and administer the portion of the Shared Reinsurance Agreements that
does not relate to the LBL Contracts, including providing all reports and
notices that relate to policies other than the LBL Contracts required with
regard to such Shared Reinsurance Agreements to the reinsurer within the time

necessary to comply with the terms and conditions of such Shared Reinsurance
Agreements. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall timely pay all
reinsurance premiums due to the reinsurer under such Ceded Reinsurance
Contracts with respect to the policies other than LBL Contracts, and collect
from such reinsurer all reinsurance recoverables due thereunder with respect
to the policies other than the LBL Contracts. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that the Company materially fails to perform its obligations
under this _Section 9.1(b)_ with respect to such Shared Reinsurance
Agreement, then upon written notice to the Company, the Administrator may
assume the authority and responsibility to manage and administer the portion
of such Shared Reinsurance Agreement that does not relate to the LBL
Contracts, and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts timely to provide
any data, information, premiums and other amounts necessary in connection with
such management and administration and shall otherwise cooperate in good faith
with the Administrator in connection therewith. In the event that (i) the
Company has not materially failed to perform its obligation under this
_Section 9.1(b)_ with respect to a Shared Reinsurance Agreement but (ii) the
Company is determined to be obligated to provide consolidated reporting with
respect to such Shared Reinsurance Agreement, the Parties shall cooperate in
good faith to develop a mutually agreeable method to manage and administer
such Shared Reinsurance Agreement. The Company shall have the right to
exercise all of its rights with respect to trust accounts, letters of credit
or other security posted for the benefit of the Company under any Shared
Reinsurance Agreement; _provided_ that it shall hold in

 



      
 

 



 

trust for the benefit of the Administrator, and transfer to the Administrator,
any amounts withdrawn by the Company from any such trust accounts, letters of
credit or other security that relate to the LBL Contracts (which amounts
constitute Recoveries under the Reinsurance Agreement); _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company shall honor Administrators requests for collateral draws
with respect to the LBL Contracts to the extent permitted under such Shared
Reinsurance Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Amendments and Replacements_. From and after the Inception Date,
the Administrator shall have the right to terminate, amend or replace with a
new reinsurance agreement between the Administrator and the applicable
reinsurer, in whole or in part, any of the Ceded Reinsurance Contracts to the
extent such termination, amendment or replacement relates to the LBL Contracts
or Vermont Captive Contracts, respectively; provided such termination,
amendment or replacement does not affect the reinsurance coverage or other
reinsurance terms provided thereunder with respect to the Company Business.
The Company shall, upon the Reinsurers request, cooperate with the
Administrator and take all actions reasonably requested by the Administrator
to cause such terminations, amendments or replacements of Ceded Reinsurance
Contracts or to cause such new Ceded Reinsurance Contracts to be entered into.
The Administrator shall reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company or its
Affiliates in connection with such terminations, amendments or replacements of
Ceded Reinsurance Contracts or the entering into of such new Ceded Reinsurance
Contracts.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Vermont Captive Reinsurance Agreement_. The Administrator shall

(a) With respect to the LBL Contracts, in accordance with the terms of the
Reinsurance Agreement, the Administrator may provide recommendations to the
Company as to the setting of all Non-Guaranteed Elements.

 



 

(b) With respect to the Vermont Captive Contracts, the Administrator, in
consultation with the Vermont Captive, may, from time to time, make
recommendations to the Company with respect to Non-Guaranteed Elements so long
as the recommendations comply with the written terms of the Vermont Captive
Contracts, Applicable Law and Actuarial Standards of Practice promulgated by
the Actuarial Standard Board governing redetermination of non-guaranteed
charges. The Company shall establish Non-Guaranteed Elements, taking into
account the recommendations of the Administrator (in consultation with the
Vermont Captive) with respect thereto. The Company shall fully consider any
such recommendations and act reasonably and in good faith in determining
whether any such recommendations should be accepted and shall not unreasonably
delay implementation of any accepted recommendations after such
recommendations are provided in writing, except to the extent that an
applicable Governmental Entity finally determines that Applicable Law would
require the implementation of such recommendations to apply to any policy or
contract that constitutes Company Business.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event
that an applicable Governmental Entity finally determines that Applicable Law
would require the implementation of Administrators recommendations with
respect to one or more LBL Contracts or Vermont Captive Contracts to apply to
any policy or contract that constitutes Company Business (a) the Parties shall
cooperate in good faith to develop a mutually agreeable plan to set Non-
Guaranteed Elements with respect to such LBL Contracts or Vermont Captive
Contracts and such Company Business, and the Parties shall implement any such
plan so agreed and (b) the Company shall not be liable for any Indemnified
Losses incurred by the Administrator as a result of the Companys failure to
implement Administrators recommendations. In the event that the Company is
notified by an applicable Governmental Entity that it proposes making a
determination that Applicable Law would require the implementation of such
recommendations to apply to any policy or contract that constitute Company
Business, the Company shall promptly notify the Administrator of such
notification. The Parties will thereafter cooperate in good faith and use
their reasonable best efforts to reach agreements with such Governmental
Entity that will avoid a final determination to such effect. The Administrator
acknowledges that the Company has certain indemnification rights under the
Reinsurance Agreement for Indemnifiable Losses resulting from the Companys
acceptance and implementation of the Administrators recommendations in
accordance with this _Section 9.4_.

the authority and responsibility on behalf of the Company to perform the
services and other obligations required of the Company, and to enforce the
Companys rights, under the Principal Underwriting Agreement, in each case to
the extent relating to the LBL Contracts covered thereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Administrator shall have no responsibility to perform any
indemnification obligations of the Company under the Principal Underwriting
Agreement to the extent such obligations arise out of any act or omission of
the Company (other than an act or omission for which Administrator is
responsible hereunder).

 



 

Section 9.7 _Other Services_. Subject to _Section 2.3_, the Administrator
shall provide such other administrative services as are necessary or
appropriate to fully effectuate the purpose of the Reinsurance Agreement, the
Vermont Captive Reinsurance Agreement and this Agreement, including such
services as are not performed by or on behalf of Company on the date hereof

Law and are consistent with the allocation of the services set forth herein
between the Administrator and the Company.

applicable to the Company from time to time, other than such regulatory and

Affiliates are subject to non-U.S. legal or regulatory requirements and
industry standards. Without limiting the foregoing, the Administrator shall
provide the reports and information set forth on _Schedule A_ within the
timeframes indicated therein. In addition, and without limiting the
Administrators obligation to provide the Administrative Services hereunder,
upon the timely and reasonable request of the Company, the Administrator shall
promptly provide to the Company copies of all existing records relating to the
Administered Business (including, with respect to records maintained in
machine readable form, hard copies) that are reasonably necessary to satisfy
any requirements imposed by Applicable Law or any Governmental Entity upon the
Company with respect to the Administered Business. All (i) such information
and (ii) such records furnished in the ordinary course of business relating to
the Administered Business shall be furnished at the Administrators sole cost
and expense. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the timely
and reasonable request of the Company, the Administrator shall promptly

other than such reports, summaries and certificates that are required or
requested because the Company or its Affiliates are subject to non-U.S. legal
or regulatory requirements and industry standards. Without limiting the
foregoing:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) As soon as practicable but not more than ten (10) Business Days after the

having jurisdiction over the Company (or any consolidated statutory financial

the Administrator shall provide to the Company an actuarial analysis of
statutory reserves for the LBL Contracts and the Vermont Captive Contracts,
reasonably adequate to support opinions prepared according to accepted
actuarial standards of practice to be issued by the Company, and as otherwise
required for regulatory reporting purposes. The Administrator shall also
provide supporting documentation as reasonably requested by the Company or as
required by Governmental Entities or actuarial standards of practice. In the
event that Applicable Law imposes (a) a legal requirement on the
Administrator, in its capacity as reinsurer under the Reinsurance Agreement or
administrator under this Agreement, to provide an actuarial opinion as to the
adequacy of statutory reserves for the LBL Contracts or the Vermont Captive
Contracts, or (b) a legal requirement on the Company to obtain such an

disclose any information to the Company or its representatives to the extent
such information does not pertain to the Administered Business or if such
disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, the work product
immunity or any other legal privilege or similar doctrine or contravene any
Applicable Law or any contract (including any confidentiality agreement to
which the Administrator or any of its Affiliates is a party) (it being
understood that the Administrator shall use its reasonable best efforts to
enable such information to be furnished or made available to the Company or
its representatives without so jeopardizing privilege or contravening such
Applicable Law or contract) or require the Administrator to disclose any
personnel or related records.

 



 

(c) During the term of this Agreement, upon any reasonable request from the
Administrator or its representatives, the Company shall (i) provide to the
Administrator and its

unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company, and
(ii) permit the Administrator and its representatives to make copies of such
records. Nothing herein shall require the Company to disclose any information
to the Administrator or its representatives if such disclosure would
jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, the work product immunity or any
other legal privilege or similar doctrine or contravene any Applicable Law or
contract (including any confidentiality agreement to which the Company or any
of its Affiliates is a party) (it being understood that the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to enable such information to be furnished or made
available to the Administrator or its representatives without so jeopardizing
privilege or contravening such Applicable Law or contract) or require the
Company to disclose its tax records (other than premium tax filings) or any

Section 16.1 _Confidentiality Obligations_. In providing the Administrative
Services provided for under this Agreement, and in connection with
maintaining, administering, handling and transferring the data of the
Contractholders and other recipients of benefits under the LBL Contracts and
Vermont Captive Contracts, the Administrator shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, comply with any Applicable Law and/or regulations with respect
to privacy or data security relative to Customer Information (as defined
below), and shall implement and maintain an effective information security
program (the " _Information Security Program_ ") designed to protect Customer
Information in compliance with all applicable privacy laws and other
Applicable Law:

 



 

(i) to ensure the security, integrity and confidentiality of Customer
Information;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or
integrity of such Customer Information; and

 



 

(iii) to protect against unauthorized access to or use of Customer Information
which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to the owner thereof
or its Affiliates, or to Customers or potential Customers thereof.

 



 

The Administrator has made a copy of such Information Security Program in
effect as of the Inception Date available to the Company. From time to time
upon the Companys written request, the Administrator shall deliver a copy of
its then-current Information Security Program to the Company. For as long as
Administrative Services are provided hereunder, the Administrator shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, abide by the Information Security Program with
respect to the Administered Business. At all times during the term of this
Agreement, the Information Security Program shall be no less protective of the
Administered Business than the information security program of the
Administrator applicable to the insurance business administered by the
Administrator for its own account.

 



 

" _Customer Information_ " is defined as all tangible and intangible
information provided or disclosed hereunder about present or former contract
holders, annuitants, or other beneficiaries (collectively, hereinafter "
_Customers_ ") or potential Customers of any Party or its Affiliates,
including, but not limited to, name, address, telephone number, email address,
account or policy information, and any list, description, or other grouping of
Customers or potential Customers, and any medical records or other medical
information of such Customers or potential Customers and any other type of
information deemed "nonpublic" and protected by privacy laws and any other
Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 16.2 _Security Incidents_.

 



 

(a) In the event that any Party discovers a security breach that has resulted
or may reasonably result in unauthorized access to or disclosure of, or have
any material adverse effect on, the security of any Customer Information
related to the LBL Contracts or the Vermont Captive Contracts (a "Security
Incident") such Party shall (i) within 24 hours, notify the other Party of
said Security Incident; and (ii) work with the other Party to take all
measures reasonably necessary to restore the security of such Customer
Information. The Company shall have the exclusive right to provide notice of
any Security Incident to any Customers of the LBL Contracts or the Vermont
Captive Contracts, any law enforcement Person or any other Governmental
Authorities and to determine the content and timing of any such notice;
provided, any such notice shall be subject to review and approval by the
Administrator.

 



 

(b) Each Party acknowledges that the breach of its obligations under this
_Section 16.2_ may cause irreparable injury and damages, which may be
difficult to ascertain. Therefore a Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive
relief with respect to any breach or threatened breach of this _Section 16.2_
by the other Party and its Affiliates. This provision shall not in any way
limit such other remedies as may be available to any Party at law or in
equity.

delivers to the Administrator all of its rights, title and interest in one
hundred percent of such amounts actually received or receivable at or after

(a) The Administrator shall have the right to open and maintain the Bank
Accounts in respect of the LBL Contracts in accordance with the terms of the
Reinsurance Agreement, _provided_ that the Administrator shall notify the
Company in writing upon opening any such Bank Account in the name of the
Company.

 



 

(b) During the term of this Agreement, the Administrator may use such Bank
Accounts or open and maintain one or more additional bank accounts with
banking institutions with respect to the Vermont Captive Contracts (the "
_Vermont Captive Bank Accounts_ "). The Administrator shall have the exclusive
authority over the Vermont Captive Bank Accounts including, without
limitation, the exclusive authority to (a) open the Vermont Captive Bank
Accounts in the name of the Company, (b) designate the authorized signatories
on the Vermont Captive Bank Accounts, (c) issue drafts on and make deposits in
the Vermont Captive Bank Accounts in the name of the Company, (d) make
withdrawals from the Vermont Captive Bank Accounts and (e) enter into
agreements with respect to the Vermont Captive Bank Accounts on behalf of the
Company; _provided_ , that in no event shall the Company be responsible for
any fees, overdraft charges or other payments, liabilities or obligations with
respect to any such Bank Accounts or be obligated to provide funding for the
Bank Accounts. The Company shall do all things necessary at the Reinsurers
expense to (x) enable and authorize the Administrator to use the Companys
existing lockboxes with respect to the Vermont Captive Contracts, if any, and
(y) enable the Administrator to open and maintain the Vermont Captive Bank
Accounts including, without limitation, executing and delivering such
depository resolutions and other documents as may be requested from time to
time by the banking institutions. The Company agrees that without the
Reinsurers prior written consent it shall not make any changes to the
authorized signatories on the Vermont Captive Bank Accounts nor attempt to
withdraw any funds therefrom.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 18.2 _Trademarks_. Administrator hereby acknowledges that the Company
has adopted and is using the names and marks listed on _Schedule C_ hereto in
connection with the LBL Contracts and Vermont Captive Contracts (collectively,
the " _Licensed Names and Marks_ "). The Company and Administrator agree as
follows:

 



 

(a) The Company hereby grants to the Administrator and Administrator hereby
accepts a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use the
Licensed Names and Marks in connection with the Administrative Services,
including Post-Closing Policies, during the term of, and subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Any of the rights in the foregoing
license may be sublicensed by the Administrator in connection with any
contract permitted by _Section 3.3_; _provided_ , that such sublicense is
limited to the use of the Licensed Names and Marks in connection with the
Administrative Services, including Post-Closing Policies and does not extend
the right to further sublicense any such Licensed Names and Marks. If the
Administrator sublicenses any of the rights in the foregoing license, the
Administrator shall remain liable for any actions or omissions by the
sublicensee. The Administrator is granted no rights to use the Licensed Names
and Marks, other than those rights specifically described and expressly
licensed in this Agreement and no right is granted hereunder for the use of
the Licensed Names and Marks in connection with any services other than the
Administrative Services, including Post-Closing Policies. Other than in
connection with the Administrative Services, including Post-Closing Policies,
none of the rights licensed to the Administrator under this _Section 18.2_
may be assigned, sublicensed or otherwise transferred by the Administrator,
nor shall such rights inure to the benefit of any trustee in bankruptcy,
receiver or successor of the Administrator, whether by operation of law or
otherwise, without the prior written consent of the Company, and any
assignment, sublicense or other transfer without such consent shall be null
and void. The merger of Administrator with or into another entity shall not
constitute an assignment or other transfer of the rights licensed to the
Administrator under this _Section 18.2_.

 



 

(b) The Administrator agrees that it will use the Licensed Names and Marks as
the Company used them prior to the Closing and that the nature of such use on
the Materials (as defined below) shall be at least equal to the standard of
quality maintained by the Company in connection with such Licensed Names and
Marks immediately prior to the Closing and consistent with established
industry practice (collectively, the " _Licensor Standards_ "). The
Administrator agrees to make available for review, upon the Companys request,
all materials that incorporate the Licensed Names and Marks including, but not
limited to, advertising copy, labels, stickers, policies, brochures or other
materials, including any applicable materials in connection with the
Administrators performance under this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Materials_ "). If the Company objects to the manner in which a Licensed Name
or Mark is used in connection with any Materials, the Company may request that
the Administrator take, and the Administrator shall promptly take, all steps
necessary to remedy any such deficiencies within 15 days after such
notification, including to promptly discontinue the use of any such Materials.
The Administrator shall promptly notify the Company of any material complaints
received in writing from third parties regarding the products or services
offered or provided under the Licensed Names and Marks and, at the request of
the Company, shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in addressing and
mitigating the circumstances giving rise to such complaints. The Administrator
shall (a) permit the Company or its representatives reasonable access to such
of the Administrators facilities and personnel as are actively involved in
use of the Licensed

 



      
 

 



 

Names and Marks on reasonable prior written notice, and (b) make available to
the Company or its representatives for inspection specimens demonstrating the
Administrators use of the Licensed Names and Marks on the Materials or
otherwise in connection with the Licensed Names and Marks, as requested by the
Company from time to time for the purpose of verifying that the
Administrators use complies with Licensor Standards and to the extent
reasonably necessary to maintain the validity of the Licensed Names and Marks
and the valuable goodwill and reputation established by the Licensed Names and
Marks.

 



 

(c) The Administrator agrees not to adopt or use any service mark, logo or
design confusingly similar to the Licensed Names and Marks. It is understood
that the Company retains the right, in its sole discretion, to modify the
Licensed Names and Marks, upon reasonable prior notice to the Administrator.
Any material costs incurred by the Administrator associated with any mailings
to Contractholders required under Applicable Law as a result of such
modification shall be reimbursed by the Company.

 



 

(d) The Administrator recognizes the value of the goodwill associated with the
Licensed Names and Marks and acknowledges that, as between the Administrator
and the Company, all proprietary rights therein and the goodwill attached
thereto belong exclusively to the Company. All uses of the Licensed Names and
Marks by the Administrator shall, with respect to service mark ownership only,
inure solely to the benefit of the Company and any registration of the
Licensed Names and Marks shall be registered by the Company in its name, it
being understood that the present license shall not in any way affect the
ownership by the Company of the Licensed Names and Marks, each of which shall
continue to be the exclusive property of the Company. The Company shall, in
its own name and at its own expense, maintain appropriate service mark
protection for the Licensed Names and Marks. The Administrator shall not at
any time during the term of this Agreement or at any time thereafter do or
cause to be done any act contesting the validity of the Licensed Names and
Marks, contesting or in any way impairing or tending to impair the Companys
entire right, title and interest in the Licensed Names and Marks and the
registrations thereof or adversely affecting the value of the Licensed Names
and Marks or the reputation and goodwill of the Company. The Administrator
shall not represent that it has any right, title or interest in the reputation
and good will of the Company. The Administrator shall not represent that it
has any right, title or interest in the Licensed Names and Marks other than
the rights expressly granted by this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Subject to the provisions of _Article XIX_ hereof, except with respect to
any uses of the Licensed Names and Marks not authorized under this Agreement,
the Company will indemnify, defend and hold the Administrator harmless from
any Losses from claims that the Licensed Names and Marks infringe on the
rights of third parties. Subject to the provisions of _Article XIX_, the
Administrator will indemnify, defend and hold the Company harmless from any
Losses that arise in connection with the Administrators use of the Licensed
Names and Marks other than as authorized under this Agreement. This _Section
18.2_ shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

 



 

(f) The right to institute and prosecute actions for infringement of the
Licensed Names and Marks is reserved exclusively to the Company, and the
Company shall have the right to join the Administrator in any such actions as
a formal party. The Company may also request, and the Administrator shall
provide, assistance with respect to any such infringement

 



      
 

 



 

action. Any such action shall be conducted at the Companys expense. The
Administrator shall provide prompt written notice to the Company of any
infringement or unauthorized use of the Licensed Names and Marks of which it
is aware, and agrees to assist the Company at the Companys expense in any
such action brought by the Company. It is understood, however, that the
Company is not obligated to institute and prosecute any such actions in any
case in which it, in its sole judgment, may consider it inadvisable to do so.
Any recovery obtained by the Company as a result of any such action shall
belong solely to Company.

 



 

(g) The agreements and covenants contained in this _Section 18.2_ shall
continue in effect until such time as this Agreement is terminated. Upon
termination of this Agreement, the Administrator shall discontinue all use of
the Licensed Names and Marks (but in no event will such use extend beyond
sixty (60) calendar days after termination). Upon any such termination, the
Administrator shall take all commercially reasonable actions necessary to
effect such discontinuance. Upon termination, all of the Administrators
rights to the Licensed Names and Marks shall revert to and continue to reside
with and be owned exclusively by the Company.

Section 21.3 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to a Section of, or an
Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. All
references herein to any agreement, instrument, statute, rule or regulation
are to the agreement, instrument, statute, rule or regulation as amended,
modified, supplemented or replaced from time to time (and, in the case of
statutes, includes any rules and regulations promulgated under said statutes)
and to any section of any statute, rule or regulation including any successor
to said section. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are

 



      
 

 



 

used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." Whenever the singular is used herein, the same shall
include the plural, and whenever the plural is used herein, the same shall
include the singular, where appropriate. Whenever the word "Dollars" or the
"$" sign appear in this Agreement, they shall be construed to mean United
States Dollars, and all transactions under this Agreement shall be in United
States Dollars. This Agreement has been fully negotiated by the Parties hereto
and shall not be construed by any Governmental Entity against either Party by
virtue of the fact that such Party was the drafting Party.

 



 

Section 21.4 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including all exhibits and schedules hereto) and the other Transaction
Agreements constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings, representations and warranties, both written and
oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.
Except as set forth in _Article XIX_ with respect to the Administrator
Indemnified Parties and the Company Indemnified Parties, this Agreement is not
intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties hereto and their
successors and permitted assigns any rights or remedies.

 



 

Section 21.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any dispute arising hereunder
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State
of New York, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under
applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

 



 

Section 21.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise (other than by operation of law in a
merger), by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party,
and any such assignment that is not consented to shall be null and void.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

 



 

Section 21.7 _Jurisdiction; Enforcement_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court of the United States or any state
court, which in either case is located in the City and County of New York
(each, a " _New York Court_ ") for purposes of enforcing this Agreement or
determining any claim arising from or related to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In any such action, suit or other proceeding, each of the
Parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to assert
by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise any claim that it is not subject
to the jurisdiction of any such New York Court, that such action, suit or
other proceeding is not subject to the jurisdiction of any such New York
Court, that such action, suit or other proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum or that the venue of such action, suit or other proceeding
is improper; _provided_ , that nothing set forth in this sentence shall
prohibit any of the Parties hereto from removing any matter from one New York
Court to another New York Court. Each of the Parties hereto also agrees that
any final and unappealable judgment against a Party hereto in connection with
any action, suit or other proceeding will be conclusive and binding on such
Party and that such award or judgment may be enforced in any court of
competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of the United States. A
certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment will be conclusive
evidence of the fact and amount of such award or judgment. Any process or
other paper to be served in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with any action or proceeding under this Agreement shall, if
delivered or sent in accordance with _Section 21.2_, constitute good, proper
and sufficient service thereof.

 



 

(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OR ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
21.7_.

 



 

Section 21.8 _Severability; Amendment; Modification; Waiver_.

 



 

(a) Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under Applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under
any Applicable Law in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability will not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed
and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision or portion of any provision had never been contained herein.

 



 

(b) This Agreement may be amended or a provision hereof waived only by a
written instrument signed by each of the Administrator and the Company.

 



 

(c) No delay on the part of any Party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on
the part of any Party of any right, power or privilege, nor any single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.

 



 

Section 21.9 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any court
of competent jurisdiction, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. The Parties hereby waive, in any action for
specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and the
posting of any bond or other security in connection therewith.

 



 

Section 21.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and
delivered to the other Party. Each Party

 



      
 

 



 

may deliver its signed counterpart of this Agreement to the other Party by
means of electronic mail or any other electronic medium utilizing image scan
technology, and such delivery will have the same legal effect as hand delivery
of an originally executed counterpart.

survive the termination of this Agreement.

COVERAGE_

 



 

Section 2.1 _Coverage_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions and other
provisions of this Agreement, as of [12:01 a.m.] Central Time on the 1st day
of the month in which the Closing occurs (the " _Inception Date_ "), the
Company hereby cedes to the Reinsurer, and the Reinsurer hereby agrees to
indemnify the Company (i) on a coinsurance basis, for one hundred percent
(100%) of the General Account Liabilities of the Company; (ii) on a modified
coinsurance basis, for one hundred percent (100%) of the Separate Account
Liabilities of the Company and (iii) for one hundred percent (100%) of the
Reinsurer Extra Contractual Obligations, in each case, payable by the Company
on or after the Inception Date (the " _Reinsured Risks_ ").

 



 

Section 2.2 _Conditions_.

 



 

(a) The Company, on its own initiative, shall not change the terms and
conditions of any LBL Contract, other than for any changes that are required
due to (i) changes in Applicable Law, (ii) the terms of the LBL Contracts or
(iii) the requirements of any Governmental Entity. If the Companys liability
under any of the LBL Contracts is changed because of changes made on or after
the Inception Date in the terms and conditions of the LBL Contracts (including
to any contract riders or endorsements thereto) that are required due to the
reasons identified in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Reinsurer will
share in the change proportionately to the coinsurance share hereunder and the
Company and the Reinsurer will make all appropriate adjustments to amounts due
each other under this Agreement. With respect to any change required due to
the reasons identified in clauses (i) or (iii) above, the Company shall, to
the extent practicable, prior to the effectiveness of any such change,
promptly notify the Reinsurer of such proposed change and afford the Reinsurer
the opportunity, to the extent practicable, to object to such change under
applicable administrative procedures (both formal and informal).

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise set forth or contemplated herein, including in
paragraph (a) above, no changes, amendments or modifications made on or after
the Inception Date of the terms and conditions of the LBL Contracts (including
to any contract riders or endorsements thereto) shall be covered hereunder
unless made by the Reinsurer pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement
or made or consented to by the Company with the prior written approval of the
Reinsurer. In the event that any such changes, amendments or modifications are
made or consented to in any LBL Contract by the Company without the prior
written approval of the Reinsurer, this Agreement will cover Reinsured Risks
incurred by the Company under such LBL Contract as if the non-approved
changes, amendments or modifications had not been made.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Indemnity Reinsurance_. This Agreement is an indemnity
coinsurance and modified coinsurance agreement solely between the Company and
the Reinsurer, and the performance of the obligations of each Party under this
Agreement shall be rendered solely to the

 



      
 

 



 

other Party. The Company shall be and shall remain the only party hereunder
that is liable to any insured, cedent, Contractholder, claimant or beneficiary
under any annuity contract or insurance policy reinsured hereunder.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Territory_. The territorial limits of this Agreement shall be
identical with those of the LBL Contracts.

Contracts (other than the Post-Underwriting Period Conversion Policies), the
Ceded Reinsurance Contracts with respect to the LBL Contracts (other than with
respect to the Post-Underwriting Period Conversion Policies) and the Separate
Accounts (to the extent provided in the Administrative Services Agreement)
directly on behalf of the Company, in each instance in accordance with the
terms of the Administrative Services Agreement. The Post-Underwriting Period
Conversion Policies shall be administered by the Company. The Company agrees
to administer the Post-Underwriting Period Conversion Policies in accordance
with Applicable Law, the terms of such policies and, subject to the foregoing,
using a degree of skill and attention no less than that which the Company
exercises with respect to the Company Business.1

 



 

Section 3.2 _Non-Guaranteed Elements_. The Reinsurer may, from time to time,
make recommendations to the Company with respect to Non-Guaranteed Elements so
long as the recommendations comply with the written terms of the LBL
Contracts, Applicable Law and Actuarial Standards of Practice promulgated by
the Actuarial Standard Board governing redetermination of non-guaranteed
charges. The Company shall fully consider any such recommendations and act
reasonably and in good faith in determining whether any such recommendations
should be accepted and shall not unreasonably delay implementation of any
accepted recommendations after such recommendations are provided in writing,
except to the extent that an applicable Governmental Entity finally determines
that Applicable Law would require the implementation of such recommendations
to apply to any policy or contract that constitutes Company Business.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that
an applicable Governmental Entity finally determines that Applicable Law would
require the implementation of the Reinsurers recommendations with respect to
one or more LBL Contracts to apply to any policy or contract that constitutes
Company Business (a) the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to develop a
mutually agreeable plan to set Non-Guaranteed Elements with respect to such
LBL Contracts and such Company Business, and the Parties shall implement any
such plan so agreed and (b) the Company shall not be liable for any
Indemnified Losses incurred by the Reinsurer as a result of the Companys
failure to implement the Reinsurers recommendations. In the event that the
Company is notified by an applicable Governmental Entity that it proposes
making a determination that Applicable Law would require the implementation of
such recommendations to apply to any policy or contract that constitute
Company Business, the Company shall promptly (but in any event within two (2)
Business

the Post-Underwriting Period Conversion Policies is subject to agreement
between Seller and Buyer as to the compensation to be received by the Company
in connection thereto.

 



      
 

 



 

Days) notify the Reinsurer of such notification. The parties will thereafter
cooperate in good faith and use their reasonable best efforts to reach
agreements with such Governmental Entity that will avoid a final determination
to such effect.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Policy Exchanges, Replacements or Surrenders_. Unless otherwise
agreed in writing by the Parties to this Agreement, (i) the Company will not
institute, promote, or encourage any exchange, replacement or surrender
program with respect to the LBL Contracts; and (ii) the Company shall not use
any information regarding the LBL Contracts, including information regarding
the Contractholders, other than for purposes of complying with its obligations
under the Administrative Services Agreement and this Agreement or as otherwise
required by Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Errors and Omissions_. If any delay, omission, error or failure
to pay amounts due or to perform any other act required by this Agreement is
unintentional and caused by misunderstanding or oversight, the Company and the
Reinsurer will adjust the situation to what it would have been had the
misunderstanding or oversight not occurred. The Party first discovering such
misunderstanding or oversight, or an act resulting from such misunderstanding
or oversight, will notify the other Party in writing promptly upon discovery
thereof, and the Parties shall act to correct such misunderstanding or
oversight within twenty (20) Business Days of such other Partys receipt of
such notice. However, this _Section 3.4_ shall not be construed as a waiver
by either Party of its right to enforce strictly the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Age, Sex and Other Adjustments_. If the Companys liability under
any of the LBL Contracts is changed because of a misstatement of age or sex or
any other material fact, the Reinsurer will share in the change
proportionately to the reinsurance share hereunder and the Company and the
Reinsurer will make all appropriate adjustments to amounts due each other
under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Set-off_. Any debts or credits, matured or unmatured, in favor of
or against either the Company or the Reinsurer with respect to this Agreement
are deemed mutual debts or credits, as the case may be, and shall be set off
from any amounts due to the Company or the Reinsurer hereunder, as the case
may be, and only the net balance shall be allowed or paid. For the avoidance
of doubt, no such set-off shall affect the obligations of the Parties or their
respective Affiliates under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement or any
other Transaction Agreement. In the event of any insolvency, rehabilitation,
conservatorship or comparable proceeding by or against the Ceding Company or
the Reinsurer, the rights of offset and recoupment set forth in this _Section
3.6_ shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Defenses_. The Reinsurer accepts, reinsures and assumes the
Reinsured Risks subject to any and all defenses, set-offs and counterclaims to
which the Company would be entitled with respect to the Reinsured Risks, it
being expressly understood and agreed to by the Parties hereto that no such
defenses, set-offs, or counterclaims are or shall be waived by the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and that the Reinsurer is and shall be fully subrogated in
and to all such defenses, set-offs and counterclaims.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.8 _Guaranty Fund Assessments and Premium Taxes_. The Company and the
Reinsurer shall settle amounts due with regard to guaranty fund assessments,
premium taxes and premium tax credits included in the General Account
Liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Administrative Services
Agreement.

make policies available for issuance upon the exercise by a Contractholder of
any conversion right in an LBL Contract in accordance with the terms of the
Administrative Services Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.10 Ceded Reinsurance Contracts.

 



 

(a) From and after the Inception Date, pursuant to the terms of the
Administrative Services Agreement, the Reinsurer shall have the exclusive
right to terminate, amend or replace with a new reinsurance agreement between
the Reinsurer and the applicable reinsurer, in whole or in part, any of the
Ceded Reinsurance Contracts to the extent such termination, amendment or
replacement relates to the LBL Contracts; _provided_ such termination,
amendment or replacement does not affect the reinsurance coverage or other
reinsurance terms provided thereunder with respect to the Company Business.
The Company agrees to not terminate, amend or replace any of the Ceded
Reinsurance Contracts to the extent such termination, amendment or replacement
relates to or affects the reinsurance coverage provided thereunder with
respect to the LBL Contracts. The Company shall, upon the Reinsurers request,
cooperate with the Reinsurer and take all actions reasonably requested by the
Reinsurer to cause such terminations, amendments or replacements of Ceded
Reinsurance Contracts or to cause such replacement Ceded Reinsurance Contracts
to be entered into. The Reinsurer shall reimburse the Company for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the
Company or its Affiliates in connection with such terminations, amendments or
replacements of Ceded Reinsurance Contracts or the entering into of such new
Ceded Reinsurance Contracts.

 



 

(b) From and after the Inception Date, to the extent not completed prior to
the Inception Date pursuant to Section 5.4 of the Stock Purchase Agreement,
the Reinsurer and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts, and
shall cooperate fully with each other, to cause the reinsurer under each Ceded
Reinsurance Contract pursuant to which such reinsurer reinsures both risk
included in the Company Business and risk that is not included in the Company
Business (each, a " _Shared Reinsurance Agreement_ ") to (i) enter into (A) a
novation to the Reinsurer or one or more of its Affiliates of the portion of
such Shared Reinsurance Agreement comprising risk that is not included in the
Company Business or (B) an amendment of such Shared Reinsurance Agreement to
exclude the risk that is not included in the Company Business together with a
new reinsurance arrangement with the Reinsurer or one or more of its
Affiliates pursuant to which such risk will be reinsured by such reinsurer on
the same terms as those applicable under the Shared Reinsurance Agreement
(each of (A) and (B), an " _Alternative Reinsurance Arrangement_ ") and (ii)
waive any right to terminate such Shared Reinsurance Agreement pursuant to its
terms as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , that neither Party shall be required to compromise any
right, asset or benefit or expend any amount, incur any liability or provide
any other consideration in connection with obtaining the consent of any
reinsurer to any Alternative Reinsurance Arrangement. For the avoidance of
doubt, if the Parties are unable to effect an Alternative

 



      
 

 



 

Reinsurance Arrangement with respect to any Shared Reinsurance Agreement and
such Shared Reinsurance Agreement remains in effect after the Inception Date,
all rights to the reinsurance recoveries under such Shared Reinsurance
Agreement that relate to the LBL Contracts shall be included in the
Recoveries, the Company shall have no obligation to seek collection for any
such Recoveries (other than with respect to the Post-Underwriting Period
Conversion Policies or as may be provided in the Administrative Services
Agreement), and the Reinsurer will administer such Shared Reinsurance
Agreement with respect to the LBL Contracts (other than with respect to the
Post-Underwriting Period Conversion Policies) under the Administrative
Services Agreement.

 



 

(c) From and after the Inception Date, to the extent not completed prior to
the Inception Date pursuant to Section 5.4 of the Stock Purchase Agreement,
the Reinsurer shall have the right but not the obligation to continue to use
efforts to cause the reinsurer under each Ceded Reinsurance Contract other
than the Shared Reinsurance Agreements to enter into either (i) a novation of
such Ceded Reinsurance Contract from the Company to the Reinsurer or one of
its Affiliates or (ii) a termination of such Ceded Reinsurance Contract
together with the concurrent entry into a new reinsurance contract with the
Reinsurer; _provided_ , that neither Party shall be required to compromise any
right, asset or benefit or expend any amount, incur any liability or provide
any other consideration in connection with obtaining the consent of any
reinsurer to any such alternative arrangement. For the avoidance of doubt, if
the Parties are unable to effect an alternative arrangement with respect to
any such Ceded Reinsurance Contract and such Ceded Reinsurance Contract
remains in effect after the Inception Date, all rights to the reinsurance
recoveries under such Ceded Reinsurance Contract shall be included in
Recoveries, the Company shall have no obligation to seek collection for any
such Recoveries (other than with respect to the Post-Underwriting Period
Conversion Policies or as may be provided in the Administrative Services
Agreement), and the Reinsurer will administer such Ceded Reinsurance Contract
(other than with respect to the Post-Underwriting Period Conversion Policies)
under the Administrative Services Agreement.

 



 

(d) Subject to the provisions of Section 3.10(a), Liabilities with respect to
the LBL Contracts under any Ceded Reinsurance Contract that is terminated or
recaptured by the Reinsurer shall be ceded hereunder automatically to the
Reinsurer without further action, subject to receipt by the Reinsurer of any
reserve transfer or similar transfers or settlement amount, if any, received
by the Company from the applicable reinsurer and, in such event, the Reinsurer
shall pay any special transfer or recapture fee or any other amount payable by
the Company in respect of the LBL Contracts in connection therewith as may be
required under such Ceded Reinsurance Contract.

 



 

(e) From and after the Inception Date, the Reinsurer shall have the right but
not the obligation to seek Transamericas consent to (and upon receipt of such
consent to effectuate on behalf of the Company) either (i) a novation of the
Transamerica Reinsurance Agreement (together with any related servicing
agreement) from the Company to the Reinsurer or one of its Affiliates or (ii)
a termination of the Transamerica Reinsurance Agreement (together with any
related servicing agreement) together with the concurrent entry into a new
reinsurance contract and any related servicing agreement with the Reinsurer;
_provided_ , that neither Party shall be required to compromise any right,
asset or benefit or expend any amount, incur any

 



      
 

 



 

liability or provide any other consideration in connection with obtaining the
consent of Transamerica to any such alternative arrangement.

 



 

Section 3.11 _Follow the Fortunes_. The Reinsurers Liability under this
Agreement shall attach simultaneously with that of the Company under the LBL
Contracts, and the Reinsurers Liability under this Agreement shall be subject
in all respects to the same risks, terms, rates, conditions, interpretations,
assessments, waivers, proportion of Premiums paid to the Company.

 



 

ARTICLE IV _ 
INITIAL REINSURANCE PREMIUM; ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION; NET SETTLEMENT_

 



 

Section 4.1 _Initial Reinsurance Premium_. The Parties agree and acknowledge
that the initial reserve transfer occurred under the Subject Reinsurance
Agreements (or predecessor reinsurance agreements), and there will be no
additional initial reinsurance premium or ceding commission due between the
Parties as a result of entering into this Agreement except as provided in
_Section 4.2_

 



 

Section 4.2 _Additional Consideration._

 



 

(a) As additional consideration for the Reinsurer entering into this
Agreement, as of the Inception Date, the Company hereby irrevocably sells,
assigns, transfers and delivers to the Reinsurer as premium hereunder all of
its rights, title and interest in one hundred percent (100%) of all of the
following amounts actually received or receivable at or after the Inception
Date by the Company or the Reinsurer, whether in its role as reinsurer
hereunder or as Administrator, with respect to the LBL Contracts (items (i)
through (v) below, collectively, the " _Recoveries_ "):

 



 

(i) Premiums;

 



 

(ii) all amounts actually collected or collectable under the Ceded Reinsurance
Contracts in respect of the LBL Contracts (including all recoveries, returns,
amounts in respect of profit sharing and all other sums to which the Company
may be entitled under the Ceded Reinsurance Contracts in respect of the LBL
Contracts);

 



 

(iii) all mortality and expense risk charges, administrative expense charges,
rider charges, contract maintenance charges, back-end sales loads and other
considerations billed separately for the LBL Contracts collected or
collectible by the Company, and any other charges, fees and similar amounts
received or receivable by the Company from the Separate Accounts in respect of
the LBL Contracts (collectively, the " _Separate Account Charges_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, the Separate Account Charges shall include any revenue
sharing fees, service fees and distribution fees received or receivable from
or in respect of Funds pursuant to a plan adopted pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) all amounts that are transferrable from the Separate Accounts to the
general account of the Company in respect of the LBL Contracts; and

 



 

(v) without duplication, all other payments, collections, releases of funds,
recoveries and other considerations or payments with respect to the LBL
Contracts, including all premiums, payments, reimbursements, interest or other
amounts that the Company receives in connection with any reinstatement or
reissuance of an LBL Contract or any conversion, exchange or replacement
policy that is reinsured under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Company agrees to execute and record all additional documents and take
all other steps reasonably requested by the Reinsurer to effectuate such
transfer to the Reinsurer. Direct receipt by the Reinsurer, including in its
role as Administrator under the Administrative Services Agreement, or any of
its Affiliates of any such amounts shall satisfy the Companys obligations to
transfer any such amount to the Reinsurer hereunder.

 



 

(c) The Company hereby and pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement
appoints the Reinsurer as its agent to collect all Recoveries in the Companys
name. The Company agrees and acknowledges that the Reinsurer and its permitted
assigns and delegatees are entitled to enforce, in the name of the Company,
all rights at law or in equity or good faith claims of the Company with
respect to such Recoveries. If necessary for such collection, the Company
shall reasonably cooperate, at the Reinsurers expense, in any litigation or
other dispute resolution mechanism relating to such collection. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the Reinsurer shall be responsible for and has
hereby assumed the financial risk of any uncollected or uncollectible
Recoveries. To the extent that the Company recovers any Recoveries from any
third party attributable to the LBL Contracts, the Company shall promptly
transfer such amounts to the Reinsurer, together with any pertinent
information that the Company may have relating thereto.

 



 

Section 4.3 _Security Interest_.

 



 

(a) The Parties intend the Companys assignment pursuant to the first sentence
of _Section 4.2(a)_ to be a present assignment of all of the Companys
rights, title and interest and not an assignment as collateral. However, to
the extent that such assignment is not recognized as a present assignment, is
not valid or is recharacterized as a pledge rather than a lawful conveyance to
the Reinsurer, the Company does hereby grant, bargain, sell, convey, assign
and otherwise pledge to the Reinsurer all of the Companys now owned and
hereafter acquired or arising, whether governed by Article 9 of the UCC or
other law, wherever located, and all proceeds and products thereof, right,
title and interest, if any (legal, equitable or otherwise) to all Recoveries
(and any lockbox or account set up for the receipt of the Recoveries after the
Inception Date) (" _Recoveries Collateral_ ") to secure all of the Companys
obligations to remit the Recoveries to the Reinsurer.

 



 

(b) Upon the failure of the Company to remit Recoveries to the Reinsurer,
which failure remains uncured ten (10) days after written notice thereof is
received by the

 



      
 

 



 

Company, the Reinsurer shall have, in addition to all other rights under this
Agreement or under Applicable Law, the following rights:

 



 

(i) the right to exercise all rights and remedies granted a secured party
under the Uniform Commercial Code, as said code has been enacted in the State
of Nebraska, the State of Illinois, or any other applicable jurisdiction (the
" _UCC_ "), as though all the Recoveries Collateral constituted property
subject to a security interest under Article 9 thereof; and

 



 

(ii) the right to intercept and retain monies and property in any lockbox or
account set up for the receipt of Recoveries.

 



 

(c) This _Section 4.3_ is being included in this Agreement to ensure that, if
an insolvency or other court determines that, notwithstanding the provisions
of this Agreement, including _Section 4.2(a)_, and the express intent of the
Parties in entering into this Agreement, the Company retained ownership of or
any rights in the Recoveries Collateral, the Reinsurers rights to the
Recoveries Collateral are protected with a first priority, perfected security
interest, and it is the intent of the Parties that this _Section 4.3_ be
interpreted as such.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained herein shall be construed to support the conclusion that
the Company will retain any ownership of or any rights in the Recoveries
Collateral after the Inception Date or to support the conclusion that the
Reinsurer does not acquire full ownership thereof as of the Inception Date.

 



 

(e) The Company shall execute and deliver and the Reinsurer is authorized to
execute and deliver any and all financing statements reasonably requested by
the Reinsurer to the extent that it may appear appropriate to the Reinsurer to
file such financing statements in order to perfect the Reinsurers title under
Article 9 of the UCC to any and all Recoveries Collateral and the Company
shall do such further acts and things as the Reinsurer may reasonably request
in order that the security interest granted hereunder may be maintained as a
first perfected security interest. All costs and expenses incurred in
connection with obtaining a first priority, perfected security interest shall
be borne by the Reinsurer.

 



 

Section 4.4 _Bank Accounts_. During the term of this Agreement, the Reinsurer
may open and maintain one or more accounts with banking institutions with
respect to the LBL Contracts (the " _Bank Accounts_ "). The Reinsurer shall
have the exclusive authority over the Bank Accounts including, without
limitation, the exclusive authority to (a) open the Bank Accounts in the name
of the Company, (b) designate the authorized signatories on the Bank Accounts,
(c) issue drafts on and make deposits in the Bank Accounts in the name of the
Company, (d) make withdrawals from the Bank Accounts and (e) enter into
agreements with respect to the Bank Accounts on behalf of the Company;
_provided_ , that in no event shall the Company be responsible for any fees,
overdraft charges or other payments, liabilities or obligations with respect
to any such Bank Accounts or be obligated to provide funding for the Bank
Accounts. The Company shall do all things necessary at the Reinsurers expense
to (x) enable and authorize the Reinsurer to use the Companys existing
lockboxes with respect to the LBL Contracts and (y) to enable the Reinsurer to
open and maintain the Bank Accounts

 



       
 

 



 

including, without limitation, executing and delivering such depository
resolutions and other documents as may be requested from time to time by the
banking institutions. The Company agrees that without the Reinsurers prior
written consent it shall not make any changes to the authorized signatories on
the Bank Accounts nor attempt to withdraw any funds therefrom.

 



 

Section 4.5 _Reports and Settlements_.

 



 

(a) The Reinsurer shall provide to the Company periodic accounting and other
reports with respect to the LBL Contracts as specified in the Administrative
Services Agreement. Other than with respect to the Post-Underwriting
Conversion Policies, settlement with respect to amounts owed hereunder by the
Reinsurer to the Company and by the Company to the Reinsurer shall be
performed through the direct payment by the Reinsurer of Reinsured Risks and
direct receipt by the Reinsurer of Recoveries on an ongoing basis in its
capacity as Administrator under the Administrative Services Agreement.

 



 

(i) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all amounts due to be
paid to the Company and the Reinsurer under this Agreement with regards to the
Post-Underwriting Period Conversion Policies shall be determined on a net
basis, as of the last day of each Monthly Accounting Period. Each net amount
due with respect to each Monthly Accounting Period (the " _Monthly Settlement_
") shall be paid by the Reinsurer to the Company, or by the Reinsurer to the
Company, as applicable, no later than fifteen (15) days after delivery of the
Monthly Report.

 



 

(ii) Within fifteen (15) days of the end of each Monthly Accounting Period,
the Company shall supply the Reinsurer with a report in the form of Schedule C
which shall set forth the Recoveries with respect to the Post-Underwriting
Period Conversion Policies collected during the prior Monthly Accounting
Period and the General Account Liabilities paid during the prior Monthly
Accounting Period (the " _Monthly Report_ ").

 



 

(iii) If the actual data required for the Monthly Report cannot be supplied
with the appropriate report, the Company shall produce best estimates and
shall provide amended reports based on actual data no more than ten (10) days
after the actual data becomes available and the Parties will settle any
additional amounts due within five (5) days thereafter.

 



 

ARTICLE V _ 
DURATION AND TERMINATION_

 



 

Section 5.1 _Duration_. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement
shall be unlimited in duration.

 



 

Section 5.2 _Reinsurer s Liability_. The Reinsurers liability with respect
to the Reinsured Risks will terminate on the earliest of: (i) the date the
Companys liability with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to the Reinsured Risks is terminated and all amounts due the Company
from the Reinsurer with respect thereto have been paid by or on behalf of the
Reinsurer to or on behalf of the Company; and (ii) the date this Agreement is
terminated upon the written agreement of the Parties.

 



 

ARTICLE VI _ 
INSOLVENCY_

 



 

Section 6.1 _Payments_. In the event of the insolvency of the Company, all
reinsurance made, ceded, renewed or otherwise becoming effective under this
Agreement shall be payable by the Reinsurer directly to the contractholders of
the contracts reinsured, without diminution because of the insolvency of the
Company. It is agreed and understood, however, that (i) in the event of the
insolvency of the Company, the domiciliary liquidator, receiver or legal
successor of the insolvent Company shall give written notice of the pendency
of a claim against the insolvent Company on the LBL Contract within a
reasonable time after such claim is filed in the insolvency proceeding and
(ii) during the pendency of such claim the Reinsurer may investigate such
claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is
to be adjudicated, any defenses which it may deem available to the Company or
its liquidator, receiver or statutory successor.

 



 

Section 6.2 _Expenses_. It is further understood that any expense thus
incurred by the Reinsurer pursuant to _Section 6.1_may be filed as a claim
against the insolvent Company as part of the expense of liquidation, to the
extent of a proportionate share of the benefit which may accrue to the Company
solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the Reinsurer. Where two or
more assuming reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in
interest elect to interpose a defense to such claim, the expense shall be
apportioned subject to court approval, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement as though such expense had been incurred by the Company.

 



 

ARTICLE VII _ 
LICENSES; SECURITY_

 



 

Section 7.1 _Licenses_. At all times during the term of this Agreement, the
Reinsurer shall (i) hold and maintain all licenses and authorizations required
so that the Company may receive Reserve Credit or (ii) otherwise take such
steps as may be required to provide the Company with Reserve Credit.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Security_. During the term of this Agreement until such time as a
Trust Account is no longer required pursuant to _Section 7.7_, as security
for the payment of amounts due the Company under this Agreement, the
Reinsurer, as grantor, shall establish and maintain the Trust Account with a

Agreement, on the Inception Date, the Reinsurer shall deposit into the Trust
Account Eligible Assets with a Reinsurer Statutory Book Value (including
investment income due and accrued) equal to the Reinsurers good faith
estimate of the Required Balance as of the Inception Date . All transfers to
and withdrawals from the Trust Account shall be in accordance with and subject
to the requirements set forth in the Trust Agreement; _provided_ that, in
addition to the requirements set

investments that are permitted to be carried by the Company as admitted assets
determined in accordance with Nebraska SAP; _provided_ , that (i) each such
asset that is a security is issued by an institution that is not the
Reinsurer, the Company or an Affiliate of either Party, and (ii) such assets
comply with the requirements specified by the investment guidelines as set
forth on _Exhibit C_ of the Trust Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that
such assets shall be managed in accordance with commercially reasonable
investment guidelines agreed by the Company and the Reinsurer upon the
occurrence of a Change in Control (the assets pursuant to this sentence being
the " _Eligible Assets_ ").

 



 

Section 7.5 _Deposit of Assets_. Prior to depositing assets in the Trust
Account, the Reinsurer will execute assignments, endorsements, medallion
guaranteed stock powers, and medallion guaranteed bond powers in blank
(collectively " _Transfer Instruments_ ") as appropriate in each instance for

obligations or any other assets requiring assignment, conveyance or transfer,
in order that the Company, or the trustee upon the direction of the Company,
may whenever necessary negotiate the assets, attach the endorsements and
record the assignments without any additional consent or signature from the

evidencing the due authority of the signatories to execute the Transfer
Instruments on behalf of the Reinsurer.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Adjustment of Security and Withdrawals_. Subject to _Section
7.7_, the amount of security provided by the Reinsurer shall be adjusted

Required Balance as of the end of such Monthly Accounting Period (such amounts
to be calculated by the Reinsurer and a report thereof to be furnished to the
Company no later than ten (10) Business Days following the end of such Monthly
Accounting Period) as follows:

 



 

(a) If the aggregate Value of the Eligible Assets held in the Trust Account at
the end of any Monthly Accounting Period is less than the Required Balance,
calculated based on the most recent Monthly Accounting Period report, the
Reinsurer shall, no later than ten (10) Business Days following delivery of
the relevant report, transfer additional Eligible Assets to the Trust Account
so that the aggregate Value of the Eligible Assets held in the Trust Account
is not less than the Required Balance as of the end of such Monthly Accounting
Period.

 



 

(b) If the aggregate Value of the Eligible Assets in the Trust Account at the
end of any Monthly Accounting Period exceeds 100% of the Required Balance,
calculated based on the most recent Monthly Accounting Period report, then the
Reinsurer shall have the right to withdraw the excess from the Trust Account
in accordance with the terms of the Trust

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that after a Change in Control the 100%
amount above shall become 102%.

 



 

(c) The report required to be delivered by the Reinsurer as described in this
_Section 7.6_ shall include a listing of each asset in the Trust Account and

accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement to pay to the Company amounts
that are (i) due to the Company from the Reinsurer under this Agreement, but
not yet recovered from the Reinsurer, (ii) not the subject of a good faith
dispute and (iii) not paid by the Reinsurer within ten (10) Business Days
after the Reinsurer has received written notice of such failure to pay from
the Company.

permitted under the terms of the Trust Agreement shall be held in trust by the
Company and maintained in a segregated account, separate and apart from the
assets of the Company for the benefit of the Reinsurer and promptly returned
to the Reinsurer, plus interest, compounded monthly, at One-Month LIBOR plus
150 basis points from and including the date of withdrawal to but excluding
the date on which such excess withdrawal is returned to the Trust Account.

contrary herein, if, prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control, the
Required Balance as set forth in the report required to be delivered by the
Reinsurer as described in _Section 7.6_ with respect to any Monthly
Accounting Period is less than or equal to $250 million (the " _Minimum
Balance_ "), then (i) the Reinsurer and the Company shall promptly deliver a
joint written notice to the Trustee to terminate the Trust Account, and (ii)
the Reinsurer shall have no further obligation to maintain any assets in the
Trust Account pursuant to this Agreement or the Trust Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.8 Certain Reports.

 



 

(a) The Reinsurer shall provide written notice of the occurrence of any Change
in Control or Captive Change of Control within two (2) Business Days after its
occurrence. In addition, the Reinsurer shall cooperate fully with the Company
and promptly respond to the Companys reasonable inquiries from time to time
concerning the determination of whether a Change in Control or a Captive
Change of Control has occurred.

 



 

Section 7.9 _Vermont Captive_. To the extent the Vermont Captive proposes to
reinsure any business in addition to the business currently reinsured under

ARTICLE VIII _ 
DAC TAXES_

 



 

Section 8.1 _DAC Taxes_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Company and Reinsurer acknowledges that it is subject to
taxation under Subchapter L of the Code and hereby makes the election
contemplated in section 1.848-2(g)(8) of the Treasury regulations under the
Code with respect to this Agreement. Each of the Company and Reinsurer (i)
agrees that such election shall be effective for the taxable year of each
Party that includes the Inception Date and for all subsequent years during
which this Agreement remains in effect and (ii) warrants that it will take no
action to revoke the election.

 



 

(b) Pursuant to section 1.848-2(g)(8) of the Treasury regulations, each Party
hereby agrees (i) to attach a schedule to its federal income tax return for
its first taxable year ending on or after the Inception Date that identifies
this Agreement as a reinsurance agreement for which the joint election under
section 1.848-2(g)(8) has been made, (ii) that the Party with net positive
consideration (as defined in the Treasury regulations) for this Agreement for
each taxable year will capitalize specified policy acquisition expenses with
respect to the Agreement without regard to the general deductions limitation
of section 848(c)(1) of the Code, and (iii) to exchange information pertaining
to the amount of net consideration (as defined in the Treasury regulations)
under this Agreement to ensure consistency.

 



 

(c) By March 1 of each year, the Reinsurer shall submit a schedule to the
Company of its calculation of the net consideration for the preceding calendar
year. If the Company agrees with the calculation, the Company shall use this
information in determining its net consideration for such prior year. If the
Company disagrees with the calculation, the Parties shall act in good faith to
resolve any differences so that consistency is maintained for tax return
reporting purposes.

 



 

(d) By May 15 of each calendar year, the Reinsurer shall reimburse (or be
reimbursed by, as the facts may provide) the Company for DAC taxes incurred
for the previous tax year with respect to the policies after the Inception
Date. The DAC tax reimbursement shall be computed by multiplying the DAC tax
factor by the sum of (i) 100% of premiums received during the previous tax
year on the Reinsured Contracts after the Inception Date subject to section
848 of the Code and (ii) the Companys net consideration (as defined in the
Treasury regulations) for the previous tax year under this Agreement for
periods beginning on or after the Inception Date. The "DAC tax factor" shall
be 0.215% for annuity contracts, 0.252% for group life contracts and 0.946%
for life insurance contracts, non-cancellable AandH contracts and guaranteed
renewable AandH contracts. The Company and the Reinsurer mutually agree to
prospectively adjust the DAC tax factor to reflect any changes in the federal
income tax rate applicable to the Company or the Reinsurer, as the case may
be, or changes to section 848 of the Code or the related Treasury regulations.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE IX _

courier to the other Party (hereinafter referred to as the "respondent")
together with its notice of intention to arbitrate. Unless a single arbitrator
is agreed upon within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of the notice of
intention to arbitrate, the respondent shall, within thirty (30) days after
receiving such notice, also appoint an arbitrator and notify the claimant
thereof in a like manner. Before instituting a hearing, the two arbitrators so
appointed shall choose an impartial umpire. If, within thirty (30) days after
they are both appointed, the arbitrators fail to agree upon the appointment of
an umpire, the umpire shall be selected pursuant to the rules of ARIAS. The
arbitrators shall be present or former executives or officers of life
insurance or reinsurance companies. The arbitrators and umpire shall be
disinterested individuals and not be under the control of either Party, and
shall have no financial interest in the outcome of the arbitration.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Failure of a Party to Appoint Arbitrator_. If the respondent
fails to appoint an arbitrator within thirty (30) days after receiving a
notice of intention to arbitrate, such arbitrator shall be selected pursuant

Parties may mutually agree.

arbitration shall have the obligation to produce those documents and as
witnesses to the arbitration those of its employees as any other participating
party reasonably requests providing always that the same witnesses and
documents be obtainable and relevant to the issues before the arbitration and
not be unduly burdensome or excessive. The parties may mutually agree as to
pre-hearing discovery prior to the arbitration hearing and in the absence of
agreement, upon the request of any party, pre-hearing discovery may be
conducted as the panel shall determine in its sole discretion to be in the
interest of fairness, full disclosure, and a prompt hearing, decision and
award by the panel. The panel shall be the final judge of the procedures of
the panel, the conduct of the arbitration of the rules of evidence, the rules
of privilege and production and of

 



      
 

 



 

excessiveness and relevancy of any witnesses and documents upon the petition
of any participating party.

 



 

Section 9.7 _Arbitration Award_. The arbitration panel shall render its
decision within sixty (60) days after termination of the proceeding unless the
parties consent to an extension, which decision shall be in writing, stating
the reason therefor. The decision of the majority of the panel shall be final
and binding on the parties to the proceeding except to the extent otherwise
provided in the Federal Arbitration Act. Judgment upon the award may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction pursuant to the Federal Arbitration
Act.

Section 11.5 _Governing Law and Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement and any dispute arising hereunder shall be governed by, and

the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof. While the parties contemplate that all disputes hereunder
will be decided pursuant to Article IX hereof, the parties submit to the
jurisdiction of any court of the United States or any state court, which in
either case is located in the City of New York (each, a "New York Court") with
respect to any legal proceedings to enforce an arbitral award issued in
accordance with Article IX. In any such action, suit or other proceeding, each
of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to
assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise any claim that it is not
subject to the jurisdiction of any such New York Court, that such action, suit
or other proceeding is not subject to the jurisdiction of any such New York
Court, that such action, suit or other proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum or that the venue of such action, suit or other proceeding
is improper; provided, that nothing set forth in this sentence shall prohibit
any of the parties hereto from removing any matter from one New York Court to
another New York Court. Each of the parties hereto also agrees that any final
and unappealable judgment against a party hereto in connection with any
action, suit or other proceeding will be conclusive and binding on such party
and that such award or judgment may be enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction, either within or outside of the United States. A certified or
exemplified copy of such award or judgment will be conclusive evidence of the
fact and amount of such award or judgment. Any process or other paper to be
served in connection with any action or proceeding under this Agreement shall,
if delivered or sent in accordance with Section 11.2 of this Agreement,
constitute good, proper and sufficient service thereof.

REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OR ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,

interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise (other than by operation of law in a

successors and assigns. For the avoidance of doubt, the Reinsurer shall be
permitted to retrocede any of the Reinsured Risks at its sole discretion.

Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under Applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under
any Applicable Law in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability will not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed
and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision or portion of any provision had never been contained herein.

 



 

(b) This Agreement may be amended or a provision hereof waived only by a
written instrument signed by each of the Reinsurer and the Company.

 



 

(c) No delay on the part of any Party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on
the part of any Party of any right, power or privilege, nor any single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.

 



 

Section 11.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and
delivered to the other Party. Each Party may deliver its signed counterpart of
this Agreement to the other Party by means of electronic mail or any other
electronic medium utilizing image scan technology, and such delivery will have

other in all reasonable respects in order to accomplish the objectives of this
Agreement including making

Business determined in accordance with Article V of the General Account

shall deliver to the Company a statement with a copy of the Recapture Balance

shall transfer to the Company the assets comprising the Recapture

(b) All account balances (both assets and liabilities) related to the
Recaptured Business and ceded by the Company to the Reinsurer under the
Subject Reinsurance Agreements (other than (i) those that are reflected in Net
Statutory General Account Reserves and (ii) the liability for interest
maintenance reserve related to the Recaptured Business) will be transferred
from the Reinsurer to the Company (the " _Recapture Balances_ ") as of the
Effective Time. The Recapture Balances shall be determined in accordance with
the Accounting Principles and shall be derived from the Recapture Balance

uncollected premiums and agents balances, deferred premiums, policyholder
dividends, premiums received in advance, commissions due and accrued,

received by the Reinsurer on behalf of the Company after the Effective Time.
Upon recapture of these Recapture Balances, a net reinsurance recoverable or a
reinsurance payable will be recorded by the Company in respect of the
Recapture Balances. As part of the Recapture Statement, the Reinsurer shall
deliver to the Company a statement showing the Reinsurers calculations of the
Recapture Balances. The net reinsurance recoverable or reinsurance payable
will be settled by the Reinsurer or the Company, as applicable, in cash or
fair value of assets within twenty (20) Business Days after delivery of the
Recapture Statement (but in any event prior to the Closing Date).

Agreement with respect to the Assets in the Trust Account. Any amounts
deposited in the Income Account shall be paid to the Grantor or its designee,
or credited to an account of the Grantor or its designee, in accordance with

(a) Whenever Eligible Assets (including, but not limited to, warrants,
options, conversions, subscriptions, takeovers, other forms of capital
reorganizations, redemptions, tenders, options to tender or non-mandatory puts

action or alternative courses of action by the Grantor, the Grantor or its
Investment Manager shall be responsible for making any decisions relating
thereto and for instructing the Trustee to act. In order for the Trustee to
act, it must receive the Grantors or Investment Managers written
instructions at the Trustees offices, addressed as the Trustee may from time
to time request, by the reasonable deadline specified by the Trustee from time

any action relating to or to exercise any rights conferred by such assets.

 



 

(b) The Trustee shall notify the Grantor or its Investment Manager by
Electronic Methods of such rights or discretionary actions or of the date or
dates by when such rights must be exercised or such action must be taken
provided that the Trustee has received from the issuer or one of the
nationally recognized bond or corporate action services to which the Trustee
subscribes, notice of such rights or discretionary corporate action or of the
date or dates such rights must be exercised or such action must be taken. If
the Trustee shall not actually receive such notice, the Trustee shall have no
liability for failing to so notify the Grantor or its Investment Manager.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) With respect to all Eligible Assets, however registered, the voting rights
are to be exercised by the Grantor or its Investment Manager. The Trustees
only duty shall be to deliver by Electronic Methods to the Grantor or its
Investment Manager any documents (including proxy statements, annual reports
and signed proxies) relating to the exercise of such voting rights.

 



 

 **Section 7** ** _Additional Rights and Duties of the Trustee._**

 



 

(a) The Trustee shall furnish to the Grantor and the Beneficiary a statement
of all Assets in the Trust Account upon the inception of the Trust Account and

Monthly Statement shall list (i) all of the Assets with CUSIP number (if
applicable) and other specific identifying information with respect to any
Asset that has no CUSIP number, and (ii) any transfers of Assets to or from
the Trust Account during such calendar month, including all purchases and
sales of Assets during such calendar month. The Monthly Statement shall be
given as soon as practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) Business
Days after the end of the calendar month most recently concluded. At the
Grantors or the Beneficiarys request, the Trustee may provide daily
reporting to the Beneficiary, the Grantor or its designated Investment Manager
by granting access to the Trustees automated data system affording on-line
access to trust accounts information. The Monthly Statement under this Section
7(a) shall be deemed given by the Trustee to the Grantor and the Beneficiary
to the extent that the Grantor and the Beneficiary, as the case may be, had
previously requested and had been given access to the Trustees automated data
system affording on-line access to trust accounts information and such
information is posted by the Trustee on such system within such ten (10)
Business Day period.

 



 

(b) Before accepting any asset for deposit to the Trust Account, the Trustee
shall determine that such asset is in such form that the Beneficiary whenever
necessary may, or the Trustee upon written direction by the Beneficiary may,
negotiate such asset without consent or signature from the Grantor or any
other Person.

 



 

(c) The Trustee shall notify the Grantor and the Beneficiary by Electronic
Methods, within ten (10) days, of any deposits to or withdrawals from the
Trust Account.

States, except that the Trustee may hold any Asset that is in book-entry form
as of the date it is credited to the Trust Account (a " _Book-Entry Asset_ ")
through the book-entry account maintained by the Trustee with the related
depository for such Book-Entry Asset (such a depository being referred to
herein as a " _Depository_ "). A Book-Entry Asset may be held in the name of a
nominee maintained by the Depository.

 



 

(e) The Trustee shall accept and may open all mail directed to the Grantor or
the Beneficiary in care of the Trustee. The Trustee shall promptly forward all
mail to the addressee whether or not opened.

the Trust Account. Upon the reasonable written request of the Grantor or the

their respective agents, employees or independent auditors to examine, audit,
excerpt, transcribe and copy, at their own expense,

 



      
 

 



 

during the Trustees normal business hours any books, documents, papers and
records relating to the Trust Account or the Assets.

 



 

(g) The Trustee is authorized to rely conclusively upon all Communications
(including, without limitation, Investment Orders, Withdrawal Notices and
Termination Notices) given by officers, agents and/or employees named in
letters and incumbency certificates furnished to the Trustee from time to time

fact acting under written authority furnished to the Trustee by the Grantor,
the Investment Manager or the Beneficiary (collectively " _Instructions_ "),
including Instructions given by letter, facsimile transmission or Electronic
Methods, if the Trustee reasonably believes such Instructions to be genuine
and to have been signed, sent or presented by the proper party or parties. The
Trustee shall not incur any liability to anyone resulting from actions taken
by the Trustee in reliance in good faith without fraud, negligence or willful
misconduct on such Instructions. The Trustee shall not incur any liability in
executing Instructions prior to receipt by it of (i) notice of the revocation
of the written authority of the individual(s) named therein or (ii) notice
from any officer, agent or employee of the Grantor, the Investment Manager or
the Beneficiary named in a letter or incumbency certificate delivered
hereunder prior to receipt by it of a more current certificate.

 



 

(h) The duties and obligations of the Trustee shall only be such as are
specifically set forth in this Agreement, as it may from time to time be
amended in accordance with the terms hereof, and no implied duties or
obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Trustee. The Trustee
shall be liable only for its own fraud, negligence, willful misconduct or lack
of good faith. Subject to the preceding sentence, the Trustee is not liable
for acting in accordance with or relying upon any instruction, notice, demand,
certificate or document contemplated by and given in accordance with this
Agreement from the Grantor or the Beneficiary or for any consequential,
punitive or special damages.

 



 

(i) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Trustee to take any
action which, in the Trustees reasonable judgment, would result in any
violation of this Agreement or any provision of law. The Trustee shall
exercise the same due care that is expected of a fiduciary with the
responsibility for the safeguarding of the Assets in the Trust Account and for
compliance with all provisions of this Agreement, whether or not the Assets
are in the Trustees possession.

 



 

(j) The Trustee may confer with a nationally recognized outside law firm of
its selection in relation to matters arising under this Agreement and shall,
upon demand, be indemnified and held harmless by the Grantor from and against
any and all losses incurred by the Trustee hereunder for any actions taken,
omitted or suffered by it in connection with this Agreement or under any
transaction contemplated hereby without any lack of good faith, fraud,
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Trustee and in accordance
with the written advice or opinion of such counsel. The written opinion of
such law firm shall be full and complete authority and protection for the
Trustee with respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by it in good
faith and in accordance with such written advice or opinion of such law firm.

 



       
 

 



 

(k) The parties hereto acknowledge that nothing in this Agreement shall
obligate the Trustee to extend credit, grant financial accommodation or
otherwise advance moneys for the purpose of making any payments or part
thereof or otherwise carrying out any Instructions, including, without
limitation, any Investment Order.

 



 

(l) Except as set forth in _Section 7(d)_, the Trustee shall not be
responsible for the existence, genuineness or value of any of the Assets or
for the validity, perfection, priority or enforceability of any liens or
security interest in any of the Assets, whether impaired by operation of law
or by reason of any action or omission to act on its part hereunder, except to
the extent such action or omission constitutes fraud, negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct on the part of the Trustee, for the validity of title to
the Assets, for insuring the Assets or for the payment of taxes, charges,
assessments or liens upon the Assets.

 



 

(m) The Trustee shall not incur any liability for not performing any act or
fulfilling any duty, obligation or responsibility hereunder by reason of any
occurrence beyond the control of Trustee, including, but not limited to, any
act or provision of any present or future law or regulation or Governmental
Authority, any act of God or war or terrorism, accidents, labor disputes, loss
or malfunction of utilities or computer software or hardware, or the
unavailability of the Federal Reserve Bank wire or other wire or communication
facility, so long as the Trustee maintains and updates from time to time
business continuation and disaster recovery procedures that it determines meet
the standards of the banking industry.

 



 

(n) The Trustee is authorized to disclose information concerning the Trust
Account and Assets to its Affiliates and other providers of services as may be
necessary in connection with the administration of the Assets or performance
of this Agreement (including, by way of example and not by way of limitation,
attorneys and accountants for the Trustee).

 



 

(o) The Trustee shall in no way be responsible for determining the amount of
Assets required to be deposited, or to monitor whether or not the Assets at
any time are or continue to be Eligible Assets or have been invested in
accordance with the Investment Guidelines or to determine independently the
prices or market value of any Assets. The Trustee shall be under no obligation
to determine whether or not any instructions given by the Grantor and
Beneficiary are contrary to any provision of law. It is understood and agreed
that the Trustees duties are solely those set forth herein and that the
Trustee shall have no duty to take any other action unless specifically agreed
to by the Trustee in writing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Trustee shall not have any duty to advise, manage, supervise or
make recommendations with respect to the purchase, retention or sale of any
Assets as to which a default in the payment of principal or interest has
occurred or to be responsible for the consequences of insolvency or the legal
inability of any broker, dealer, bank or other agent employed by the Grantor
or Trustee with respect to the Assets provided that, in cases where the
Trustee has employed such an agent, the Trustee shall have selected and
retained such agent with reasonable care. The Trustee shall have no liability
for any release of Assets made by it at the direction of the Beneficiary or
the Grantor provided in accordance with the terms hereof.

this Agreement, a fee computed at its usual and customary rates for services
of this sort, as determined in good faith by the Trustee from time to time and
communicated to and agreed to in writing by the Grantor. The Grantor shall
also pay or reimburse the Trustee for all of the Trustees expenses and
disbursements in connection with its duties under this Agreement (including

disbursement as may arise from the Trustees fraud, negligence, willful
misconduct or lack of good faith.

 



 

(b) The Grantor hereby indemnifies the Trustee for, and holds it harmless
against, any losses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
incurred or paid (other than as a result of the Trustees fraud, negligence,
willful misconduct or lack of good faith), arising out of or in connection
with the performance of its duties and obligations under this Agreement,
including without limitation any loss arising out of or in connection with the
status of the Trustee in connection with the performance of its duties and any
nominee as the holder of record of any or all of the Assets. In addition to
and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Beneficiary hereby indemnifies the
Trustee for, and holds it harmless against, any losses (including attorneys
fees and expenses) incurred or paid (other than as a result of the Trustees
fraud, negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith), arising out of
or in connection with actions taken by the Trustee pursuant to any written
instruction from the Beneficiary to perform any such action. The Grantor and
the Beneficiary each hereby acknowledge that the foregoing indemnities shall
survive the resignation of the Trustee or removal of the Trustee or the
termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) No Assets shall be withdrawn from the Trust Account or used in any manner
for paying compensation to, or reimbursement or indemnification of, the
Trustee.

obligations under this Agreement with respect to such party to the extent
resulting from the Trustees fraud, negligence, willful misconduct or lack of
good faith. The Trustee hereby acknowledges that the foregoing indemnities
shall survive the resignation of the Trustee or removal of the Trustee or the
termination of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 9** ** _Resignation of the Trustee._**

 



 

(a) The Trustee may resign at any time by giving not less than ninety (90)
days written notice thereof to the Beneficiary and to the Grantor. The
Grantor and the Beneficiary jointly also may remove the Trustee at any time,
without assigning any reason therefor, on fifteen (15) days prior written

paragraph (b) of this _Section 9_.

 



 

(b) Upon receipt of the Trustees notice of resignation or giving notice to

 **ARTICLE II 
SCHEDULED SERVICES**

 



 

2.1 _Scheduled Services_.

 



 

2.1.1 _Services_.

 



 

(a) Seller, directly or through its Affiliates, and their respective
employees, agents or subcontractors permitted in accordance with _Section 2.7_
herein (" _Service Providers_ "), shall provide or cause to be provided to
Buyer and certain of its Affiliates all services set forth on _Schedules
1(a)-(f)_ from and after the date of this Agreement for the duration set forth
in _Schedules 1(a)-(f)_. Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Service
Fees as set forth in _Section 4.1_ to Seller for providing the services set
forth on _Schedules 1(a)-(f)_ , or causing such services to be provided.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The services set forth on _Schedules 1(a)-(f)_ are hereinafter referred to
as the " _Scheduled Services_ ", and the duration for which each Scheduled
Service is to be provided as set forth in _Schedules 1(a)-(f)_ is referred to
as the " _Service Term_ ". _Schedules 1(a)-(f)_ set forth, for each Scheduled
Service, the Providing Party and the Receiving Party and, where appropriate,
the Affiliate or permitted third party designated in writing by the Receiving
Party to receive such Service (the " _Designated Recipient_ "). The Receiving
Party, in its sole discretion, may change any Affiliate or third party
designated as the Designated Recipient for a Scheduled Service from the Person
currently so designated in _Schedules 1(a)-(f)_ , _provided that_ any
additional cost to the Providing Party caused by or arising from such change
shall be borne by the Receiving Party.

 



 

2.1.2 _Direction of Employees_. The Providing Party shall be solely
responsible for all salary, employment, payroll and other benefits of and
liabilities owed to, and compliance with immigration and visa laws and
requirements in respect of, its personnel assigned to perform the Scheduled
Services. In performing their respective duties hereunder, all personnel
engaged in providing Scheduled Services shall be under the direction, control
and supervision of the Providing Party; and the Providing Party shall have the
sole right to exercise all authority with respect to the employment (including
termination of employment), assignment and compensation of such personnel. The
employees of the Providing Party engaged in providing Scheduled Services to
the Receiving Party shall not, by virtue thereof, become employees of the
Receiving Party.

 



 

2.1.3 _Cooperation_. Seller shall and shall cause each Providing Party to, and
Buyer shall and shall cause each Receiving Party to, use its reasonable best
efforts to: (a) cooperate with the other Party with respect to the provision
or receipt of such Scheduled Service and (b) enable the Providing Party to
provide and the Receiving Party or Designated Recipient to receive such
Scheduled Service in accordance with this Agreement. The failure of a Party to
comply with this provision with respect to a Scheduled Service in a way that
materially prevents or materially hinders the other Party from providing or
receiving such Scheduled Service at all or in accordance with the service
standard in _Section 2.2.1_ shall result in the following: (i) with respect to
payment of Fees under _Section 4.1.1(a)(i)-(iii)_ , (x) if such non-
cooperation by Seller or a Providing Party occurs during the first twelve (12)
month period of this Agreement, the Appraisal Fees, as set forth in _Section
4.1.1(a)(i),_ for the _Schedule 1(a)(i), (a)(ii), or (c)-(f)_ on which such
Scheduled Service appears shall be extended by the period of such non-
cooperation, and (y) if such non-cooperation by Seller or a Providing Party
occurs during the six (6) months thereafter (including as extended by _Section
2.1.3(i)(x)_ ), the fees set forth in _Section 4.1.1(a)(ii)_ shall be extended
by the period of such non-cooperation _provided_ that notwithstanding
_Sections 2.1.3(i)(x)_ and _2.1.3(i)(y)_ , the fees set forth in _Section
4.1.1(a)(iv)_ shall apply after the end of the twenty-fourth (24th) calendar
month from the date hereof; or (ii) if the Buyer or a Receiving Party is
failing to cooperate, Buyer shall pay Seller for any incremental fees, costs
or expenses arising from such non-cooperation. A Party must provide notice to
the other Party if it believes such other Party is failing to cooperate. Upon
receipt of such notice, such Party shall have thirty (30) days to cure such
failure to cooperate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a failure to cooperate on
the part of such Party shall not excuse performance of the respective
Scheduled Service. Such cooperation shall include assisting Buyer in
benchmarking the costs to be paid by the Receiving Party in the administrative
services agreement to be entered into between third

 



      
 

 



 

party administrators and the Receiving Party; _provided_ that Seller shall not
be obligated to breach any existing obligation to a third party administrator.

 



 

2.1.4 _Permits_. Seller represents and covenants that, as of the date hereof,
it and any of its Affiliates through which Seller intends to provide a
Scheduled Service has all material Permits necessary to provide the Scheduled
Services. Seller shall be responsible for keeping in force all Permits
necessary to provide the Scheduled Services, with any associated costs borne
by Seller and Buyer equally. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Seller shall not be obligated to provide any Scheduled Service if
the provision of such Scheduled Service would violate any Applicable Law or
rules of professional ethics. If Seller is prevented from providing, or
causing to be provided, any Scheduled Service because providing such Scheduled
Service or causing it to be provided would violate any Applicable Law or rules
of professional ethics, Seller shall (i) notify Buyer of such prevention as
soon as practicable, and (ii) provide or cause to be provided alternative
equivalent services, and Seller and Buyer shall pay equally any additional
costs, fees and expenses associated with such alternative services. Except
with respect to such alternative services provided during the first twelve
(12) months in which Scheduled Services are provided pursuant to this
Agreement, if costs in connection with the provision of alternative equivalent
services are reduced, the fees charged to Buyer will be reduced
commensurately. If Seller changes the manner in which it provides the
Scheduled Services such that it or its Affiliates must obtain any additional
Permits necessary to provide the Scheduled Services for which it is
responsible, other than in response to a change in Applicable Law, Seller
shall be responsible for obtaining such necessary Permits, at Sellers cost.

 



 

2.1.5 _Omitted Services_. If at any time after the Closing Date, Buyer becomes
aware of any service that is not a Scheduled Service (i) that had been
provided by a Service Provider, in whole or in part, to the Business in the
period of time during the twelve (12) months prior to the execution of the SPA
(the " _Signing Date_ "), (unless such service was terminated in the normal
course of business prior to the Closing Date) and (ii) that is (A) reasonably
necessary to conduct the Business or (B) reasonably necessary for Buyer to
satisfy its obligations under the SPA, the Administrative Services Agreement
or any of the other Transaction Agreements (each, an " _Omitted Service_ "),
then Buyer shall provide written notice thereof to Sellers Transition
Manager: (w) within 100 days after the date hereof, or (x) for an Omitted
Service that has historically been provided on a quarterly basis, promptly
after discovering the need for such Omitted Service and in no event later than
thirty (30) days from the end of the first full quarterly period after the
date hereof to which such Omitted Service is related, or (y) for an Omitted
Service that has historically been provided on an annual basis, promptly after
discovering the need for such Omitted Service and in no event later than
ninety (90) days from the end of the first relevant annual period after the
date hereof to which such Omitted Service is related. If such notice is
provided, (a) Seller shall cause the Omitted Service to begin to be provided
to Buyer and/or its Affiliates within a commercially reasonable period of time
under the circumstances after receipt of such notice, (b) such Omitted Service
shall be deemed to be a Scheduled Service, (c) _Schedules 1(a)-(f)_ shall be
deemed amended to include such Omitted Service, and (d) such Omitted Service
shall be provided in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. With respect to an Omitted Service qualifying under _Section
2.1.5(i)_ that becomes a Scheduled Service included in _Schedules 1(a)-(f)_ ,
Buyer shall pay an amount commensurate with the Service Fees set forth in
_Schedules 1(a)-(f)_ for similar Scheduled Services, to the extent such
similar Scheduled Services exist, and _Schedules 1(a)-(f)_ shall be

 



      
 

 



 

amended accordingly to include such amount. For an Omitted Service qualifying
under _Section 2.1.5(ii)_ that becomes a Scheduled Service included in
_Schedules 1(a)-(f)_ , or an Omitted Service for which there is no similar
Scheduled Service in _Schedules 1(a)-(f)_ , Seller shall determine in good
faith the amounts payable by Buyer based on the Service Fees set forth in
_Schedules 1(a)-(f)_ and provide notice of such amounts to Buyer _; provided_
, that upon such notice, Buyer shall in its sole discretion have the right to
accept or reject the provision of such service. In the event that the
Receiving Party requests that the Providing Party provide additional services
that are not Omitted Services (" _Additional Services_ "), the Providing Party
shall consider such request in good faith and if it decides it is willing to
provide or to cause one of its Affiliates to provide such Additional Services,
in the Providing Partys reasonable discretion, the Parties shall negotiate in
good faith to agree on the terms upon which the Providing Party would provide
such Additional Services and the amounts payable by Buyer for such Additional
Services. In the event that the Providing Party agrees to provide any such
Additional Service, the Parties will enter into an amendment to this Agreement
amending _Schedules 1(a)-(f)_ to reflect such Additional Service, and such
Additional Service shall be deemed to be part of this Agreement and the
Scheduled Services from and after the date of such amendment. The foregoing
obligations of Seller with respect to an Omitted Service or an Additional
Service shall not apply with respect to any services that are excluded
services set forth in _Schedule 1(h)_ hereto.

 



 

2.1.6 _Finance and Actuarial Corporate Support_. In the performance of the
Scheduled Services listed in Schedule 1(c)(ii), at the Receiving Partys
reasonable request, Providing Party shall provide compilations of data and
information in a reporting format consistent with that used by Providing Party
for its own business to enable the Receiving Party to direct the Business;
_provided_ that Providing Party shall have no obligation to provide reports
that include any judgment, analysis, or data relating to or reflecting policy
data not owned by the Receiving Party, or that reflect any other data or
processes proprietary to the Providing Party. The Parties agree that the
Providing Party will not have any responsibility for the direction of the
Business.

 



 

2.2 _Standard of Services_.

 



 

2.2.1 _General Standard_. The Providing Party shall perform each Scheduled
Service for which it is responsible or to cause such Scheduled Services to be
performed for the Receiving Party or its Designated Recipient at a standard
that is no lower than the service standards set forth on _Schedule 1(g)_ ,
and, if no standard for a Scheduled Service is set forth on _Schedule 1(g)_ ,
at a standard no lower than the standard to which such Scheduled Service was
provided in the twelve (12) months immediately prior to the Signing Date. The
target milestones and timelines relating to the Migration services in
_Schedule 1(b)_ shall be estimated in good faith and documented in the
Migration plan, and such Migration services shall be provided in a workmanlike
manner. The Receiving Party understands and agrees that the Providing Party is
not in the business of providing transition services to third parties, and
under no circumstances shall the Providing Party be held accountable to a
higher standard of care than that set forth herein. The description of
services in _Schedules 1(a)-(f)_ shall not alter, amend or supplement the
service standard set forth in this Section. If the Receiving Party provides
the Providing Party with written notice of the occurrence of any Significant
Service Shortfall (as defined below) in the Scheduled Services, the Providing
Party shall rectify such Significant Service Shortfall promptly, _provided_
that any Dispute as to whether a Significant Service Shortfall

 



      
 

 



 

occurred shall be resolved in accordance with _Section 2.5_ hereto, and the
Providing Party shall take corrective action in good faith in connection with
such alleged Significant Service Shortfall until such Dispute is resolved;
_provided further_ that the Providing Partys obligations under this Agreement
shall be relieved to the extent, and for the duration of, any Force Majeure
Event as set forth in _ARTICLE VI_ ; _provided further_ , that any costs, fees
and expenses associated and in connection with remedying such Significant
Service Shortfall shall be borne by the Party responsible for causing such
shortfall. For purposes of this _Section 2.2.1_ , a " _Significant Service
Shortfall_ " shall occur if a service level standard set forth in _Schedule
1(g_ ) is not met for two (2) consecutive months.

 



 

2.2.2 _Disaster Recovery Program_. For the duration of the Term, the Providing
Party shall, and shall cause its relevant Affiliates to, maintain backup,
business continuation and disaster recovery plans consistent with past
practices as they existed during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding
the Signing Date.

 



 

2.3 _Limitation on Services_.

 



 

2.3.1 Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Sellers obligation to cause Service
Providers to provide the Scheduled Services to Buyer and/or its Affiliates
under the standards of performance set forth in _Section 2.2.1_ of this
Agreement or _Schedule 1(g)_ shall be subject to and shall be limited to the
extent to which Service Providers ability to provide Scheduled Services to
Buyer or its Affiliates is adversely affected by Buyers failure to perform
its obligations hereunder, under the SPA or any other Transaction Agreement,
or its Affiliates failure to perform hereunder, under the SPA or any other
Transaction Agreement.

 



 

2.3.2 Seller shall have no obligation to cause any Scheduled Services to be
provided to any Person other than Buyer, its Affiliates, Buyers Designated
Recipient or its Affiliates.

 



 

2.3.3 Seller shall cause to be provided the Scheduled Services in accordance
herewith solely to allow Buyer and its Affiliates to conduct the Business in
substantially the same manner as conducted during the twelve (12) months prior
to the Signing Date (inclusive of any organic growth in volume and scope of
such businesses). Except as otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties, Seller
shall not be obligated to cause to be provided Scheduled Services to Buyer and
its Affiliates in support of the businesses of Buyer and its Affiliates other
than the Business.

 



 

2.3.4 Seller shall not be obligated to cause any Service Provider to provide
any Scheduled Service (or portion thereof) to the extent performance of such
Scheduled Service (or portion thereof) would require such Service Provider to
violate or breach (i) any Applicable Law or any Order; (ii) the terms and
conditions of a TSA Material Contract applicable to the administration of the
Business, unless to not do so would not be in compliance with Applicable Law
or any Order; (iii) subject to Sellers obligations under _Section 2.9_ , any
executed written agreement in effect as of the Closing Date between such
Service Provider and a non-affiliated third party; (iv) such Service
Providers written policies and procedures generally applicable to its other
businesses or customers, including any changes made thereto, to the extent
such changes are made (A) after the Closing Date and (B)(I) to comply with
Applicable Law or any Order, or (II) to respond to a new legal or regulatory
issue or to respond to a reasonably plausible security

 



       
 

 



 

threat; or (v) the SPA or any other Transaction Agreement; _provided_ that,
for the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall continue to be obligated to cause
Service Providers to provide such Scheduled Services (or portion thereof) to
the extent that doing so would not result in any such violation or breach;
_provided_ further that to the extent that (i)-(v) herein apply Seller and
Buyer shall negotiate in good faith and agree upon a course of action to
provide alternative equivalent services with Seller and Buyer to share equally
any costs, fees or expenses associated with such alternative equivalent
services.

 



 

2.3.5 Subject to _Section 2.3_ , Seller and Buyer reserve the right to suggest
any changes to (i) the manner in which the Scheduled Services are provided or
received, (ii) the location from which the Scheduled Services are provided or
to which the Scheduled Services are received or (iii) the personnel involved
in the provision or receipt of the Scheduled Services. The Parties shall
negotiate such changes in good faith, with any incremental costs, fees or
expenses borne by the Party suggesting such change. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall not make a change under this _Section 2.3.5_ that
makes receipt of the Scheduled Services materially more expensive or the
Separation process materially more difficult or complicated unless such change
is also being implemented broadly across Sellers own business operations.

 



 

2.3.6 Except with respect to any Company Employee hired pursuant to the SPA,
if Buyer desires to hire or employ any other employee of Seller who provides
or supports any Scheduled Services prior to the date of discontinuation of all
Scheduled Services hereunder for which such employee has any duties or
obligations, the Parties shall discuss in good faith whether and to what
extent the hiring or employment of such employee will reduce Sellers
obligations hereunder with respect to such Scheduled Services; _provided_
that, even if such employee of Seller is hired by Buyer and was the sole
employee responsible for providing any Scheduled Service, Seller shall remain
obligated to provide such Scheduled Services if such employee is hired or
employed by Buyer or its Affiliates to perform a service that is not the same
as the Scheduled Service for which such employee was solely responsible for
providing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall continue to provide any
resources reasonably necessary for such a hired employee to perform his or her
duties and obligations during the Term of this Agreement and any extensions
thereof.

 



 

2.4 _Variances_. With respect to VUL Contracts administered pursuant to this
Agreement, Seller shall cause to be provided to Buyer and/or its Affiliates
(a) such daily reports as Seller and/or their Affiliates produced during the
nine (9) months prior to the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Date Period_ ")
summarizing (i) the discrepancies arising in the execution and recording of
investment transactions pursuant to the VUL Contracts, and (ii) during such
portion of the Term in which Seller provides Scheduled Services, gains or
losses to Buyer resulting from or arising out of the administration of the VUL
Contracts (including, without limitation, delayed legal interest or claim
interest from processing delays, unrecovered miscalculations of claim payment
amounts, and other errors in processing claims resulting in gains or losses to
Buyer) (collectively, the items summarized in (a)(i) and (a)(ii) are the "
_Variances_ "), and (b) such weekly and monthly reconciliation reports as
Seller and/or their Affiliates produce as of the Closing Date. For such
Variances, Seller shall, in accordance with their guidelines existing as of
the Closing Date, reconcile and credit or debit the applicable
Contractholders account. For so long as Seller is providing the Scheduled
Services during the Term, at the end of every six (6) month period during the
Term (each, a " _True-Up Period_ ") and once immediately following the

 



      
 

 



 

discontinuation of all of the Scheduled Services (the " _Final True-Up Period_
"), Seller shall aggregate the Monthly Net Variances over the months occurring
during the applicable True-Up Period or Final True-Up Period (such aggregate
being the " _True-Up Sum_ "). If the True-Up Sum for a True-Up Period or the
Final True-Up Period, as applicable, is negative, then Seller shall invoice
Buyer for such True-Up Sum and Buyer shall remit payment in accordance with
_ARTICLE IV_ ; provided, that such True Up Sum shall not exceed the "
_Variance Limit_ " (which shall be equal to the cumulative sum of Ten Thousand
Dollars ($10,000) per month times the number of months of such True-Up Period
or Final True-Up Period). If the True-Up Sum for a True-Up Period or the Final
True-Up Period, as applicable, is positive, then Seller shall remit such True-
Up Sum to Buyer. The " _Monthly Net Variance_ " shall be the aggregate amount
during a given month credited to Contractholders accounts or paid to
Contractholders to correct Variances (negative amounts), less any amounts
debited from Contractholders accounts or recovered from Contractholders
(including contractholders in connection with the correction of Variances
(positive amounts)), and less any amounts retained by Seller in connection
with a Variance and not required under Sellers Guidelines existing as of the
Closing Date or Applicable Law, to be paid or credited to Contractholders to
correct such Variance.

 



 

2.5 _Dispute Resolution_.

 



 

2.5.1 _Amicable Resolution_. The Parties mutually desire that friendly
collaboration will continue between them during the Term. Accordingly, they
will try to resolve in an amicable manner all disagreements and
misunderstandings connected with their respective rights and obligations under
this Agreement, including any amendments hereto. In furtherance thereof, in
the event of any dispute or disagreement (a " _Dispute_ ") between the Parties
in connection with this Agreement (including the standard of performance,
delay of performance or non-performance of obligations, or payment or non-
payment of Service Fees hereunder), then the Transition Managers shall attempt
to resolve the Dispute amicably. If the Transition Managers are unable to
resolve a Dispute in a timely manner, then either Transition Manager, by
written request to the other, may request that such Dispute be referred for
resolution to the president (or similar position) of the division implicated
by the matter for Seller and Buyer, which presidents will have fifteen (15)
days to resolve such Dispute. If the presidents of the relevant divisions for
each Party do not agree to a resolution of such Dispute within fifteen (15)
days after the reference of the matter to them, or if the Dispute is not
otherwise resolved in a friendly manner as set forth in this _Section 2.5.1_ ,
either Party involved in the Dispute may bring an action regarding such
Dispute as set forth in _Section 11.6_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 2.5.1_ , any amendment to the terms of this
Agreement may only be effected in accordance with _Section 11.7_.

 



 

2.5.2 _Non-Exclusive Remedy_. Nothing in this _Section 2.5_ will prevent
either Party from immediately seeking injunctive or interim relief (i) in the
event of any actual or threatened breach of any of the provisions of _ARTICLE
VIII_ , (ii) in the event that the Dispute relates to, or involves a claim of,
actual or threatened infringement or violation of intellectual property or
(iii) to the extent necessary for either Party to preserve any right. All such
actions for injunctive or interim relief shall be brought in a court of
competent jurisdiction in accordance with _Section 11.6_. Such remedy shall
not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for breach of this Agreement, and
further remedies may be pursued in accordance with _Section 2.5.1_.

 



      
 

 



 

2.5.3 _Commencement of Dispute Resolution Procedure_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party, but none of their respective
Affiliates, is entitled to commence a dispute resolution procedure under this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ , and each Party will cause its
respective Affiliates not to commence any dispute resolution procedure in
connection with this Agreement other than through such Party as provided in
this _Section 2.5.3_.

 



 

2.5.4 _Compensation_. With respect to any Scheduled Services provided as set
forth in _Schedules 1(a)-(f)_ , during the pendency of any Dispute, the
Receiving Party shall continue to make all payments due and owing under
_ARTICLE IV_ for such Scheduled Services and the Providing Party shall
continue to provide all such Scheduled Services in accordance with the service
standard set forth in _Section 2.2.1_ ; _provided_ that either Party may
recoup any payments or losses incurred during the pendency of a Dispute based
on the resolution of such Dispute. The Parties will proceed in good faith with
the Migration timeline identified in the Migration plan during pendency of any
Dispute concerning any Scheduled Service set forth in _Schedule 1(b)_.

 



 

2.6 _No Agency_. Each Party acknowledges that it has entered into this
Agreement for independent business reasons. The relationship of the Parties
hereunder is that of independent contractors and nothing contained herein
shall be deemed to create a joint venture, partnership or any other
relationship. Neither Party shall have any power or authority to negotiate or
conclude any agreement, or to make any representation or to give any
understanding on behalf of the other in any way whatsoever.

 



 

2.7 _Subcontracting_. The Providing Party may subcontract for the performance
of any Scheduled Service to: (a) any Person if the service to be subcontracted
is primarily a routine task or function; (b) an Affiliate of the Providing
Party; (c) any reinsurer or its Affiliates; (d) an existing subcontractor that
was providing such service to the Providing Party or the Receiving Party
immediately before the Closing Date; (e) any subcontractor to which Seller or
an Affiliate subcontracts the same or similar services for itself; and (f) any
other Person with the prior written consent of the Receiving Party, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, _provided_
that no such subcontracting shall relieve the Providing Party from any of its
obligations or liabilities hereunder, and the Providing Party shall remain
responsible for all obligations or liabilities of such subcontractor with
respect to the provision of such service or services as if provided by the
Providing Party. In the event that the Providing Party subcontracts for
performance of any Scheduled Service under _Section 2.7(a)_ , _(c)_ or _(e)_ ,
Seller shall pay any incremental fees to the subcontractor that are in excess
of the Fees set forth for that Scheduled Service in _Schedules 1(a)-(f)_ ;
_provided_ that if Seller subcontracts to any person under _Sections
2.7(a)-(e)_ after the date hereof, to the extent that such subcontracting
makes Separation more difficult or complicated, then Seller shall pay all
incremental costs, fees and expenses relating to Separation caused by such
subcontracting.

 



 

2.8 _Consents_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, if the provision of any Scheduled Service as contemplated by this
Agreement requires the consent, license or approval of any third party that
has not been obtained prior to the date hereof as contemplated by _Section
5.4(a)_ of the SPA, Seller shall continue to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such consent, license, or approval as promptly as possible
after the Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that under no circumstances shall the
performance of such Scheduled Service require the Providing Party or any of
its directors (or persons in similar positions), officers, employees or agents
to violate any Applicable Laws or breach any TSA Material Contract. Seller and
Buyer shall share equally all costs of obtaining such third party consents,
licenses or approvals necessary for the provision and receipt of the Scheduled
Services, including any payments that are required to any third party. If the
Providing Party reasonably believes that it is unable to provide such
Scheduled Service because of a failure to obtain necessary consents, licenses,
sublicenses or approvals, Providing Party shall promptly notify the Receiving
Party and the Parties shall negotiate in good faith and agree upon a course of
action to provide alternative equivalent services with Seller and Buyer to
share equally any costs, fees or expenses associated with such alternative
equivalent services.

 



 

2.9 _Transition Management_. Each Party shall appoint a transition manager
(each, a " _Transition Manager_ "). The Transition Managers shall have the
authority to represent the position of their respective Parties and to make
operational decisions regarding the Parties performance of this Agreement.
Each Transition Manager shall appoint or designate in a writing directed to
the other Transition Manager, a person or persons to act in his or her stead
on day-to-day matters within various functional areas when the Transition
Manager is unavailable. Subject to the right to delegate duties to others, the
Transition Managers shall serve as the primary contact point for the
respective principals with respect to the obligations of the Parties under
this Agreement. Each Transition Managers responsibilities shall include: (a)
conducting reviews of compliance with the service standard in _Section 2.2.1_
; (b) assuring compliance with this Agreement, including the schedules; (c)
mitigating and resolving technical and business issues; (d) managing the
service migration process; and (e) participating in the dispute resolution
process under _Section 2.5_. A Party may designate a replacement for its
Transition Manager by written notice to the other Party. Each Transition
Manager, and any successor, shall have an educational background, experience,
skills and other qualifications necessary to perform his or her assigned
duties. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to authorize either
Transition Manager to amend this Agreement in any way.

 



 

2.10 _Transition Plan_. Promptly after the date hereof, and in any event
within thirty (30) days hereafter, Seller and Buyer shall each appoint a
transition team to cooperate in good faith to develop a Migration plan for
separating the Company Business from the businesses of Seller and its
Affiliates (including the Company) that is not Company Business so as to
minimize the adverse impact of such Migration on each partys businesses. Such
Migration plan shall include a decision on whether to separate the
accounting/finance conversion from the administrative conversion, such that,
if included, Seller would continue providing Scheduled Services for
accounting/finance functions to December 31, 2014 but the administrative
conversion would occur earlier. Buyer shall bear any additional costs incurred
as a result of the decision to separate the accounting/finance conversion from
the administrative conversion. Seller and Buyer each agree to cooperate in the
performance of the activities set forth on _Schedule 1(b)_ and the Migration
of the performance of the Scheduled Services on _Schedules 1(a)_ and
_1(c)-(f)_ from a Service Provider to Buyer, an Affiliate or a third party of
Buyers choice, taking into account, in good faith, the need to minimize both
the cost of such Migration and disruption to the ongoing business activities
of each party.

 



      
 

 



 

2.11 _Records and Audit_. Each Party shall maintain true and correct records
of all receipts, invoices, reports and other documents relating to the
provision and receipt of Scheduled Services and the policyholder records of
the Business in accordance with their respective standard accounting practices
and procedures, consistently applied, and shall provide each other with
reasonable access to such records, subject to Applicable Law and the
obligations of _ARTICLE VIII_. Following the Term of this Agreement, Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to: (i) allow Buyer, upon reasonable
prior notice and during normal business hours, through its employees and
Representatives, the right, at Buyers expense and no more than once per
calendar year unless required by a governmental regulatory agency, to examine
any records produced during the Term of this Agreement relating to the
provision of Scheduled Services, or any other obligation under this Agreement,
or the policyholder records of the Business that are retained by Seller or any
of its Affiliates for any purpose, including the preparation or examination of
Buyers Tax Returns, regulatory filings, financial statements and the conduct
of any litigation or otherwise, or the conduct of any regulatory, customer or
other dispute resolution process, but only to the extent that such records of
Seller relate to the provision of Scheduled Services or the policyholder
records of the Business during the Term of this Agreement; (ii) maintain such
records in accordance with Sellers and its Affiliates record retention
policies; and (iii) provide reasonable access to employees concerning the
information in such records for any independent audit of Buyer; _provided_
that Seller and its Affiliates may destroy such records in their discretion in
compliance with their record retention policies after giving reasonable prior
written notice to Buyer of their intention to destroy such records; _provided
further_ that Seller and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to maintain
or retain any books and records to the extent that electronic or paper copies
or originals of such books and records are delivered to Buyer at or prior to
the end of the Term of this Agreement. The Providing Party shall provide, to
the Receiving Party and any independent auditors engaged by it, reasonable
access to staff and data relating to the Systems in which the Receiving
Partys data is held or processed.

 



 

2.12 _Ownership of Intellectual Property; License_. Any Intellectual Property
owned by a Party or its Affiliates and used after the date hereof in
connection with the provision or receipt of the Scheduled Services, as
applicable, shall remain the property of such Party or its Affiliates. Each
Party grants, and shall cause its Affiliates to grant, to the other Party and
its Affiliates a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide
license, during the term of this Agreement, to use the intellectual property
owned by such Party or its Affiliates only to the extent necessary for the
other Party and its Affiliates to provide or receive the Scheduled Services,
as applicable. Other than the license granted to a Party and its Affiliates
pursuant to the preceding sentence, the SPA, the Administrative Services
Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement, neither party nor its Affiliates
shall have any right, title or interest in the intellectual property owned by
the other party or its Affiliates.

 



 

2.13 _Separate Accounts_. Seller will perform, or has performed, services
required for Separate Account Separation (as defined in the ASA). Seller and
Buyer shall each equally bear the fees, costs and expenses associated with
Separate Account Separation (as defined in the ASA), to be invoiced in
accordance with _Section 4.2_ herein, with the total aggregate exposure of
each Party not to exceed fifty thousand U.S. dollars ($50,000).

 



 

2.14 _Notice to Policyholders_. Seller shall, on behalf of Buyer and at
Buyers cost, include an announcement of the Closing, in form and substance
agreed to by the Parties, Sellers

 



      
 

 



 

consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, with the first
correspondence sent to the policyholders of the Company after the Closing,
such announcement to be provided in the ordinary course of business or at such
time as otherwise required by Applicable Law.

 



 

2.15 _Link on Website_. After Migration is successfully completed and
continuing for one (1) year thereafter, Seller shall include and maintain a
link displayed on the appropriate Allstate website that directs users that
click or activate the link to the Company website. Such link shall be
accompanied by appropriate language notifying the Companys policyholders of
the Companys website, and instructing them to access such website directly in
the future.

 



 

2.16 _Customer Telephone Service_. After Migration is successfully completed
and continuing for one (1) year thereafter, each Party shall redirect any
inquiries it receives regarding the other Party to the appropriate telephone
number of such Party.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III 
TERM AND TRANSITION ASSISTANCE**

 



 

3.1 _Term_. The term (the " _Term_ ") of this Agreement shall commence as of
the date hereof and, subject as to any Scheduled Service to the earlier
expiration of the Service Term with respect thereto, shall continue until the
earliest of:

 



 

3.1.1 the date on which the last of the Scheduled Services under this
Agreement is terminated; or

 



 

3.1.2 the date on which this Agreement is terminated by mutual agreement of
the Parties.

 



 

3.2 _Extension and Termination_.

 



 

3.2.1 _Extension_. If Buyer reasonably believes that it will not be able to
complete its Migration of one or more Scheduled Services by the end of the
18th month under this Agreement, then upon written notice provided to Seller
at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of such 18-month period, Buyer
shall have the right to request and cause Seller to continue to provide such
Scheduled Services; _provided that_ , with respect to such extended Scheduled
Services, Buyer shall pay the applicable Fees set forth in _Section
4.1.1(a)(iii)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Buyer is unable to complete
Migration before the end of such 18-month period due primarily to the
Providing Party failing to fulfill its obligations in the performance of any
of the Scheduled Services, Buyer shall pay the applicable Fees set forth in
_Section 4.1.1.(a)(ii)_ until all such deficiencies are cured.

 



 

3.2.2 _Early Termination_. If the Receiving Party wishes to terminate a
Scheduled Service (or a portion thereof) before Buyer has completed its
Migration of all Scheduled Services, the Receiving Party shall notify the
Providing Party in writing of the proposed date on which such Scheduled
Service (or portion thereof) shall terminate (the " _Termination Date_ "), at
least 60 days prior to the Termination Date. The termination of a portion of a
service shall not change the Fees for such service. Effective on the
Termination Date, such Scheduled Service (or portion thereof) shall be
discontinued and thereafter, this Agreement shall be of no further force and
effect with respect to such Scheduled Service (or

 



      
 

 



 

portion thereof), except as to obligations accrued prior to the Termination
Date. Except with respect to obligations accrued prior to the Termination
Date, if all Scheduled Services on one of the _Schedules 1(a)(i), (a)(ii),
(b)(i), (b)(ii), (c)(i), (c)(ii) or (d)-(f)_ are terminated, any fees, costs
or expenses associated with such _Schedule 1(a)(i), (a)(ii), (b)(i), (b)(ii),
(c)(i), (c)(ii) or (d)-(f)_ , shall no longer be due or owing subsequent to
the date of termination of the last Scheduled Service on such Schedule.

 



 

3.3 _Return of Materials_. After a Scheduled Service is terminated, each Party
will return all materials in a form usable by the other Party, with the cost
to change the form of such materials, if applicable, to be borne by the
recipient, and property owned by the other Party and materials and property of
a proprietary nature involving a Party or its Affiliates relevant solely to
the provision or receipt of that Scheduled Service and no longer needed
regarding the performance of other Scheduled Services under this Agreement,
and will do so (and will cause its Affiliates to do so) within thirty (30)
days after the applicable termination.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV 
COMPENSATION AND PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR SCHEDULED SERVICES**

 



 

4.1 _Compensation for Scheduled Services_.

 



 

4.1.1 _Compensation Generally_. In accordance with the payment terms set forth
in _Section 4.2_ and subject to _Section 4.1.3_ , the Receiving Party agrees
timely to pay the Providing Party, on a monthly basis:

 



 

(a) an amount for the provision of Scheduled Services as follows
(collectively, the " _Fees_ "):

 



 

(i) during the first twelve (12) months of this Agreement, for Scheduled
Services on _Schedules 1(a) and 1(c)-(f)_ , the Appraisal Fees _;_

 



 

(ii) except with respect to Scheduled Services listed on _Schedule 1(c)(ii)_ ,
during the period starting at the end of the period in subsection (i) until
six (6) months thereafter, for Scheduled Services on _Schedules 1(a) and
1(c)-(f)_ ; the Cost of Service plus 10% of the Cost of Service; or

 



 

(iii) except with respect to Scheduled Services listed on _Schedule 1(c)(ii)_
, during the period starting at the end of the period in subsection (ii), for
Scheduled Services on _Schedules 1(a) and 1(c)-(f)_ ; the Cost of Service plus
20% of the Cost of Service; and

 



 

(iv) during the period starting at the end of the 24th month from the date
hereof, an additional $500,000 for every one (1) month period thereafter;

 



 

(v) for Scheduled Services on _Schedule 1(b)_ , the Fees set forth on Schedule
1(b);

 



      
 

 



 

(vi) for those Scheduled Services listed on _Schedule 1(c)_ (ii), fees for any
such services above the current stated estimates will be incremental and
charged on a time and materials basis at Sellers cost; and1

 



 

(b) any payments due to Seller pursuant to _Section 2.4_ (Variance).

 



 

Seller shall calculate the Cost of Service six (6) months in advance of the
periods specified in subsections (i)-(iii) of _Section 4.1.1.(a)_ and shall
promptly notify Buyer or Receiving Party of such calculation. If the Cost of
Service so calculated (x) is higher than the Base Fee, for purposes of
_Section 4.1.1.(a)_ the Cost of Service shall be capped at 110% of the Base
Fee; or (y) is lower than the Base Fee, for purposes of _Section 4.1.1.(a)_
the Cost of Service shall in no case be lower than 90% of the Base Fee.

 



 

4.1.2 _Out of Pocket Costs_. Except with respect to any Out of Pocket Costs
(as defined below) incurred in providing the Scheduled Services set forth in
_Schedules 1(a)-(f)_ of this Agreement, without limiting the foregoing and
subject to _Section 2.8_ and _Section 4.1.3_ , the Receiving Party agrees to
pay, or reimburse the Providing Party for its payment of, all Out of Pocket
Costs of the Providing Party. For purposes hereof, the term " _Out of Pocket
Costs_ " means all fees, costs or other expenses (including Sales and Service
Taxes) (except for any consent fees in the SPA or _Section 2.8_ herein)
payable by the Providing Party or its Affiliates to third parties that are not
Affiliates of the Providing Party in connection with the Scheduled Services
and Migration services provided by the Providing Party hereunder. The
Providing Party shall request in writing from the Receiving Party the approval
of all Out of Pocket Costs above fifty thousand U.S. dollars ($50,000); and
agrees not to accrue such Out of Pocket Costs until it receives written
approval from the Receiving Party. The Providing Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts: (a) not to incur Out of Pocket Costs that are inconsistent
with the type of Out of Pocket Costs incurred under past practices with the
applicable Scheduled Services without the prior written consent of the
Receiving Party; and (b) to minimize the amount of its Out of Pocket Costs,
consistent with providing the Scheduled Services in accordance with the
standard set forth in _Section 2.2.1_.

 



 

4.1.3 _Taxes_.

 



 

(a) The Receiving Party will pay and be liable for all sales, goods or
services, excise, privilege, value added (" _VAT_ "), lease, use, transfer,
consumption or similar gross receipts based taxes (the " _Sales and Service
Taxes_ ") imposed on Scheduled Services and Migration services provided by the
Providing Party. Such taxes will be payable by the Receiving Party to the
Providing Party in the manner set forth in _Section 4.2_ or as otherwise
mutually agreed in writing by the Parties and under the terms of the
Applicable Law which governs the relevant Sales and Service Tax.
Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if the Receiving Party is exempt from
liability for such taxes, the Receiving Party shall provide the Providing
Party with a certificate (or other proof), which certificate or proof is
reasonably acceptable to the Providing Party, evidencing an exemption from
liability for such Sales and Service Taxes. The Receiving Partys obligation
to pay Sales and Service Taxes under this

  1 **Note to Draft** : The detailed calculation of those Fees described in
Section 4.11(a)(vi) will be discussed prior to Closing and documented in
_Schedule 1(c)_.

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 4.1.3_ shall be subject to the receipt of a valid and customary
invoice or other document under the terms of Applicable Law for each Sales and
Service Tax. The Providing Party shall be responsible for any losses
(including any deficiency, interest and penalties) imposed as a result of a
failure timely to remit any Sales and Service Taxes to the applicable tax
authority to the extent the Receiving Party timely remits such Sales and
Service Taxes to the Providing Party or the Receiving Partys failure to do so
results from the Providing Partys failure timely to charge or provide notice
of such Sales and Service Taxes to the Receiving Party. The Receiving Party
shall be entitled to any refund on any Sales and Service Taxes paid in excess
of liability as determined at a later date. Each Party shall promptly notify
the other Party of any deficiency claim or similar notice by a taxing
authority with respect to Sales and Service Taxes payable under this
Agreement, and of any pending tax audit or other proceeding that could lead to
the imposition of Sales and Services Taxes payable under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Each Party shall pay and be responsible for its own personal property
taxes and taxes based on its own income, profits or assets. Payments for
Scheduled Services or other amounts under this Agreement shall be made net of
withholding taxes, _provided_ however that if the Providing Party believes
that a reduced rate of withholding applies or the Providing Party is exempt
from withholding, the Receiving Party shall only be required to apply such
reduced rate of withholding or not withhold if the Providing Party provides
the Receiving Party with evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Receiving
Party that a reduced rate of or no withholding is required. Satisfactory
evidence for this purpose may include rulings from, or other correspondence
with, tax authorities and tax opinions rendered by qualified persons
reasonably satisfactory to the Receiving Party, to the extent reasonably
requested by the Receiving Party. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each Party shall provide the other with executed originals of
Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 certifying that such Party is exempt from
U.S. federal backup withholding tax, and any updates with respect thereto as
appropriate. The Receiving Party shall promptly remit any amounts withheld to
the appropriate taxing authority and in the event that the Receiving Party
receives a refund of any amounts previously withheld from payments to the
Providing Party and remitted, the Receiving Party shall surrender such refund
to the Providing Party.

 



 

(c) With respect to each provision in this _Section 4.1.3_ , the Receiving
Party and the Providing Party shall reasonably cooperate with each other and
take any action to provide or make available any information reasonably
requested (and with a sufficient level of detail) in order to minimize any
Sales and Service Taxes payable with respect to the Scheduled Services and
Migration services.

 



 

4.2 _Payment Terms_.

 



 

4.2.1 Within fifteen (15) days following the end of any month during which
Service Providers provide Scheduled Services, Seller shall issue or cause to
be issued an invoice (and reasonably sufficient backup materials related
thereto) (" _TSA Monthly Invoice_ "), which shall set forth the amounts
payable by or on behalf of Buyer pursuant to _Section 4.1._ The Parties
acknowledge that there may be a reasonable lag in the submission of charges
from Service Providers and third parties (including vendors) relating to the
provision of Scheduled Services. With respect to any amounts payable by Buyer
hereunder that accrue or are incurred by a Service Provider during the Term
but that are not billed to such Service Provider or of which such

 



      
 

 



 

Service Provider does not become aware until after the Term, Seller shall set
forth or shall cause to be set forth such amounts payable in invoices (and
reasonably sufficient backup materials related thereto) sent to Buyer as soon
as practicable following the end of the Term (each a " _Post-Term Invoice_ ");
but in any event within sixty 60 days.

 



 

4.2.2 Subject to _Section 4.2.5_ , (a) Seller shall aggregate all costs
incurred by it between the Signing Date and Closing Date for work on the
Migration of the policies of the Recaptured Business to the third party
administrator selected by the Buyer, and shall provide monthly reports on the
Migration plan and achievement under it to Buyer in a form mutually agreed
upon by the Parties; (b) all such costs described in subsection (a) shall be
reported to Buyer within forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date and
Seller shall subsequently invoice Buyer for all such costs; and (c) Buyer also
agrees to reimburse Seller for those costs incurred after the Closing Date by
Seller for the Migration of the policies of the Recaptured Business.

 



 

4.2.3 Payment in full of the amounts so invoiced or noticed shall be made by
electronic transfer of immediately available funds or other method
satisfactory to the Providing Party, within thirty (30) days after the date of
receipt of the monthly invoice. Except with respect to any amount in Dispute
pursuant to _Section 2.5_ herein, any amount unpaid after the thirtieth (30th)
day following receipt by Buyer of such TSA Monthly Invoice or Post-Term
Invoice shall bear an overdue interest charge calculated at a rate of 1.5% per
month on a pro-rated basis on such overdue balance until paid. In no event
shall Buyer offset any amounts due hereunder.

 



 

4.2.4 Should a Party dispute any portion of the amount due from it on any
invoice or require any adjustment to an invoiced amount, then such Party shall
notify the other Party in writing of the nature and basis of the Dispute or
adjustment as soon as reasonably possible using, if necessary, the dispute
resolution procedures set forth in _Section 2.5_. The Parties shall use their
reasonable best efforts to resolve any such Dispute prior to the payment due
date. All amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid
and payable in U.S. dollars.

 



 

4.2.5 To the extent that, after the Signing Date, Seller has (i) negotiated
and entered into agreements relating to the administration by se2 of the
annuity contracts included in the Business, or (ii) taken any other actions
that are reasonably necessary to transition the administration of such annuity
contracts to se2, the Parties agree that Seller shall bear all costs and
expenses relating to such transition; _provided_ , that if Buyer causes the
Company to request additional or different services from se2 in connection
therewith that result in increased costs or expenses, Buyer shall reimburse
Seller for such increased costs and expenses. To the extent Buyer causes the
Company to implement changes to the services provided by se2 that reduce the
costs or expenses associated therewith, Seller shall be entitled to retain
such cost or expense savings in excess of such amount. For the avoidance of
doubt, to the extent there is any conflict between _Schedule 1(b)(ii)_ and
this _Section 4.2.5_ , _Schedule 1(b)(ii)_ shall control.

 



       
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE V 
INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

5.1 _Indemnification by Seller_. Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless
Buyer and each of its Affiliates (each, an " _Buyer Indemnified Person_ "),
from any and all Indemnifiable Losses to the extent relating to or arising out
of Third Party Claims relating to, resulting from or arising out of: (a) any
fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct by or on behalf of Seller or any
other Service Providers in providing any of the Scheduled Services that Seller
or any other Service Provider is obligated to provide hereunder; (b) any
material breach by Seller or any other Service Provider of any of its
obligations under this Agreement or (c) any actual or alleged infringement of
any third partys intellectual property rights as a result of receiving
Scheduled Services herein; _provided_ with respect to (c) that such Scheduled
Services are being provided in substantially the same manner as provided to
the Business by Seller in the twelve (12) months prior to the Signing Date,
unless altered at the sole discretion of Seller.

 



 

5.2 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller
and each of its Affiliates (each, a " _Seller Indemnified Person_ ") from any
and all Indemnifiable Losses to the extent relating to or arising out of Third
Party Claims relating to, resulting from or arising out of: (i) any material
breach by Buyer of any of its obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any
Scheduled Service that is altered, at the request of Buyer or Receiving Party,
from the manner in which Seller provided such service to the Business in the
twelve (12) months prior to the Signing Date.

 



 

5.3 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) If any Indemnitee receives notice of assertion or commencement of any
Third Party Claim against such Indemnitee in respect of which an Indemnitor
may be obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the
Indemnitee shall give such Indemnitor reasonably prompt written notice (but in
no event later than thirty (30) days after becoming aware) thereof and such
notice shall include a reasonable description of the claim and any documents
relating to the claim and an estimate of the Indemnifiable Loss and shall
reference the specific sections of this Agreement that form the basis of such
claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnitee in
notifying any Indemnitor shall relieve the Indemnitor from any obligation
hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnitor is actually
prejudiced by such delay. Thereafter, the Indemnitee shall deliver to the
Indemnitor, within five calendar days after the Indemnitees receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnitee relating to the Third Party Claim.

 



 

(b) The Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel selected by the Indemnitor. Should the Indemnitor so elect to assume
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall not as long as it
conducts such defense be liable to the Indemnitee for legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense
thereof. If the Indemnitor assumes such defense, the Indemnitee shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnitor, it being
understood that the Indemnitor shall control such defense. The Indemnitor
shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by
the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnitee for any period during which the Indemnitor has not assumed the
defense thereof (other than during any period in which the Indemnitee shall
have not yet given notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above). If the
Indemnitor chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, the Parties shall
cooperate in the defense thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the Indemnitors request) the provision to the Indemnitor of records
and information that are relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not
the Indemnitor shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnitee shall not admit any liability with respect to, or pay, settle,
compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnitors prior
written consent. If the Indemnitor has assumed the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnitor may only pay, settle, compromise or discharge a Third
Party Claim with the Indemnitees prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_
, that the Indemnitor may pay, settle, compromise or discharge such a Third
Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnitee if such settlement
(i) includes a complete and unconditional release of the Indemnitee from all
liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (ii) does not subject the
Indemnitee to any injunctive relief or other equitable remedy and (iii) does
not include a statement or admission of fault, culpability or failure to act
by or on behalf of the Indemnitee. If the Indemnitor submits to the Indemnitee
a bona fide settlement offer that satisfies the requirements set forth in the
proviso of the immediately preceding sentence and the Indemnitee refuses to
consent to such settlement, then thereafter the Indemnitors liability to the
Indemnitee with respect to such Third Party Claim shall not exceed the
Indemnitors portion of the settlement amount included in such settlement
offer, and the Indemnitee shall either assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim or pay the Indemnitors attorneys fees and other out-of-pocket costs
incurred thereafter in continuing the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI 
FORCE MAJEURE**

 



 

If performance by either Party of any terms or provisions hereof shall be
delayed or prevented, in whole or in part, because of or related to compliance
with any Applicable Law, decree, request or order of any Governmental Entity,
or because of riots, war, public disturbance, fire, explosion, storm, flood,
acts of God, acts of terrorism, or for any other reason that is not within the
control of the such Party and that by the exercise of reasonable diligence
such Party is unable to prevent (each, a " _Force Majeure Event_ "), then (i)
such Party shall give written notice to the other Party, (ii) the Parties
shall promptly confer, in good faith, to agree upon equitable, reasonable
action to minimize the impact, on both Parties, of such conditions, and (iii)
such Party shall be excused from its obligations hereunder during the period
such Force Majeure Event continues, and no liability shall attach against it
on account thereof. Neither Party shall be excused from performance if it
fails to use reasonable diligence to remedy the situation and remove the cause
and effect of the Force Majeure Event.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII 
REMEDIES AND SURVIVAL**

 



 

7.1 _Financial Remedies Upon Material Breach_. In the event of material breach
of any provision of this Agreement by a Party, the non-defaulting Party shall
give the defaulting Party written notice thereof, and:

 



 

7.1.1 If such breach arises from the Receiving Partys non-payment of an
amount that is not in Dispute, the Receiving Party shall cure the breach
within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of written notice of such non-
payment. If the Receiving Party does not cure such breach prior to the end of
such ten (10) day period, then the Receiving Party shall pay the Providing
Party the undisputed amount plus an amount of interest equal to three percent
per annum above the "prime rate" as announced in the "Money Rates" section of
the then most recent edition of the Eastern Edition of _The Wall Street
Journal_ , which interest rate shall change as and when the "prime rate"
changes. The Parties agree that this rate of interest constitutes reasonable
liquidated damages and not an unenforceable penalty.

 



 

7.1.2 If such breach results or arises from the Providing Partys failure to
provide one or more of the Scheduled Services at the service standard provided
in _Section 2.2.1_ or any Schedule appended hereto, Seller shall provide or
shall cause to be provided alternative equivalent services and Seller shall
pay any additional costs, fees and expenses associated and in connection with
such alternative services. If such breach is for any other material failure to
perform in accordance with this Agreement, the defaulting Party shall cure
such breach within thirty (30) days of the date of such notice. The defaulting
Party shall remain liable for any damages relating to such breach, subject to
the limits set forth in _Section 7.3_.

 



 

7.2 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent
jurisdiction, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at
law or in equity. The parties hereby waive, in any action for specific
performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and the posting of any
bond or other security in connection therewith.

 



 

7.3 _Limitation of Liability_. Except with respect to each Partys obligations
under _ARTICLE V_ (Indemnification) and _ARTICLE VIII_ (Confidentiality), the
maximum liability of either Party (including its Affiliates) hereunder shall
not exceed two times the total amount received by Seller in the performance of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the Parties,
on behalf of themselves and all other Indemnitees, waive any claim to any
punitive or consequential damages against each other; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not apply in respect to any indemnification claim asserted by
Buyer pursuant to _Section 5.1_ or by Seller pursuant to _Section 5.2_ to the
extent that punitive or consequential damages are awarded to a third party
against either Party (including its Affiliates), as the case may be, by a
court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a final and non-appealable
judgment

 



      
 

 



 

7.4 _Survival Upon Expiration or Termination_. The provisions of _Sections
2.5_ , 2 _.10_ , _2.11_ , _2.15_ , _2.16,_ and _3.3_ , and _ARTICLE I_ ,
_ARTICLE IV_ , _ARTICLE V_ , _ARTICLE VII_ , _ARTICLE VIII_ , _ARTICLE IX_ ,
_ARTICLE X_ , and _ARTICLE XI_ shall survive the termination or expiration of
this Agreement unless otherwise agreed to in writing by both Parties.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII 
CONFIDENTIALITY**

 



 

8.1 _Confidential Information_. Each Party covenants that it will (a) accord
the Confidential Information (as defined below) of the other Party the same
degree of confidential treatment that it accords its similar proprietary and
confidential information but in no event less than a reasonable degree of
care, (b) not use such Confidential Information for any purpose other than
those stated in this Agreement and (c) not disclose such Confidential
Information to any Person unless disclosure to such Person is made in the
ordinary course of such Partys conduct of its business and is subject to
protections comparable to those such Party would apply in connection with a
comparable disclosure of its own Confidential Information. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, a party may disclose Confidential
Information of the other Party, without liability for such disclosure, to the
extent the disclosing party demonstrates that such disclosure is (i) required
to be made pursuant to Applicable Law, (ii) required to be made to a court or
other tribunal in connection with the enforcement of such Partys rights under
this Agreement or to contest claims between the Parties, (iii) made to such
Partys service providers or Affiliates or, with respect to client information
and client account information or records, the applicable current or then-
existing client, (iv) with respect to Intellectual Property, made to such
Partys clients or prospective clients in connection with marketing activities
or servicing of client accounts, in each case for clauses (iii) and (iv),
subject to a confidentiality agreement that includes protections no less
restrictive than those set forth herein, or (v) approved by the prior written
consent of the other Party. Each Party will promptly notify the other Party if
it receives a subpoena or otherwise becomes aware of events that may legally
require it to disclose Confidential Information of the other Party, and will
cooperate with the other Party (at the other Partys expense) to obtain an
order quashing or otherwise modifying the scope of such subpoena or legal
requirement, in an effort to prevent the disclosure of such Confidential
Information. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Confidential Information_ "
means all confidential or proprietary information and documentation of either
Party made available to the other Party under this Agreement that is either
identified in writing as confidential or which the receiving Party recognized
or should reasonably have recognized at the time of disclosure as being of a
confidential nature.

 



 

8.2 _Unauthorized Acts_. Each Party shall (a) notify the other Party promptly
of any unauthorized possession, use, or knowledge of any Confidential
Information by any Person that shall become known to it, any attempt by any
person to gain possession of Confidential Information without authorization or

claim arising from or related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In any such action, suit or other proceeding, each of the parties
hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to assert by way

jurisdiction of any such New York Court, that

 



      
 

 



 

such action, suit or other proceeding is not subject to the jurisdiction of
any such New York Court, that such action, suit or other proceeding is brought
in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of such action, suit or other
proceeding is improper; _provided_ that nothing set forth in this sentence
shall prohibit any of the parties hereto from removing any matter from one New
York Court to another New York Court. Each of the Parties also agrees that any

constitute good, proper and sufficient service thereof.

11.7.1 Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under Applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under
any Applicable Law in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability will not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed
and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision or portion of any provision had never been contained herein.

be amended or a provision hereof waived only by a written instrument signed by
each of Seller and Buyer.
