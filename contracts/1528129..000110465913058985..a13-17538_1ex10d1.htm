_Section 13.1(a)_ and the payments made by the owing Party as provided in
_Section 13.1(a)_, and (2) upon final resolution of any Title Disputed
Matters and any Environmental Disputed Matters, in accordance with _ARTICLE_
4 and _Article 5_, respectively.

 



 

2.3 _Allocation of the Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) On or prior to the Execution Date and solely for the purposes of _ARTICLE_
4 and _Article 5_, Buyers and Sellers have agreed upon an allocation of the
Purchase Price among (1) the Leases as set forth on **_Exhibit A_**, (2) the
Wells as set forth on **_Exhibit B_**, (3) the Assets owned by Laredo Gas
Services and (4) the Assets not allocated pursuant to (1)-(3) above as such
amounts are listed on **_Exhibit B_** (collectively, the " ** _Allocated
Values_** ").

 



 

(b) Sellers may (but are not obligated to) prepare an allocation of the
Purchase Price on a schedule (the " ** _Proposed Section 1060 Allocation
Schedule_**") for purposes of, and in accordance with, Section 1060 of the
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, within 30 days after the
Final Settlement Date. Within 60 days after delivery of such Proposed Section
1060 Allocation Schedule, if so prepared by Sellers in accordance with the
preceding sentence, Buyers and Sellers shall reasonably endeavor to agree to a
final

 



      
 

 



 

allocation schedule to be used for income Tax reporting purposes (the " **
_Final Section 1060 Allocation Schedule_**"); _provided that_ if the Parties
are unable to reach agreement within such 60-day period, then, immediately
after the expiration of such period, either Party may invoke the Dispute
resolution provisions immediately below upon the delivery of written notice
thereof to the other Party and, within ten days thereafter, the Parties shall
mutually appoint an independent expert having the qualifications specified
below (the " ** _Property Valuation Expert_** "), failing which the Parties
shall, within ten days after the expiration of such foregoing ten day period,
request that the AAA, acting through its offices in Houston, Texas, appoint
the Property Valuation Expert. The Property Valuation Expert shall be a
licensed petroleum engineer, having a minimum of ten years experience with
regard to the types of oil and assets involved in the Proposed Section 1060
Allocation Schedule Dispute, shall be without any conflicts of interest as to
the Parties, and shall not have been employed by or undertaken more than
$50,000 of work, in the aggregate, for any Party (including its Affiliates)
within the five year period preceding the submission of the Dispute. Within 15
days following the appointment of the Property Valuation Expert, Sellers shall
provide the Property Valuation Expert with a copy of this Agreement, and each
Party shall provide, both to the Property Valuation Expert and to each other,
a summary of its position with regard to the Proposed Section 1060 Allocation
Schedule in a written document of ten pages or less. The Parties shall
instruct the Property Valuation Expert that, within 30 days after receiving
the Parties respective submissions, the Property Valuation Expert shall
render a written decision, choosing only either Buyers position or Sellers
position with respect to each Disputed matter. Any decision rendered by the
Property Valuation Expert pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive and
binding on Sellers and Buyers, and will be enforceable against each Party in
any court having jurisdiction hereof, but is not reviewable by, or appealable
to, any court except in the event of fraud. The Parties shall each bear one-
half of the costs of the Property Valuation Expert and of the associated
Dispute resolution process and proceedings. In the case of such a Dispute
resolution process regarding Sellers Proposed Section 1060 Allocation
Schedule Dispute, Sellers will issue the Final Section 1060 Allocation
Schedule consistent with the Property Valuation Experts decision, within 30
days after receiving the Property Valuation Experts decision with respect
thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, the Property Valuation Expert will
function as an expert in accordance with the foregoing procedure, not as an
arbitrator. Sellers and Buyers shall file all Tax Returns (including Internal
Revenue Service Form 8594) consistent with any such Final Section 1060
Allocation Schedule. Sellers and Buyers shall take no position inconsistent
with such allocations on any applicable Tax Return in any audit by or
proceeding before any Governmental Entity related to Taxes, unless required by
Law or with the written consent of the other Party (not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) _provided, however_ , that nothing contained
herein shall prevent Buyers or Sellers from settling any proposed deficiency
or adjustment by any Governmental Entity based upon or arising out of the
allocation, and neither Buyers nor Sellers shall be required to litigate
before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental
Entity challenging such allocation. In the event that the allocation described
herein is disputed by any Governmental Entity, then the Party receiving notice
of the dispute shall promptly notify, consult with and obtain the consent (not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of the other Party
concerning resolution of the dispute. If either (i) Sellers fail to deliver to
Buyers a Proposed Section 1060 Allocation Schedule within 30 days after the
Final Settlement Date or (ii) a Final Section 1060 Allocation Schedule is not
agreed by the Parties (or otherwise determined by a Dispute resolution process

 



      
 

 



 

in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.3(b)_), then
each Party shall be responsible for its reporting requirements under Code
Section 1060 and any other provisions that may apply; _provided that_ the
Parties shall reasonably coordinate with each other regarding any such
filings, in order to avoid any material inconsistencies.

 



 

2.4 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted
according to this _Section 2.4_ without duplication. For purposes of
determining the amounts of the adjustments to the Purchase Price provided for
in this _Section 2.4_, the principles set forth in _Section 2.4(a)_ shall
apply.

 



 

(a) _Proration of Costs and Revenues_.

 



 

(1) Buyers shall be (A) entitled to (i) all production of Hydrocarbons from or
attributable to the Properties from and after the Effective Time (and all
products and proceeds attributable thereto), and (ii) excluding overhead
charges arising under applicable joint operating agreements, administrative
orders or other legal authority related to those Assets operated by Sellers
that are earned prior to Closing, all other income, proceeds, receipts and
credits earned with respect to the Assets from and after the Effective Time,
and (B) responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all
Property Expenses incurred from and after the Effective Time.

 



 

(2) Sellers shall be (A) entitled to (i) all production of Hydrocarbons from
or attributable to the Properties prior to the Effective Time (and all
products and proceeds attributable thereto), (ii) all other income, proceeds,
receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets prior to the Effective
Time, and (iii) all overhead charges arising under applicable joint operating
agreements, administrative orders or other legal authority related to the
Assets operated by any Seller that are earned prior to Closing, and (B)
responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all Property
Expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(3) " ** _Earned_** " and " ** _incurred_** ", as used in this Agreement shall
be interpreted in accordance with GAAP and Council of Petroleum Accountants
Society standards, except as otherwise specified herein.

 



 

(4) Sellers have caused the Hydrocarbons in the storage facilities located on,
or utilized in connection with, the Leases to be measured, gauged or strapped
as of the Effective Time. For purposes of allocating production (and proceeds
and accounts receivable with respect thereto) under this _Section 2.4_, (A)
liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be " ** _from or attributable to_** "
the Properties when they pass through the pipeline connecting into the storage
facilities into which they are run and (B) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be
deemed to be " ** _from or attributable to_** " the Properties when they pass
through the royalty measurement meters, delivery point sales meters or custody
transfer meters on the gathering lines or pipelines through which they are
transported (whichever meter is closest to the well). Sellers shall utilize
reasonable interpolative procedures, consistent with industry practice, to
arrive at an allocation of production when exact meter readings or gauging and
strapping data are not available.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Property Expenses_. The term " ** _Property Expenses_** " means all (1)
capital expenses attributable to the Assets in the ordinary course of
business, (2) Asset Taxes (as apportioned as of the Effective Time pursuant to
_ARTICLE_ 9), (3) operating expenses incurred in the ownership, development,
operation and production of the Assets in the ordinary course of business and,
where applicable, in accordance with any relevant joint operating agreement
(including lease rentals, if any), (4) overhead costs charged to the Assets
under the applicable joint operating agreement, administrative order or other
legal authority and (5) extension and renewal payments with respect to the
Leases.

 



 

(c) _Upward Adjustments_. To calculate the Preliminary Purchase Price and the
Final Purchase Price, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward, without
duplication, by the following:

 



 

(1) an amount equal to any proceeds received by Buyers (net of royalties,
overriding royalties, net profit interests and other similar burdens on or
measured by production) from the sale of any Hydrocarbons that were produced
from and saved, or attributable to, the Assets prior to the Effective Time;

 



 

(2) an amount equal to the cost of all additional Assets listed on **_Schedule
2.4(c)_ **and Leases acquired after the Effective Time;

 



 

(3) an amount equal to all Property Expenses and all royalties, overriding
royalties, net profit interests and similar burdens on or measured by
production, in each case, attributable to the Assets from and after the
Effective Time that were paid by any Seller;

 



 

(4) an amount equal to the value of all Hydrocarbons that were produced and
saved from, or attributable to, the Assets that are in storage or existing in
stock tanks, pipelines and/or plants (including inventory) as of the Effective
Time, such value to be based upon the applicable Contract price in effect as
of the Effective Time (or if there is no Contract price, then the market price
in effect as of the Effective Time in the field in which such Hydrocarbons
were produced), net of (A) all amounts payable as royalties, overriding
royalties, net profit interests and other similar burdens on or measured by
production and (B) all applicable severance Taxes;

 



 

(5) an amount equal to all prepaid expenses (including pre-paid bonuses,
rentals, cash calls and advances to Third Party operators for expenses not yet
incurred, prepaid Taxes, and scheduled payments) paid by any Seller and
attributable to the ownership or operation of the Assets from and after the
Effective Time;

 



 

(6) an amount equal to the Subject Transfer Taxes paid by any Seller with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

(7) with respect to those Assets operated by any Seller, an amount equal to
all overhead charges arising under applicable joint operating agreements,
administrative orders or other legal authority that are (A) attributable to
such Seller operated Assets and the period of time prior to Closing and (B)
which have been paid by Third Parties and received by any Buyer;

 



       
 

 



 

(8) with respect to natural gas, if the Net Imbalance is positive, an amount
equal to (A) the Net Imbalance, multiplied by (B) $2.55 per Mmbtu; and

 



 

(9) any other amount provided for in this Agreement or otherwise agreed to in
writing by Buyers and Sellers.

 



 

(d) _Downward Adjustments_. To calculate the Preliminary Purchase Price and
the Final Purchase Price, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward,
without duplication, by the following:

 



 

(1) subject to _Section 4.2(f)_, an amount equal to the Title Adjustment
Amount attributable to Title Defects for which Sellers have chosen the remedy
set forth in _Section 4.2(j)(1)_;

 



 

(2) subject to _Section 5.3(b)_, an amount equal to the Environmental
Adjustment Amount attributable to Environmental Defects, if any, for which
Sellers have chosen the remedy set forth in _Section 5.3(e)(1);_

 



 

(3) an amount equal to the Allocated Value (without duplication) of those
Assets not transferred at Closing in accordance with _Section 4.2(j)(2)_,
_Section 4.4(a)_, _Section 4.4(b)_ or _Section 5.3(e)(3)_;

 



 

(4) an amount equal to all proceeds received by Sellers (net of royalties,
overriding royalties, net profit interests and similar burdens on or measured
by production and Asset Taxes), from the sale of any Hydrocarbons produced and
saved from, or attributable to, the Assets from and after the Effective Time;

 



 

(5) an amount equal to the value of any Casualty Loss pursuant to _Section
8.3(b)_;

 



 

(6) with respect to natural gas, if the Net Imbalance is negative, an amount
equal to (i) the absolute value of the Net Imbalance, multiplied by (ii) $2.55
per Mmbtu;

 



 

(7) an amount equal to all Property Expenses and all royalties, overriding
royalties, net profit interests and similar burdens on or measured by
production, in each case, attributable to the Assets prior to the Effective
Time that were paid by Buyers;

 



 

(8) all funds held in suspense by Sellers with respect to the operation,
ownership, production and developments of the Assets, including those amounts
set forth in **_Schedule 6.19_** ; and

 



 

(9) any other amount provided in this Agreement or otherwise agreed to in
writing by Buyers and Sellers.

 



 

2.5 _Preliminary Settlement Statement_. On or before the day that is two
Business Days prior to Closing, Sellers shall deliver to Buyers a statement
(the " ** _Preliminary Settlement_**

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _Statement_** ") setting forth Sellers calculations of the adjustments to
the Purchase Price set forth in _Section 2.4_ (the Purchase Price, as so
adjusted " ** _Preliminary Purchase Price_** "), the resulting Preliminary
Purchase Price and the Closing Amount, in each case, prepared in good faith
using the best information reasonably available to Sellers at the Closing
Date, along with such data in Sellers possession as is reasonably necessary
to support such calculations. The Preliminary Settlement Statement also shall
set forth Sellers designated account for purposes of Buyers payment of the
Closing Amount. The Parties shall attempt to agree in writing upon the
Preliminary Purchase Price prior to Closing, and in the event the Parties
cannot agree upon the Preliminary Purchase Price prior to Closing, Sellers
calculation of the Preliminary Purchase Price and the Closing Amount as
reasonably calculated and as set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement
shall be used by the Parties for purposes of Closing.

BUYERS INSPECTION; DUE DILIGENCE REVIEW**

 



 

3.1 _Due Diligence_. Subject to the provisions of this _ARTICLE_ 3, from and
after the Execution Date up to the Defect Notice Date (the " ** _Due Diligence

3.2 _Access to Records_. For purposes of the Due Diligence Review, to the

Sellers located in Tulsa, Oklahoma during normal business hours. For the
avoidance of doubt, any and all such Records inspected and/or copied by Buyers
pursuant to this _Section 3.2_ remain subject to the provisions of _Section
8.2(c)_. Buyers shall not, during the Due Diligence Period, contact any of the
customers or suppliers of any Seller, or Working Interest co-owners of any

written notice to, and the written consent of, Sellers. In connection with any

rights and Environmental Assessments of the Assets with Sellers and any Third
Party operator of the Assets to reasonably minimize any inconvenience to or
interruption of the conduct of business by Sellers or any such Third Party
operator of the Assets.

 



 

(b) If Buyers or any of their Representatives prepare a written report with
respect to any Environmental Assessment, Buyers will furnish a copy thereof to
Sellers as soon as practicable following the receipt thereof by Buyers, and in
any event by the Defect Notice Date. The Parties shall maintain the
confidentiality of any Environmental Assessments conducted hereunder, and any
reports created with respect thereto, unless and only to the extent disclosure
of the same is required by a Governmental Entity; _provided that_ Buyers

OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, BUYERS HEREBY WAIVE, RELEASE AND AGREE TO
DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS SELLERS AND THE OTHER SELLER INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LOSSES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF OR

BUYERS OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES RELATED TO SUCH ACCESS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT
TO ANY ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT (BUT NOT INCLUDING LOSSES INCURRED BY BUYERS
AFTER CLOSING RELATING TO ANY CONDITION DISCOVERED AS A RESULT OF SUCH
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT), IN EACH CASE, EVEN IF SUCH LOSSES ARISE OUT OF OR
ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO, SOLELY OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT

CONTAINED IN _ARTICLE 6_ SELLERS MAKE NO, AND DISCLAIM ALL, WARRANTIES OR
REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND AS TO ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED BY BUYERS OR THEIR
REPRESENTATIVES PURSUANT TO THIS _ARTICLE_ 3 _,_ INCLUDING THE RECORDS AND

provided with delivery of a Title Defect Notice with respect to such defects;

 



       
 

 



 

(8) defects as a consequence of cessation of production, insufficient
production, or failure to conduct operations on any of the Properties held by
production, or lands pooled, communitized or unitized therewith, unless Buyers
provide affirmative evidence that reasonably substantiates the cessation of
production, insufficient production or failure to conduct operations, thereby
giving rise to a right to terminate the Lease in question, which evidence
shall be provided with delivery of a Title Defect Notice with respect to such
defects;

 



 

(9) defects or irregularities resulting from or related to probate proceedings
or lack thereof unless same result in a reduction of Net Revenue Interest or
an increase in the Working Interest without a proportionate increase in the
Net Revenue Interest of the affected asset) for such Lease or Well shown on
**_Exhibit B_**;

 



 

(10) defects arising from prior oil and gas leases relating to the Lands that
are terminated, expired or invalid but not surrendered of record;

 



 

(11) any defect that affects only which Person has the right to receive
royalty payments (rather than the amount of such royalty) and that does not
affect the validity of the underlying Lease; and

 



 

(12) defects based on references to lack of information (unless such
information (A) is not reflected in the records of the applicable county and
(B) is not in the Records made available to Buyers).

 



 

(b) _Title Benefit_. The term " ** _Title Benefit_** " means any right,
circumstance or condition that operates to increase the Net Revenue Interest
of any Seller with respect to any Lease or Well above that shown in **_Exhibit
B_**.

 



 

(c) _Notice of Defective Interest_. On or before the Defect Notice Date,
Buyers shall notify Sellers in writing of any matters that, in Buyers
reasonable opinion, constitute a Title Defect (such notice, a " ** _Notice of
Defective Interests_** "). To be effective, each Notice of Defective Interests
shall be in writing, be received by Sellers prior to or on the Defect Notice
Date and contain the following: (1) a clear description of the alleged Title
Defect, (2) a description of each Property affected by the alleged Title
Defect (each such Property, a " ** _Title Defect Property_** "), (3) the
Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (4) supporting documents
reasonably necessary for Sellers (as well as any title attorney or examiner
hired by Sellers) to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect, and (5)
the amount which Buyers reasonably believe to be the Title Defect Amount as
provided for in _Section 4.2(e)_, and the computations and information upon
which Buyers beliefs are based. To give Sellers an opportunity to commence
reviewing and curing Title Defects, prior to the Defect Notice Date, Buyers
agree to use its reasonable efforts to give Sellers weekly notices of all
Title Defects discovered by Buyers during the preceding week; _provided that_
any such notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the
Defect Notice Date. Other than with respect to Buyers (A) remedies for
breaches of _Section 8.1(b)(1)_ and _Section 8.1(b)(3)_, and (B) rights
under the special warranty set forth in the Assignment, any matters that may
otherwise constitute a Title Defect, but of which Sellers have not been
notified by Buyers in a Notice of

 



      
 

 



 

Defective Interests delivered in accordance with this _Section 4.2(c)_ prior
to the Defect Notice Date, shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyers for
all purposes.

 



 

(d) _Notice of Title Benefits_. On or prior to the Defect Notice Date, Buyers
will promptly furnish Sellers with written notice (in accordance with the
requirements for a Title Benefit Notice below) of any matters that, in Buyers
reasonable opinion, could constitute a Title Benefit, and that is discovered
by any of Buyers or any of their Representatives (for the avoidance of doubt,
including any title attorneys, landmen or other title examiners) while
conducting Buyers Due Diligence Review. On or before the Defect Notice Date,
Sellers shall advise Buyers in writing of any matters that, in Sellers
reasonable opinion, constitute a Title Benefit (each such notice, a " **
_Title Benefit Notice_** "). For purposes of clarity, Buyers shall be
obligated to provide Sellers with a Title Benefit Notice with respect to any
Title Benefit they should discover during their due diligence. However, Buyers
are not obligated to, and may not, conduct due diligence on all Properties.
Buyers shall not be liable for failing to disclose any Title Benefits on
Properties for which they choose, in their sole discretion, not to perform due
diligence or on Properties for which they perform due diligence but,
notwithstanding the due diligence, do not obtain relevant information that
would reveal a Title Benefit. Each Title Benefit Notice shall be in writing
and contain the following: (1) a clear description of the Title Benefit, (2) a
description of each Property affected by the Title Benefit (each such
Property, a " ** _Title Benefit Property_** "), (3) the Allocated Value of
each Title Benefit Property, (4) supporting documents reasonably necessary for
Buyers or Sellers, as applicable, (as well as any title attorney or examiner
hired by Buyers or Sellers, as applicable) to verify the existence of the
Title Benefit, and (5) the amount which Buyers or Sellers, as applicable,
reasonably believe to be the Title Benefit Amount for each Title Benefit
Property and the computations and information upon which Sellers belief is
based. Subject to Sellers remedy for a breach of this _Section 4.2(d)_ by
Buyers, Sellers shall be deemed to have waived all Title Benefits of which it
has not given, or received, notice on or before the Defect Notice Date.

 



 

(e) _Title Defect Amount_. Subject to the provisions of _Section 4.2(f)_, the
" ** _Title Defect Amount_** " means the amount by which the Allocated Value
of a Title Defect Property affected by a Title Defect is reduced as a result
of the existence of such Title Defect, which amount shall be determined in
accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:

 



 

(1) if Buyers and Sellers agree in writing on the Title Defect Amount, that
amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 



 

(2) if the Title Defect is a Lien that is undisputed and liquidated in amount,
then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount of the payment necessary to
remove such Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

 



 

(3) for Leases that are undeveloped and non-producing as of the Execution
Date, in the event that an asserted Title Defect is the actual failure of
Sellers to own the number of net leasehold acres represented on **_Exhibit
A_** for any such undeveloped Lease, then the Title Defect Amount shall be an
amount equal to the Allocated Value of the affected Lease _multiplied by_ a
fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the difference between (i) the
represented aggregate number of net leasehold acres

 



      
 

 



 

covered by the Lease, and (ii) the actual aggregate number of net leasehold
acres covered by such Lease, and (B) the denominator of which shall be the
represented aggregate number of net leasehold acres shown on **_Exhibit A_**
for such Lease;

 



 

(4) in the event that the Title Defect for any Lease or Well is the actual
failure of the applicable Seller to own the represented Net Revenue Interest
with respect to such Lease or Well set forth on **_Exhibit B_** then the
Title Defect Amount shall be equal to the Allocated Value of the Title Defect
Property _multiplied_ by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the
difference between (i) the actual Net Revenue Interest for the Title Defect
Property, and (ii) the Net Revenue Interest with respect to such Title Defect
Property as set forth on **_Exhibit B_** and (B) the denominator of which is
the Net Revenue Interest with respect to such Title Defect Property as set
forth on **_Exhibit B_**; and

 



 

(5) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type
not described in subsections (1), (2), (3) or (4) above, the Title Defect
Amount shall be determined by taking into account the following factors: (A)
any potential discrepancy between (i) the Net Revenue Interest or Working
Interest with respect to such Title Defect Property and (ii) the Net Revenue
Interest or Working Interest with respect to such Title Defect Property as
stated on **_Exhibit B_**; (B) the Allocated Value of the Title Defect
Property; (C) the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by the Title
Defect; (D) the legal effect of the Title Defect; (E) the values placed upon
the Title Defect by Buyers and Sellers; (F) the likelihood that the Title
Defect will prevent or impair the timely receipt of production revenues
attributable to the Title Defect Property; and (G) such other reasonable
factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _ARTICLE_ 4, the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any
Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of the Title Defect
Property and if a Title Defect is reasonably susceptible to being cured, the
Title Defect Amount attributable to such Title Defect shall not exceed the
cost and expense to cure such Title Defect.

 



 

(f) _Title Deductibles_. Except as provided in the last sentence of this
_Section 4.2(f)_, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
(1) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
remedies provided by Sellers in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby for any Title Defect affecting a Title Defect Property for which the
Title Defect Amount attributable thereto does not exceed * (" ** _Individual
Title Threshold_** "); and (2) in no event shall there be any adjustments to
the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Sellers in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby for any Title Defect Amount attributable
to a Title Defect affecting a Title Defect Property that exceeds the
Individual Title Threshold unless (A) the sum of (i) the aggregate Title
Defect Amounts of all such Title Defects exceeding the Individual Title
Threshold, excluding any Title Defects cured by Sellers, _plus_ (ii) the
aggregate Environmental Defect Values of all Environmental Defects that exceed
the Individual Environmental Threshold, excluding any Environmental Defects
Remediated by Sellers, _minus_ (iii) all Title Benefit Amounts, exceeds (B)
the Aggregate Defect Deductible, after which point, subject to the Individual
Title Threshold, Buyers shall be

 



 

27

 



 

* - Confidential Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to this omitted information.

      
 

 



 

entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies only with
respect to the incremental amount of such Title Defect Amounts, in the
aggregate, in excess of such Aggregate Defect Deductible. If any Asset is
excluded pursuant to _Section 4.2(j)(2)_, the Title Defect Amount relating to
such excluded Asset will not be counted towards the Aggregate Defect
Deductible. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary otherwise set forth in
this Agreement, with respect to any Title Defect discovered, and a Notice of
Defective Interests delivered, by Buyer during the Due Diligence Period that,
if discovered by Buyer after Closing, would constitute a breach of the special
warranty set forth in _Section 2.1_ of the Assignment, subject, however, to
the Permitted Encumbrances, the Title Defect Amount for such Title Defect
shall not be subject to the Individual Title Threshold nor the Aggregate Title
Defect Deductible.

 



 

(g) _Title Benefit Amount_. The " ** _Title Benefit Amount_** " means the
amount by which the Allocated Value of a Title Benefit Property affected by a
Title Benefit is increased as a result of the existence of such Title Benefit.
Each Title Benefit Amount shall be determined in accordance with the same
methodology, terms and conditions for determining each Title Defect Amount.
With respect to any Title Benefit reported under _Section 4.2(d)_, _provided
that_ the Title Benefit Amount with respect thereto is in excess of the
Individual Title Threshold, the Title Benefit Amount attributable to such
Title Benefit shall be used to reduce the amount of the aggregate Title Defect
Amounts and Environmental Defect Values attributable to Title Defects and
Environmental Defects properly and timely raised by Buyers after taking into
account the Individual Title Threshold and the Individual Environmental
Threshold, as applicable. If the Parties cannot reach an agreement on alleged
Title Benefits or Title Benefit Amounts by the scheduled Closing, then (1) the
average of Sellers and Buyers good faith estimate of such disputed Title
Benefit Amount shall be used in calculating the reduction to the Title Defect
Amounts and Environmental Defect Values pursuant to this _Section 4.2(g)_ to
the extent applicable, and (2) the provisions of _Section 4.3_ shall apply.
For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers shall not be entitled to any remedy with
respect to any claimed Title Benefit if the applicable Title Benefit Amount
with respect thereto is not in excess of the Individual Title Threshold.

 



 

(h) _Title Adjustment Amount_. The amount by which the Purchase Price is to be
adjusted in accordance with this _ARTICLE_ 4 for Title Defect Amounts (after,
for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account the Aggregate Title Defect
Deductible and any offsetting Title Benefit Amounts) shall be referred to as
the " ** _Title Adjustment Amount_** ".

 



 

(i) _Sellers  Right to Cure_. Continuing until one Business Day prior to
Closing (such period of time, the " ** _Cure Period_** "), Sellers shall have
the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at their sole cost, to cure or
remove any Title Defects timely asserted by Buyers pursuant to _Section
4.2(c)_. If Sellers believe that they have cured any applicable Title Defect,
Sellers shall deliver written notice thereof to Buyers, together with
supporting documents available to Sellers and reasonably necessary for Buyers
(as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Buyers) to verify the cure
of such Title Defect. Buyers shall, at or prior to the end of the Cure Period,
advise Sellers in writing whether it agrees or (pursuant to a Title Dispute
Notice, as described in _Section 4.3_) Disputes that any such Title Defect
has been so cured; _provided that_ Buyers failure to timely respond to
Sellers notice of cure shall be deemed Buyers agreement that such Title
Defect has been cured and Buyers waiver of its Claim with respect to such
Title Defect. If Buyers timely notify Sellers of a Dispute as to Sellers

 



      
 

 



 

attempted cure of any Title Defect, then (subject to _Section 4.2(j)_), the
provisions of _Section 4.3_ shall apply to such Title Defect.

 



 

(j) _Remedies for Title Defects_. Subject to Sellers continuing right to
Dispute the existence of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Amount
asserted with respect thereto and subject to _Section 4.2(f)_, in the event
that any Title Defect timely asserted by Buyers in accordance with _Section
4.2(c)_ is not waived in writing by Buyers or cured by Sellers prior to the
end of the Cure Period, then Sellers shall elect one of the following remedies
with respect to such Title Defect:

 



 

(1) reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Amount applicable to such
Title Defect;

 



 

(2) retain the entirety of the Title Defect Property that is subject to such
Title Defect (together with all related Assets) and reduce the Purchase Price
by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of the Assets so retained; or

 



 

(3) with Buyers reasonable consent, indemnify Buyers against all Losses
resulting from such Title Defect with respect to the applicable Title Defect
Property pursuant to an indemnity agreement mutually acceptable to the
Parties.

 



 

As to any Title Defect timely asserted by Buyers in accordance with _Section
4.2(c)_ which remains uncured by Sellers prior to the end of the Cure Period
and for which a corresponding Title Defect Amount is included in the Title
Adjustment Amount at Closing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Title
Defect which Sellers have chosen to dispute pursuant to _Section 4.3_),
Sellers also shall retain the right, but not the obligation, to attempt to
cure each such Title Defect after Closing at Sellers sole cost and expense;
_provided that_ Sellers shall furnish notice to Buyers of Sellers belief that
they have cured any such Title Defect (together with supporting documents
available to Sellers and reasonably necessary for Buyers, as well as any title
attorney or examiner hired by them, to verify the cure of any such Title
Defect), by no later 15 days prior to the Final Settlement Statement Due Date.
If Buyers disagree that the Title Defect has been cured, it shall so advise
Sellers in writing within five Business Days after receipt of Sellers notice
as provided above, following which the provisions of _Section 4.3_ will apply
to resolve such Dispute, and the Final Settlement Statement Due Date shall be
extended to the extent necessary to complete the Dispute resolution procedure
as provided for in _Section 4.3_. Should Buyers (A) fail to respond to
Sellers notice of cure in such five Business Day period, then Buyers shall be
deemed to have (i) agreed that the Title Defect has been cured and (ii) waived
its Claim with respect to such Title Defect, or (B) agree that the Title
Defect has been cured, and then, in each case, the Title Defect Amount
attributable thereto and included in the Title Adjustment Amount used to
adjust the Purchase Price at Closing shall be credited to Sellers in the Final
Settlement Statement.

 



 

4.3 _Title Dispute Resolution_. If prior to the Closing or, with respect to
the adequacy of Sellers Title Defect curative actions after Closing, after
the Closing, the Parties are unable to resolve any Title Disputed Matter, then
either Party shall have the right, upon the delivery of written notice to the
other Party (each, a " ** _Title Dispute Notice_** "), to Dispute such Title
Disputed Matter and to invoke the Dispute resolution provisions below in this
_Section 4.3_ in order to

 



      
 

 



 

resolve any such Dispute. As used herein, the term " ** _Title Disputed
Matter_** " means a Dispute regarding any of the following: (w) the existence
and scope of a Title Defect or Title Benefit; (x) any Title Defect Amount or
Title Benefit Amount, as the case may be; (y) the Title Adjustment Amount, if
any; and (z) the adequacy of Sellers Title Defect curative actions. As to any
Dispute regarding the adequacy of Sellers Title Defect curative actions after
Closing as provided for in _Section 4.2(j)_, the Final Settlement Statement
Due Date shall be extended to the extent necessary to complete the Dispute
resolution procedure as provided for below in this _Section 4.3_. Any Title
Dispute Notice must be delivered on or before the tenth Business Day after
Closing except with respect to Disputes relating to any of Sellers Title
Defect curative actions conducted post-Closing. Any Title Dispute Notice
relating to any of Sellers Title Defect curative actions conducted post-
Closing must be delivered within ten Business Days following Buyers receipt
of notice from Sellers that they have cured the applicable Title Defect. In no
event will Closing be delayed on account of any Title Disputed Matter and, if
the Title Defect Property affected thereby is transferred to Buyers at
Closing, the average of the Parties respective good faith estimates of the
Title Defect Amounts attributable to such Title Defect Property shall be used
in the calculation and determination of the Title Adjustment Amount to be used
at Closing.

 



 

(a) The Parties shall attempt to resolve all Title Disputed Matters through
good faith negotiations for a period of 20 days after the delivery of a Title
Dispute Notice by either Party. Following such negotiation period, if the
Title Disputed Matter at issue remains in Dispute, such Title Disputed Matter
shall be resolved pursuant to this _Section 4.3_ and the Parties shall
mutually appoint an independent expert having the qualifications specified
below (the " ** _Title Defect Expert_** "). If the Parties are unable to
mutually agree upon the Title Defect Expert, then the Parties shall, within
ten days after the expiration of such foregoing negotiation period, request
that the AAA, acting through its offices in Houston, Texas, appoint the Title
Defect Expert. The Title Defect Expert shall be a licensed title attorney
having a minimum of ten years experience with regard to the types of title
defects affecting the Properties involved in the Title Disputed Matter, shall
be without any conflicts of interest as to the Parties, and shall not have
been employed by or undertaken more than $50,000 of work, in the aggregate,
for either Party or its Affiliates within the five year period preceding the
submission of the Dispute. For the avoidance of doubt, the Title Defect Expert
will function as an expert in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
_Section 4.3_, and not as an arbitrator.

 



 

(b) Within 30 days following the appointment of the Title Defect Expert,
Sellers shall provide the Title Defect Expert with a copy of this Agreement,
and each Party shall provide, both to the Title Defect Expert and each other,
a summary of its position with regard to each such outstanding Title Disputed
Matter in a written document of five pages or less per Title Disputed Matter.
The Parties shall instruct the Title Defect Expert that, within 30 days after
receiving the Parties respective submissions, the Title Defect Expert shall
render a written decision. In rendering its decision, the Title Defect Expert
shall not award (1) a higher Title Defect Amount than the lower of (A) the
Allocated Value of the applicable Property or (B) the amount claimed by Buyers
in their summary, (2) a higher Title Benefit Amount than the amount claimed by
Sellers in their summary, (3) a lower Title Benefit Amount than the amount
claimed by Buyers in their summary or (4) a lower Title Defect Amount than
that amount claimed by Sellers in their summary, as applicable. The Title
Defect Expert shall determine the specific disputed Title Defect, Title
Benefit, Title Defect Amount, Title Benefit Amount or the adequacy

 



      
 

 



 

of Sellers Title Defect curative actions, as the case may be, submitted by
either Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party
with respect to any other matter. Any decision rendered by the Title Defect
Expert pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive, and binding on Sellers and
Buyers, and will be enforceable against each Party in any court having
jurisdiction hereof, but is not reviewable by, or appealable to, any court
except in the event of fraud. The Parties shall each bear one-half of the
costs of the Title Defect Expert and of any associated dispute resolution
process and proceedings.

 



 

(c) If the Title Defect Expert determines that a Title Defect did not exist or
that a Title Defect existed but was cured by Sellers, then any Title Defect
Amount attributable thereto that was included in the Title Adjustment Amount
used at Closing, if any, shall be credited to Sellers in the Final Settlement
Statement.

 



 

(d) If the Title Defect Expert determines that a Title Defect exists, but that
the Title Defect Amount attributable thereto is a lesser amount than any Title
Defect Amount with respect thereto that was included in the Title Adjustment
Amount used at Closing, if any, then the difference thereof shall be credited
to Sellers in the Final Settlement Statement.

 



 

(e) If the Title Defect Expert determines that a Title Defect exists, such
Title Defect has not been cured by Sellers and the Title Defect Amount
attributable thereto is a greater amount than any Title Defect Amount with
respect thereto that was included in the Title Adjustment Amount used at
Closing, if any, then the difference thereof shall be credited to Buyers in
the Final Settlement Statement.

 



 

(f) Any such adjustments to the amount of the Purchase Price will be reflected
in the Final Settlement Statement as applicable.

 



 

4.4 _Preferential Rights and Consents_.

 



 

(a) _Preferential Purchase Rights_. Promptly following the Execution Date, and
in any event within five Business Days following the Execution Date, Sellers
shall send notices to the holder of each Preferential Right listed on
**_Schedule 6.6_** in accordance with the terms of the instruments giving rise
to such Preferential Rights. Sellers shall promptly provide a copy of each
such notice to Buyers following the delivery thereof by Sellers. Sellers shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause waivers of such Preferential
Rights to be obtained and delivered prior to Closing; _provided that_ Sellers
shall not be required to make payments or undertake other obligations to or
for the benefit of the holders of such Preferential Rights in order to obtain
the required waivers. Buyers shall reasonably cooperate with Sellers in
seeking to obtain such waivers of Preferential Rights; _provided that_ Buyers
shall not be required to make payments or undertake other obligations to or
for the benefit of the holders of such Preferential Rights in order to obtain
the required waivers. Any Preferential Right must be exercised subject to all
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (including all thresholds,
deductibles and other amounts except for the cash consideration, which shall
equal the Allocated Value for such property), including the successful Closing
of this Agreement pursuant to _ARTICLE_ 12 as to those Assets for which
Preferential Rights have not been exercised. The consideration payable under
this Agreement for any particular Asset for purposes of Preferential Rights
notices shall be the Allocated Value for such Asset, subject to

 



      
 

 



 

adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.4_ and _Section 13.1_. If, prior to the
Closing Date, either Party discovers any required Preferential Right for which
notices have not been delivered pursuant to the first sentence of this
_Section 4.4(a)_, then (x) the Party making such discovery shall provide the
other Party with written notification of such Preferential Right, (y) Sellers,
following delivery or receipt of such written notification, as applicable,
will promptly send notices to the holders of such Preferential Rights in
accordance with the terms of the instrument giving rise to such Preferential
Right, and (z) the terms and conditions of this _Section 4.4(a)_ shall apply
to the Assets subject to such Preferential Right.

 



 

(1) If, prior to Closing, any holder of a Preferential Right notifies Sellers
that it intends to consummate the purchase of the Assets to which its
Preferential Right applies or if the time for exercising such Preferential
Right has not expired, then the Assets subject to such Preferential Right
(together with all related Assets) shall be excluded from the Assets to be
assigned to Buyers at Closing, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
sum of the Allocated Values of such Assets so excluded.

 



 

(2) Sellers shall be entitled to all proceeds paid by any Person exercising a
Preferential Right prior to Closing. If such holder of such Preferential Right
thereafter fails to consummate the purchase of the Assets subject to such
Preferential Right (together with all related Assets) on or before the end of
the time period for closing such sale or the time for exercising such
Preferential Right expires without exercise by the holder thereof, then (A)
Sellers shall so notify Buyers, (B) Sellers shall assign to Buyers, on the
tenth Business Day following the end of such time period or termination of
such right without exercise, such Assets that were so excluded at Closing
pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form as the Assignment,
and (C) Buyers shall pay to Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with
respect to such excluded Assets, as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.4_ and
_Section 13.1_.

 



 

(3) All Assets for which any applicable Preferential Right has been waived in
writing, or as to which the time for exercising the applicable Preferential
Right has expired, in each case, prior to Closing, shall be transferred to
Buyers at Closing, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Consents_. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, and in any
event within five Business Days following the Execution Date, Sellers shall
send notices to the holder of each Consent listed on **_Schedule 6.5_**
requesting such holders applicable written Consent to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause such Consents to be obtained and delivered prior to Closing; _provided
that_ Sellers shall not be required to make payments or undertake other
obligations to or for the benefit of the holders of such Consents in order to
obtain the required Consents. Buyers shall reasonably cooperate with Sellers
in seeking to obtain such Consents to assignment; _provided that_ Buyers shall
not be required to make payments or undertake other obligations to or for the
benefit of the holders of such Consents in order to obtain the required
Consents. If, prior to the Closing Date, either Party discovers any Consents
for which notices have not been delivered pursuant to the first sentence of
this _Section 4.4(b)_, then (x) the Party making such discovery shall provide
the other Party with written notification of such Consents, (y) Sellers,
following

 



      
 

 



 

delivery or receipt of such written notification, as applicable, will promptly
send notices to the holders of Consents requesting such Consents, and (z) the
terms and conditions of this _Section 4.4(b)_ shall apply to the Assets
subject to such Consents.

 



 

(1) If (A) Sellers fail to obtain any such Consent prior to Closing and the
failure to obtain such Consent would (i) cause the assignment of the Assets
affected thereby to Buyers to be void or (ii) give the holder of such Consent
the right to terminate the applicable underlying Lease, Surface Contract or
Applicable Contract under the express terms thereof, (B) Sellers fail to
obtain a Consent held by a Governmental Entity prior to Closing, or (C) a
Consent requested by Sellers is denied in writing, then, in each case, the
Assets affected by such un-obtained Consent (together with all related Assets,
the " ** _Affected Assets_** ") shall be excluded from the Assets to be
assigned to Buyers at Closing, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
sum of the Allocated Value of such Affected Assets.

 



 

(2) If any such Consent relating to Affected Assets that was not obtained
prior to Closing is obtained within 45 days following the Closing, then (A) on
the fifteenth Business Day after such Consent is obtained, Sellers shall
assign such Affected Assets to Buyers pursuant to an instrument in
substantially the same form as the Assignment, and (B) Buyers shall pay to
Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amount by which
the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with respect to such Affected
Assets, as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.4_ and _Section 13.1_.

 



 

(3) If Sellers fail to obtain any such Consent prior to Closing and (A) the
failure to obtain such Consent would not (i) cause the assignment of the
Assets affected thereby to Buyers to be void or (ii) give the holder of such
Consent the right to terminate the applicable underlying Lease, Surface
Contract or Applicable Contract under the express terms thereof, (B) the
holder of such Consent is not a Governmental Entity and (C) such Consent
requested by Sellers is not denied in writing by the holder thereof, then (I)
the Assets subject to such un-obtained Consent shall nevertheless be assigned
by Sellers to Buyers at Closing as part of the Assets and without reduction to
the Purchase Price, (II) Buyers shall have no claim against Sellers, and
Sellers shall have no liability for, the failure to obtain any such Consent
and (III) Buyers shall be responsible from and after the Closing for any and
all Losses arising from the failure to obtain such Consent.

Environmental Defect or Condition, or Sellers or their respective
predecessors failure to comply with Environmental Laws.

 



       
 

 



 

5.3 _Environmental Defects_.

 



 

(a) _Environmental Defect Notices_. On or before the Defect Notice Date,
Buyers shall notify Sellers in writing of any matters that, in Buyers
reasonable opinion, constitute an Environmental Defect (such notice, an " **
_Environmental Defect Notice_** "). To be effective, each Environmental Defect
Notice shall be in writing, be received by Sellers prior to or on the Defect
Notice Date and contain the following: (1) a detailed description of the
alleged Environmental Defect, (2) each Asset affected by the alleged
Environmental Defect (each such Asset, an " ** _Environmental Defect
Property_** "), (3) the Allocated Value, if any, of each Environmental Defect
Property, (4) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as
any environmental consultant hired by Seller) to verify the existence of the
alleged Environmental Defect, and (5) the amount that Buyers reasonably
believe is the most cost-effective manner reasonably available to Remediate
each alleged Environmental Defect, consistent with Environmental Laws and the
requirements of the applicable Governmental Entity, taking into account that
non-permanent remedies (such as mechanisms to contain or stabilize Hazardous
Materials, including monitoring site conditions, natural attenuation, risk-
based corrective action, institutional controls or other appropriate
restrictions on the use of property, caps, dikes, encapsulation, leachate
collection systems, etc.) may be the most cost-effective manner reasonably
available, net to Sellers interest in the applicable Assets (the " **
_Environmental Defect Value_** "), and the computations and information upon
which Buyers belief is based. To give Sellers an opportunity to commence
reviewing and curing Environmental Defects, prior to the Defect Notice Date
Buyers agree to use their reasonable efforts to give Sellers weekly written
notices of all Environmental Defects discovered by Buyers during the preceding
week; _provided that_ any such notice may be preliminary in nature and
supplemented prior to or on the Defect Notice Date. Other than with respect to
Buyers remedies for breaches of _Section 6.15_, any matters that may
otherwise constitute an Environmental Defect, but of which Sellers have not
been notified by Buyers in an Environmental Defect Notice delivered in
accordance with this _Section 5.3(a)_ prior to the Defect Notice Date, shall
be deemed to have been waived by Buyers for all purposes.

 



 

(b) _Environmental Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, (1) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase
Price or other remedies provided by Sellers in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby for any Environmental Defect affecting an
Environmental Defect Property for which the Environmental Defect Value
attributable thereto does not exceed * (" ** _Individual Environmental
Threshold_** "); and (2) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the
Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Sellers in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby for any Environmental Defect Value
attributable to an Environmental Defect affecting an Environmental Defect
Property that exceeds the Individual Environmental Threshold unless (A) the
sum of (i) the aggregate Environmental Defect Values of all such Environmental
Defects exceeding the Individual Environmental Threshold, excluding any
Environmental Defects Remediated by Sellers, _plus_ (ii) the aggregate Title
Defect Amounts of all Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title
Threshold, excluding any Title Defects cured by Sellers, _minus_ (iii) all
Title Benefit Amounts, exceeds (B) the Aggregate Defect Deductible, after
which point, subject to the Individual Environmental Threshold, Buyers shall
be entitled to adjustments to

 



 

36

 



 

* - Confidential Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to this omitted information.

      
 

 



 

the Purchase Price or other remedies only with respect to the incremental
amount of such Environmental Defect Values, in the aggregate, in excess of
such Aggregate Defect Deductible.

 



 

If any Asset is excluded pursuant to _Section 5.3(e)(3)_, the Environmental
Defect Value relating to such excluded Asset will not be counted towards the
Aggregate Defect Deductible.

 



 

(c) _Environmental Adjustment Amount_. The amount by which the Purchase Price
is to be adjusted in accordance with this _ARTICLE_ 5 for Environmental
Defect Values shall be referred to as the " ** _Environmental Adjustment
Amount_** ".

 



 

(d) _Sellers  Right to Remediate_. Continuing until the end of the Cure
Period, Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at
its sole cost, to Remediate any Environmental Defects timely asserted by
Buyers pursuant to _Section 5.3(a)_. If Sellers believe that they have
Remediated any applicable Environmental Defect, Sellers shall deliver written
notice thereof to Buyers, together with supporting documents available to
Sellers and reasonably necessary for Buyers (as well as any environmental
consultant hired by Buyers) to verify the Remediation of the Environmental
Defects. Buyers shall, at or prior to the end of the Cure Period, advise
Sellers in writing whether they agree or (pursuant to an Environmental Dispute
Notice, as described in _Section 5.3(f)_) dispute that the Environmental
Defect has been so Remediated; _provided that_ Buyers failure to timely
respond to Sellers notice of Remediation shall be deemed Buyers irrevocable
agreement that the Environmental Defect has been Remediated and Buyers
irrevocable waiver of its Claim with respect to such Environmental Defect. If
Buyers timely notify Sellers in writing of a Dispute as to Sellers attempted
Remediation of any Environmental Defect, then (subject to _Section 5.3(e)_)
the provisions of _Section 5.3(f)_ shall apply to such Environmental Defect.

 



 

(e) _Remedies for Environmental Defects_. Subject to Sellers continuing right
to dispute the existence of an Environmental Defect and/or the Environmental
Defect Value asserted with respect thereto and subject to _Section 5.3(b)_,
in the event that any Environmental Defect timely asserted by Buyers in
accordance with _Section 5.3(a)_ is not waived in writing by Buyers or
Remediated by Sellers prior to the end of the Cure Period, then Sellers shall
elect one of the following remedies with respect to such Environmental Defect:

 



 

(1) reduce the Purchase Price by the Environmental Defect Value applicable to
such Environmental Defect;

 



 

(2) with Buyers reasonable consent, indemnify Buyers against all Losses
resulting from such Environmental Defect and associated Remediation pursuant
to an indemnity agreement mutually agreed by the Parties; or

 



 

(3) retain the entirety of the Asset that is subject to such Environmental
Defect (together with all related Assets), and reduce the Purchase Price by an
amount equal to the sum of the Allocated Value of the Assets so retained.

 



 

If Sellers elect the option set forth in clause (1) above, then Buyers shall
be deemed to have assumed responsibility for all costs and expenses
attributable to the Remediation of the applicable Environmental Defect and all
Losses with respect thereto, and Buyers obligations with respect thereto
shall be deemed to constitute Assumed Obligations. If Sellers elect the

 



      
 

 



 

option set forth in clause (2) above, Sellers shall additionally have the
right to elect to assume responsibility for the Remediation of such
Environmental Defect following Closing and, if Sellers so elect (A) Sellers
shall use their reasonable efforts to implement such Remediation in a manner
which is consistent with the requirements of Environmental Laws in a timely
fashion for the type of Remediation that Sellers elect to undertake and (B)
Buyers, effective as of the Closing, hereby grant to Sellers and their
representatives access to the Assets to conduct such Remediation.

 



 

(f) _Environmental Dispute Resolution Procedure_. If prior to the Closing the
Parties are unable to resolve any Environmental Disputed Matter, then either
Party shall have the right, upon the delivery of written notice to the other
Party (each, an " ** _Environmental Dispute Notice_** "), to Dispute such
Environmental Disputed Matter and to invoke the Dispute resolution provisions
below in this _Section 5.3(f)_ in order to resolve any such Dispute. As used
herein, the term " ** _Environmental Disputed Matter_** " means a Dispute
regarding any of the following: (w) the existence and scope of an
Environmental Defect; (x) any Environmental Defect Value; (y) the
Environmental Adjustment Amount, if any; and (z) the adequacy of Sellers
Environmental Defect Remediation actions. Any Environmental Dispute Notice
must be delivered on or before the tenth Business Day after Closing. In no
event will Closing be delayed on account of any Environmental Disputed Matter
and if the Environmental Defect Property affected thereby is transferred to
Buyers at Closing, the average of the Parties respective good faith estimates
of the Environmental Defect Values attributable to such Environmental Defect
Property shall be used in the calculation and determination of the
Environmental Adjustment Amount to be used at Closing

 



 

(1) The Parties shall attempt to resolve all Environmental Disputed Matters
through good faith negotiations for a period of 20 days after the delivery of
an Environmental Dispute Notice by either Party. Following such negotiation
period, if the Environmental Disputed Matter at issue should remain in
Dispute, such Environmental Disputed Matter shall be resolved pursuant to this
_Section 5.3(f)_ and the Parties shall mutually appoint an independent expert
having the qualifications specified below (the " ** _Environmental Defect
Expert_** "). If the Parties are unable to mutually agree upon the
Environmental Defect Expert, then the Parties shall, within ten days after the
expiration of such negotiation period, request that the AAA, acting through
its offices in Houston, Texas, appoint the Environmental Defect Expert. The
Environmental Defect Expert shall be a certified environmental professional
having a minimum of ten years experience with regard to the types of
environmental defects affecting the Properties involved in the Environmental
Disputed Matter, shall be without any conflicts of interest as to the Parties,
and shall not have been employed by or undertaken more than $50,000 of work,
in the aggregate, for either Party or its Affiliates within the five year
period preceding the submission of the Dispute. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Environmental Defect Expert will function as an expert in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this _Section 5.3(f)_, and not as an arbitrator.

 



 

(2) Within 30 days following the appointment of the Environmental Defect
Expert, Sellers shall provide the Environmental Defect Expert with a copy of
this Agreement, and each Party shall provide, both to the Environmental Defect
Expert and each other, a summary of its position with regard to each such
outstanding Environmental

 



      
 

 



 

Disputed Matter in a written document of five pages or less per Environmental
Disputed Matter. The Parties shall instruct the Environmental Defect Expert
that, within 30 days after receiving the Parties respective submissions, the
Environmental Defect Expert shall render a written decision. In rendering its
decision, the Environmental Defect Expert shall not award a higher
Environmental Defect Value than the amount claimed by Buyers in their summary
or a lower Environmental Defect Value than the amount claimed by Sellers in
their summary, as applicable. Any decision rendered by the Environmental
Defect Expert pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive, and binding on
Sellers and Buyers, and will be enforceable against each Party in any court
having jurisdiction hereof, but is not reviewable by, or appealable to, any
court except in the event of fraud. The Parties shall each bear one-half of
the costs of the Environmental Defect Expert and of any associated Dispute
resolution process and proceedings.

 



 

(3) If the Environmental Defect Expert determines that an Environmental Defect
did not exist or that an Environmental Defect existed but was Remediated by
Sellers, then any Environmental Defect Value attributable thereto that was
included in the Environmental Adjustment Amount used at Closing, if any, shall
be credited to Sellers in the Final Settlement Statement.

 



 

(4) If the Environmental Defect Expert determines that an Environmental Defect
exists, but that the Environmental Defect Value attributable thereto is a
lesser amount than any Environmental Defect Value with respect thereto that
was included in the Environmental Adjustment Amount used at Closing, if any,
then the difference thereof shall be credited to Sellers in the Final
Settlement Statement.

 



 

(5) If the Environmental Defect Expert determines that an Environmental Defect
exists, such Environmental Defect has not been Remediated by Sellers and the
Environmental Defect Value attributable thereto is a greater amount than the
Environmental Defect Value with respect thereto that was included in the
Environmental Adjustment Amount used at Closing, if any, then the difference
thereof shall be credited to Buyers in the Final Settlement Statement.

 



 

(6) Any such adjustments to the amount of the Purchase Price will be reflected
in the Final Settlement Statement as applicable.

 



 

5.4 _NORM, Wastes and Other Substances_ _._ Buyers acknowledge that the Assets
have been used for exploration, development and production of oil and gas and
that there may be petroleum, produced water, wastes or other substances or
materials located in, on or under the Assets or associated with the Assets.
Equipment and sites included in the Assets may contain asbestos, NORM or other
Hazardous Materials. NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells,
materials and equipment as scale, or in other forms. The wells, materials and
equipment located on the Assets or included in the Assets may contain NORM and
other wastes or Hazardous Materials. NORM containing material and/or other
wastes or Hazardous Materials may have come in contact with various
environmental media, including water, soils or sediment. Special procedures
may be required for the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation or
disposal of environmental media, wastes, asbestos, NORM and other Hazardous
Materials from the Assets. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Buyer shall not be permitted to

 



      
 

 



 

claim any Environmental Defect on the account of the presence of NORM on the
Assets and the properties underlying the Assets.

(8) authorize or agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any of the actions

(c) _Derivative Transactions_. To the extent that doing so would not cause any
Seller to be in violation of any provision of any agreement (including,
without limitation, any credit agreement, indenture, other loan or similar
document) to which it is a party or otherwise cause any Seller to be in breach
of any representation and warranty contained in this Agreement, Laredo shall

expenses of entering into the Hedging Transactions, (ii) costs and expenses
related to transferring to, or novating in favor of, Buyers and (iii) costs,
expenses and other liabilities arising from or attributable to the Hedging
Transactions. In the event that this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing,
Laredo may, at its sole election, unwind any or all of the Hedging
Transactions; but in any event, Buyers shall release, defend, indemnify and
hold Sellers and the other Seller Indemnified Parties harmless from and
against any and all losses, costs, expenses or other liabilities arising from
or related to the Hedging Transactions, and shall make any required payments
to Sellers and the other Seller Indemnified Parties within ten Business Days

such request for such consent, unless Buyers notify Sellers to the contrary
during that period.

 



 

(e) _Disclaimer_. Buyers acknowledge that Sellers own undivided interests in
certain of the Assets with respect to which they are not the operator, and
Buyers agree that the acts or omissions of the other Working Interest owners
(including the operators) who are not Sellers or any of Sellers Affiliates
and which Sellers do not have the contractual right to control shall not
constitute a breach of the provisions of _Section 8.1_, nor shall any action
required by a vote of Working Interest owners in and of itself constitute such
a breach so long as Sellers have voted their interest in a manner that
complies with the provisions of _Section 8.1_.

 



 

8.2 _Covenants and Agreements of Buyers and EVOC, as Applicable_.

 



 

(a) _Change of Name_. As promptly as practicable, but in any case within 120
days after the Closing Date, Buyers and EVOC shall use their reasonable
efforts to (1) eliminate the name "Laredo" and any variants thereof from the
Assets, (2) cease using in any way the word "Laredo" with respect to the
Assets, and (3) remove and cease to use all trademarks associated with Sellers
or their Affiliates with respect to the Assets. Except with respect to such
grace period for eliminating existing usage, for the avoidance of doubt,
Buyers and EVOC shall have no right to use any logos, trademarks or trade
names belonging to Sellers or any of their Affiliates. FROM AND AFTER THE
CLOSING, BUYERS HEREBY WAIVE, RELEASE AND AGREE TO JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY,
DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS SELLERS AND THE OTHER SELLER INDEMNIFIED

RELATION TO ANY BREACH BY BUYERS OR EVOC OF THEIR

 



      
 

 



 

OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS _SECTION 8.2(A_), EVEN IF SUCH LOSSES ARISE OUT OF OR
RESULT FROM, SOLELY OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, GROSS, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT

replacements for such bonds, letters of credit and guarantees to the extent
such replacements are necessary (1) for Buyers ownership and EVOCs operation
of the Assets and (2) to permit the cancellation of the bonds, letters of
credit and guarantees posted by Sellers and/or their Affiliates with respect
to the Assets. In addition, at or prior to Closing, Buyers and EVOC shall
deliver to Sellers evidence of the posting of bonds or other security with all
applicable Governmental Entities meeting the requirements of such authorities
to own and, where appropriate, operate, the Assets.

 



 

(c) _Confidentiality_. As used herein, the term " ** _Confidential
Information_** " means all proprietary information of whatever nature, in
whatever form (including oral, written, graphic, digital, electronic or
otherwise), which may be disclosed by Sellers or their Representatives to
Buyers or their Representatives, or otherwise obtained by Buyers or their
Representatives, regarding the Assets (whether pursuant to Buyers Due
Diligence Review or otherwise), including the following types of information,
documents and other materials: (w) geological, geophysical, drilling,
engineering, production, operational, reserve, reservoir and other technical,
leasehold, land, environmental, financial, commercial and other data, plats,

existence and contents of any proposal, discussion, negotiation, understanding
or agreement involving the Parties in respect of the Assets, including with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (y) all
reproductions, transcriptions, reports, summaries, extracts, restatements,
analyses, interpretations, sketches, notes and other materials, in whatever
form, which may be generated by Buyers from any Confidential Information
previously received by Buyers; and (z) Third Party Proprietary Data.

 



 

(1) Subject to _Section 8.2(c)(2)_ and _Section 8.2(c)(3)_, Buyers agree
that all Confidential Information shall, in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement and this Agreement, be kept strictly confidential
and shall not be sold, traded, published, transferred or otherwise disclosed
to any other Person in any manner whatsoever, including electronically or by
any other means of reproduction or transmittal, without Sellers specific
prior written consent. Without limiting the scope of Buyers obligations under
the immediately preceding sentence, Buyers shall take protective measures for
the Confidential Information which are at least as stringent as for its own
confidential and proprietary information.

 



 

(2) Buyers may disclose Confidential Information without Sellers prior
written consent only to the extent that such disclosed Confidential
Information: (A) at the time disclosed, is part of the public domain other
than through the act or omission of

 



      
 

 



 

Buyers or their Representatives in violation of the provisions of this
_Section 8.2(c)_; (B) was, prior to the Effective Time, acquired
independently by Buyers from a Third Party who (i) lawfully obtained such
Confidential Information, and (ii) did not derive such Confidential
Information directly or indirectly from Sellers or its Representatives; (C) is
developed by Buyers or any of their Affiliates independently, and without the
use of or reference to, any of the Confidential Information; or (D) is
required to be disclosed by Buyers under applicable Law, including any
recognized securities exchange on which the shares of Buyers or any of their
Affiliates are actively traded; _provided that_ Buyers will make all
reasonable efforts to give Sellers prior written notice of any such required
disclosure and the opportunity to seek a protective order if Sellers wish, all
to the extent permitted by applicable Law; _provided further_ , if Sellers
wish, but are unable, to obtain such protective order prior to any such
required disclosure, then (I) Buyers may disclose to the appropriate
Governmental Entity or other authority that portion of the Confidential
Information which Buyers are legally required to disclose and Buyers shall use
all reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will
be accorded to the Confidential Information and (II) Buyers shall not be
liable to Sellers for such disclosure to the extent made in accordance with
this Section.

 



 

(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyers may disclose Confidential
Information to any of their Affiliates and other Representatives without
Sellers prior written consent, _provided that_ Buyers shall remain liable
hereunder for any failure of such Affiliate or other Representative to
maintain such Confidential Information as strictly confidential in accordance
with the terms of this _Section 8.2(c)_. Buyers shall ensure that each such
Affiliate and other Representative is aware of Buyers obligations under this
_Section 8.2(c)_ and shall ensure compliance by each such Affiliate and other
Representative with all such obligations.

 



 

(d) _Qualifications_. Buyers shall continue to be qualified to own, and EVOC
shall continue to be qualified to operate the Assets in all jurisdictions
where such Assets are located. Buyers and/or EVOC, as applicable, will
continue to maintain lease bonds and any other surety bonds as may be required
by, and in accordance with, all applicable Laws governing the ownership and
operation of the Assets.

 



 

(e) _Future Assumption of Liabilities_. In the event that (i) any Buyer or any
of its successors or assigns conveys, assigns, or otherwise transfers all or
substantially all of their properties or assets to any Person; (ii) any Buyer
or any of its successors or assigns conveys, assigns, or otherwise transfers
all or any portion of the Assets to any Person; or (iii) any dissolution,
liquidation, termination, merger, consolidation or other reorganization of any
Buyer occurs, then, and in each such case, such assignment, conveyance,
transfer, or change shall expressly provide that the successors, assigns and
transferees of any Buyer and any of its successors, assigns or transferees
shall assume and continue to be responsible for the Assumed Liabilities set
forth in this Agreement. Each Buyer agrees that the covenants set forth in
this _Section 8.2(e)_ shall run with title to the Leases/Lands and shall be
incorporated at Closing into each Assignment conveying the Leases/Lands to
such Buyer. Each Buyer hereby acknowledges Sellers reliance on this _Section
8.2(e)_ and that same is a material part of this Agreement, agrees that the
Purchase Price reflects Buyers agreement to the covenants set forth in this
_Section 8.2(e)_, and acknowledges further that, without this _Section
8.2(e)_, Sellers would not have entered

 



      
 

 



 

into this Agreement. The provisions contained in this _Section 8.2(e)_ shall
expressly survive Closing and delivery and recording of each Assignment.

 



 

8.3 _Covenants and Agreements of the Parties_.

 



 

(a) _Communication Between the Parties Regarding Breach_. If Buyers or Sellers
obtain Knowledge prior to Closing that leads either Party to believe that the
other Party has breached a representation or warranty or failed to perform a
covenant or agreement under this Agreement, the non-breaching Party shall
inform the alleged breaching Party in writing of such potential breach as soon
as reasonably practicable so that the breaching Party may attempt to remedy or
cure such breach prior to the Closing. If such breach or failure is thereafter
cured to the reasonable satisfaction of the non-breaching Party by the Closing
(or, if the Closing does not occur, by the date this Agreement terminates),
then such breach or failure shall be deemed not to have occurred for all
purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Casualty Loss_. Prior to Closing, if a portion of the Assets is destroyed
or materially damaged by fire or other casualty or if a material portion of
the Assets is taken or threatened to be taken in condemnation or under the
right of eminent domain (each, a " ** _Casualty Loss_** "), Sellers shall
promptly advise Buyers in writing of such Casualty Loss and shall elect, by
the delivery of written notice to Buyers at least five Business Days prior to
the Closing Date (or, if the Casualty Loss occurs after such date and prior to
Closing, as soon as reasonably practicable prior to the Closing Date), either
of the following: (1) to retain the Asset affected by the Casualty Loss and
reduce the Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of such Asset; or (2) with
the consent of Buyers, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, to assign such Asset to Buyers without any reduction
of the Purchase Price, subject to the assignment to Buyers of all insurance
proceeds received by Sellers (net of any Taxes incurred thereon by Sellers) as
to such Casualty Loss.

 



 

(c) _Successor Operator_. Sellers are designated as operator of certain Assets
pursuant to joint operating agreements with Third Parties included in the
Applicable Contracts. Buyers acknowledge that such Third Parties may not agree
to allow EVOC to succeed Sellers as operator under such joint operating
agreements or may exercise other rights that they may have which would
preclude EVOC from succeeding Sellers as operator. Buyers and EVOC
specifically acknowledge and agree that Sellers have made no representation,
warranty or other guarantee that EVOC will succeed Sellers as operator under
any joint operating agreement; _provided that_ Sellers shall use their
commercially reasonably efforts, if requested by Buyers and/or EVOC, to
support EVOCs succession of Sellers as operator as to any of the Assets
currently operated by Sellers, subject to the provisions of any applicable
joint operating agreement and subject to the payment by Buyers and/or EVOC of
any required fee or other consideration. It is expressly understood and agreed
that neither Sellers nor any of their Affiliates shall be obligated to
continue operating any of the Assets following the Closing, and Buyers assume
full responsibility for operating (or causing the operation of) all Assets
following Closing. Without implying any obligation on Sellers part to
continue operating any Assets after the Closing, if Sellers or any of their
Affiliates continue to operate any Assets following the Closing at the request
of Buyers or any third party working interest owner, due to constraints of
applicable joint operating agreements, failure of a successor operator to take
over operations or other reasonable cause, such continued operation by such
Person shall be for the

 



      
 

 



 

account of Buyers and at the sole risk, cost and expense of Buyers (including
such Persons overhead) and Buyers release and indemnify Sellers and the other
Seller Indemnified Parties from any liabilities in connection with such
operations, except to the extent caused by gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Sellers or any of their Affiliates.

 



 

(d) _Employees of Sellers_. Buyers and EVOC agree that, without Sellers prior
written consent and excepting only as expressly otherwise provided below,
until one year after the Closing Date, Buyers and EVOC will not, directly or
indirectly, solicit for employment any employee of Sellers or any of their
Affiliates who have provided services in relation to the Assets or with whom
Buyers or EVOC have had contact or who became known to Buyers or EVOC in
connection with Buyers consideration of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except as to the Available Employees (as defined below); _provided
that_ , so long as Buyers and EVOC have not breached their obligations
hereunder, Buyers and EVOC shall not be precluded from hiring any such
employee or other Person who (1) responds to any advertisement to the public
or the industry generally that is not directly or indirectly targeted at
employees of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, or (2) has been
terminated (and not rehired) by Sellers or any of their Affiliates at least
six months prior to commencement of employment discussions between Buyers or
EVOC and such employee or other Person. Buyers, EVOC or their Affiliates, in
their sole discretion, may make offers of employment to those certain of the
Sellers employees listed in **_Schedule 8.3(d)_ **(the " ** _Available
Employees_** "). From and after the Execution Date until the Closing Date,
Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with Buyers and EVOC in permitting Buyers,
EVOC or their Affiliates, upon reasonable notice to Sellers, reasonable access
to the Available Employees to interview such Available Employees during normal
business hours and to communicate any information concerning employment offers
and employment with Buyers, EVOC or their Affiliates. Without limitation to
the foregoing, however, Sellers shall have the right to make competing offers
to the Available Employees to remain employees of Sellers.

 



 

(e) _Government Reviews_. In a timely manner, the Parties and EVOC shall (1)
make all required filings, prepare all required applications and conduct
negotiations with each Governmental Entity as to which such filings,
applications or negotiations are necessary or appropriate in the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and (2) provide such information as
each may reasonably request to make such filings, prepare such applications
and conduct such negotiations. Each Party and EVOC shall reasonably cooperate
with and use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist the other with
respect to such filings, applications, and negotiations. Without limiting the
foregoing, if the Parties determine that a filing under the HSR Act is
required, then, within ten Business Days following the Execution Date, the
Parties will prepare and file with the DOJ and the FTC the notification and
report form required by the HSR Act for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and request early termination of the waiting period thereunder.
Each of the Parties agree to respond promptly to any inquiries from the DOJ or
the FTC concerning such filings and to comply in all material respects with
the filing requirements of the HSR Act. The Parties shall cooperate with each
other and shall promptly furnish all information to the other Parties that is
necessary in connection with Buyers compliance with the HSR Act. The Parties
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably
necessary and appropriate in connection with any HSR Act filing to consummate
the transactions consummated hereby. All filing fees incurred in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with the HSR Act filings made pursuant to this _Section 8.3(e)_
shall be borne one-half by Buyers and one-half by Sellers.

 



 

(f) _Amendment of Schedules_. Buyers agree that Sellers shall have the
continuing right until Closing to add, supplement or amend the Schedules and
Exhibits with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered which, if
existing or known as of the Execution Date or thereafter, would have been
required to be set forth or described in such Schedules. Simultaneously with
any such addition, supplement or amendment, Sellers shall provide copies
thereof to Buyers. For purposes of determining whether the conditions set
forth in _ARTICLE_ 10 have been fulfilled, the Schedules to Sellers
representations and warranties contained in _ARTICLE 6_ shall be deemed to
include only that information contained therein on the Execution Date and
shall be deemed to exclude all information contained in any addition,

 **ARTICLE 9 
TAX MATTERS**

 



 

9.1 _Asset Tax Liability_. Subject to the treatment of real property Taxes,
personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem Taxes (" ** _Property Taxes_**
") provided below, all Asset Taxes for Tax periods that begin before and end
on or after the Effective Time shall be allocated between Buyers and Sellers
as of the Effective Time for all taxable periods that include the Effective
Time. All Asset Taxes that are not Property Taxes shall be allocated to
Sellers to the extent they relate to Hydrocarbon production prior to the
Effective Time and to Buyers to the extent they relate to Hydrocarbon
production on or after the Effective Time. No liability for Asset Taxes shall
duplicate an adjustment to Purchase Price made pursuant to _Section 2.4_.
Property Taxes for each assessment period shall be allocated to Sellers based
on the percentage of the assessment period occurring before the Effective Time
and to Buyers based on the percentage of the assessment period occurring on or
after the Effective Time. Each Party shall promptly furnish to the other Party
copies of any Asset Tax assessments and statements (or invoices therefor from
any applicable Third Party operator of the Assets) received by it, to the

 



      
 

 



 

extent such assessment, statement, or invoice relates to an Asset Tax
allocable to the other Party under this _Section 9.1_. Sellers shall estimate
all Asset Taxes asserted against it that are attributable to the ownership or
operation of the Assets to the extent relating to the period on and after the
Effective Time and through the Closing Date, together with all Subject
Transfer Taxes, and incorporate such estimates into the Preliminary Settlement
Statement. The actual amounts (to the extent the actual amounts differ from
the estimates included in the Preliminary Settlement Statement and are known
at the time of the Final Settlement Statement) shall be accounted for in the
Final Settlement Statement. If the actual amounts are not known at the time of
the Final Settlement Statement, the amounts shall be re-estimated, as
necessary, based on the best information available at the time of the Final
Settlement Statement.

 



 

9.2 _Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use, transfer, stamp, documentary,
registration, value-added and other similar Taxes (including all applicable
real estate transfer Taxes but excluding Taxes on gross income, net income,
gross receipts or margin), duties, levies, recording fees or other
governmental charges incurred by or imposed with respect to the property
transfers undertaken pursuant to this Agreement (" ** _Subject Transfer
Taxes_** ") shall be the responsibility of, and shall be paid by, Buyers. The
Parties shall reasonably cooperate in taking steps that would minimize or
eliminate any Subject Transfer Taxes. Buyers agree to file all Subject
Transfer Tax Returns relating to such Subject Transfer Taxes and to reasonably
consult with Sellers regarding any such filing. Upon filing, Buyers shall
promptly provide Sellers with a copy of all Subject Transfer Tax Returns.

 



 

9.3 _Asset Tax Returns_. Sellers shall provide Buyers with any information
Sellers have that is reasonably necessary for Buyers to file any required Tax
Return with respect to Asset Taxes that are due after the Closing Date. All
such Tax Returns shall be prepared by Buyers in a manner consistent with the
prior practice of Sellers, to the extent permitted by Law and in a manner
consistent with the allocation described in _Section 2.3(a)_, _Section
2.3(b)_ and, if applicable, the final Section 1060 Allocation Schedule. Buyers
shall provide Sellers with copies of completed drafts of such Tax Returns at
least 20 days prior to the due date for filing thereof, to the extent
reasonably practicable, along with supporting work papers, for Sellers
review. Buyers shall consider in good faith any comment that Sellers submit to
Buyers no less than ten days prior to the due date of such Tax Returns. Buyers
shall file all such Tax Returns and, subject to the provisions of _Section
9.1_, pay all Asset Taxes due and payable with respect to such Tax Returns. To
the extent Buyers make any payment of Asset Taxes pursuant to this _Section
9.3_ for which Sellers are liable pursuant to _Section 9.1_ and which exceeds
the amount taken into account in the Final Settlement Statement, Sellers shall
reimburse Buyers for such excess amount no later than ten days after Buyers
deliver a statement to Sellers setting forth the amount of reimbursement to
which Buyers are entitled along with such supporting evidence as is reasonably
necessary to calculate the amount of reimbursement.

 



 

9.4 _Tax Cooperation_. Buyers and Sellers shall each cooperate fully as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the
filing of any Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding (each,
a " ** _Tax Proceeding_** ") with respect to Taxes relating to or in
connection with the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the other Partys request) the provision of such Records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding and
making employees available

 



      
 

 



 

on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder.

 **ARTICLE 13 
POST-CLOSING OBLIGATIONS**

 



 

13.1 _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) _Final Settlement Statement_. As soon as practicable after the Closing,
but in no event later than 120 days after Closing except as may be otherwise
expressly provided herein, (the " ** _Final Settlement Statement Due Date_**
"), Sellers will cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyers, in accordance
with GAAP and customary industry accounting practices, a settlement statement
setting forth each adjustment to the Purchase Price in accordance with

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 2.4_ and showing the calculation of such adjustments and the
resulting final purchase price (the " ** _Final Purchase Price_** " and such
statement, the " ** _Final Settlement Statement_** "). Within 30 days after
its receipt of the Final Settlement Statement, Buyers shall deliver to Sellers
a written report containing any changes that Buyers propose to make to the
Final Settlement Statement. Buyers failure to deliver to Sellers a written
report detailing proposed changes to the Final Settlement Statement by such
date shall be deemed to be an acceptance by Buyers of the Final Settlement
Statement delivered by Sellers. The Parties shall endeavor to agree in writing
with respect to the changes proposed by Buyers, if any, by no later than 60
days after Buyers receipt of Sellers proposed Final Settlement Statement.
Should the Parties fail to agree on the Final Settlement Statement and Final
Purchase Price by such date, either Party may invoke the Dispute resolution
procedures provided for in _Section 13.1(b)_. The date upon which such
agreement is reached or upon which the Final Purchase Price is determined
pursuant to _Section 13.1(b)_ shall be herein called the " ** _Final
Settlement Date_**." If such agreed or determined Final Purchase Price is more
than the Preliminary Purchase Price, Buyers shall pay to Sellers the amount of
such difference by wire transfer in immediately available funds no later than
five Business Days after the Final Settlement Date. If such agreed or
determined Final Purchase Price is less than the Preliminary Purchase Price,
Sellers shall pay the amount of such difference to Buyers by wire transfer in
immediately available funds no later than five Business Days after the Final
Settlement Date.

 



 

(b) _Dispute Resolution_. Within ten days after either Party invokes the
Dispute resolution procedures of this _Section 13.1(b)_ pursuant to _Section
13.1(a)_, the Parties shall mutually appoint an independent expert having the
qualifications specified below (the " ** _Accounting Expert_** "). If the
Parties are unable to mutually agree upon the Accounting Expert within such
ten day period, then the Parties shall, within ten days after the expiration
of such foregoing ten day period, request that the AAA, acting through its
offices in Houston, Texas, appoint the Accounting Expert. The Accounting
Expert shall be a certified public accountant having a minimum of ten years
experience with regard to the types of matters involved in the Dispute, shall
be without any conflicts of interest as to the Parties, and shall not have
been employed by or undertaken more than $50,000 of work, in the aggregate,
for either Party or its Affiliates within the five year period preceding the
submission of the Dispute. For the avoidance of doubt, the Accounting Expert
will function as an expert in accordance with the foregoing procedure, not as
an arbitrator.

 



 

(c) Within 15 days following the appointment of the Accounting Expert, Sellers
shall provide the Accounting Expert with a copy of this Agreement, and each
Party shall provide, both to the Accounting Expert and to each other, a
summary of its position with regard to each such outstanding matter involving
the Final Settlement Statement in a written document of five pages or less per
outstanding Disputed matter. The Parties shall instruct the Accounting Expert
that, within 30 days after receiving the Parties respective submissions, the
Accounting Expert shall render a decision, choosing only either Buyers
position or Sellers position with respect to each Disputed matter.

 



 

(d) Any decision rendered by the Accounting Expert pursuant hereto shall be
final, conclusive and binding on Sellers and Buyers, and will be enforceable
against each Party in any court having jurisdiction hereof, but is not
reviewable by, or appealable to, any court except in the event of fraud. The
Parties shall each bear one-half of the costs of the Accounting

 



      
 

 



 

Expert and of any associated Dispute resolution proceedings. The Final
Settlement Statement shall be re-issued by Sellers if and as necessary to
conform to the Accounting Experts decision.

 



 

13.2 _Records_. Sellers shall make the Records available for pick up by Buyers
within 60 days following the Closing Date. Sellers may retain copies of the
Records, and Sellers shall have the right to review and copy the original
Records during standard business hours and upon reasonable notice to Buyers
for so long as Buyers retain the Records, which shall be a minimum of six
years after the Closing Date. Buyers agree that the Records will be maintained
in compliance with all applicable Laws governing document retention.

 



 

13.3 _Further Assurances_. From time to time after Closing, Sellers, Buyers
and EVOC shall each execute, acknowledge and deliver to each other such
further instruments and take such other action as may be reasonably requested
by such other Party or EVOC, as applicable, at such requesting Partys or
EVOCs cost, as applicable, and as are commercially reasonable to be performed
in order to accomplish more effectively the purposes of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including those post-Closing actions
contemplated by _Section 4.4(a)_ and _Section 4.4(b)_. Promptly after
Closing, Buyers shall: (a) record the Assignments of the Assets and all state
and federal assignments executed at the Closing in all applicable real
property records and/or, if applicable, all state and federal Governmental
Entities, and Buyers shall provide to Sellers copies of such recorded
documents; (b) actively pursue the approval of all Customary Post-Closing
Consents from the applicable Governmental Entities; and (c) actively pursue
all other consents and approvals that may be required in connection with the
assignment of the Assets to Buyers and the assumption of the rights,

not been obtained prior to Closing, _provided that_ Sellers shall reasonably
cooperate with Buyers in obtaining such other consents and approvals, at
Buyers cost.

Agreement, from and after Closing, Sellers and Buyers and EVOCs sole and
exclusive remedies against each other with respect to any and all Claims for
breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement or under any other agreement, contract or
instrument contemplated herein (including the affirmations of the
representations and warranties contained in the certificates delivered by each
Party and EVOC at Closing pursuant to _Section 12.3(d)_ and _Section
12.3(g)_, as applicable) or otherwise in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, are exclusively set forth in _Section 3.3(d)_, _Section
8.2(a)_ and this _Section 14.2_, and if no such right of defense or
indemnification or to be held harmless is expressly provided in _Section
3.3(d)_, _Section 8.2(a)_ and this _Section 14.2_, then such Claims are
hereby waived by the Parties to the fullest extent permitted by Law. Except
for the remedies contained in _Section 3.3(d)_, _Section 8.2(a)_ and this
_Section 14.2_, each Party and EVOC (including as to its respective
Indemnified Parties) releases, remises, and forever discharges the other Party
(including as to its respective Indemnified Parties) and EVOC, as applicable,
from any and all suits, legal or administrative proceedings, Claims, demands,
damages, Losses, costs, liabilities, interest, causes of action and other
obligations whatsoever, in Law or in equity, known or unknown, which such
Parties might now or subsequently may have, based on, relating to, or arising

(e) _Waiver of Non-Compensatory Damages_. None of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from
Sellers, Buyers, or their respective Affiliates or other Representatives, any
special, indirect, consequential, punitive, exemplary, remote or speculative
damages, including damages for lost profits of any kind, arising under or in
connection with this Agreement, any other agreement, contract or instrument
contemplated herein or the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the
extent any such Party suffers such damages (including costs of defense and
reasonable attorneys fees incurred in connection with defending of such
damages) to a Third Party, which damages (including costs of defense and
reasonable attorneys fees incurred in connection with defending against such
damages) shall not be excluded by this provision as to recovery hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, Buyers, on behalf of each of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, and Sellers, on behalf of each of Seller Indemnified
Parties, waive any right to recover any special, indirect, consequential,
punitive, exemplary, remote or speculative damages, including damages for lost
profits of any kind, arising in connection with or with respect to this

14.3 _Claims Procedure_. The defense, indemnification and hold harmless
obligations contained in _Section 3.3(a)_, _Section 8.2(a)_ and _Section
14.2_ shall be implemented as follows:

 



 

(a) _Claim Notice_. The Party seeking defense and indemnification under the
terms of this Agreement (" ** _Indemnified Party_** ") shall submit a written
" ** _Claim Notice_** " to the other Party (" ** _Indemnifying Party_** ")
which, to be effective, must be delivered prior to the end of the survival
period applicable under _Section 14.4_ to the particular Loss that is the
subject of such Claim Notice and must state, to the extent of the information
reasonably available to the Indemnified Party: (1) the amount of each payment
or other obligation claimed by an Indemnified Party to be owing or other Loss
for which the Indemnified Party is seeking defense, indemnification and to be
held harmless, (2) the basis for such Claim, with supporting documentation if
available, and (3) a list identifying, to the extent reasonably possible, each
separate item of Loss for which payment or any other obligation is so Claimed.
Within 30 days of receipt of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party may
provide written notice to the Indemnified Party that it accepts, contests or
rejects the Losses identified in such Claim Notice or its responsibility for
same. Any failure of the Indemnifying Party to provide such notice within such
time period shall be deemed to be a rejection by such Indemnifying Party of
such Losses and its responsibility for same. If the Indemnifying Party objects
to a Claim Notice on the basis that it lacks sufficient information, it shall
promptly request from the Indemnified Party any specific additional
information reasonably necessary for it to assess such indemnification Claim,
and the Indemnified Party shall provide the additional information reasonably
requested to the extent reasonably available to it. Upon receipt of such
additional information, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified
Party of any withdrawal or modification of the objection. All disputed
defense, indemnification and hold harmless Claims shall be resolved by Buyers
and Sellers in accordance with either (A) a mutual agreement between Buyers
and Sellers, which shall be memorialized in writing, or (B) final arbitration
in accordance with _Section 15.12_, which may be

 



      
 

 



 

invoked by either Party at any time when it reasonably believes that the
Parties are unable to reach mutual agreement as to any defense,
indemnification and hold harmless Claim arising under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Information_. Promptly after the Indemnified Party receives notice of a
Claim or legal action by a Third Party that may result in a Loss for which
defense, indemnification and the right to be held harmless may be sought under
this _ARTICLE_ 14 (a " ** _Third Party Claim_** "), the Indemnified Party
shall give written notice of such Third Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party.
If the Indemnifying Party or its counsel so requests, the Indemnified Party
shall furnish the Indemnifying Party with copies of all pleadings and other
material information reasonably available to the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Third Party Claim. At the election of the Indemnifying Party,
made within 30 days after receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall
permit the Indemnifying Party to assume sole management and control of such
Third Party Claim (to the extent only that such Third Party Claim relates to a
Loss for which the Indemnifying Party is liable), including the determination
of all appropriate actions, the negotiation of settlements on behalf of the
Indemnified Party, and the conduct of litigation through attorneys of the
Indemnifying Partys choice; _provided, however_ , that no such settlement can
result in any cost or other liability to the Indemnified Party for which it is
entitled to be defended, indemnified or held harmless hereunder, without its
consent. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume such control, (i) any and
all expense incurred by the Indemnified Party thereafter for investigation,
defense or other handling of the matter shall be borne by the Indemnified
Party, except as to those reasonable expenses incurred in responding to any
request or instruction by the Indemnifying Party and (ii) the Indemnified
Party shall give all reasonable information and assistance, other than
pecuniary, that the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably request as necessary
for the proper defense of such Third Party Claim. In the absence of such an
election, the Indemnified Party will reasonably endeavor to defend, at the
Indemnifying Partys expense, any Third Party Claim to which such Indemnifying
Partys defense, indemnification and hold harmless obligation under this
_ARTICLE_ 14 applies until the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, and,
if the Indemnifying Party fails to assume such defense within the time period
provided above, settle or otherwise resolve the same in the Indemnified
Partys reasonable discretion at the Indemnifying Partys expense and
liability, subject to the Indemnifying Partys consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided, further_ , that if
the Indemnifying Party fails to grant such consent, it shall immediately
assume such defense, indemnification and hold harmless obligation from the
Indemnified Party and reimburse the Indemnified Party for all expenses and
other obligations and liabilities incurred by it prior to such point in time.
If any such Third Party Claim requires immediate action, both the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party will cooperate in good faith to take
appropriate action so as not to jeopardize the defense of such Third Party
Claim or either Partys position with respect to such Third Party Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party is entitled to, and does, assume the defense of any
such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel at its own expense and to participate in the defense thereof,
subject to the Indemnifying Partys sole management and control of the defense
of any such Third Party Claim in its sole good faith judgment; _provided,
however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall
pay the reasonable attorneys

 



      
 

 



 

fees of the Indemnified Party if the Indemnified Partys counsel shall have
advised the Indemnified Party in writing that there is a conflict of interest
that could make it inappropriate under applicable standards of professional
conduct to have common counsel for the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party ( _provided that_ the Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible for
paying for more than one separate firm of attorneys and one local counsel to
represent all of the Indemnified Parties subject to such Third Party Claim).
In the event that the Indemnifying Party has any Dispute regarding whether it
is obligated to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Party as
to any Third Party Claim or other Claim or any Dispute as to the scope of any
such defense, indemnity and hold harmless obligation as to a Third Party Claim
or other Claim, such Dispute shall be resolved in accordance with _Section
15.12_, which Dispute resolution process may be invoked by either Party at any
time when it reasonably believes that the Parties are unable to reach mutual
agreement as to any defense, indemnification or hold harmless Claim arising
under this Agreement.

months. Except for Section _14.4(a)(5)_ , it is the intent of the Parties to
shorten the application of the statute of limitations as set forth in this
_Section 14.4(a)_.

 



 

(b) Representations, warranties, covenants and agreements (and any certificate
related thereto) shall be of no further force and effect after the date of
their expiration; _provided that_ there shall be no termination of any bona
fide Claim asserted through a Claim Notice delivered pursuant to _Section
14.3_ with respect to such a warranty, covenant or agreement prior to its
expiration date.

 



 

(c) The indemnities in (1) _Section 14.2(a)(1)_, _Section 14.2(a)(2)_,

termination date of each respective representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement that is subject to indemnification,

 



      
 

 



 

except in each case as to matters for which a Claim Notice has been delivered
to the Indemnifying Party on or before such termination date, (2) _Section
14.2(a)(4)_ shall survive the Closing for a period of six months, (3) _Section
14.2(a)(3)_ and _Section 14.2(b)(4), _shall survive the Closing until 30 days
after the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable thereto, and (4)
_Section 14.2(b)(1)_ and _Section 14.2(a)(5)_ , shall survive the Closing
without time limit.

 



 

14.5 _Reservation as to Non-Parties_. Nothing herein is intended to limit or
otherwise waive any recourse Buyers, EVOC or Sellers may have against any
Third Party for any obligations or liabilities that may be incurred with
respect to the Assets.

 



 

14.6 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Any payment pursuant to this
_ARTICLE_ 14 shall be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law.

MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

15.1 _Schedules and Exhibits_. The Schedules and Exhibits hereto constitute a

face of the information disclosed therein to Buyers. The disclosure of any

Material Adverse Effect.

15.8 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT, ALL ISSUES ARISING HEREUNDER, ALL
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND ANY ARBITRATION OR EXPERT DISPUTE
RESOLUTION PROCEDURE CONDUCTED PURSUANT HERETO SHALL BE CONSTRUED EXCLUSIVELY

15.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Exhibits, the Schedules, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the documents delivered at Closing by or on
behalf of each Party, EVOC and their Affiliates (collectively, the " **
_Transaction Documents_** ") constitutes the entire agreement and
understanding between the Parties and their respective members, shareholders,
officers, directors and employees with respect to the subject matter hereof,
superseding all prior negotiations, discussions, agreements and understandings
relating to such subject matter.

 



 

15.10 _Binding Effect_. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure
to the benefit of, the Parties, EVOC and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

 



 

15.11 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is intended to benefit
only the Parties and their respective Indemnified Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns; _provided that_ only each of the Parties
will have the right (but not the obligation) to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement on its own behalf or on behalf of any of its respective Indemnified
Parties.

 



 

15.12 _Dispute Resolution_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.3(b)_,
_Section 4.3_, _Section 5.3(f)_ and _Section 13.1(b)_, any Dispute shall be
determined by arbitration administered by the AAA in accordance with its
Commercial Arbitration Rules (the " ** _Rules_** ") and the provisions of this
_Section 15.12_.

 



 

(a) The arbitration shall be conducted by three arbitrators. The place of
arbitration shall be Houston, Texas. Within 30 days of either Party providing
notice to the other Party of a Dispute, each Party to such Dispute shall
appoint one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so appointed shall select the
third and presiding arbitrator within 30 days following appointment of the
second Party-appointed arbitrator. If either Party fails to appoint an
arbitrator within the permitted time period, then the missing arbitrator shall
be selected by the AAA as appointing authority in accordance with the AAA
Rules. Any arbitrator nominated or appointed by the AAA shall be a member of
the Large, Complex Commercial Case Panel of the AAA. In addition to the rules
of the AAA and applicable Law on arbitrator neutrality, no arbitrator shall
have been an employee or consultant to either Party or any of its Affiliates
within the five year period preceding the arbitration, or have any financial
interest in the Dispute.

 



 

(b) All awards of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding, subject
only to grounds and procedures for vacating, modifying or correcting such
under the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 _et seq._ ). Judgment on the
award may be entered and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction
hereunder.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the agreement to arbitrate Disputes in this _Section
15.12 _(except as provided in _Section 2.3(b)_, _Section 4.3_, _Section
5.3(f)_ or _Section 13.1(b)_), either Party may apply to a court for interim
measures pending appointment of the arbitration tribunal, including
injunction, attachment and conservation orders. The Parties agree that seeking
and obtaining such court-ordered interim measures shall not waive a Partys
right to arbitration. Additionally, the arbitrators (or in an emergency the
chairperson acting alone in the event one or more of the other arbitrators is
unable to be involved in a timely fashion) may grant interim measures
including injunctions, attachments and conservation orders in appropriate

 



      
 

 



 

circumstances, which measures may be immediately enforced by court order.
Hearings on requests for interim measures may be held in person, by telephone
or video conference or by other means that permit the Parties to present
evidence and arguments. The arbitrators (or chairperson, as the case may be)
may require either Party to provide appropriate security in connection with
such measures.

 



 

(d) The arbitral tribunal is authorized to award costs, attorneys fees and
expert witness fees and to allocate such costs and fees between the Parties.
The award may include interest from the date of any default, breach or other
accrual of a claim until the arbitral award is paid in full. The arbitrators
may not award indirect, consequential, special, punitive or exemplary damages
except to the extent allowed under the terms of _Section 14.2(e)_. Unless
otherwise directed by the arbitral tribunal, each Party shall pay its own
expenses in connection with the arbitration. The cost of the arbitrators shall
be split evenly between the Parties.

 



 

(e) All negotiations, mediation, arbitration and expert determinations
relating to a Dispute (including a settlement resulting from negotiation or
mediation, an arbitral award, documents exchanged or produced during a
mediation or arbitration proceeding, and memorials, briefs or other documents
prepared for the arbitration) are confidential and may not be disclosed by the
Parties, their respective Affiliates or any of their respective employees,
