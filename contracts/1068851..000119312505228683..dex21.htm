and Prosperity, respectively, in and to any type of property and choses in
action shall be transferred to and vested in Continuing Corporation by virtue
of such Merger without reversion or impairment, without further act or deed
and without any assignment having occurred, but subject to any existing liens
or other encumbrances thereon. The Merger shall have all other effects set
forth in Article 5.06 of the TBCA.



Section 1.5. _Liabilities of Continuing Corporation_. At the Effective Time,
Continuing Corporation shall be liable for all liabilities of SNB and
Prosperity. All debts, liabilities, obligations and contracts of SNB and of
Prosperity, respectively, matured or unmatured, whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise, and whether or not reflected or reserved against on
balance sheets, books of account, or records of SNB or Prosperity, as the case
may be, shall be those of Continuing Corporation and shall not be released or
impaired by the Merger. All rights of creditors and other obligees and all
liens on property of either SNB or Prosperity shall be preserved unimpaired
subsequent to the Merger.



Section 1.6. _Ratification by Shareholders_. This Agreement shall be submitted
to the shareholders of SNB in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
the applicable provisions of law and the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
of SNB. SNB and Prosperity shall proceed expeditiously and cooperate fully in

-3- Section 1.7. _Tax Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto that the
Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)

Section 1.8.  _Modification of Structure_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, Prosperity may elect, subject to the filing of
all necessary applications and the receipt of all required regulatory
approvals, to modify the structure of the transactions contemplated hereby so
long as (i) there are no material adverse federal income tax consequences to
the shareholders of SNB as a result of such modification, (ii) the
consideration to be paid to holders of SNB Stock under this Agreement is not
thereby changed in kind or reduced in amount solely because of such
modification and (iii) such modification will not be likely to materially
delay or jeopardize receipt of any required regulatory approvals. In the
event of such election, the parties agree to execute an appropriate amendment
to this Agreement in order to reflect such election.



II. CONSIDERATION AND EXCHANGE PROCEDURES



Section 2.1. _Merger Consideration_.



(a) Unless otherwise adjusted as provided in any of Sections 2.2(a) or 2.2(b)
hereof, at the Effective Time of the Merger, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each share of SNB Stock
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time, other than any Dissenting
Shares (as defined in Section 2.5 hereof), shall be converted into and
represent the right to receive (i) the Per Share Stock Consideration (as
defined below) and (ii) the Per Share Cash Consideration (as defined below).
The Per Share Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration are collectively
referred to herein as the "Per Share Merger Consideration").



"Per Share Stock Consideration" shall equal that fraction of a share of
Prosperity Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio.



"Prosperity Common Stock" means the Prosperity common stock, $1.00 par value
per share.



"Exchange Ratio" shall equal 0.3577, as may be adjusted pursuant to Section
2.2.



"Per Share Cash Consideration" shall equal $7.50, as may be adjusted pursuant
to Section 2.2.



(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.5 hereof, at the Effective Time,
all such shares of SNB Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each certificate previously representing any such shares shall thereafter
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration.



(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Prosperity will not issue any certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Prosperity Common Stock otherwise issuable pursuant to the Merger.
In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional shares, Prosperity shall pay to
each former holder of SNB Stock otherwise entitled to receive such fractional
share an amount of cash determined by multiplying (i) the Average Share Price
(as



 

-4- defined below) of Prosperity Common Stock by (ii) the fraction of a share of
Prosperity Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a).



"Average Share Price" of Prosperity Common Stock shall be the average of the
daily closing price per share of Prosperity Common Stock on The Nasdaq Stock
Market, Inc. National Market System ("Nasdaq") (as reported in  _The Wall
Street Journal_ or, if not reported thereby, another alternative source as
chosen by Prosperity) for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on
and including the fifth trading day prior to the Closing Date (as defined
in Section 8.1 hereof).



Section 2.2. _Adjustment to Per Share Merger Consideration_.



(a) The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect any change
in the number of shares of Prosperity Common Stock by reason of any stock
dividends or splits, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or
conversion or other similar change in capitalization with respect to
Prosperity Common Stock, received or to be received by holders of Prosperity
Common Stock, when the record date or payment occurs prior to the Effective
Time.



(b) In the event the Average Share Price of Prosperity Common Stock shall
be less than $26.73, SNB may give notice of its intent to terminate this
Agreement as provided in Section 9.1(h) hereof; subject to Prosperitys right,
in its sole and absolute discretion, to (i) increase the Exchange Ratio
(subject to Section 2.4), (ii) increase the Per Share Cash Consideration, or
(iii) increase both the Exchange Ratio (subject to Section 2.4) and the Per
Share Cash Consideration, so that as a result of such adjustments contemplated
in the case of each of clause (i), (ii) and (iii), the Total Merger
Consideration (as defined below) shall be no less than $221,802,928. If
Prosperity elects to make the Walkaway Counter Offer (as defined in Section
9.1(h) hereof), it shall give prompt written notice to SNB of such election
(the "Walkaway Counter Offer Notice"). The Walkaway Counter Offer Notice, if
given, shall set forth the adjustments to the Exchange Ratio and/or Per Share
Cash Consideration, as the case may be, and shall include a calculation of
the adjusted Total Merger Consideration. Any references in this Agreement to
"Exchange Ratio" and "Per Share Cash Consideration" shall thereafter be deemed
to refer to the Exchange Ratio and the Per Share Cash Consideration after
giving effect to any adjustment set forth in the Walkaway Counter Offer
Notice.



"Total Merger Consideration" shall equal the sum of the Total Stock
Consideration, the Total Cash Consideration and the Total Option
Consideration.

 



"Total Stock Consideration" shall equal the product determined by
multiplying (i) the Average Share Price by (ii) the product of (A) the
Exchange Ratio multiplied by (B) the aggregate number of shares of SNB Stock
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.



"Total Cash Consideration" shall equal the product determined by
multiplying (i) the Per Share Cash Consideration by (ii) the aggregate number
of shares of SNB Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.



"Total Option Consideration" shall equal the sum of the Total Cash Option
Consideration and the Total Prosperity Option Consideration.



 

-5- "Total Cash Option Consideration" shall equal the aggregate amount of Cash
Option Consideration (as defined in Section 2.3) paid to the holders of SNB
Stock Options.



"Total Prosperity Option Consideration" shall equal the product determined by
multiplying (i) the aggregate number of Prosperity Options (as defined in
Section 2.3) issued to the holders of the SNB Stock Options, by (ii) the
difference between (A) the Average Share Price minus (B) the weighted average
exercise price of all such Prosperity Options.



Section 2.3. _Treatment of SNB Stock Options_.



(a) At the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of SNB Common Stock
which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto ("SNB Stock
Option") pursuant to the SNB Bancshares, Inc. 2002 Stock Option Plan ("SNB
Stock Option Plan") shall automatically become vested and shall, at the option
of the holder, subject to any adjustment to the number of Prosperity Options
that may be issued as required by Section 2.4 hereof, either (i) be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive the Cash Option Consideration (as
defined below), or (ii) be converted (automatically and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof) into the right to receive the Prosperity
Option Consideration (as defined below).



"Cash Option Consideration" shall mean, with respect to each SNB Stock Option,
a cash payment equal to the difference between (A) the sum of (1)
the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Average Share Price and (2) the Per
Share Cash Consideration and (B) the exercise price of such SNB Stock Option
as listed on _Schedule 3.2(c)._



"Prosperity Option Consideration" shall mean an option (a
"Prosperity Option") to purchase shares of Prosperity Common Stock in an
amount and at an exercise price determined as provided below (and otherwise
subject to the terms of the SNB Stock Option Plan and/or agreements evidencing
the grants thereunder): 



(i) The number of shares of Prosperity Common Stock to be subject to the new
option shall be equal to the number of shares of SNB Common Stock subject to
the original option multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio (as defined
below); and



(ii) The exercise price per share of Prosperity Common Stock under the new
option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of SNB Common Stock
under the original option divided by the Option Exchange Ratio.



(b) The Option Exchange Ratio shall be that number of shares of Prosperity
Common Stock determined by (i) dividing the Per Share Cash Consideration by
the Average Share Price, and (ii) adding that number to the Exchange Ratio.
Based on an assumed Average Share Price of $31.45, Per Share Cash
Consideration of $7.50 and no adjustment to the Exchange Ratio, the Option
Exchange Ratio would equal 0.5962.



(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Prosperity
will not issue a Prosperity Option representing the right to purchase any
fractional share of Prosperity Common Stock. In lieu of the issuance of a
Prosperity Option to purchase such fractional share, Prosperity shall pay a
cash payment determined by multiplying (i) the difference between (A) the
Average Share Price and (B) the exercise price of such Prosperity Option by
(ii) the fraction of a share of Prosperity Common Stock which such
holder would otherwise be entitled to receive upon the exercise of such
Prosperity Option.



 

-6- (d) The adjustment provided herein with respect to any options which are
"incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue
Code, shall be and is intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent
with section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The duration and other terms
of the new option shall be the same as the original option except that all
references to SNB shall be deemed to be references to Prosperity.



Section 2.4. _Ceiling on Issuance of Prosperity Common Stock and Prosperity
Options_.



(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall the aggregate number of shares of Prosperity Common Stock,
including Prosperity Options representing the right to purchase shares of
Prosperity Common Stock, that Prosperity may issue as consideration in
connection with the Merger exceed the Maximum Available Shares (as defined
below).



The "Maximum Available Shares" shall equal twenty percent (20%) of the number
of shares of Prosperity Common Stock outstanding as of the fifth trading day
prior to the Closing Date _less_ one (1) share of Prosperity Common Stock.



(b) If the aggregate number of shares of Prosperity Common Stock
and Prosperity Options that would have otherwise been required to be issued
by Prosperity but for Section 2.4(a) exceeds the Maximum Available Shares, the
number of Prosperity Options to be issued shall be reduced, on a pro rata
basis, and automatically converted into the right to receive the Cash Option
Consideration, until the aggregate number of shares of Prosperity Common Stock
and Prosperity Options no longer exceeds the Maximum Available Shares.



(c) If, after converting all of the Prosperity Options into the right
to receive the Cash Option Consideration in accordance with Section 2.4(b),
the aggregate number of shares of Prosperity Common Stock to be issued in
connection with the Merger still exceeds the Maximum Available Shares, then
the number of such shares of Prosperity Common Stock shall be the Maximum
Available Shares, and the Per Share Cash Consideration shall be increased so
that the Total Merger Consideration shall be no less than $221,802,928.



(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall the Total Stock Consideration be less than 50% of the amount
determined by subtracting the Total Prosperity Option Consideration from the
Total Merger Consideration. In the event that this Section 2.4(d) and Section
2.4(a) cannot be mutually satisfied, this Agreement shall be deemed to have
been terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(h) and Prosperity shall be deemed to
not have made a Walkaway Counter Offer.



Section 2.5. _Dissenting Shares_. Each share of SNB Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the holder of which has
not voted in favor of the Merger and who has delivered a written demand for
payment of the fair value of such shares within the time and in the manner
provided in Article 5.12 of the TBCA, is referred to herein as a "Dissenting
Share." Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of
the Dissenting Shares shall be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Per Share Merger



 

-7- Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 of this Agreement and shall be entitled
only to such rights as are available to such holder pursuant to the
applicable provisions of the TBCA unless and until such holder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his right to
appraisal and payment under the TBCA. Each holder of Dissenting Shares shall
be entitled to receive the value of such Dissenting Shares held by him in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the TBCA; provided, such holder
complies with the procedures contemplated by and set forth in the
applicable provisions of the TBCA. If any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his
dissenters rights, each of such holders Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with the
provisions of this Article II, without any interest thereon.



Section 2.6. _Exchange of Shares_.



(a) Immediately prior to the Closing Date, Prosperity shall deposit or
cause to be deposited in trust with Computershare Investor Services, Inc.,
Denver, Colorado (the "Exchange Agent") (i) certificates representing shares
of Prosperity Common Stock and (ii) cash in an aggregate amount sufficient to
make the appropriate cash payments (A) of the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration set forth in Section 2.1 hereof, (B) to holders of Dissenting
Shares pursuant to Section 2.5 hereof, if any, and (C) to holders of a
fraction of a share of Prosperity Common Stock (such certificates and cash
being referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement.



(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Prosperity shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of an outstanding
certificate or certificates which as of the Effective Time represented shares
of SNB Stock (the "Certificates"), a form letter of transmittal which will
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and contain instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates for payment therefor. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent
of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the amount of cash and number of shares of Prosperity Common Stock provided
in Section 2.1 hereof, and such Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest will be paid or accrued with respect to the shares of Prosperity
Common Stock or cash payable upon surrender of the Certificates. Until
surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.5, each
Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall
represent for all purposes the right to receive the Merger
Consideration without any interest thereon.



(c) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time
with respect to shares of Prosperity Common Stock and payable to the holders
thereof shall be paid to the holder of a Certificate until such holder
surrenders such Certificate to the Exchange Agent in accordance with this
Section 2.6. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this
Section 2.6, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon, which had become
payable after the Effective Time with respect to the shares of Prosperity
Common Stock represented by such Certificate.



 

-8- (d) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer ledger of SNB shall be closed
and there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of SNB of the
shares of SNB Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Prosperity,
they shall be promptly presented to the Exchange Agent and exchanged as
provided in this Section 2.6.



(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of SNB for six
months after the Exchange Agent mails the letter of transmittal pursuant to
Section 2.6 shall be returned to Prosperity upon demand, and any shareholders
of SNB who have not therefore complied with the exchange procedures in this
Article II shall look to Prosperity only, and not the Exchange Agent, for the
payment of any Merger Consideration in respect of such shares.



(f) If any certificate representing shares of Prosperity Common Stock is to
be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be appropriately endorsed
(or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in
proper form (reasonably satisfactory to Prosperity) for transfer, and that the
person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate representing shares of Prosperity Common Stock in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or not payable.



(g) None of Prosperity, SNB, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be
liable to any former holder of shares of SNB Stock for any Prosperity
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.



(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Prosperity or
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
Prosperity or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against Prosperity with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.

Section 3.9. _Real Property Owned or Leased_.



(a) Other than real property acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of

all real property owned or leased by SNB and the Bank (collectively, the "SNB
Real Property"). True and complete copies of all deeds, leases and title

leasehold interest in, the properties referred to in  _Schedule 3.9(a)_, and
all mortgages, deeds of trust and security agreements to which such property
is subject have been or will be furnished or made available to Prosperity.

enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting

and is in full force and effect; there are no existing defaults by SNB or, to
SNBs knowledge, the other party thereunder and there are no allegations or
assertions of such by any party under such agreement or any events that with
notice lapse of time or the happening or occurrence of any other event would
constitute a default thereunder.



(c) To the knowledge of SNB, none of the buildings and structures located on
any SNB Real Property, nor any appurtenances thereto or equipment therein, nor
the operation or maintenance thereof, violates in any manner any restrictive
covenants or encroaches on any property owned by others, nor does any building
or structure of third parties encroach upon any SNB Real Property, except for
those violations and encroachments which in the aggregate could
not reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Effect on SNB. No
condemnation proceeding is pending or, to SNBs knowledge, threatened, which
could reasonably be expected to preclude or materially impair the use of any
SNB Real Property in the manner in which it is currently being used.



(d) SNB and its Subsidiaries have good and indefeasible title to, or a valid
and enforceable leasehold interest in, or a contract vendees interest in, all
SNB Real Property, and such interest is free and clear of all liens, charges
or other encumbrances except (i) statutory liens for amounts not yet
delinquent or which are being contested in good faith through proper
proceedings and (ii) those liens related to real property taxes, local

other matters of record which do not, individually or in the aggregate,
materially adversely affect the use and enjoyment of the relevant real
property.

its business (the "SNB Personalty"), free and clear of all liens, charges or
other encumbrances and except (i) statutory liens for amounts not yet
delinquent or which are being contested in good faith through proper
proceedings and (ii) such other liens, charges, encumbrances and
imperfections of title as do not individually or in the aggregate materially
adversely affect the use and enjoyment of the relevant SNB Personalty. Subject
to ordinary wear and tear, SNB Personalty is in good operating condition and
repair and is adequate for the uses to which it is being put.



Section 3.11. _Environmental Laws_. To the knowledge of SNB, SNB and its
Subsidiaries and any properties or business owned or operated by any of them,

designated as Hazardous Materials (as defined below) under the Environmental
Laws, and they are not subject to any claim or lien under any Environmental
Laws. During the term of ownership by SNB or any of its Subsidiaries, no real
estate currently owned, operated, or leased (including any property acquired

funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment or
benefit to any employee, former employee or director of SNB. _Schedule
3.20(e)_ further sets forth reasonable estimates of severance benefits
payable under the employment or change in control agreements and any amounts

no basis on which any litigation or proceeding could be brought which could

or to be taken in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Neither Prosperity nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
default with respect to any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree, award,
rule or regulation of any court, arbitrator or governmental agency or
instrumentality.



Section 4.6. _Financial Statements_.



(a) Prosperity has furnished or made available to SNB true and complete copies
of its (i) Amendment No. 1 to the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year
ended December 31, 2004 (as amended, the "Annual Report"), as filed with the
SEC, which contains Prosperitys audited consolidated balance sheets as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income,
statements of changes in shareholders equity and statements of cash flow for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 and (ii) Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, as filed with the SEC,
which contains Prosperitys unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related
unaudited consolidated statements of income, statements of changes in
shareholders equity and statements of cash flows as of and for the nine

to above included in the Annual Report and the unaudited financial statements
are collectively referred to herein as the "Prosperity Financial Statements."



(b) Each of the Prosperity Financial Statements fairly presents the
financial position and results of operation of Prosperity at the dates and
for the periods indicated in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis, except in the case of the unaudited Prosperity Financial Statements,
subject to normally recurring year-end audit adjustments and the absence of
notes to such SNB Financial Statements.



(c) As of the dates of the Prosperity Financial Statements referred to above,

such Prosperity Financial Statements or otherwise disclosed in this Agreement,
or in any of the documents delivered to SNB.

January 1, 2002, Prosperity has timely filed all material reports and
statements, together with any amendments required to be made with respect
thereto, that it was required to file with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange
Act. As of their respective dates, each of such reports and statements, (or if
amended, as of the date so amended), were true and correct and complied in
all material respects with the relevant statutes, rules and regulations
enforced or promulgated by the SEC and such reports did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.



Section 4.8. _Prosperity Employee Benefit Plans_. The employee pension benefit
plans and welfare plans (referred to collectively herein as the "Prosperity
Plans") that are sponsored,



 

-28- maintained or contributed to by Prosperity and its Subsidiaries have all been
operated in all material respects in compliance with ERISA, the Code and any
other applicable laws. None of the Prosperity Plans nor any of their
respective related trusts have been terminated (except the termination of any
Prosperity Plan which is in compliance with the requirements of ERISA and
which will not result in any additional liability to Prosperity), and there
has been no "reportable event," as that term is defined in Section 4043 of
ERISA, required to be reported since the effective date of ERISA which has
not been reported, and none of such Prosperity Plans nor their respective
related trusts have incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency," as such
term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA (whether or not waived), since
the effective date of ERISA. The Prosperity Plans are the only employee
pension benefit plans covering employees of Prosperity and its Subsidiaries.
Prosperity and its Subsidiaries will not have any material liabilities with
respect to employee pension benefits, whether vested or unvested as of the
Closing Date, for any of their employees other than under the Prosperity
Plans, other than the benefits due under such plans, and as of the date hereof
the actuarial present value of Prosperity Plan assets of each Prosperity Plan
is not less (and as of the Effective Time of the Merger such present value
will not be less) than the present value of all benefits payable or to be
payable thereunder. Neither Prosperity nor any of its
Subsidiaries contributes or, has within the last six years contributed to,
any multiemployer plan.



Section 4.9. _Compliance with Laws and Regulatory Filings_. Prosperity and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local
laws, rules, regulations and orders applicable to them, except where such
noncompliance would not result in a Material Adverse Effect on Prosperity.
Except for approvals by regulatory authorities having supervisory jurisdiction
over Prosperity and its Subsidiaries, no prior consent, approval
or authorization of, or declaration, filing or registrations with, any person
or regulatory authority is required of Prosperity and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance by Prosperity of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Prosperity and its
Subsidiaries have filed all reports, registrations and statements, together
with any amendments required to be made thereto, that are required to be filed
with the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the TDB or any other regulatory
authority having supervisory jurisdiction over Prosperity and its
Subsidiaries, and such reports, registrations and statements, as finally
amended or corrected, are, to the knowledge of Prosperity and
its Subsidiaries, true and correct in all material respects.



Section 4.10. _Taxes_. Prosperity and its Subsidiaries have filed with the
appropriate governmental authorities all material Tax Returns and reports
required to be filed, and have paid all Taxes and assessments due and
owing (whether or not shown on any Tax Return). At the time of filing, all
such Tax Returns were correct and complete in all material respects. Neither
Prosperity nor any of its Subsidiaries has executed or filed with any
governmental authority any agreement extending the period for assessment and
collection of any Tax. Neither Prosperity nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to any pending action or proceeding by any governmental authority for
assessment or collection of Taxes, nor has any written claim for assessment
or collection of Taxes been asserted against Prosperity or any of its
Subsidiaries.



Section 4.11. _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since September 30, 2005, (i)
Prosperity and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses in
the ordinary and usual course consistent with prudent banking practices
(excluding the incurrence of expenses related to this



 

-29- Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) and (ii) no event has
occurred or circumstance arisen that, individually or in the aggregate, has
had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Prosperity.



Section 4.12. _Brokers, Finders and Financial Advisors_. Neither Prosperity
nor any of its officers, directors or employees have employed any broker,
finder, financial advisor or investment banker or incurred any liability for
any brokerage, financial advisory, investment banking or other fees or
commissions in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. 



Section 4.13. _Accounting Controls_. Prosperity has devised and maintained a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance that: (i) all material transactions are executed in accordance with
general or specific authorization of the Board of Directors and/or the duly
authorized executive officers of Prosperity; (ii) all material transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP consistently applied with respect to institutions such
as Prosperity or other criteria applicable to such financial statements, and
to maintain proper accountability for items therein; (iii) control of the
material properties and assets of Prosperity is permitted only in accordance
with general or specific authorization of the Board of Directors and/or the
duly authorized executive officers of Prosperity; and (iv) the recorded
accountability for items is compared with the actual levels at reasonable
intervals and appropriate actions taken with respect to any differences.



Section 4.14.  _Regulatory Approvals_. Prosperity has no reason to believe
that it will not be able to obtain all requisite regulatory approvals
necessary to consummate the transactions set forth in this Agreement.



Section 4.15. _Insurance_. All insurance policies owned by Prosperity or by
which Prosperity or any of its properties or assets is covered are in full
force and effect. All such policies, taken together, provide adequate
insurance coverage for the assets and operations of Prosperity for all
material risks to which Prosperity is normally exposed in the operation of
its business. No insurance has been refused with respect to any operations,
properties, or assets of Prosperity nor has any insurance been limited by any
insurance carrier that has carried, or received any application for any such
insurance during the last three years. Prosperity has no reason to believe
that existing insurance coverage cannot be renewed as and when the same shall
expire upon terms and conditions as favorable as those presently in effect,
other than possible increases in premiums or unavailability of coverage that
does not result from any extraordinary loss experience on the part of
Prosperity.



Section 4.16. _Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance_. Prosperity and its Subsidiaries
and any of the officers and directors of Prosperity and its Subsidiaries, in
their capacities as such, are in compliance, in all material respects, with
the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and
the related rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the SEC and
Nasdaq. Prosperity is actively taking steps to ensure that it will be in
compliance with other applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
related rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the SEC and Nasdaq
not currently in effect upon and at all times after the effectiveness of such
provisions.



 

-30- Section 4.17. _Prosperity Information_. None of the information relating to
Prosperity and its Subsidiaries that is provided by Prosperity for inclusion
in (i) the Proxy Statement will contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, and (ii) the Registration Statement will,
at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement
thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.

financial and operating data and other information as to the business and
properties of SNB as Prosperity shall, from time to time, reasonably request.

Section 5.4. _Information for Regulatory Applications and SEC Filings_. To
the extent permitted by law, SNB shall furnish Prosperity with all information

Directors of SNB determines, based on the advice of counsel, that the failure
to furnish such information or participate in such negotiations or discussions
would or could reasonably be deemed to constitute a breach of the fiduciary
or legal obligations of SNBs Board of Directors to its shareholders. SNB
agrees to notify Prosperity of any such unsolicited acquisition proposal
orally, within one (1) business day, and in writing, within two (2) business

 



 

-35- days, of its receipt, and provide reasonable detail as to the identity of the

Prosperity, consistent with GAAP, immediately prior to Closing, make such
accounting entries as Prosperity may reasonably request in order to conform
the accounting records of SNB to the accounting policies and practices of
Prosperity. No such adjustment shall of itself constitute or be deemed to be a
breach, violation or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty,
covenant, condition or other provision or constitute grounds for termination
of this Agreement or be an acknowledgment by SNB (i) of any adverse
circumstances for purposes of determining whether the conditions to
Prosperitys obligations under this Agreement have been satisfied, or (ii)
that such adjustment is required for purposes of determining satisfaction of
the condition to Prosperitys obligations under this Agreement set forth in
Section 10.3 hereof or (iii) that such adjustment has any bearing on the
number of shares of Prosperity Common Stock issuable hereunder. No adjustment
required by Prosperity shall (a) require any prior filing with or approval by
any governmental agency or regulatory authority or (b) violate any law, rule
or regulation applicable to SNB or the Bank.

from the date hereof through the Effective Time, it will not sell or purchase
any investment securities in excess of $100,000 in the aggregate, or

securities that may be identified to SNB by Prosperity (the "Identified
Securities"). SNB shall inform Prosperity of all pending sales of the
Identified Securities, including the proposed sales price, and SNB shall
not sell any of the Identified Securities without Prosperitys prior
approval. Prosperitys failure to approve the proposed sale of any Identified

sales of the Identified Loans, including the proposed sales price, and SNB
shall not sell any of the Identified Loans without Prosperitys prior
approval. Prosperitys failure to approve the proposed sale of any Identified
Loans shall not be deemed to be a failure by SNB to satisfy the covenant set
forth in this Section 5.12.



Section 5.13. _Consents to Assign and Use Leased Premises_. With respect to
the leases disclosed in _Schedule 3.9(a)_ , SNB shall use its commercially
reasonable best efforts, and Prosperity shall reasonably cooperate with SNB
at SNBs request, to obtain all consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers
or similar affirmations necessary to transfer and assign all right, title and

and deliver to Prosperity, at least ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date,

SNB Stock Option shall either (i) be converted, in accordance with its terms,
into an option to purchase a number of shares of Prosperity Common Stock equal
to the number of shares of SNB Common Stock subject to the original option
multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share equal
to the exercise price per share of the original option divided by the Option
Exchange Ratio, consistent with the provisions of Section 2.3 hereof or (ii)
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the cash payment set
forth in Section 2.3 hereof.



Section 5.16. _Environmental Investigation; Rights to Terminate Agreement_



(a) Prosperity and its consultants, agents and representatives shall have the
right to the same extent that SNB or the Bank has such right (at Prosperitys
cost and expense), but not the obligation or responsibility, to inspect any
SNB or Bank property, including, without limitation, conducting asbestos
surveys and sampling, environmental assessments and investigation, and other
non-invasive or non-destructive environmental surveys and
analyses ("Environmental Inspections") at any time on or prior to thirty (30)
days after the date of this Agreement. If, as a result of any such
Environmental Inspection, further investigation ("secondary investigation")
including, without limitation, test borings, soil, water, asbestos or other
sampling, is deemed desirable by Prosperity, Prosperity shall (i) notify SNB
of any property for which it intends to conduct such a secondary investigation
and the reasons for such secondary investigation, (ii) submit a work plan to
SNB for such secondary investigation, for which Prosperity agrees to afford
SNB the ability to comment on and Prosperity agrees to consider all such
comments (and negotiate in good faith any such comments) and (iii) conclude
such secondary investigation, on or prior to sixty (60) days after the date of
this Agreement. Prosperity shall give reasonable notice to SNB of such
secondary investigations, and SNB may place reasonable restrictions on the
time and place at which such secondary investigations may be carried out.



(b) SNB agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Prosperity for any claims for
damage to property, or injury or death to persons, made as a result of
any Environmental Inspection or secondary investigation conducted by
Prosperity or its agents, to the extent such damage or injury is attributable
to the negligent or wrongful actions or omissions of SNB or its



 

-38- agents. Prosperity agrees to indemnify and hold harmless SNB for any claims
for damage to property, or injury or death to persons, to the extent
attributable to the negligent or wrongful actions or omissions of Prosperity
or its agents in performing any Environmental Inspection or secondary
investigation. Prosperity shall not have any liability or responsibility of
any nature whatsoever for the results, conclusions or other findings related
to any Environmental Inspection, secondary investigation or other
environmental survey. If this Agreement is terminated, then except as
otherwise required by law, reports to any governmental authority of the
results of any Environmental Inspection, secondary investigation or other
environmental survey shall be made by SNB and not by Prosperity. Prosperity
shall make no such report prior to Closing unless required to do so by law,
and in such case, Prosperity will give SNB reasonable prior notice of
Prosperitys intentions.



(c) Prosperity shall have the right to terminate this Agreement within ninety
(90) days after the date of this Agreement if (i) the results of such
Environmental Inspection, secondary investigation or other environmental
survey are disapproved by Prosperity because the Environmental Inspection,
secondary investigation or other environmental survey identifies violations or
potential violations of Environmental Laws that could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on SNB; (ii) any past or present event,
condition or circumstance that would require remedial or cleanup action under
Environmental Laws involving an expenditure in excess of $1,000,000 or that
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on SNB; (iii)
the Environmental Inspection, secondary investigation or other environmental
survey identifies the presence of any underground or above ground storage
tank in, on or under any property that is not shown to be in compliance with
all Environmental Laws applicable to the tank either now or at a future time
certain, or that has had a release of petroleum or some other Hazardous
Material that has not been cleaned up to the satisfaction of the relevant
governmental authority or any other party with a legal right to compel
cleanup, the effect of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on SNB; or (iv) the Environmental Inspection, secondary
investigation or other environmental survey identifies the presence of any
asbestos-containing material in, on or under any property which is not
disclosed in _Schedule 3.11_ , the removal or abatement of which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on SNB.



(d) SNB agrees to make available upon request to Prosperity and its
consultants, agents and representatives all documents and other material
relating to environmental conditions of any property including, without
limitation, the results of other environmental inspections and surveys to the
extent such documents are in the actual possession of SNB. SNB also agrees
that all engineers and consultants who prepared or furnished such reports may
discuss such reports and information with Prosperity and, at Prosperitys
cost, shall be entitled to certify the same in favor of Prosperity and its
consultants, agents and representatives and make all other data available to
Prosperity and its consultants, agents and representatives.

shares of Prosperity Common Stock subject to such options and shall use its
best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement (and

as such options remain outstanding. With respect to those individuals who
subsequent to the Merger will be subject to the reporting requirements under
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, where applicable, Prosperity shall

or the Bank to the fullest extent which such Indemnified Parties would be
entitled under the Certificate of Incorporation of SNB or the Articles of
Association of the Bank, as applicable, in each case as in effect on the date
hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, Prosperity also agrees that
limitations on liability existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as
provided in the Certificate of Incorporation of SNB or the equivalent document

full force and effect from and after the Effective Time.



(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
6.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure
to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may
have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not actually prejudice

proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume
such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are

Party shall pay, promptly as statements therefor are received, the reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties (which may not
exceed one firm in any jurisdiction), (ii) the Indemnified Parties will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (iii) the Indemnifying Party

applicable laws and any applicable contractual obligations, Prosperity will
(i) afford the executive officers and authorized representatives (including

investigation as it shall desire to make of the affairs of Prosperity, and
(ii) furnish SNB with such additional financial and operational data and other
information as to the business and properties of Prosperity as SNB shall, from

regulatory accounting principles, as applicable) applied on a consistent
basis with previous accounting periods. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement, SNB will return to Prosperity all documents and other
information obtained pursuant hereto and will keep confidential any
information obtained pursuant to this Agreement.

other entity for any reason or purpose whatsoever, other than in connection
with the regulatory notice and application process or, after termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof, use such Subject Information
for its own purposes or for the benefit of any person, firm, corporation,
association, or other entity under any circumstances. The term "Subject
Information" does not include any information that (i) at the time of
disclosure or thereafter is generally available to and known to the public,
other than by a breach of this Agreement by the disclosing party, (ii) was
available to the disclosing party on a nonconfidential basis from a source
other than the nondisclosing party or (iii) was independently acquired or
developed without violating any obligations of this Agreement.



Section 7.3. _Publicity_. Except as otherwise required by applicable law or
in connection with the regulatory application process, as long as this
Agreement is in effect, neither Prosperity nor SNB shall, nor shall they
permit any of their officers, directors or representatives to, issue or cause
the publication of any press release or public announcement with respect to,
or otherwise make any public announcement concerning, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the consent of the other party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.



Section 7.4. _Employee Benefit Plans_.



(a) SNB shall execute and deliver such instruments and take such other
actions as Prosperity may reasonably require in order to cause the amendment
or termination of any of its employee benefit plans on terms satisfactory to
Prosperity and in accordance with applicable law and effective no later than
the Closing Date. Prosperity agrees that the employees of SNB who continue
their employment after the Closing Date (the "SNB Employees") will be entitled
to participate as newly hired employees in the employee benefit plans and
programs maintained for employees of Prosperity and Prosperity Bank, in
accordance with the respective terms of such plans and programs, and
Prosperity shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to facilitate
coverage of SNB Employees in such plans and programs from and after the
Closing Date, subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Section 7.4.



(b) Each SNB Employee will be entitled to credit for prior service with SNB
for all purposes under the employee welfare benefit plans and other employee
benefit plans and programs (including any severance programs but excluding
stock option plans), sponsored by Prosperity or Prosperity Bank to the extent
SNB sponsored a similar type of plan in which SNB Employees participated
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Any eligibility waiting period and pre-
existing condition exclusion applicable to such plans and programs shall be
waived with



 

-44- respect to each SNB Employee and their eligible dependents. For purposes of
determining a SNB Employees benefits for the calendar year in which the
Merger occurs under Prosperitys vacation program, any vacation taken by a SNB
Employee before the Closing Date for the calendar year in which the Merger
occurs will be deducted from the total Prosperity vacation benefit available
to such SNB Employee for such calendar year. Prosperity further agrees to
credit each SNB Employee and their eligible dependents for the plan year
during which coverage under Prosperitys group health plan begins, with any
deductibles already incurred during such year, under SNBs group health plan.



(c) Each SNB Employee shall be entitled to credit for past service with SNB
for the purpose of satisfying any eligibility or vesting periods applicable to
Prosperitys employee benefit plans which are subject to Sections 401(a) and
501(a) of the Code (including, without limitation, Prosperitys 401(k) Profit
Sharing Plan).



Section 7.5. _Attendance at Certain Board Meetings_. In order to facilitate
the continuing interaction of Prosperity with SNB and the Bank, and in order
to keep each party fully advised of all ongoing activities of the other party,
subject to the limitation in this Section 7.5, each party agrees to allow the
other party (the "Visiting Party") to designate two representatives (who
shall be officers of the Visiting Party), each of whom will be allowed to
attend as an invited guest and fully monitor all regular and called meetings
of the board of directors and loan and discount and asset liability management
committees of the other party (including, but not limited to, meetings of the
officers loan committee of the other party). Each such party, as the case may
be, shall promptly give the Visiting Party prior notice by telephone of all
called meetings. Such representatives shall be bound by Visiting Partys
confidentiality obligations under this Agreement and shall have no right to
vote and may be excluded from sessions of the board of directors or loan or
investment committee during which there is being discussed (i) matters
involving this Agreement, (ii) information or material which the party hosting
the meeting is required or obligated to maintain as confidential under
applicable laws or regulations, (iii) matters which the Chairman of the Board
determines in his or her reasonable discretion would constitute a conflict of
interest or (iv) pending or threatened litigation or investigations if, in the
opinion of counsel to the party hosting the meeting, the presence of such
representative would or might adversely affect the confidential nature of or
any privilege relating to any matters to be discussed. No attendance by
representatives of the Visiting Party at the other partys board or
committee meetings under this Section 7.5 or knowledge gained or deemed to
have been gained by virtue of such attendance will affect any of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement made by the party hosting the
meeting. If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are disapproved
by any regulatory authority whose approval is required or the Agreement is
otherwise terminated prior to the Effective Time, then the Visiting Partys
designees will no longer be entitled to notice of and permission to attend
such meetings.



VIII. CLOSING

SNB, to the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, or such

IX. TERMINATION



Section 9.1. _Termination_.



(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, this
Agreement may be terminated and the Merger contemplated hereby may be
abandoned by action of the Board of Directors of Prosperity or SNB at any time
prior to the Effective Time if:



(i) any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or other United
States (federal or state) governmental body shall have issued an order,
decree or ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall
have been final and non-appealable;

 



(ii) any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are disapproved
by any regulatory authority or other person whose approval is required to
consummate any of such transactions; or



(iii) the Merger shall not have become effective on or before the one hundred
and eightieth (180th) day following the date of this Agreement, unless
approval of the appropriate bank regulatory agencies and the declaration of
effectiveness of the Registration Statement by the SEC, has not been received
within the time required to



 

-46- consummate the Merger on or before the 180th day, in which case the Merger
shall not have become effective on or before the two hundred and tenth (210th)
day following the date of this Agreement, or such later date as shall have
been approved in writing by the Boards of Directors of Prosperity and
SNB; provided, however, that the right to terminate under this Section
9.1(a)(iii) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any
material obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or has
resulted in, the failure of the Merger to become effective on or before such
date;



(b) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by the
Board of Directors of SNB if (i) Prosperity shall fail to comply in any
material respect with any of its covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, or if any of the representations or warranties of Prosperity
contained herein shall be inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) if the
conditions set forth in Article XI have not been met by Prosperity or waived
by SNB. In the event the Board of Directors of SNB desires to terminate this
Agreement because of an alleged breach or inaccuracy as provided in clause (i)
above, such Board of Directors must notify Prosperity in writing of its intent
to terminate stating the reason therefor. Prosperity shall have fifteen (15)
days from the receipt of such notice to cure the alleged breach or inaccuracy.



(c) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by
action of the Board of Directors of Prosperity if (i) SNB shall fail
to comply in any material respect with any of its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, or if any of the representations or warranties of
SNB contained herein shall be inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) if
the conditions set forth in Article X have not been met by SNB or waived by
Prosperity. In the event the Board of Directors of Prosperity desires to
terminate this Agreement because of an alleged breach or inaccuracy as
provided in clause (i) above, such Board of Directors must notify SNB in
writing of its intent to terminate stating the cause therefor. SNB shall have
fifteen (15) days from the receipt of such notice to cure the alleged breach
or inaccuracy.



(d) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing
by either Prosperity or SNB if the approval of the shareholders of SNB
contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been obtained by reason of the
failure to obtain the required vote at the SNB Shareholder Meeting at which
they consider the Agreement. 



(e) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing upon
the mutual written consent of Prosperity and SNB and the approval of such
action by their respective Boards of Directors.



(f) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by the
Board of Directors of SNB if prior to the Effective Time, SNB shall
have received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 9.3(c))
and SNBs Board of Directors determines in its good faith judgment and in the
exercise of its fiduciary duties, based as to legal matters on the advice of
independent legal counsel and as to financial matters on the written advice
of Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc. or an investment banking firm of national
reputation, that such alternative Acquisition Proposal (if consummated
pursuant to its terms) is a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 9.3(d))
and that the failure to terminate this Agreement and accept such Superior
Proposal would be inconsistent with the proper exercise of such fiduciary
duties; provided, however, that termination under this clause (f) shall not
be deemed effective until payment of the Termination Fee required by Section
9.3.



 

-47- (g) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by the
Board of Directors of Prosperity if SNB Board of Directors shall have (i)
resolved to accept an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) withdrawn or modified, in
any manner that is adverse to Prosperity, its recommendation or approval of
this Agreement or the Merger or recommended to SNB shareholders acceptance or
approval of any alternative Acquisition Proposal, or shall have resolved to do
the foregoing.



(h) This Agreement may be terminated by the Board of Directors of SNB at any
time during the five-day period following the fifth trading day prior to
the Closing Date, if the Average Share Price of Prosperity Common Stock shall
be less than $26.73 and subject to this Section 9.1(h). If SNB elects to
exercise its termination right pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence,
it shall give prompt written notice to Prosperity; provided that such notice
of its intent to terminate may be withdrawn at any time within the
aforementioned five-day period. For a period of five (5) business days from
the date of receipt of such notice, Prosperity shall have the option, but not
the obligation, to increase the Total Merger Consideration as set forth in
Section 2.2(b) hereof ("Walkaway Counter Offer"). If Prosperity elects to make
the Walkaway Counter Offer, it shall give the Walkaway Counter Offer Notice
to SNB during the five business day period promptly as provided in Section
2.2, whereupon the notice of termination previously sent by SNB shall be null
and void and of no effect, SNB shall no longer have the right to terminate
the Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(h) and this Agreement shall remain
in effect in accordance with its terms (except for the adjustments to the
Exchange Ratio and/or Per Share Cash Consideration, as the case may be). Any
references in this Agreement to "Exchange Ratio" and "Per Share Cash
Consideration" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio and
the Per Share Cash Consideration after giving effect to any adjustment
set forth in the Walkaway Counter Offer Notice.



Section 9.2.  _Effect of Termination_. Except as provided in Section 9.3, in
the event of termination of this Agreement by either Prosperity or SNB as
provided in Section 9.1 or the abandonment of the Merger without breach by any
party hereto, this Agreement (other than Section 7.2) shall become void and
have no effect, without any liability on the part of any party or its
directors, officers or shareholders. Nothing contained in this Section 9.2
shall relieve any party hereto of any liability for a breach of this
Agreement.



Section 9.3.  _Termination Fee_. To compensate Prosperity for entering into
this Agreement, taking actions to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereunder and incurring the costs and expenses related thereto and other
losses and expenses, including foregoing the pursuit of other opportunities
by Prosperity, SNB and Prosperity agree as follows:



(a) Provided that Prosperity shall not be in material breach of any covenant
or obligation under this Agreement (which breach has not been cured
promptly following receipt of written notice thereof by SNB specifying in
reasonable detail the basis of such alleged breach), SNB shall pay to
Prosperity the sum of $10,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") if this Agreement is
terminated (i) by SNB under the provisions of Section 9.1(f), (ii) by either
Prosperity or SNB under the provisions of Section 9.1(d), if at the time of
any failure by the



 

-48- shareholders of SNB to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger there
shall exist an Acquisition Proposal with respect to SNB and, within twelve
months of the termination of this Agreement, SNB enters into a definitive
agreement with any third party with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal
or (iii) by Prosperity under the provisions of Section 9.1(g). The payment of
the Termination Fee shall be Prosperitys sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to termination of this Agreement as set forth in this Section 9.3(a).



(b) Any payment required by paragraph (a) of this Section 9.3 shall become
payable within two (2) business days after receipt by the non-terminating
party of written notice of termination of this Agreement; provided, however,
that if such termination payment is required pursuant to clause (ii)
of Section 9.3(a), then such termination payment shall become payable within
two (2) business days after the execution and delivery by SNB of such
definitive agreement.



(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means a written
offer or proposal which contains a fixed price per share or a mathematically
ascertainable formula for calculating a price per share for the SNB Common
Stock or SNB Class B Stock regarding any of the following (other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) involving SNB or any Subsidiary:
(i) any merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange,
recapitalization, business combination, liquidation, dissolution or other
similar transaction involving any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge,
transfer or other disposition of, all or substantially all of the assets or
equity securities or deposits of, SNB or any Subsidiary, in a single
transaction or series of related transactions which could reasonably be
expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or materially delay the
completion of the Merger; (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer for all or
substantially all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of SNB or the
filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act in connection
therewith; or (iii) any public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention
to do any of the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing.



(d) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal made by a third person that the Board of Directors of
SNB determines in its good faith judgment to be more favorable to SNBs
shareholders than the Merger (taking into account, in good faith, the written
opinion, with only customary qualifications, of SNBs independent financial
advisor that the value of the consideration to SNBs shareholders provided for
in such proposal exceeds the value of the consideration to SNBs shareholders
provided for in the Merger) and for which financing, to the extent required,
is then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of SNB (taking into account, in good faith, the written advice of
SNBs independent financial advisor), is reasonably capable of being obtained
by such third person.

-54- Agreement may change its address for the giving of notice specified above by
giving notice as herein provided. Notices permitted to be sent via e-mail
shall be deemed delivered only if sent to such persons at such e-mail
addresses as may be set forth in writing.



Section 13.6. _Controlling Law_. All questions concerning the validity,
operation and interpretation of this Agreement and the performance of the
obligations imposed upon the parties hereunder shall be governed by the laws
of the State of Texas, without taking into account provisions regarding choice
of law.



Section 13.7. _Headings_. The headings and titles to the sections of this

hereof or affect the construction or interpretation of any provision hereof.

the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards
of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance
with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.



Section 13.9. _Severability_. Any provision hereof prohibited by or unlawful
or unenforceable under any applicable law or any jurisdiction shall as to such
jurisdiction be ineffective, without affecting any other provision of
this Agreement, or shall be deemed to be severed or modified to conform with
such law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in
force, provided that the purpose of the Agreement can be effected. To the

waived, they are hereby waived, to the end that this Agreement be deemed to be
a valid and binding agreement enforceable in accordance with its terms.

agreements heretofore made between the parties hereto are merged in this
Agreement which (together with the Disclosure Schedules, exhibits and any
agreements executed by the parties hereto contemporaneously with or subsequent
to the execution of this Agreement) shall be the sole expression of the
agreement of the parties respecting the Merger.



Section 13.12. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall
be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.



 

-55- Section 13.13. _Binding on Successors_. Except as otherwise provided herein,

parties and their respective heirs, executors, trustees, administrators,
guardians, successors and assigns.
