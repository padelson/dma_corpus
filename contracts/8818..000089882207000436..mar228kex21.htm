  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of March 22, 2007, among AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), ALPHA ACQUISITION CORP., a New York corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "), and PAXAR CORPORATION, a New York corporation (the " _Company_ "). Capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in the sections listed opposite such terms in Annex I.

 

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of the Company, Parent and Sub has adopted this Agreement, and deemed it advisable and in the best interests of their respective shareholders to consummate the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Company (" _Company_ _Common Stock_ "), other than (i) shares of Company Common Stock directly owned by the Company, as treasury stock, or by Parent or Sub, and (ii) Company Restricted Stock will be converted into the right to receive $30.50 in cash.

 

 WHEREAS, as an inducement to and condition of Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, Arthur Hershaft will enter into a voting and support agreement (the " _Voting Agreement_ "), the form of which is attached as Annex II, the Board of Directors of the Company has approved the entry by Arthur Hershaft into the Voting Agreement, and the Voting Agreement will be entered into concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

    ARTICLE I 
  
  _The Merger_ 
--- 

 

 SECTION 1.01. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Business Corporation Law of the State of New York (the " _NYBCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ __").

 

 SECTION 1.02. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the first Business Day after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver of those conditions), at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 W. 52nd St., New York, New York 10019, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing
occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

 

 SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as promptly as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall deliver a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the NYBCL and shall make all other filings and recordings required under the NYBCL. The Merger shall become effective at such date and time as the Certificate of Merger is filed by the department of state of the State of New York or at such subsequent date (which shall not be later than 30 days after filing) as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_."

 

 SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 906 of the NYBCL.

 

 SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

 (b) The Bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

 SECTION 1.06. _Directors_. From and after the Effective Time, the directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

 

 SECTION 1.07. _Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

 

    ARTICLE II 
--- 

 

    _Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the_ 
  _Constituent Corporations; Exchange Fund;_ 
  _Company Equity Awards_ 
--- 

 

 SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock (other than the requisite adoption of the Merger by the stockholders of the Company) or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Sub (other than the requisite adoption of the Merger by Parent as the sole stockholder of Sub, which adoption has been obtained): 

    (a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

  (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share
of Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company, as treasury
stock, or by Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

  (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 2.01(b)_ and Company
Restricted Stock) shall be converted into the right to receive $30.50 in cash,
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all
such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any declared dividends with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that remain unpaid as of the Effective Time and that are due to
such holder.

 

  (d) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

 

  SECTION 2.02. _Exchange Fund_. (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing
Date, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of
the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II and, in
connection therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Company. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, in
trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock cash in
U.S. dollars an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 

  (b) _Certificate Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time, but in any event within two Business Days thereafter,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which
shall otherwise be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of a
Certificate shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificate,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by

   the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of
cash which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented
by such Certificate shall have been converted into the right to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_ , and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a person other
than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any
cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II.

 

  (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash
paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificates, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations
obligation to pay all dividends that may have been declared by the Company
and that remain unpaid at the Effective Time. At the close of business on the
day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to
the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery
of cash to the holder thereof as provided in this Article II.

 

  (d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for
12 months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand,
and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their
shares for payment in compliance with this Article II shall thereafter look
only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their
claims for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article
II.

 

  (e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other person shall be liable to
any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a
public official in compliance with any applicable state, federal or other
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have
been surrendered prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration
would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such
Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
immediately prior to such time become the property of Parent, free and clear
of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 

  (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the
cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States
of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and

   Poors, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$500 million (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that
are then publicly available). Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be paid solely to Parent, and all fees and expenses of
the Paying Agent in connection with the satisfaction of its
responsibilities contemplated by this Article II shall be paid by Parent.
Nothing contained herein and no investment losses resulting from investment of
the Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any holder of Certificates to
receive the Merger Consideration due to such holder as provided herein.

 

  (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond or surety in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall
deliver in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto.

 

  (h) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable.

 

  SECTION 2.03. _Company Stock Options and Company Equity Awards_. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action necessary (including
any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the Companys Board of
Directors or a committee thereof) such that:

 

  (a) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall cease to represent
a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted
automatically into an option to purchase shares of common stock, par value $1
per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Shares_ ") in an amount and at an
exercise price determined as provided in this _Section 2.03(a)_ (and
otherwise subject to the terms of the applicable equity-based compensation
plans and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder) (a " _Parent Stock
Option_ "). The number of Parent Common Shares to be subject to each Parent
Stock Option shall be equal to (w) the product of (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (B) the Merger Consideration, divided by (x) the
average closing price of a Parent Common Share on the New York Stock Exchange
(as reported on the NYSE Composite Transactions Reports) for the 20 trading
days immediately preceding (but not including) the Closing Date (the "
_Average Parent Stock Price_ "); _provided_ that any fractional shares
resulting

   from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.
The exercise price per Parent Common Share under each Parent Stock Option
shall be equal to (y) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
at which such Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by (z) the quotient obtained by dividing the Merger
Consideration by the Average Parent Stock Price; _provided_ that such exercise
price shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Company Stock Option which is an "incentive stock option"
shall be adjusted in a manner consistent with Section 424 of the Code, and
the regulations promulgated thereunder, so as not to constitute a
modification, extension or renewal of the option within the meaning of Section
424(h) of the Code. The vesting schedule for each of the Company Stock
Options shall not be accelerated solely as a result of the Merger and such
Company Stock Options shall be considered to be assumed by Parent as of the
Effective Time for all purposes under the applicable plans, subject to
the existing vesting schedules and other terms of the applicable grant,
provided that the vesting of unvested Company Stock Options shall be
accelerated upon a termination without Cause of the applicable award holders
employment prior to the 24-month anniversary of the Effective Time.

 

  (b) Any Company Restricted Stock outstanding as of the Effective Time
shall be converted into a number of Parent Common Shares equal to (i) the
product of (x) the number of such restricted Company Common Shares and (y)
the Merger Consideration, divided by (ii) the Average Parent Stock Price (
_provided_ that any fractional shares resulting from such calculation shall be
rounded up to the nearest whole number), and shall otherwise remain subject
to the terms (including vesting terms) of the applicable equity-based
compensation plans and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder, _provided_
that the vesting of Company Restricted Stock shall be accelerated upon a
termination without Cause of the applicable award holders employment prior to
the 24-month anniversary of the Effective Time.

 

  (c) At the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the
holder of Company Equity Awards with respect to such holders Company Equity
Awards, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive shares of
Company Common Stock or benefits measured in whole or in part by the value of
a number of shares of Company Common Stock granted under any Company Benefit
Plan or otherwise (including deferred stock units) other than Company Stock
Options and Company Restricted Stock (each, other than Company Stock Options
and Company Restricted Stock, a " _Company Equity Award_ "), whether vested or
unvested, and without affecting the vesting thereof, which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right or
award with respect to shares of the Company Common Stock, and shall be
converted into a cash-based right or award equal in amount to the Merger
Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock underlying a
particular Company Equity Award, _provided_ that with respect to performance
share awards granted under the Companys 2000 Long-term Performance and
Incentive Plan, such awards shall be replaced pursuant to Section 8(a) of the
applicable award agreements with a number of restricted Parent Common Shares
(or, at the election of Parent, Parent restricted stock units with dividend
equivalent rights) equal to (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that would have been earned as of the Effective Time
pursuant to Section 8(b) of the applicable award agreements in the absence of
such replacement multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, divided by (ii)
the Average Parent Stock Price ( _provided_ that any fractional shares or
units resulting from such calculation shall be rounded up to the nearest

  whole number). Such shares (or units) shall vest on the date that the
applicable three-year performance period was scheduled to conclude, subject to
accelerated vesting in accordance with the terms of the applicable performance
share award agreement, it being understood and agreed that if the holder of a
performance share award is party to any employment, change in control or other
similar agreement that includes the term "cause" or "good reason", the terms
"cause" and "good reason" as used in the performance share agreement shall be
deemed to have the same meaning as set forth in such employment, change in
control or other similar agreement.

 

 (d) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Paxar Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") shall continue to be operated in accordance with its terms through the Effective Time, _provided_ that the Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that no participants may increase their participation levels in the ESPP following the date hereof and that no new participants may commence participation in the ESPP following the date hereof. The Company will take all actions to ensure that the ESPP is terminated, and all options thereunder exercised, no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

 (e) _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this _Section 2.03_ , " _Cause_ " means (i) "Cause" as defined in any employment or similar agreement to which the applicable award holder is a party, or (ii) if there is no such agreement or if it does not define Cause: (1) conviction of a crime (other than a vehicular misdemeanor), (2) dishonesty in the course of fulfilling employment duties that causes harm to the Company, or (3) willful and deliberate failure to perform employment duties in any material respect.

 SECTION 3.01. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter (it being understood that any information set forth in one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the Section or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds in number and each other Section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that such information is relevant to such other Section or subsection) or the SEC Documents filed with the SEC by the Company and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Filed SEC Documents_ __"), other than the sections of the Filed SEC Documents pertaining to "risk factors" or "forward looking statements," the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as follows:

 

 (a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate, company or partnership power and authority to carry on its business as presently conducted, and (ii) is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except, in the case of the Companys Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized, existing, qualified, licensed or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The

   Company has made available to Parent prior to the execution of this
Agreement a true and complete copy of the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company_ _Certificate of Incorporation_
") and the Bylaws of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), in each case
as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

  (b) _Subsidiaries_. All "significant subsidiaries" of the Company, as
such term is defined in Section 1-02 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange
Act, and all entities listed on Exhibit 21 to the Companys annual report on
Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, (collectively, "
_Significant Subsidiaries_ ") and their respective jurisdictions of
organization are listed in Section 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter.
All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in,
each Significant Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable and are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company free and
clear of all pledges, liens, charges, mortgages, encumbrances or security
interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_ "), other
than (A) mechanics, carriers, workmens, warehousemens, repairmens or
other like Liens arising or incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, (B) Liens for Taxes, assessments and other
governmental charges and levies (i) that are not due and payable, (ii) that
are being contested in good faith or (iii) that may thereafter be
paid without interest or penalty, and (C) Liens (other than liens securing
indebtedness for borrowed money), defects or irregularities in title,
easements, rights-of-way, covenants, restrictions, zoning restrictions,
building codes and other similar matters that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially impair the continued use
and operation of the assets to which they relate in the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted (collectively, "
_Permitted Liens_ ").

 

  (c) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 200,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, par value $0.10 per
share, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
" _Company Preferred Stock_ "). At the close of business on March 20, 2007,
(i) 41,554,469 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding
(which number includes 0 shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company in
its treasury), (ii) 6,765,345 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved and
available for issuance pursuant to the Companys 1990 Employee Stock Option
Plan, 1997 Incentive Stock Option Plan, 2000 Long-Term Performance and
Incentive Plan and the ESPP (the foregoing plans, collectively, the "
_Company Stock Plans_ "), of which 3,130,791 shares of Company Common Stock
were subject to outstanding options to acquire shares of Company Common Stock
from the Company (such options, together with any similar options granted
after March 20, 2007, but excluding options outstanding under the ESPP, the "

 (f) _SEC Documents; Internal Controls and Procedures_.

 

 (i) __ The Company has filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents with the SEC required to be filed by the Company since December 31, 2003 (as such documents have since the time of their filing been amended or supplemented, the " _SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates of filing, the SEC Documents complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable thereto, and none of the SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The audited consolidated financial statements and the unaudited quarterly financial statements (including, in each case, the notes thereto) of the Company included in the SEC Documents when filed complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in all material respects in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC or other rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end adjustments consistent with past practice). Except for matters reflected or reserved against in the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2006, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations (whether absolute, accrued, contingent, fixed or otherwise) of any nature, except liabilities and obligations that (A) were incurred since December 31, 2006, in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (B) are incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (C) would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

The Companys and its consolidated Subsidiaries disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it or they file under the Exchange

  Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material
information is accumulated and communicated to the management of the Company
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "). The management of the
Company has completed its assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements
of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2006,
and such assessment concluded that such internal control was effective. The
Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation, to the Companys
outside auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors of the
Company, (A) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

  SECTION 3.02. _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Sub_.
Except as set forth in the Parent Disclosure Letter (it being understood
that any information set forth in one section or subsection of the Parent
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the Section or
subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds in number and each other
Section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent that such information is relevant to such other Section or
subsection), Parent and Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:

 

  (a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. Each of Parent and
Sub is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of its jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or limited
liability company power, as applicable, and authority to carry on its business
as presently conducted. Each of the Parent and Sub is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing (where such concept is
recognized under applicable Law) in each jurisdiction where the nature of its
business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, other than where the failure to be so
qualified, licensed or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Parent
has made available to the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement a
true and complete copy of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Parent
and the Certificate of Incorporation of Sub and the Bylaws of Parent and Sub,
in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

  (b) _Authority_. Each of Parent and Sub has all requisite corporate or
limited liability company power, as applicable, and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of each of Parent and Sub, and no other corporate
proceedings (including no shareholder action) on the part of Parent or Sub are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by each of Parent and Sub and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Sub, enforceable
against each of Parent and Sub in accordance with its terms, subject, as to
enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency and other Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general
equity principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law).

    (c) _No Conflict_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement do not,
and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement will not,
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right
of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss
of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of Parent or Sub under, any provision of (i) the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or comparable organizational documents
of Parent or Sub or (ii) subject to the filings and other matters referred to
in the immediately following sentence, any Law or Judgment, in each case
applicable to Parent or Sub or their respective properties or assets, other
than, in the case of clause (ii), any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults, rights, losses or Liens that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the Closing.
No consent, approval, order or authorization of, registration, declaration or
filing with, or notice to, any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained
or made by or with respect to Parent or Sub in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Sub or the consummation by
Parent and Sub of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement except for (I) the filing of a premerger notification and report
form by Parent and Sub under the HSR Act and the filings and receipt,
termination or expiration, as applicable, of such other approvals or waiting
periods as may be required under any other applicable foreign or domestic
competition, merger control, antitrust or similar Law, (II) the delivery of
the Certificate of Merger to the department of state of the State of New York
and (III) such other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
registrations, declarations, filings and notices the failure of which to be
obtained or made would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the Closing.

 

  (d) _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no suit, action or
proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay
Parent and Sub from consummating the Merger. As of the date hereof, there is
no Judgment outstanding against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially impede or materially delay Parent and Sub from consummating the
Merger.

 

  (e) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent or Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement will, on the date it is first mailed to the stockholders of
the Company and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

 

  (f) _Financing_. The Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a true,
accurate and complete copy of an executed debt commitment letter and
related term sheets (the " _Debt Commitment_ _Letter_ ") pursuant to which,
and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, certain lenders have
committed to provide Parent with loans in the amounts described therein, the
proceeds of which will be used to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Debt Financing_ "). The Debt
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn or
terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect that is materially

  adverse to the Company or would materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger and neither Parent nor Sub is in breach of any of
the terms or conditions set forth therein, and no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach or failure to satisfy a condition precedent set forth
therein. The financing and other fees that are due and payable under the Debt
Commitment Letter on or before the date hereof have been paid in full. The
proceeds from such Debt Financing, together with the available cash and other
existing and available credit facilities of Parent, constitute all of the
financing required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and are sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parents and Subs
obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the Merger
Consideration (and any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, Sub or the
Surviving Corporation). The Debt Commitment Letter contains all of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of the lenders thereunder to make the
Debt Financing available to Parent and/or Sub on the terms therein.

 

 (g) _Capitalization of Sub_. The authorized capital stock of Sub consists of 100 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the capital stock of Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens. Sub has outstanding no option, warrant, right, or any other agreement pursuant to which any person other than Parent may acquire any equity security of Sub. Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and, prior to the Effective Time, will not have incurred liabilities or obligations of any nature, other than pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any related agreement.

 

 (h) _Brokers and Other Advisors_. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other person, other than JPMorgan Chase, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent, is entitled to any brokers, finders or financial advisors fee or commission in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Sub. 

 

 (i) _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, any shares of Company Common Stock or other securities convertible into, exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock. Except as set forth in Section 3.02(i) of the Parent Company Disclosure Letter, there are no voting trusts or other agreements, arrangements or understandings to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of the capital stock or other equity interest of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor are there any agreements, arrangements or understandings to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the acquisition, divestiture, retention, purchase, sale or tendering of the capital stock or other equity interest of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(a) Subject to _Section 4.03(b)-(f)_ , from the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company agrees that it shall not, nor shall it permit, authorize or cause any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective officers, directors, employees, Affiliates, agents, or other representatives, including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries (" _Representatives_ "), to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or the making or completion of, an Alternative Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations concerning, or provide or cause to be provided any non-public information or data relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with, or have any discussions with any person relating to, an actual or potential Alternative Proposal, (iii) adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, any Alternative Proposal, (iv) adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement relating to any Alternative Proposal, or (v) resolve to propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any action of any Subsidiary of the Company or Representative of the Company that would be a violation of this _Section 4.03_ if taken by the Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 4.03_ by the Company.

    (b) The Company shall, shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, immediately cease any solicitations, discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than the parties hereto) with respect to
an Alternative Proposal, in each case that exist as of the date hereof. The
Company shall promptly inform its Representatives of the Companys obligations
under this _Section 4.03_.

 

  (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 4.03_ at any
time prior to receipt of the Stockholder Approval, in response to
an unsolicited written Alternative Proposal which did not result from or
arise in connection with a breach of _Section 4.03(a)_ or _(b)_  and which
the Board of Directors of the Company determines, in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors, (1) constitutes
or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and (2) that
the failure to take action on such unsolicited Alternative Proposal would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
Representatives may (i) furnish non-public information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the person who has made such Alternative
Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a confidentiality agreement no
less restrictive of the other party than the Confidentiality Agreement is of
Parent, and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with such person
and its Representatives regarding such Alternative Proposal; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Company shall simultaneously provide or make available to
Parent any material non-public information concerning the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that is provided to the person making such Alternative
Proposal or its Representatives which was not previously provided or made
available to Parent.

 

  (d) Except as set forth in _Section 7.01(c)(ii)_ , and excluding any
confidentiality agreement permitted pursuant to _Section 4.03(c)_ , neither
the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, or publicly propose
to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the
Recommendation, (ii) adopt or approve any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement relating to any
Alternative Proposal or (iii) adopt, approve, endorse or recommend,
or publicly propose to adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, any Alternative
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to receipt of the
Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee
thereof determines that an Alternative Proposal is a Superior Proposal and
further determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that failure to withdraw or modify its Recommendation would be inconsistent
with the Companys Board of Directors exercise of its fiduciary duties, the
Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof may withdraw or
modify its Recommendation.

 

  (e) The Company promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) shall
advise Parent of (i) any Alternative Proposal or inquiry that would reasonably
be expected to lead to any Alternative Proposal, (ii) any request for non-
public information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than
such indications, inquiries or requests for information not reasonably
expected to be related to an Alternative Proposal, or (iii) any inquiry or
request for discussion or negotiation regarding an Alternative Proposal, in
each case that is received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives, including in each case the identity of the person making any
such Alternative Proposal or indication, inquiry or request and the material
terms of

   any such Alternative Proposal or request or inquiry (including copies of any
document or correspondence evidencing such Alternative Proposal or indication,
inquiry or request). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a
current basis (and in any event within 24 hours of the occurrence of any
material changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status
(including the material terms and conditions thereof and any material change
to the terms thereto) of any such Alternative Proposal or indication or
inquiry, including furnishing copies of any written revised proposals. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) notify Parent if it determines to begin providing information or to
engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an Alternative Proposal. The
Company shall as promptly as practicable notify Parent in writing if its Board
of Directors determines that any Alternative Proposal is a Superior Proposal.
The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any
confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing such information
to Parent.

 

  (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or
its Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act
or (ii) making any required disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in
the good faith judgment of such Board of Directors, after consultation and the
receipt of advice from its outside counsel, failure to disclose such
information would reasonably be expected to violate its obligations under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure that
addresses or relates to the Recommendation or an Alternative Proposal shall be
deemed to be a modification, amendment or withdrawal of the Recommendation for
the purposes of _Section 4.03(d)_ unless the Board of Directors of the
Company in connection with such communication publicly reaffirms the
Recommendation.

 

  (g) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean
any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person or group (other than Parent
and its Affiliates) relating to (i) any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase, in a single transaction or a series of transactions, of (A) 20% or
more (based on the fair market value thereof, as determined by the Board of
Directors of the Company) of the assets (including capital stock of the
Subsidiaries of the Company) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (B) 20% or more of outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock,
(ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in
such person or group owning, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of
outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock or (iii) any merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, binding share exchange or similar transaction
involving the Company pursuant to which such person or group (or the
shareholders of such person or members of such group) would own, directly or
indirectly, 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or
of the surviving entity in a merger or the resulting direct or indirect parent
of the Company or such surviving entity, other than, in each case, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

  (h) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any
written Alternative Proposal on terms which the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, to be more favorable to the
holders of Company Common Stock than the Merger, taking into account (i) all
the terms and conditions of such Alternative Proposal and this Agreement
(including any

  proposal or offer by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement during the 3
Business Day period referred to herein), and (ii) all financial, regulatory,
legal and other aspects of such proposal; _provided_ that the Board of
Directors of the Company shall not so determine that any such proposal is a
Superior Proposal prior to the time that is 3 Business Days after the date on
which the Company has disclosed all material terms of such proposal to Parent
in accordance with _Section 4.03(e)_ ; _provided_ , _further_ , that any
material amendment of the terms of such proposal (including, without
limitation, price) must be disclosed to Parent in accordance with _Section
4.03(e)_ and shall commence anew the 3 Business Day period, and _provided
further_ for purposes of the definition of " _Superior Proposal_ ", the
references to "20% or more" in the definition of Alternative Proposal shall be
deemed to be references to "more than 50%."

 

 SECTION 4.04. _Conduct of Business of Parent and Sub_. Except as set forth in Section 4.04 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, as contemplated, required or permitted by this Agreement, as required by Law or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction, or as consented to in writing by the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time:

 

 (a) Parent shall cause Sub to (i) perform its obligations under this Agreement and (ii) not engage directly or indirectly in any business or activities of any type or kind and not to enter into any Contracts or arrangements with any person, or be subject to or bound by any obligation or undertaking, which is inconsistent with this Agreement; and

 

 (b) Parent shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, take any action which is intended to or which would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the ability of any of the parties hereto from obtaining any necessary approvals of any Governmental Entity required for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, from performing its covenants and agreements under this Agreement or from consummating the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 SECTION 4.05. _Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to give Parent or Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

 SECTION 5.01. _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting_. (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement. Parent shall provide to the Company all information concerning Parent and Sub as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement and shall otherwise assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and resolution of comments referred to below. The Company shall as promptly as practicable notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from 

   the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any request from the SEC or the staff of
the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall
provide Parent with copies of all material correspondence between the Company
and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the
SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff of
the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and to cause the Proxy Statement
to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement. If at any time prior to the
Stockholders Meeting there shall occur or be discovered any event or any
information relating to the Company, Parent, Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC and,
to the extent required by Law, mail to the Companys stockholders an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such event or information.
Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC or the staff of
the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response.

 

  (b) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the date of this Agreement, establish a record date for, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "
_Stockholders  Meeting_") for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder

modify or withdraw its Recommendation pursuant to _Section 4.03(d)_ , the
Company shall, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders
adoption of this Agreement and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement.

 

  SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. The Company
shall afford to Parent, and to Parents Representatives, reasonable access
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or
the termination of this Agreement to all of its and its Subsidiaries
properties, books and records and to those employees of the Company to whom
Parent reasonably requests access, and, during such period, the Company shall
furnish to Parent all information concerning its and its Subsidiaries
business as Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to (i)
provide access to or disclose information where the Company reasonably
determines that such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, contravene any Law or
any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
unduly interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in the ordinary course or (ii) provide access to any properties
of the Company or its Subsidiaries for the purpose of environmental sampling
or testing. Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the
confidentiality letter agreement dated as of January 18, 2007, between Parent
and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), Parent shall hold, and shall cause its
Representatives to hold, all information received from the Company or
its Representatives, directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement.

    SECTION 5.03. _Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use reasonable best
efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do
promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals, and
expirations or terminations of waiting periods from Governmental Entities and
the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all
steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval, clearance or waiver from, or
to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties,
(iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv)
the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and
not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and Parent agree not to
extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable foreign or
domestic competition, merger control, antitrust or similar Law or enter into
any agreement with any Governmental Entity not to consummate the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior
written consent of the other party.

 

  (b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (i) promptly, but in no
event later than 10 Business Days after the date hereof, file any and all
required Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and use
reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as promptly as practicable,
(ii) promptly file any and all required notifications or applications under
any other applicable foreign or domestic competition, merger control,
antitrust or similar Law with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and use reasonable best efforts
to receive required approvals or clearances and cause the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period under such applicable foreign or
domestic competition, merger control, antitrust or similar Law as promptly as
practicable, (iii) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in
(x) determining whether any filings are required to be made with,
or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals, and
expirations or terminations of waiting periods are required to be obtained
from, any third parties or other Governmental Entities in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (y) timely making all such filings and
timely obtain all such consents, permits, authorizations or approvals, (iv)
supply to any Governmental Entity as promptly as practicable any additional
information or documents that may be requested pursuant to any Regulatory Law
(as hereinafter defined) or by such Governmental Entity, and (v) take, or
cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all such further action as
may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the United States
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition
authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any other person may
assert under Regulatory Law with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, and to avoid or eliminate any impediment under any Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental

   Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as
soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the Outside Date),
including (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of any assets or businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (y) otherwise taking or
committing to take any actions that after the Closing Date would limit the
freedom of action of Parent, its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporations) or Affiliates with respect to, or Parents or its Affiliates
ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporations) businesses, product lines or assets; in each case as
may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing or
delaying the Closing beyond the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , and
notwithstanding anything else contained herein, the provisions of this
_Section 5.03_ shall not be construed to require Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (or permit the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries) to
undertake or commit to undertake any efforts or to take any action or commit
to take any action if such efforts or action would, or would reasonably be
expected to, result in a Substantial Detriment. " _Substantial Detriment_ "
shall mean changes or effects which, individually or in the aggregate, would
result in, or would be reasonably likely to result in, a Material Adverse
Effect, at or after the Effective Time, _provided_ that any requirement to
divest or hold separate, or limit the operation of, any division,
Subsidiary, interest, business, product line, asset or property relating to
the operations conducted by Parent and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time shall be deemed to result in a Substantial Detriment if such action with
respect to a comparable amount of assets or businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries would be reasonably likely, in the aggregate, to have a Material
Adverse Effect, at or after the Effective Time.

 

  (c) Subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent shall keep each other apprised of
the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions. The Company and
Parent shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to
review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in
connection with, any proposed written communication to any Governmental
Entity. Each of the Company and Parent agrees not to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed transactions unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by
such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate.

 

  (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
parties contained in this _Section 5.03_ , if any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party,
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of the
Company and Parent shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall
use reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Merger

   and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this
_Section 5.03_ shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(ii)_ so long as such party has, prior to such
termination, complied with its obligations under this  _Section 5.03_.

 

  (e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means the
Sherman Act of 1890, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the HSR Act, the
Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 and all other federal, state or foreign
statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial
doctrines and other Laws, including any antitrust, competition or trade
regulation Laws that are designed or intended to (i) prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade or lessening competition through merger or acquisition or (ii)
protect the national security or the national economy of any nation.

 

  SECTION 5.04. _Benefit Plans_. (a) For a period of one year following
the Effective Time, Parent shall provide (i) base salary to each individual
who is an employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company Employees_ ") that is no less
favorable than the base salary of each such Company Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Date and (ii) employee benefits (including without
limitation annual bonus opportunities, incentive opportunities and long-term
equity incentive opportunities) to the Company Employees that are no less
favorable in the aggregate to the benefits provided to the Company Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time, it being understood and agreed that,
in the event the Closing Date occurs prior to the payment date of annual
bonuses for the period ending December 31, 2007 (the " _2007 Bonus Year_ "),
Company Employees who participate immediately prior to the Closing Date in an
annual bonus plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall receive a bonus
for the 2007 Bonus Year in an amount no less than they would have received if
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement had not occurred, applying the
objective formulae based on a good faith estimate of the expected performance
of the Company and/or the employee as if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement had not occurred and exercising any discretionary authority
thereunder in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

 

  (b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan," as such term defined
in Section 3(3) of ERISA (whether or not subject to ERISA), maintained by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including any vacation, paid time-off and
severance plans) with respect to which any Company Employee may become a
participant, for all purposes, including determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits, vesting, benefit accruals and
early retirement subsidies, each Company Employees service with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor employer
of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent service with the
predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary) shall
be treated as service with Parent or its applicable Subsidiary; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such service need not be recognized for purposes of benefit
accrual under final average pay defined benefit plans or as would otherwise
result in a duplication of benefits.

 

  (c) Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods under any "employee welfare benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(1)
of ERISA (whether or not subject to ERISA),

   maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates in which Company Employees
(and their eligible dependents and eligible domestic partners) participate
from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable
Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall
recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments,
deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or
her eligible dependents and eligible domestic partners) during the calendar
year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such
years deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare
benefit plans in which they participate from and after the Effective Time.

 

  (d) The parties agree that consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a "Change in Control" (or
other similar concept) under any Company Benefit Plan or other compensatory
plan, program or arrangement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party with respect to which such concept (or similar concept) is
relevant, including the Change in Control Employment Agreements to which
the Company is a party; _provided_ that if a true, correct and complete copy
of any such agreement, plan, program or arrangement has not been provided to
Parent prior to the date hereof, this  _Section 5.04(d)_ shall not apply to
such agreement, plan, program or arrangement.

 

  (e) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.07_ , no provision of
this _Section 5.04_ shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any
employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof)
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any respect, and no provision of
this _Section 5.04_ shall create such rights in any such persons in respect of
any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Company
Benefit Plan or any employee program or any plan or arrangement of the Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries. No provision of this Agreement shall constitute a
limitation on the rights to amend, modify or terminate after the Effective
Time any such plans or arrangements of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or to terminate the employment of any Company Employee.

 

  SECTION 5.05. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_. (a) All
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any person
who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior
to the date of this Agreement, a director, officer, trustee, employee, agent
or fiduciary (including as a fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit
plan) of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the Company
Certificate of Incorporation, the Company Bylaws, the organizational documents
of any Subsidiary of the Company or any indemnification or
employment agreement or other Contract between such Indemnified Party and the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, as in effect on the date
hereof or, with respect to any indemnification agreement entered into after
the date hereof, to the extent the terms thereof are no more favorable in any
material respect to the Indemnified Party that is the beneficiary thereof than
the terms of any indemnification agreement existing on the date hereof and a
true, correct and complete copy of which has been previously disclosed to
Parent) shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time,
survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six years following the Effective

  Date in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any
such Indemnified Party.

 

 (b) Without limiting _Section 5.05(a)_ or any rights of any Indemnified Party pursuant to the Company Certificate of Incorporation, the Company Bylaws, the organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company or any indemnification or employment agreement or other Contract, from and after the Effective Time, in the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (a " _Claim_ "), whether civil, criminal or administrative, in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (or any of their respective predecessors), is or is threatened to be made a party in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company (or any of their respective predecessors), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each such director or officer against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each such director or officer to the fullest extent permitted by Law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such threatened or actual Claim arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was a director (including in a capacity as a member of any board committee) or officer of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors, or a fiduciary with respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by any of the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before, at or after the Effective Time. Parents obligations under this _Section 5.05(b)_ shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim.

In lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, Parent may direct the Company to purchase, at or prior to the Effective Time, prepaid (or " _tail_ ") directors and officers liability insurance coverage no less favorable than the coverage described in the

   preceding sentence; _provided_ that the Company shall not be required to pay
any amounts in respect of such coverage prior to the Closing.

 

  (d) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
substantial portion of its properties and other assets to any person, or if
Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the applicable
successors and assigns or transferees shall succeed to, and expressly assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.05_.

 

  (e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 5.05_ and the
parties acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees the payment and
performance of the Surviving Corporations obligations pursuant to this
_Section 5.05_.

 

  (f) The provisions of this _Section 5.05_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or
her heirs and his or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by contract or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, if any Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time) is made against any Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section 5.05_ shall
continue in effect until the final disposition of such Claim.

 

  SECTION 5.06. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as provided in _Section 7.02_
, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid
by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated.

 

  SECTION 5.07. _Public Announcements_. Each of Parent and the Company
shall consult with the other before issuing, and give the other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required
by applicable Law, court process or the rules and regulations of any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system and except for any
matters referred to in  _Section 4.03(f)_. The parties agree that the initial
press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

 

  SECTION 5.08. _Financing_. Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
respective best efforts to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms
and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including using their
reasonable best efforts (a) to negotiate definitive agreements with respect
thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter,
(b) to satisfy all conditions applicable to Parent in such definitive
agreements, (c) to comply with its obligations under the Debt Commitment
Letter, and (d) to enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent
shall give the Company prompt notice upon becoming aware of any material
breach by any party of the Debt Commitment Letter or any

  termination of the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep the Company
informed on a reasonable basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. In the event that Parent becomes aware
of any event or circumstance that makes procurement of any portion of the Debt
Financing unlikely to occur in the manner or from the sources contemplated in
the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall immediately notify the Company and
Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective best efforts to arrange any
such portion from alternative sources. The Company agrees to provide, and will
use reasonable best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives
(including legal and accounting) to provide such cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the Debt Financing or
any alternative financing, _provided_ that Parent shall, at the request of the
Company, reimburse the Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in providing such cooperation.

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.01(c)(ii_ _)_ ; or

 

 (iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 7._ _01(d)(ii)_ ;

cash (the " _Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no event shall
the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  (b) With respect to any payment required to be made pursuant to _Section 7.02(a)(i)_ , the Company shall pay $5,000,000 of the Termination Fee concurrently with the termination of this Agreement, and shall pay the remainder of the Termination Fee upon the occurrence of the events in _Section 7.02(a)(i)(C)_.

 (d) In the event that (A) either party shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(i)_ or _7.01(b)(ii)_ (with respect to Restraints related to any Regulatory Law), (B) as of the date of such termination any approval under any Regulatory Law required to be obtained prior to the Closing shall not have been obtained or any waiting period under any Regulatory Law required to be expired or terminated prior to the Closing shall not have expired or been terminated, (C) immediately prior to such termination, the conditions set forth in _Sectionsv 6.01_ _(a)_ , _6.01(c)_ (other than a failure of such condition with respect to Restraints related to any Regulatory Law), _6.02(a)_ and _6.02(b)_ shall have been satisfied, then Parent shall pay to the Company, no later than two Business Days following such termination, a termination fee of $50,000,000 in cash (the " _Regulatory Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Regulatory Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

 (e) In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee or Parent Expenses or Parent shall fail to pay the Regulatory Termination Fee, in each case as required pursuant to this _Section 7.02_ when due, such amounts shall accrue interest for the period commencing on the date such amounts became past due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by JPMorgan Chase from time to time during such period, as such banks prime lending rate plus 1.50% . In addition, if the Company or Parent shall fail to pay such amounts when due, then such party shall also pay to the other party all of the other partys costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with efforts to collect such fee.

 

 (f) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 7.02_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Sub for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

  (g) Any payments made pursuant to this _Section 7.02_ shall be net of any amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of applicable Tax Law.

 

 SECTION 7.03. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 7.01_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company or any of their respective officers or directors, other than the provisions of the last sentence of _Section 5.02_ , _Section 5.06_ , _Section 7.02_ , this _Section 7.03_ and _Article VIII_ , which provisions shall survive such termination; _provided_ , _however_ that nothing herein shall relieve the Company, Parent or Sub from liability for any fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful and material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination.

 

 SECTION 7.04. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time before or after receipt of the Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that after such Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no amendment or waiver that by Law requires further adoption or approval by the stockholders of the Company without such adoption or approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 

 SECTION 7.05. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) to the extent permitted by Law, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) subject to the proviso to the first sentence of _Section 7.04_ and to the extent permitted by Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 

 SECTION 7.06. _Procedure for Termination or Amendment_. A party terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01_ shall give written notice of such termination to the other parties hereto. A termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01_ or an amendment of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.04_ shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of Parent or the Company, action by its Board of Directors.

jurisdiction, the Federal Court of the United States of America sitting in the
Southern District of New York) in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that
all claims in respect of such action or proceeding must be commenced, and may
be heard and determined, exclusively in the aforementioned courts (c) waives,
to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action
or proceeding in the aforementioned courts; and (d) to the fullest extent
permitted by law, (i) waives the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in the aforementioned courts, (ii)

such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise), and (iii) agrees not to assert any claim that this Agreement, or
the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of
the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each party to
this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner

 SECTION 8.11. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8._ _11_.

 

 SECTION 8.12. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void, invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. The parties further agree that any such illegal, void, invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be limited or eliminated only to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and that the parties shall replace such provisions of this Agreement with a

  valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such provision.
