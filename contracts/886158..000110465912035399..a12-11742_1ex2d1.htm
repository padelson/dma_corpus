AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of May 8, 2012,
among Bed Bath and Beyond Inc., a company organized under the laws of New York
(" _Parent_ "), Blue Coral Acquisition Corp., a California corporation and a
direct wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Cost Plus,
Inc., a California corporation (the " _Company_ "). Each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company are referred to herein as a " _Party_ " and together as "
_Parties_."

 



 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company have unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are in
the best interests of their respective shareholders and (ii) approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and
the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent proposes to cause Merger Sub to commence a tender offer (as it
may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the "
_Offer_ ") to purchase all the outstanding shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") at a price
per share of Company Common Stock of $22.00, without interest, net to the
seller thereof in cash, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, certain holders
of Company Common Stock or options therefor (the " _Shareholder Parties_ ")
are entering into agreements substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto
(the " _Support Agreements_ ") pursuant to which, and subject to the terms
thereof, the Shareholder Parties have agreed, among other things, to (i)
tender the shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by them in the
Offer and (ii) support the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, regardless of whether the Offer Closing occurs, Merger Sub will merge
with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving
corporation in the merger (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby, except as expressly
provided in _Section 3.01_ , each issued and outstanding share of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive $22.00, without interest on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and
the Merger.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the Parties agree as follows:

      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 **THE OFFER**

 



 

SECTION 1.01. _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_. As promptly as reasonably practicable (and,
in any event, within fifteen (15) Business Days) after the date of this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock at a price per share equal to $22.00, without interest
(such amount, or any other amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer and
this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ "), net to the Seller thereof in cash (as
adjusted as provided in _Section 1.01(c)_ , if applicable).

 



 

(b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and
of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares
of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject to the
conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The Offer
Conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and
Merger Sub may waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition at any time and
from time to time, in their sole discretion, other than the Minimum Tender
Condition, which may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub only with the prior
written consent of the Company. Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the
right to increase the Offer Price or to waive or make any other changes in the
terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless
otherwise provided in this Agreement or previously approved by the Company in
writing, Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to, (i)
reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought to be purchased in
the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer, (iv) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Tender
Condition, (v) add to the Offer Conditions or amend, modify or supplement any
Offer Condition in a manner materially adverse to any holder of Company Common
Stock, or (vi) terminate, extend or otherwise amend or modify the expiration
date of the Offer in any manner other than in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Adjustments to Offer Price_. The Offer Price shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the
date hereof and prior to Merger Subs acceptance for payment of, and payment
for, Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer; _provided, however,_ that
nothing in this _Section 1.01(c)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to
take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms
of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at the later of (i) midnight, New York City time, on the
20th Business Day following the commencement of the Offer (determined using
Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) and (ii) 5:00 p.m. New York City time
on June 28, 2012 (such date being the " _Initial Offer Expiration Date_ ").
Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) (i) extend the Offer
for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), the staff thereof or
Nasdaq, applicable to the Offer and (ii) if any of the Offer Conditions set
forth in clause (b) of _Annex I_ or in paragraph (i) of clause (c) of _Annex
I_ shall not have been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent or

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Sub, waived, extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive
increments of up to ten (10) Business Days each, with the length of such
period to be determined by Parent or Merger Sub (or such longer period as the
Parties may agree), until such time as such Offer Conditions are satisfied.
Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion, without consent of the Company, extend
the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of between two
(2) and ten (10) Business Days each, with the length of such period to be
determined by Parent or Merger Sub (or such other period as the Parties may
agree), if on any then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the Offer
Conditions shall not have been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent
or Merger Sub, waived. Parent and Merger Sub agree that, if on any then-
scheduled expiration date of the Offer, but subject to Parents right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_ , any of the Offer
Conditions shall not have been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent
or Merger Sub, waived, then to the extent requested in writing by the Company
delivered to Parent no less than two (2) Business Days prior to such
expiration date, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to)
extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to
five (5) Business Days each, with the length of such period to be determined
by Parent or Merger Sub (or such longer period as the Parties may agree), for
an aggregate period of time of not more than ten (10) Business Days.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 1.01(d)_ , Merger
Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the earliest to occur of
(i) the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.01_
, (ii) three (3) Business Days after the Proxy Statement Clearance Date and
(iii) the Outside Date.

 



 

(e) _Payment_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and
this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept
for payment, and pay for, all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered
and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly after the applicable
expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with
_Section 1.01(d)_ ) and in any event in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c)
promulgated under the Exchange Act. The date of payment for shares of Company
Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to and subject to the conditions of
the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing_ ", and the
date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the
" _Offer Closing Date_."

 



 

(f) _Termination of the Offer; Continuing Pursuit of the Merger_. If at any
then-scheduled expiration date (i) any Offer Condition shall not have been
satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Merger Sub, waived and (ii)
three (3) Business Days have elapsed since the Proxy Statement Clearance Date,
then (x) Merger Sub may irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer or
(y) from and after 5:00 p.m. New York City time on July 23, 2012, the Company
shall have the right, exercisable by delivering written notice to Parent and
Merger Sub to cause Merger Sub to, and upon receipt of such notice, Merger Sub
shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to), irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer at the then-scheduled expiration date following the
receipt of such notice from the Company (delivered no less than two (2)
Business Days prior to the then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer). If
the Offer is terminated pursuant to this _Section 1.01(f)_ , the Company shall
proceed with and take all actions necessary to hold the Shareholders Meeting
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The termination of the Offer
pursuant to this _Section 1.01(f)_ is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Offer Termination_." Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 1.01(f)_ , if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01_
, then Merger Sub shall promptly (and, in any event, within one (1) Business
Day of such termination), irrevocably and

 



      
 

 



 

unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn
by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section
8.01_ , Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository
acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered shares of Company
Common Stock to the registered holders thereof to the extent required by the
terms of the Offer. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Offer
Termination shall not give rise to a right of termination of this Agreement
unless to the extent expressly provided for in _Section 8.01_ and that, absent
such termination of this Agreement, the obligations of the Parties hereunder
other than those related to the Offer shall continue to remain in effect,
including those obligations with respect to the Merger.

 



 

(g) _Offer Documents_. On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and
Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, and including all exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "), which
shall include, as exhibits, an offer to purchase and a related letter of
transmittal, a summary advertisement, a notice in compliance with Section
1110(h) of the California Code and the Company Bylaws and other ancillary
Offer documents pursuant to which the Offer will be made (such Schedule TO and
the documents attached as exhibits thereto, together with any supplements or
amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and promptly thereafter shall
cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the holders of the Company
Common Stock as required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company
shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the
Company that may be required by applicable securities laws or reasonably
requested by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Offer Documents. The
Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company
Recommendation; _provided, however,_ that the Board of Directors of the
Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to, and in
accordance with, _Section 5.02_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect. Parent and Merger Sub shall take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed
with the SEC and the other Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be
disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. Parent and Merger
Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any request from the SEC or the staff of
the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Offer Documents, and shall
provide the Company with copies of all correspondence between Parent, Merger
Sub and their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the
staff of the SEC, on the other hand. Parent and Merger Sub shall use
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Offer
Documents, and Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel
a reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any written
response to any such written comments of the SEC or its staff. Prior to the
filing of the Offer Documents (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the
dissemination thereof to the holders of Company Common Stock, or responding to
any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect thereto, Parent
and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response.

 



 

(h) _Funds_. Subject in all respects to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Offer Conditions, Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided to Merger Sub

 



      
 

 



 

on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common
Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

 



 

SECTION 1.02. _Company Actions_.

 



 

(a) _Schedule 14D-9_. On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC,
the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such _Schedule 14D-9_ , together
with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ "), which,
except as expressly contemplated by _Section 5.02(c)_ , shall describe and
make the Company Recommendation with respect to the Offer, and promptly
thereafter shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the holders of the Company Common
Stock. The Company shall also include in the Schedule 14D-9 the Fairness
Opinion. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company in
writing all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub that may be required
by applicable securities laws for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect. The
Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC and the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected,
to be disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company
shall promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any request from the SEC or the staff
of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall
provide Parent and Merger Sub with copies of all correspondence between the
Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of
the SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or
the staff of the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, and the Company shall
provide Parent and Merger Sub and their respective counsel a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the formulation of any written response to any
such written comments of the SEC or its staff. Prior to the filing of the
Schedule 14D-9 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the dissemination
thereof to the holders of Company Common Stock, or responding to any comments
of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall
provide Parent and Merger Sub and their respective counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response.

 



 

(b) _Shareholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the
Company shall cause its transfer agent to furnish Merger Sub promptly with
mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders of
Company Common Stock as of the latest practicable date and of those Persons
becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together with lists, copies
of all lists of shareholders, security position listings, computer files and
all other information in the Companys possession or control regarding the
beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to Merger Sub
such information (including updated lists of shareholders, security position
listings and computer files) and assistance as Parent or Merger Sub may
reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial
holders of the Company Common Stock. Subject to the requirements of applicable
Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer
Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall not use or
disclose the information contained in any such labels,

 



      
 

 



 

lists, listings and files other than in connection with the Offer and the
Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request,
destroy all copies of such information then in their possession or control.

 



 

SECTION 1.03. _Top-Up_.

 



 

(a) _Top-Up_. The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable right
(the " _Top-Up_ "), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in
this _Section 1.03_ , to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer
Price up to a number of newly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") that, when added to the number
of shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent and
Merger Sub at the time of the Top-Up Closing (assuming that the Offer Closing
has occurred, provided that Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to
exclude for this purpose any shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to
guaranteed delivery procedures), shall constitute one share more than 90% of:
(i) the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as of the expiration of the
Offer _plus_ (ii) without duplication of clause (i), the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock issuable to holders of Company DSUs outstanding
as of the expiration of the Offer _plus_ (iii) the aggregate number of shares
of Company Common Stock issuable to holders of Company Stock Options
outstanding as of the expiration of the Offer _minus_ (iv) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable to holders of Company Stock
Options for which Parent has obtained prior to the expiration of the Offer
agreements (satisfactory to Parent in its sole discretion) by the holders
thereof not to exercise such Company Stock Options prior to the termination of
this Agreement _plus_ (v) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock issuable to the holders of Company Equity Awards (other than Company
Stock Options and Company DSUs) outstanding as of the expiration of the Offer
_plus_ (vi) the number of shares to be purchased by Merger Sub under the Top-
Up; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up may not be exercised to purchase
an amount of Top-Up Shares in excess of the number of shares of Company Common
Stock authorized and unissued (treating shares owned by the Company as
treasury stock as unissued) and not otherwise reserved or committed for
issuance at the time of exercise of the Top-Up. The Top-Up shall be
exercisable only once.

 



 

(b) _Exercise of Top-Up; Top-Up Closing_. If there shall have not been validly
tendered in the Offer, and not validly withdrawn, that number of shares of
Company Common Stock (provided that Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right
to exclude for this purpose any shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to
guaranteed delivery procedures) which, when added to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent and Merger Sub
would represent at least one share more than 90% of: (i) the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock as of the expiration of the Offer _plus_ (ii)
without duplication of clause (i), the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock issuable to holders of Company DSUs outstanding as of the
expiration of the Offer _plus_ (iii) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock issuable to holders of Company Stock Options outstanding as of
the expiration of the Offer _minus_ (iv) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock issuable to holders of Company Stock Options for which
Parent has obtained prior to the expiration of the Offer agreements
(satisfactory to Parent in its sole discretion) by the holders thereof not to
exercise such Company Stock Options prior to the termination of this Agreement
_plus_ (v) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable to
the holders of Company Equity Awards (other than Company Stock Options and
Company DSUs) outstanding as of the expiration of the Offer _plus_ (vi) the
number of shares to be purchased by Merger Sub

 



   



 

     
 

 



 

under the Top-Up (the " _Short-Form Threshold_ "), Merger Sub shall be deemed
to have exercised the Top-Up for such number of Top-Up Shares as is necessary
for Merger Sub to reach the Short-Form Threshold and on such date shall give
the Company prior written notice specifying the number of shares of Company
Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent and its Merger Sub at the
time of such notice (assuming that the Offer Closing has occurred, provided
that Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to exclude for this purpose
shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures). The
Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice (and in
any event no later than the Offer Closing), deliver written notice to Merger
Sub specifying, based on the information provided by Merger Sub in its notice,
the number of Top-Up Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up
Shares (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "), which shall take place at the location of
the Merger Closing specified in _Section 2.02_ , and shall take place
simultaneously with the Offer Closing, the purchase price owed by Merger Sub
to the Company to purchase the Top-Up Shares shall be paid to the Company, at
Merger Subs option, (i) in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds, or (ii)
by (x) paying in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds, an amount equal to
not less than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Shares and (y) executing
and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount
equal to the aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up less the amount
paid in cash pursuant to the preceding clause (x) (the " _Promissory Note_ ").
The Promissory Note (i) shall be due on the first anniversary of the Top-Up
Closing, (ii) shall bear simple interest of 3% per annum, (iii) shall be full
recourse to Parent and Merger Sub, (iv) may be prepaid, in whole or in part,
at any time without premium or penalty, and (v) shall have no other material
terms. At the Top-Up Closing, the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger
Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares.

 



 

(c) _Exemption from Registration_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the
Top-Up Shares that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up will not
be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (including all
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Securities Act_ "), and
will be issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration
under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and
warrants to the Company that Merger Sub will be, upon the purchase of the Top-
Up Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D
under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up and the Top-Up
Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up are being and will be
acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to,
or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning
of the Securities Act).

 



 

(d) _No Effect on Dissenter Rights_. The Parties agree that any dilutive
impact on the value of the shares of Company Common Stock as a result of the
issuance of the Top-Up Shares will not be taken into account in any
determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Shares pursuant to Chapter
13 of the California Code as contemplated by _Section 3.01(d)_ and that none
of the Parties shall take any position to the contrary in any appraisal
proceeding.

 



 

SECTION 1.04. _Directors_.

 



 

(a) _Composition of Board of Directors of the Company and Board Committees_.
Effective upon the initial acceptance for payment by Merger Sub of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ ," the use
of which term herein shall not, unless the context otherwise requires, depend
upon whether Parent shall

 



      
 

 



 

exercise its rights under this _Section 1.04(a)_ ) and from time to time
thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to designate from time to time such
number of members of the Board of Directors of the Company as will give
Parent, subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 thereunder, representation equal to at least that number of directors,
rounded up to the next whole number, that is the product of (i) the total
number of directors (giving effect to the directors elected or appointed
pursuant to this sentence) _multiplied by_ (ii) the percentage that (A) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially or of record owned by
Parent and Merger Sub (including shares of Company Common Stock accepted for
payment pursuant to the Offer) bears to (B) the number of shares of the
Company Common Stock then outstanding; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event that Parents designees are appointed or elected to the Board of
Directors of the Company, until the Effective Time the Board of Directors of
the Company shall have at least two directors who are members of the Board of
Directors of the Company and who are not officers, shareholders or Affiliates
of the Company or Parent and who will be independent for purposes of Rule
10A-3 under the Exchange Act (the " _Independent Directors_ "); _provided,
however,_ that, in such event, if the number of Independent Directors shall be
reduced below two for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Independent
Director shall be entitled to designate a Person to fill such vacancy who
shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement
or, if no Independent Directors then remain, the other directors shall
designate two Persons to fill such vacancies who are not officers,
shareholders or Affiliates of the Company or Parent and who will be
independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, and such
Persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this
Agreement. Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall take all action
requested by Parent necessary to effect any election or appointment pursuant
to this _Section 1.04_ , including (at the election of Parent) (x) subject to
the Company Certificate and Company Bylaws, increasing the size of the Board
of Directors of the Company, and (y) obtaining the resignation of such number
of its current directors as is, in each case, necessary to enable such
designees to be so elected or appointed to the Board of Directors of the
Company in compliance with applicable Law (including, to the extent applicable
prior to the Effective Time, Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act). From time to
time after the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all action necessary to
cause the individuals so designated by Parent to be directors on the Board of
Directors of the Company to constitute substantially the same percentage
(rounding up where appropriate) as is on the Board of Directors of the Company
on each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company to the fullest
extent permitted by all applicable Law and the rules of The Nasdaq Stock
Market (the " _Nasdaq_ "), and the Company shall take all action requested by
Parent necessary to effect any such election or appointment.

 



 

(b) _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Company shall mail to its
shareholders the Information Statement containing the information required by
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder, and the Company
agrees to make such mailing either (i) concurrently with the mailing of the
Schedule 14D-9 or (ii) if not included in the Schedule 14D-9, if Parent shall
have requested, within three (3) calendar days following such request, which
request shall not be delivered prior to ten (10) calendar days following the
mailing of the Schedule 14D-9 ( _provided, however_ , that, in each case,
Parent and Merger Sub shall have provided to the Company on a timely basis all
information required to be included in the Information Statement with respect
to such designees and with respect to Parents officers, directors and
Affiliates, and if not then as soon as practicable thereafter).

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Required Approvals of Independent Directors_. Following the election or
appointment of Parents designees pursuant to _Section 1.04(a)_ and prior to
the Effective Time, in addition to any other vote or approval required by the
Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws or applicable Law, the affirmative
vote of a majority of the Independent Directors then in office shall be
required for the Company to consent (i) to amend this Agreement or to
terminate this Agreement, (ii) to waive or elect to enforce any of the
Companys rights or remedies under this Agreement, (iii) to extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or
Merger Sub or (iv) to any other matter under this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Effects on Continued Listing_. After the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall, upon Parents request, take all action reasonably necessary to elect to
be treated as a "controlled company" as defined by Listing Rule 5615(c) of the
Nasdaq rules (or any successor provision).

 



 

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 **THE MERGER**

 



 

SECTION 2.01. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the California Corporations
Code (the " _California Code_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 



 

SECTION 2.02. _Merger Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Merger
Closing_ ") shall take place at (a) if the Offer Closing shall have not
occurred at or prior to the Merger Closing, 9:00 a.m., local time, on a date
to be specified by the Parties, which shall be no later than the third
Business Day after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable
statute, law (including common law), ordinance, code, rule, regulation,
judgment or directive (domestic or foreign) issued, promulgated or entered
into by or with any Governmental Entity (each, a " _Law_ ")) waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Merger Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of those
conditions), or (b) if the Offer Closing shall have occurred at or prior to
the Merger Closing, on the date of the Offer Closing (and the Top-Up Closing
if the Top-Up has been exercised). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Merger
Closing may be consummated at such other time or date as Parent and the
Company may agree to in writing. The date on which the Merger Closing occurs
is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Merger Closing Date_." The Merger
Closing shall be held at the offices of Proskauer Rose LLP, at Eleven Times
Square, New York, NY 10036, unless another place is agreed to in writing by
Parent and the Company.

 



 

SECTION 2.03. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
at the Merger Closing, the Parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing with the Secretary of State of the State of California a certificate of
ownership and merger (the " _Certificate of Ownership_ ") or an agreement of
merger (the " _Agreement of Merger_ " and together with the Certificate of
Ownership, the " _California Filing_ ") in such form as is

 



      
 

 



 

required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the
California Code, and shall make all other filings or recordings required under
the California Code. If such Secretary of State requires any changes in the
Agreement of Merger as a condition to filing or issuing a certificate to the
effect that the Merger is effective, Merger Sub and the Company shall execute
any necessary revisions incorporating such changes; _provided_ , _however,_
that such changes are not inconsistent with and do not result in any
substantive change in the terms of this Agreement. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the California Filing with the Secretary of State
of the State of California or at such later time as Parent and the Company
shall agree and shall specify in the California Filing (the time the Merger
becomes effective being referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

SECTION 2.04. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the California Code. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective
Time, all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

SECTION 2.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

 



 

(a) The Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company
Certificate_ ") shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in its entirety
as the Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall
be Cost Plus, Inc. and the provision in the Articles of Incorporation of
Merger Sub naming its incorporator shall be omitted, until thereafter amended
in accordance with applicable Law.

 



 

(b) The Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ ")
shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in its entirety as the Bylaws
of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be Cost Plus, Inc., until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law.

 



 

SECTION 2.06. _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be.

 



 

SECTION 2.07. _Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers
of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 **EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS;
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

 



 

SECTION 3.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
the Company Common Stock, or of any shares of capital stock of Parent or
Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company or Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_.

 



 

(i) Subject to _Section 3.02(e)_ , each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding (x)
shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 3.01(b)_ , and (y) any
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 3.01(c)_ shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry
shares (" _Common Stock Book-Entry Shares_ "), which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock, shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest, in each case to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
_Section 3.02(b)_ , in the case of certificated shares, and automatically, in
the case of Common Stock Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock owned by any wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company shall remain
outstanding after the Effective Time.

 



 

(iii) The right of any holder of a Certificate or Common Stock Book-Entry
Share to receive the Merger Consideration shall, to the extent provided in
_Section 3.02(h)_ , be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding
that is required under any applicable Law relating to Taxes.

 



 

(d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to
demand and has properly demanded dissenters rights in accordance with Chapter
13 of the California Code (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time,

 



      
 

 



 

holders of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive payment of the "fair market value" of
such Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such
Chapter 13. All Dissenting Shares held by shareholders who shall have failed
to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights under
such Chapter 13 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to
have become exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as
of the Effective Time, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the
manner provided in _Section 3.01(c)_ , of the Certificate or Certificates that
formerly evidenced such Dissenting Shares. The Company shall (i) serve prompt
notice to Parent of any demands under such Chapter 13 and attempted
withdrawals of such notices or demands and (ii) give Parent the opportunity to
participate in and direct all negotiations, petitions and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent (which may be given or withheld in
its sole discretion), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

(e) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Without limiting the other
provisions of this Agreement but without duplication of the provisions of
_Section 1.01(c)_ , if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, there shall be any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), cash dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on
or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 3.01(c)_ shall be equitably adjusted by
Parent to reflect the effect thereof; _provided, however,_ that nothing in
this _Section 3.01(e)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any
action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 3.02. _Payment of Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to deposit with a bank or trust company designated by
Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "),
for the benefit of the holders of Certificates and Common Stock Book-Entry
Shares, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration required
to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_. All Merger Consideration that shall
be deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this _Section 3.02(a)_ is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Paying Agent
shall make the payments contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_
out of the Exchange Fund. Except to the extent set forth in _Section 3.02(f)_
, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 



 

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 



 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose
shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (A) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and which shall be in form and contain provisions which Parent
may specify and which are reasonably acceptable to the

 



      
 

 



 

Company) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record
of one or more Certificates shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such
Certificate or Certificates, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_ , and the Certificates
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock, which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the transfer or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.02(b)(i)_ ,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any payment to
holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
holder of Common Stock Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to
receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this _Article III_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one
or more Common Stock Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Common Stock
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall
automatically upon the Effective Time (or, at any later time at which such
Common Stock Book-Entry Shares shall be so converted) be entitled to receive,
and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time the amount of cash to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_ (after taking into account all
shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder immediately prior to the
Effective Time), and the Common Stock Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall
forthwith be canceled.

 



 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates (or automatically, in
the case of Common Stock Book-Entry Shares) in accordance with the terms of
this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates or such Common Stock Book-Entry Shares. At
the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall
be canceled against delivery of and exchanged as provided in this _Article
III_.

 



 

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six (6) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of the Certificates who have

 



      
 

 



 

not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ and the instructions set
forth in the letter of transmittal shall, subject to any abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law, thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation for, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable
for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration in accordance with
this _Article III_.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent nor any of their respective Representatives
shall be liable to any person in respect of any distributions from the
Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered prior to four (4) years after the Effective
Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger
Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
international, national, regional, state, local or other government, any
court, administrative, regulatory or other governmental agency, commission,
arbitral body or authority or any organized securities exchange (each, a "
_Governmental Entity_ ")), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be income of
Parent. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be
made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash
into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the
amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

 



 

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, by the person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article
III_.

 



 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (including the
Offer Price and the Merger Consideration) such amounts as Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent determine are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Law relating to Taxes. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing
Authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Certificates in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV**

 



 

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES**

 



 

SECTION 4.01. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except (i) as
disclosed in the Company SEC Documents publicly available since January 29,
2011, but prior to the date of this Agreement, other than any forward-looking
disclosures set forth in any risk factor section, any disclosures in any
section relating to forward-looking statements and any other disclosures
included therein to the extent they are non-specific, predictive, cautionary
or forward-looking in nature; and (ii) as set forth in the disclosure letter
delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement
(the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (with specific reference to the
particular section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information
set forth in such disclosure letter relates (provided, that disclosure made
with respect to any Section and/or subsection, will also be deemed to be
disclosure against other sections and/or subsections of this Agreement to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is applicable to
such other section and/or subsections), the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 



 

(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is a corporation or legal entity duly organized or formed, is
validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that
recognize that concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or formation, as the case may be, and has the requisite
corporate, partnership or limited liability company power and authority and
possesses all governmental licenses, Permits, authorizations and approvals
necessary to enable it to use its corporate or other name and to own, lease or
otherwise hold and operate its properties and other assets and to carry on its
business as currently conducted, except with respect to its Subsidiaries,
where the failure to have such governmental licenses, Permits, authorizations
or approvals or to be so organized, existing and in good standing, or to have
such power and authority, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize
that concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or other assets makes such
qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except where the failure
to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) _Restated Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws_. The Company has made
available to Parent, prior to the date of this Agreement, complete and
accurate copies of the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws, and the
comparable organizational documents of each Significant Subsidiary (as such
term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) (a " _Significant
Subsidiary_ "), in each case as amended to the date hereof. The Company
Certificate and the Company Bylaws so delivered are in full force and effect
and the Company is not in violation of the Company Certificate or Company
Bylaws.

 



 

(c) _Subsidiaries_. Section 4.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists, as
of the date hereof, (i) each Significant Subsidiary of the Company (including
its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation) and (ii) each other Subsidiary

and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, no such determination or opinion letter
has been revoked, nor has revocation been threatened, and no event has

the Company, its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been
satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a material risk to
the Company, its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate, of incurring any such
liability, other than liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (which premiums have been paid when due). The representation made
in this Section 4.01(o)(v) is made with respect to any employee benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement subject to Title IV of ERISA to which the

non-exempt prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code) and no such transaction is expected to occur with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan (and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not constitute or directly or indirectly
result in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction); (B) none of the Company,
its Subsidiaries, any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, or any employee,
officer, director, shareholder or other service provider of the Company or any

existing Company Benefit Plan; (C) all payments required with respect to each
Company Benefit Plan have been made or provided for by the Company or its
Subsidiaries or their respective ERISA Affiliates in accordance with the
provisions of each of the Company Benefit Plans, applicable Law and GAAP; (D)
no claim, proceeding, lawsuit, arbitration or other action has been

trust of any of the Company Benefit Plans; (E) no Company Benefit Plan is
under (or is expected to be under), and neither the Company nor its

Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity, and no such completed

Knowledge of the Company, no event, condition, or circumstance exists that
could reasonably be expected to result in a material increase of the benefits
provided under any Company Benefit Plan or the expense of maintaining any
Company Benefit Plan from the level of benefits or expense incurred for the
most recent fiscal year ended before the Closing Date; (G) none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates has any
unfunded liabilities pursuant to any Company Benefit Plan that is not intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code that are not fully reflected
on the Companys financial statements; (H) no event, condition, or
circumstance exists that would prevent the amendment or termination of any
Company Benefit Plan other than in accordance with its terms; (I) with respect
to each Company Benefit Plan that is funded mostly or partially through an
insurance policy, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
ERISA Affiliates currently has any material liability in the nature of

contingent material liability arising wholly or partially out of events
occurring on or before the date of this Agreement or is reasonably expected to
have such material liability with respect to periods through the Effective

(viii) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is mandated by a
government other than the United States or subject to the Laws of a
jurisdiction outside of the United States (each, a " _Foreign Company Plan_
"), the fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Company Plan,
the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Company Plan funded through
insurance or the book reserve established for any Foreign Company Plan,
together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide
for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the date of this Agreement, with
respect to all current and former participants in such Foreign Company Plan
according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to
determine employer contributions to such Foreign Company Plan, and no
transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or
insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations. Each Foreign
Company Plan has been maintained and operated in all material respects in
accordance with the applicable plan document and all applicable Laws and other
requirements, and if intended to qualify for special tax treatment, satisfies
all requirements for such treatment.

 



 

(ix) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of
the Shareholder Approval with respect to the Merger or the consummation of the

entitle any Company Personnel to severance or termination pay, (B) accelerate

the grant date thereof and no Option has been extended, amended or repriced
since the date of grant.

 



 

(p) _No Gross Ups_. No Company Personnel is entitled to any gross-up, make-

SECTION 5.02. _Competing Proposal Consideration_.

 



 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by _Section 5.02(b)_ , (i) the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall cause its and its
Subsidiaries Representatives to, immediately cease any existing
solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may be
ongoing with respect to any Competing Proposal or any proposal reasonably
likely to result in a Competing Proposal (and the Company shall demand to have
all copies of all non-public information it or its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives have distributed or made available since the date
hereof to Persons in connection with their consideration of any Competing
Proposal (other than with respect to Parent and its Affiliates), destroyed or
returned

 



      
 

 



 

to the Company as soon as possible); and (ii) the Company shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall cause its and its Subsidiaries
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly through any Person, (A)
solicit, initiate, encourage or knowingly facilitate any Competing Proposal,
(B) participate in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
material information in connection with any Competing Proposal, (C) engage in
discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to any Competing
Proposal, (D) withdraw, modify or qualify (or publicly propose to withdraw,
modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to Parent the Company Recommendation
or take any other action or make any other public statement inconsistent with
such Company Recommendation (any such action being referred to herein as a "
_Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); or (E) enter into any merger
agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, share purchase agreement,
asset purchase agreement, share exchange agreement, option agreement, or
similar document or any agreement, arrangement, understanding or commitment
relating to any Competing Proposal or enter into any contract, arrangement,
understanding or agreement in principle that is intended or would reasonably
be expected to result in a Competing Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing,
any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.02_ by any
Representative of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a
breach of this _Section 5.02_ by the Company.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 5.02(a)_ , if at any
time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the earlier to occur of the
Offer Closing and the Shareholder Approval, the Company receives a written
bona fide Competing Proposal (that did not result directly or indirectly from
a breach of this _Section 5.02_ ) which the Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal and financial advisors) constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and if the
Company first receives from such third party a signed confidentiality
agreement with such Person that contains confidentiality and standstill
provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (an " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ "), then the Company may (i) furnish non-public
information to the third party making such Competing Proposal, if, and only
if, the Company shall concurrently therewith provide to Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided or
made available to any such Person (or its Representatives) which had not
previously been provided or made available to Parent or Merger Sub, and (ii)
engage in discussions or negotiations with such third party with respect to
the Competing Proposal. In addition to the obligations of the Company set
forth in this _Section 5.02_ , the Company shall as promptly as practicable
(and in any event within 24 hours after receipt) notify Parent orally and in
writing of any Competing Proposal such notice to include the identity of the
Person making such Competing Proposal and a copy of such Competing Proposal,
including draft agreements or term sheets submitted in connection therewith
(or, where no such copy is available, a reasonably detailed description of
such Competing Proposal). The Company shall (x) keep Parent informed in
reasonable detail, on a current basis, of the status and details of any
Competing Proposal (including any change to the terms thereof) of any
Competing Proposal and (y) describe to Parent in reasonable detail as soon as
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof all correspondence and other
written material sent or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
from any Person or any Representative of any Person making a Competing
Proposal that describes any of the terms or conditions of any Competing
Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause the Companys Subsidiaries
not to, enter into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any
Contract, in each case, that prohibits the Company from providing such
information to Parent.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Board of
Directors of the Company may at any time prior to the earlier to occur of the
Acceptance Time and the Shareholder Approval (x) effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if the Board of
Directors of the Company concludes in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (y) if the
Company receives a Competing Proposal that the Board of Directors of the
Company concludes in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel
and its financial advisor) constitutes a Superior Proposal (A) effect a
Company Recommendation Change and/or (B) terminate this Agreement to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; provided,
however, that the Board of Directors may not effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change relating to a Competing Proposal pursuant to the
foregoing clause (x) or (y)(A) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the
foregoing clause (y)(B) unless the Company shall have provided prior written
notice to Parent, at least three (3) Business Days in advance of such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or such termination (the " _Notice Period_ "),
of its intention to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response
to such Intervening Event or Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement to
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal
_provided, however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement to
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal unless
concurrently with such termination the Company pays the Termination Fee
payable pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)(iii)_. Such notice in response to an
Intervening Event shall describe such Intervening Event, and the Company
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during such Notice Period, if
requested by Parent, negotiate with Parent in good faith to amend this
Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change. Such notice in response to a Superior Proposal shall
specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal
(including the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal) and shall
attach the most current version of any proposed agreement pursuant to which
such Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated. Prior to effecting such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during such Notice
Period, if requested by Parent, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Competing Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any material amendment to the terms of any
Competing Proposal, including the financial terms thereof, shall require a new
written notification from the Company and an additional three-Business-Day
period that satisfies this _Section 5.02(c)_.

 



 

(d) The Company shall not release any third party from, or waive any
provisions of, any confidentiality or "standstill" or similar agreement in
favor of the Company; provided, however, that the Company may waive its rights
under any "standstill" agreement solely to the extent (i) necessary to enable
the parties subject thereto to make to the Company inquiries, proposals or
offers on a non-public basis that constitute a Competing Proposal and (ii) the
standstill provision contained in the Confidentiality Agreement are similarly
waived; _provided, however_ , that nothing herein shall permit the Company or
its Representatives to initiate contact with such a party for the purpose of
granting, or solicit or encourage, a request for such a waiver, and the
Company shall otherwise enforce such agreements; _provided further_ , that all
of the restrictions and limitations set forth in this _Section 5.02_ shall
otherwise apply any such Competing Proposal made by any such party.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) As used in this Agreement,

 



 

(i) the term " _Competing Proposal_ " means any proposal, offer or inquiry
made by a third party relating to (A) any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, of (1)
15% or more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (2) 15% or more of the combined voting power of the Company, (B) any
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person
or group beneficially owning 15% or more of the combined voting power of the
Company, (C) the issuance by the Company of 15% or more of its voting
securities; or (D) any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, share exchange or other
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in which the
other party thereto or its shareholders will beneficially own, directly or
indirectly, 15% or more of the combined voting power of the Company or the
surviving entity or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or
such surviving entity, other than transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and

 



 

(ii) the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means a Competing Proposal not solicited
or initiated in breach of this _Section 5.02_ that the Board of Directors of
the Company in good faith determines (after consultation with outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor) would, if consummated, result in a
transaction that is (A) more favorable to the Companys shareholders from a
financial point of view than the transactions contemplated hereby, after
taking into account all relevant factors as the Board of Directors of the
Company considers to be appropriate, but which shall include all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the
terms of and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent in writing in
response to such proposal after Parents receipt of the notice contemplated by
_Section 5.02(c)_ ) and (B) reasonably capable of being consummated on the
terms proposed; provided, however, that, for purposes of the definition of
"Superior Proposal," the references to "15% or more" in the definition of
Competing Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50% or more".

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Board of Directors of the Company from (i) disclosing to the Companys
shareholders a position contemplated by 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation
M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure to its shareholders if the Board of Directors of the Company has
reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with any applicable
Law; provided, however, that this _Section 5.02(f)_ shall not be deemed to
permit the Board of Directors of the Company to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or take any of the actions referred to in _Section
5.02(c)_ except, in each case, to the extent permitted by and in accordance
with _Section 5.02(c)_.

the other hand. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff of
the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall provide

reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document.

 



 

(b) _Covenants of Parent with respect to the Proxy Statement_. Parent shall

made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to information specifically supplied
by the Company for inclusion or

shareholders, for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (the "

and hold the Shareholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Proxy Date; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall such meeting be
held later than thirty-five (35) calendar days following the date the Proxy
Statement is disseminated to the Companys shareholders and any adjournments

Parent other than in the case it is required to allow reasonable additional

of proxies voting for the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions

Shareholders Meeting even if the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or proposed or announced any
intention to do so. The Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent,
advise Parent at least on a daily basis on each of the last ten (10) Business
Days prior to the date of the Shareholders Meeting as to the aggregate tally
of proxies received by the Company with respect to the Shareholder Approval.

and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, shall be the
only matter which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the shareholders
of the Company at the Shareholders Meeting.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Amendments to Proxy Statement_. If at any time prior to the Effective

their respective Subsidiaries or their respective officers or directors should
be discovered by the Company or Parent, respectively, which, pursuant to the
Securities Act or Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a
supplement to the Proxy Statement, such Party shall promptly inform the other
Parties. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to correct any
information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have

Affiliates, to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable
after the Offer Closing without the Shareholders Meeting in accordance with
Section 1110 of the California Code.

notice to the Company during the period prior to the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement to all of its and its Subsidiaries properties,
books, Contracts, commitments, personnel and records as Parent may from time

reasonable efforts to obtain any approval or consent required from the other

SECTION 6.04. _Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,

of the Company or the Compensation Committee shall adopt such resolutions and
take such other actions as may be required to provide that:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) At the earlier of the Offering Closing and the Effective Time, each then
outstanding Company Stock Option, whether or not exercisable, shall, by virtue
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, the Company or Parent, become fully vested
and, immediately after the Effective Time, be cancelled and shall only entitle
the holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the excess,
if any, of (A) the applicable Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option; and provided, further, that if the exercise price
per share of any such Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled and
terminated without any cash payment or other consideration being made in
respect thereof; and

 



 

(ii) Immediately after the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company DSU
shall, by virtue of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, the Company or Parent,
become fully vested and cancelled, and shall only entitle the holder thereof
to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the applicable Merger
Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company DSU at the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) The payment of all Equity Award Amounts hereunder shall be subject to
appropriate withholding for Taxes in accordance with _Section 3.02(h)_. The
term " _Equity Award Amounts_ " means, collectively, all amounts payable
pursuant to this _Section 6.04._

 



 

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, from each holder of a Company Stock
Option, without incurring any liabilities in connection therewith, a written
agreement from such holder agreeing not to exercise such Company Stock Option
from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time. Any such written
agreement shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Parent.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver
written notice to each holder of a Company Stock Option or Company DSUs
informing such holder of the effect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on the Company Stock Options or Company DSUs, as applicable.
Promptly following the date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the
earlier of the expiration of the Offer and the Effective Time, the Company

_Section 6.04(d)_ (including approval of the Board of Directors of the Company
or the Compensation Committee).

 



 

SECTION 6.05. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, assume the obligations with respect to all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities, including advancement of
expenses, for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the
Company as provided in the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws (in each
case, as in effect on the date hereof) or any indemnification Contract between
such directors or officers and the Company, set forth on Section 6.05(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, without further action, as of the Effective
Time and such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
other assets to any person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause
proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.05_.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to (and if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time to) obtain a six-year pre-paid "tail
policy" covering acts or omissions at or prior to the Effective Time with
respect to those persons who are currently covered by the current policies of
the directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company
(the " _Current D andO Policy_") with such coverage levels not materially less
favorable to such indemnified persons than those of the Current DandO Policy;
provided, however, that (i) such "tail" insurance policy shall not require the
payment of an aggregate premium in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of
the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the
date hereof to maintain the Current DandO Insurance (and if the aggregate
premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Company, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a tail policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount) and (ii)
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not enter into any Contract for
a "tail" policy without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the Company
and/or the Surviving Corporation shall for any reason fail to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to
maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time the Current DandO Policy with respect to acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with levels of coverage no less
favorable in any material respect than that provided as of the date hereof, or
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase comparable
policies of directors and officers liability insurance for such six (6)-year
period with levels of coverage no less favorable in any material respect as
provided under the Current DandO Policy as of the date hereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
required to pay an aggregate annual premium for such policies of directors
and officers liability insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of
the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the
date hereof to maintain the Current DandO Insurance (and if the annual premium
of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount).

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.05_ (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable from and after the Effective Time by, each
indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii)
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract or
otherwise.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 6.06. _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any
press release or other public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation, except as such Party may reasonably conclude may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system, in which case the Party required to make the release or
announcement will use its reasonable efforts to allow the other Party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance. The Parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the
form heretofore agreed to by the Parties.

 



 

SECTION 6.07. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

SECTION 6.08. _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall, from and after the date hereof and until the Effective Time, enter
into, establish, amend or modify any plan, program, agreement or arrangement
pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or pursuant to which
benefits are provided, in each case to any current or former director,
manager, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries unless, prior to such entry into, establishment, amendment or
modification, the Compensation Committee (each member of which the Board of
Directors of the Company determined is an "independent director" within the
meaning of Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq rules and shall be an
"independent director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act at the time of any such action) shall have
taken all such steps as may reasonably be necessary to (a) approve as an
Employment Compensation Arrangement each such plan, program, agreement or
arrangement and (b) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor
under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan,
program, agreement or arrangement; _provided, however,_ that nothing in this
_Section 6.08_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action
with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 6.09. _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any litigation
against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parents prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

SECTION 6.10. _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) From the Effective Time until January 26, 2013, the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (other than employees whose terms and conditions
of employment

 



      
 

 



 

are governed by a collective bargaining agreement, the terms and conditions of
which shall be respected by Parent and the Surviving Corporation) who remain
in the active employment of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
(the " _Continuing Employees_ ") shall receive, at Parents sole discretion,
either (i) employee benefits that, in the aggregate are substantially
comparable to the employee benefits provided by the Company to the Continuing
Employees under the Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Merger
Closing or (ii) employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are substantially
comparable to the employee benefits provided by Parent and its Subsidiaries to
its similarly situated U.S.-based employees generally; _provided, however,_
that, in either case, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries shall be required to take into account any defined benefit
pension plans in determining whether employee benefits are substantially
comparable in the aggregate.

 



 

(b) Each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for service with the
Company or its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors under any
employee benefit plans or arrangements of Parent and its Subsidiaries for
purposes of eligibility and vesting solely to the extent past service was
recognized for such Continuing Employee under the comparable Company Benefit
Plans immediately prior to the Merger Closing, and to the same extent past
service is credited under such plans or arrangements for similarly situated
employees of Parent, and not for purposes of benefit accrual or calculation of
benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 6.10(b)_
shall be construed to require crediting of service for purposes of the
calculation of benefits or that would result in (i) duplication of benefits,
(ii) service credit for any purposes under a defined benefit pension plan or
any post-employment health or post-employment welfare plan or (iii) service
credit under a newly established plan for which prior service is not taken
into account for employees of Parent and its subsidiaries generally.

 



 

(c) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent in which Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions and exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees solely to
the extent such conditions and exclusions and waiting periods were satisfied
or did not apply to such employees under the welfare plans maintained by the
Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each
Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior
to the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan, to the extent
credited under the welfare plans maintained by the Company prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ are for the sole benefit of the
Parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be
construed to confer upon or give to any person (including for the avoidance of
doubt any current or former employees, directors, or independent contractors
of any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its
Affiliates, or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries), other than the Parties and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 6.10_ )
under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, any rights to continued employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 6.10_ to the contrary, nothing contained herein, whether express or
implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other

 



      
 

 



 

modification of any employee benefit plan maintained by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, or shall
limit the right of Parent to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company
Benefit Plan or any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries following the Effective Time. Nothing
contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company shall take
no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to adopt or continue any specific employee benefit plans or to
continue the employment of any specific person.

 



 

(e) Effective as of immediately prior to the earlier of the Offer Closing and
the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate (or cause to be terminated)
all Company Benefit Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code (set forth on Section 6.10(e) of the Company Disclosure
Letter) (unless Parent provides written notice to the Company no later than
seven (7) Business Days prior to the earlier of the Offer Closing and the
Effective Time that any such Company Benefit Plan shall not be terminated).
Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, and, in no event
later than three (3) Business Days prior to the earlier of the Offer Closing
and the Effective Time, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that
such Company Benefit Plan(s) have been terminated (effective no later than
immediately prior to the earlier of the Offer Closing and the Effective Time)
pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company. The form and
substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and prior approval of
Parent. In the event that termination of any such Company Benefit Plan would
reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation or surrender charges, or
other fees, then the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) such actions as
are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees
and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the earlier of the Offer Closing and the Effective Time.

 



 

SECTION 6.11. _Certain Tax Matters_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time:

 



 

(f) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall promptly notify Parent of
any suit, claim, action, investigation, proceeding or audit pending against or
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any Tax.

 



 

(g) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries will retain all books, documents
and records necessary for the preparation of Tax Returns and reports.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 6.12. _Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Board of Directors of the
Company shall (a) use reasonable best efforts to ensure that no Takeover Laws
and any takeover-related provision in the Company Certificate or Company
Bylaws is or becomes applicable to Parent, Merger Sub, this Agreement, the
Support Agreements, the Offer, the Top-Up or the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Support Agreements, and
(b) if any Takeover Law or any takeover-related provision in the Company
Certificate or Company Bylaws becomes applicable to Parent, Merger Sub, this
Agreement, the Support Agreements, the Offer, the Top-Up or the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Support
Agreements, use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger, the Offer,
the Top-Up and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Support Agreements may be timely consummated on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and the Support Agreements and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such Law or provisions on, this Agreement, the Support Agreements, the Offer,
the Top-Up or the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Support Agreements. No Company Adverse Recommendation Change
shall change the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company for
purposes of causing any Takeover Laws or takeover related provision in the
Companys Certificate or Company Bylaws to be inapplicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 6.13. _Liquor License Transfer_. Parent shall prepare and deliver to
the Company the documents and forms required by any applicable Government
Entity to transfer the Liquor Licenses to Parent, Merger Sub or their
designees or, as applicable, to provide that such Liquor Licenses remain in
effect notwithstanding the Offer Closing, the Merger Closing or the other
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Liquor License Transfer Documents_
"). Promptly, after receipt of the Liquor License Transfer Documents, the
Company shall duly execute and deliver the executed originals of such Liquor
License Transfer Documents to Parent. Parent shall deliver the fully executed
Liquor License Transfer Documents to the appropriate Government Entity, and
shall, at Parents election, concurrently with such delivery, request
temporary permits from each such Government Entity to continue to operate
under the Liquor Licenses from and after the Effective Time pending final
approval of the transfer of the Liquor Licenses. The Liquor Licenses shall be
transferred by Company to Parent, Merger or their designees free and clear of
all Liens.

 



 

SECTION 6.14. _Company Cooperation on Certain Matters_. After the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall establish a
mechanism, subject to applicable Law, reasonably acceptable to both Parties by
which the Parties will confer on a regular and continued basis regarding the
general status of the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and integration planning matters and communicate and consult with specific
persons to be identified by each Party to the other with respect to the
foregoing.

by either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 8.01_ , this Agreement

sentence of _Section 6.02(b)_ , this _Section 8.02_ , _Section 8.03_ and
_Article IX_ , which provisions shall survive such termination indefinitely;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such termination shall relieve any Party from
liability for any breach of any of its representation, warranties, covenants
or agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination.

 



 

SECTION 8.03. _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Except as provided in this _Section 8.03_ , all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement, the Support Agreements, the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Support Agreements shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated, except that expenses
incurred in connection with the printing and mailing of the Offer Documents
and the Proxy Statement, and in connection with notices or other filings with
any Governmental Entities under any Antitrust Laws shall be shared equally by
Parent and the Company.

 



 

(b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.01(e)_ , (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to _Section 8.01(b)(iii)_ at a time when the termination of this Agreement by
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(e)_ is permitted or (iii) this Agreement is
terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_ , then the Company
shall pay Parent a fee in the amount equal to $16,250,000 (the " _Termination
Fee_ "), by wire transfer of same-day funds on the second Business Day
following the date of termination of this Agreement in the case of (i) and
(ii), and by wire transfer of same-day funds concurrently with the termination
of this Agreement in the case of (iii).

 



 

(c) In the event that (i) a Competing Proposal shall have been made to the
Company or shall have been made directly to the shareholders of the Company
generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known or any person shall
have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a
Competing Proposal, (ii) thereafter this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.01(b)(i)_ , _Section 8.01(b)(iii)_ , or _Section 8.01(c)_ and (iii)
within 12 months after any such termination referred to in clause (ii) above,
the Company enters into a definitive Contract with respect to, or consummates
the transactions contemplated by, any Competing Proposal (regardless of
whether such Competing Proposal is (x) made before or after termination of
this Agreement or (y) is the same Competing Proposal referred to in clause (i)
above), then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee (less, if
applicable, the Turn Down Fee previously paid to Parent by the Company), by
wire transfer of same-day funds, on the date of the first to occur of such
event(s) referred to above in this clause (iii); _provided_ , _however_ , that
for purposes of the definition of "Competing Proposal" in this _Section
8.03(c)(iii)_ , references to "15%" shall be replaced by "50%".

 



 

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company

for its actual and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses not to exceed $1,500,000
(the " _Turn-Down Fee_ "), by wire transfer of same-day funds on the second
Business Day following the date of such termination of this Agreement;
provided, that the existence of circumstances which would require the

 



      
 

 



 

Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.03(c)_ shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to pay the
Turn-Down Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.03(d)_ ; and provided, further, that
the payment by the Company of the Turn-Down Fee pursuant to this _Section
8.03(d)_ shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.03(c)_ except to the extent indicated
in _Section 8.03(c)_.

 



 

(e) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount
due pursuant to this _Section 8.03_ and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.03_
from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment
at the prime lending rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect
on the date such payment was required to be made. All payments under this
_Section 8.03_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated in writing by Parent.

at any time before or after receipt of the Shareholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after such approval has been obtained, there shall be made no
amendment that by applicable Law requires further approval by the shareholders
of the Company, without such approval having been obtained. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the Parties. Termination of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time shall
not require approval of the shareholders of the Company.

 



 

SECTION 8.05. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the Parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Except as provided by applicable
Law, no waiver of this Agreement shall require the approval of the
shareholders of the Company. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of such rights nor shall any single or partial exercise by any Party of any of
its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such
rights or any other rights under this Agreement.

intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any

Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the
benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties without notice or liability to
any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in
this Agreement may not be intended as a statement of fact but may instead
represent an allocation among the Parties of the risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties.
Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date hereof or any other date.

to which such holder is entitled to pursuant to Article III.

interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior written

indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to

and assigns.

 



 

SECTION 9.09. _Specific Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction; Personal
Jurisdiction; Covenants_.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any federal or state court located within Los Angeles County,
State of California, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties hereby agrees that any claim, dispute or controversy
(of any and every kind or type, whether based on contract, tort, statute,
regulation or otherwise, and whether based on state, federal, foreign or any
other law), arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement,
the documents referred to in this Agreement, or any of the transactions
contemplated thereby, and including disputes relating to the existence,
validity, breach or termination of this Agreement (any such claim being a "
_Covered Claim_ "), shall be heard and determined exclusively in a federal or
state court located within Los Angeles County, State of California (an "
_Applicable Court_ "). Each of the Parties expressly agrees and acknowledges
that the Applicable Court is an appropriate and convenient forum for
resolution of any and all Covered Claims, that it will not suffer any undue
hardship or inconvenience if required to litigate in such court, and that such
court is fully competent and legally capable of adjudicating any Covered
Claim. Each Party further represents that it has agreed to the jurisdiction of
the Applicable Court in respect of Covered Claims after being fully and
adequately advised by legal counsel of its own choice concerning the
procedures and laws applied in such courts and has not relied on any
representation by any other Party or its Affiliates or Representatives as to
the content, scope or effect of such procedures and law, and will not contend
otherwise in any proceeding in any court of any jurisdiction.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits, for itself and in respect
to its Affiliates and properties, generally and unconditionally, to the
exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Applicable Courts in respect of Covered
Claims. The Parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction
over the person of such Parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the
subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided
in _Section 9.02_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be
valid and sufficient service thereof.

 



 

(d) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to attempt
to assert or assert, by way of motion or other request for leave from an
Applicable Court, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action
involving a Covered Claim, (i) the defense of sovereign immunity, the defense
that any Covered Claim or remedy with respect thereto is within the exclusive
jurisdiction of a court outside Los Angeles County, State of California, (ii)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the
Applicable Courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process in
accordance with this _Section 9.09_ , (iii) that it or its Affiliates or
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise), and (iv) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the suit, action or proceeding is not
maintainable in such court, (C) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding
is improper or inappropriate and (D) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the Parties further
hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to attempt to assert, by way of
motion or other request in any other court of other forum, that a judgment
entered by any Applicable Court, including a judgment for specific
performance, is not enforceable in such other court or forum. The Parties
agree that a final judgment in respect of any Covered Claim of the Applicable
Court shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law

 



 

SECTION 9.10. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY LITIGATION, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (b) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (c) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY
AND (d) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.10.

 



 

SECTION 9.11. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect.

 



      
 

 



 

Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.

of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer if:

 



 

(a) there shall not have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior

(satisfactory to Parent in its sole discretion) by the holders thereof not to
exercise such Company Stock Options prior to the termination of this Agreement
_plus_ (v) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable to
the holders of Company Equity Awards (other than Company Stock Options and
Company DSUs) outstanding as of the expiration of the Offer _plus_ (vi) the
number of shares to be purchased by Merger Sub under the Top-Up (the "
_Minimum Tender Condition_ ");

 



 

(b) (i) the waiting period applicable to the purchase of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger under
the HSR Act (or any extension thereof) shall have neither expired nor
terminated (ii) any consent required under any other Antitrust Law of the
jurisdictions set forth on Section 6.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter
shall not have been obtained or any applicable waiting period thereunder shall
not have expired or been terminated, (iii) all other consents, approvals and
authorizations of any Governmental Entity required of Parent, the Company or
any of their Subsidiaries to consummate the Merger shall not have been
obtained or (iv) conditions of any agreement by any Party with any
Governmental Entity that prohibits the Offer Closing pending the completion of
the Governmental Entitys review or investigation of the Merger shall not have
been satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms thereof; or

 



 

(c) any of the following conditions shall have occurred and be continuing as
of the expiration of the Offer:

 



 

(i) there shall be any temporary restraining Order, preliminary or permanent
injunction or other judgment, Order or decree issued by a court or agency of
competent jurisdiction located in the United States or in any other
jurisdiction outside of

      
 

 



 

the United States in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or Parent
Merger Sub, engage in business activities that prohibits the consummation of
the Merger or the Offer and remain in effect, or any Law shall have been
enacted, issued, enforced, entered, or promulgated and remains in effect that
prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger or the Offer);

 



 

(ii) (A) The representations and warranties of the Company contained in
_Section 4.01(e)_ , _Section 4.01(v)_ , _Section 4.01(w)_ and _Section
4.01(x)_ of this Agreement shall not be true and correct in all material
respects, in each case as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
expiration of the Offer as though made as of the expiration of the Offer
(except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to
an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), (B) the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Section 4.01(d)_
shall not be true and correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement
and as of the expiration of the Offer as though made as of the expiration of
the Offer, (C) the representation and warranty of the Company contained in the
first sentence of _Section 4.01(j)_ shall not be true and correct in all
respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the expiration of the
Offer as though made as of the expiration of the Offer, and (D) all other
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement
shall not be true and correct (without giving effect to any qualifications or
limitations as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect set forth therein) as
of the date of this Agreement and as of the expiration of the Offer as though
made as of the expiration of the Offer (except to the extent such
representations and warranties expressly relate to a specified date, in which
case as of such specified date) and except, in the case of this clause (D),
for such failures to be true and correct that have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect;

 



 

(iii) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect any
obligation required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to
the expiration of the Offer;

 



 

(iv) since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred any change,
development, circumstance, event or occurrence, that individually, or together
with any other change, development circumstance, event or occurrence, has had
or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

 



 

(v) in the event that the exercise of the Top-Up is necessary to ensure that
Merger Sub owns at least 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
as of the Acceptance Time (calculated on a fully diluted basis), there shall
exist under applicable Law or other Restraint any restriction or legal
impediment on the ability of Merger Sub or the Company to consummate the Top-
Up, or the shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up
together with the shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered in the Offer
and not properly withdrawn are insufficient for Merger Sub to own at least 90%
of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as of the Acceptance Time
(calculated on a fully diluted basis);

 



 

(vi) a Triggering Event shall have occurred; and

      
 

 



 

(vii) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 



 

At the request of Parent, the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate
executed on behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer or the chief
financial officer of the Company certifying that none of the conditions set
forth in clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) of clause (c) above shall have occurred
and be continuing as of the expiration of the Offer.

 



 

For purposes of determining whether the Minimum Tender Condition and the
condition set forth in clause (v) of clause (c) have been satisfied, Parent
and Merger Sub shall have the right to include or exclude for purposes of its
determination thereof shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed
delivery procedures.

 



 

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights and obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate or modify
the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC, may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub in
whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion
(other than the Minimum Tender Condition). The failure by Parent or Merger Sub
at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a
waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right
that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

 



 

The capitalized terms used in this _Annex I_ and not defined in this _Annex I_
shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of May 8, 2012, by and among Bed Bath and Beyond Inc., Blue Coral Acquisition

Beneficial Ownership on or after the date hereof and (b) any inquiries or
proposals that are received by, any information that is requested from, or any
negotiations or discussions that are sought to be initiated or continued with,
any Shareholder (in its capacity as a shareholder of the Company) or any of
its Affiliates with respect to any Takeover Proposal and any subsequent
modifications thereto, or any other matter referred to in _Section 4.3_, such
notice to include the identity of the Person making such inquiry or proposal,
requesting such information or seeking to initiate or continue such
negotiations or discussions, as the case may be and a copy of such Takeover
Proposal or other requests or inquiries, including draft agreements or term
sheets submitted in connection therewith (or, where no such copy is available,
a reasonably detailed description of such Takeover Proposal). The Shareholder
shall (i) keep Parent fully informed in all material respects of the status or
detail of any developments, discussions and negotiations relating to the
matters described in clause (b) of the preceding sentence of the status and
details (including any change to the terms thereof) including any Takeover
Proposal and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or
delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other written materials sent
or provided to the Shareholder or any of its Subsidiaries from any Person that
describes any of the terms or conditions of any Takeover Proposal or other
proposal that is the subject of any such inquiry, proposals or information
requests.

 



 

4.5. _Waiver of Dissenters Rights_. The Shareholder waives, and agrees not to
assert or perfect, and shall cause any of its Affiliates who hold any Covered
Shares to waive and to not assert or perfect, any rights of appraisal or
rights to dissent from the Merger that the Shareholder may have under
applicable Laws or otherwise, including Chapter 13 of the California Code by
virtue of ownership of the Covered Shares.

 



      
 

 



 

4.6. _Option Matters_. From the date hereof until the Effective Time, without
Parents prior written consent, each Shareholder who is a holder of Company
Stock Options agrees not to exercise any such Company Stock Options (in whole
or in part) or Transfer any such Company Stock Options (or any portion
thereof) during such period.

 



 

4.7. _Further Assurances_. From time to time, at Parents request and without
further consideration, the Shareholder shall cooperate with Parent and Merger
Sub in making all filings and obtaining all consents of Governmental Entities
and third parties and execute and deliver such additional documents and take
all such further actions as may be necessary or desirable to effect the
actions and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

4.8. _Litigation Matters; Group Status_.

 



 

(a) The Shareholder hereby agrees not to commence or join in, and agrees to
take all actions necessary to opt out of any class in any class action with
respect to, any claim, derivative or otherwise, against Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or any of their respective successors (i) challenging the validity
of, or seeking to enjoin the operation of, any provision of this Agreement or
(ii) alleging a breach of any fiduciary duty of any Person in connection with
the negotiation and entry into the Merger Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Shareholder agrees that it shall not become a member of a "group" (as
that term is used in Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended) with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock
Options or any other voting securities of the Company for the purpose of
opposing or competing with or taking any actions inconsistent with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE V**

 



 

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

5.1. _Termination_. This Agreement shall remain in effect until the earlier to
occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the Merger Agreement Termination Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this _Section 5.1_, _Section
4.8(a)(ii)_, _Section 5.2_, _Section 5.3_ and _Section 5.5_ through _5.16_
shall survive any termination of this Agreement without regard to any temporal
limitation. Neither the provisions of this _Section 5.1_ nor the termination
of this Agreement shall relieve (A) any party hereto from any liability of
such party to any other party incurred prior to such termination or
expiration, or (B) any party hereto from any liability to any other party
arising out of or in connection with a breach of this Agreement.

 



 

5.2. _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to vest in Parent any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of
ownership of or with respect to any Covered Shares. All rights, ownership and
economic benefits of and relating to the Covered Shares shall remain vested in
and belong to the Shareholder, and nothing herein shall, or shall be construed
to, grant Parent any power, sole or shared, to direct or control the voting or
disposition of any of the Covered Shares, except as otherwise provided herein.

 



      
 

 



 

5.3. _Expenses_. All fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be

the Merger is consummated.

 



 

5.4. _Public Announcements_. Except as required by applicable Law (in which
case the Shareholder required to make the announcement will use its reasonable
efforts to allow Parent reasonable time to comment on such announcement in
advance of such issuance), no public announcements by the Shareholder
regarding this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, or the Merger
Agreement and transactions contemplated thereby are permitted. The Shareholder
(a) consents to and authorizes the publication and disclosure by Parent and
its Affiliates of its identity and holding of the Covered Shares and the
nature of its commitments and obligations under this Agreement in any
announcement or disclosure required by the SEC or other Governmental Entity,
the Offer or any other disclosure document in connection with the Offer, the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement or this
Agreement, and (b) agrees to give to Parent any information it may reasonably
require for the preparation of any such disclosure documents. Shareholder
agrees to promptly notify Parent of any required corrections with respect to
any written information supplied by it specifically for use in any such
disclosure document, if any to the extent that any shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect.

others. The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or

by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or

parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the parties without notice or liability to any other Person.

the consent or approval of any party to be valid and binding on the parties,
such consent or approval must be in writing.

 



 

5.8. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic transmission), all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties (including by facsimile or other
electronic transmission).

 



 

5.9. _Entire Agreement; No-Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and, to
the extent referenced herein, the Merger Agreement, together with the several
agreements and other documents and instruments referred to herein or therein
or annexed hereto or thereto, herewith constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both

 



      
 

 



 

written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof and are not intended to and do not confer upon any person other
than the parties any legal or equitable rights or remedies.

 



 

5.10. _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS
THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS
THEREOF.

 



 

5.11. _Assignment_. Except in connection with a Permitted Transfer or a
Transfer of Covered Shares permitted by the proviso contained in _Section
4.1(a)_, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations of any party hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, and any assignment without such consent shall be
null and void, except that Merger Sub, upon prior written notice to the
Shareholder, may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and Permitted Transferees. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or
their respective successors and permitted assigns any rights, remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

5.12. _Specific Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction; Personal Jurisdiction;
Covenants_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any federal or state court located within Los Angeles County,
State of California, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereby agrees that any claim, dispute or controversy
(of any and every kind or type, whether based on contract, tort, statute,
regulation or otherwise, and whether based on state, federal, foreign or any
other law), arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement,
the documents referred to in this Agreement, or any of the transactions
contemplated thereby, and including disputes relating to the existence,
validity, breach or termination of this Agreement (any such claim being a " **
_Covered Claim_** "), shall be heard and determined exclusively in an
Applicable Court. Each of the parties expressly agrees and acknowledges that
the Applicable Court is an appropriate and convenient forum for resolution of
any and all Covered Claims, that it will not suffer any undue hardship or
inconvenience if required to litigate in such court, and that such court is
fully competent and legally capable of adjudicating any Covered Claim. Each
party further represents that it has agreed to the jurisdiction of the
Applicable Court in respect of Covered Claims after being fully and adequately
advised by legal counsel of its own choice concerning the procedures and laws

 



      
 

 



 

applied in such courts and has not relied on any representation by any other
party or its Affiliates or Representatives as to the content, scope or effect
of such procedures and law, and will not contend otherwise in any proceeding
in any court of any jurisdiction.

 



 

(c) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits, for itself and in respect
to its Affiliates and properties, generally and unconditionally, to the
exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Applicable Courts in respect of Covered
Claims. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction
over the person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the
subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided
in _Section 5.5_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be
valid and sufficient service thereof.

 



 

(d) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to attempt
to assert or assert, by way of motion or other request for leave from an
Applicable Court, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action
involving a Covered Claim, (i) the defense of sovereign immunity, the defense
that any Covered Claim or remedy with respect thereto is within the exclusive
jurisdiction of a court outside Los Angeles County, State of California, (ii)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the
Applicable Courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process in
accordance with this _Section 5.12_, (iii) that it or its Affiliates or
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise), and (iv) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the suit, action or proceeding is not
maintainable in such court, (C) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding
is improper or inappropriate and (D) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the parties further
hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to attempt to assert, by way of
motion or other request in any other court of other forum, that a judgment
entered by any Applicable Court, including a judgment for specific
performance, is not enforceable in such other court or forum. The parties
agree that a final judgment in respect of any Covered Claim of the Applicable
Court shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law

 



 

5.13. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY LITIGATION, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (b) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (c) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY
AND (d) EACH PARTY HAS

 



      
 

 



 

BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 5.13_.

 



 

5.14. _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by Parent and the Shareholder. Each party may
waive any right of such party hereunder by an instrument in writing signed by
such party and delivered to Parent and the Shareholder.

 



 

5.15. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

 



 

5.16. _Action by Shareholder Capacity Only_. Parent acknowledges that the
Shareholder has entered into this Agreement solely in its capacity as the
record and/or beneficial owner of the Covered Shares (and not in any other
capacity, including without limitation, any capacity as a director of the
Company). Nothing herein shall limit or affect any actions taken by the
Shareholder or its Affiliate or designee, or require a Shareholder or its
Affiliate or designee to take any action, in each case, in their capacity as a
director of the Company, including, without limitation, to disclose
information acquired solely in their capacity as a director of the Company,
and any actions taken (whatsoever), or failure to take any actions
(whatsoever), by it or him in such capacity as a director of the Company shall
not be deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement.
