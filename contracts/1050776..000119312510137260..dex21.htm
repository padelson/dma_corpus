shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

 

1.8 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and without any action on the part of any holder of Company Capital Stock:

(i) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting
Shares and shares canceled pursuant to Section 1.8(b)) shall be converted into
the right to receive, subject to and in accordance with Section 1.10(c), an
amount of cash equal to the Per-Share Cash Amount, without interest. As of
the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall
automatically be cancelled and no longer deemed outstanding, and the holders
thereof shall not have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Per-Share Cash Amount, without interest, upon surrender of
Certificates (as defined in Section 1.10) in accordance with Section 1.10. The
amount of cash each such holder is entitled to receive for the shares of
Company Common Stock held by such holder shall be rounded to the nearest cent
and computed after aggregating cash amounts for all shares of Company Common
Stock held by such holder.

 



 

7 (ii) At the Effective Time, each share of capital stock of Sub that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue of
the Merger and without further action on the part of Parent, be converted into
and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (and the
share of Surviving Corporation into which the shares of Sub capital stock are
so converted shall be the only share of the Surviving Corporations capital
stock that is issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective Time).
Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Sub capital stock will
evidence ownership of one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Company Capital Stock Owned by the Company and Parent_.
At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Capital Stock that are owned by
the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
each share of Company Capital Stock owned by Parent or any direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof.

(c) _Adjustments_. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification,
combination, recapitalization or other like change with respect to
the Company Capital Stock or Parent Common Stock occurring after the
Agreement Date and prior to the Effective Time, all references in this
Agreement to specified numbers of shares of any class or series affected
thereby, and all calculations provided for that are based upon numbers of
shares of any class or series (or trading prices therefor) affected thereby,
shall be equitably adjusted to the extent necessary to provide the parties the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification,
combination, recapitalization or other like change.

 

(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, if any stockholder of the Company that is entitled to appraisal
rights demands to be paid the "fair value" of such holders shares of Company
Capital Stock and complies with all conditions and obligations necessary to
perfect appraisal rights in accordance with Delaware Law, each Dissenting
Share held by such stockholder will not be converted into the right to the
cash amounts set forth in Section 1.8(a), except as provided in this Section
1.8(d). The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any such demands
received by the Company, including any stockholders notice of their intent to
demand payment pursuant to Delaware Law that the Company receives prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the
Company, and (ii) the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands under Delaware Law. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment or offer to
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any claim or
demand in respect of any Dissenting Shares. If, after the Effective Time, any
Dissenting Stockholder shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost the right to seek dissenters rights, the Dissenting Shares
held by such stockholder shall immediately be converted into the right to
receive the cash payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a) in respect of such shares
as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall issue and
deliver to the holder thereof, at (or as promptly as reasonably practicable
after) the applicable time or times specified in Section 1.10(c), following
the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 1.10(c),
the amount of cash to which such holder would be entitled in respect thereof
under this Section 1.8(a) as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares
(and all such cash shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have
become deliverable to such holder pursuant to Section 1.8(a)).

  

 

8 1.9 _Company Options; Company RSUs; Company SARs_.

 

(a) _Unvested Company Options, Company RSUs and Company SARs held by
Continuing Employees_. At the Effective Time, each unvested Company Option,
Company RSU and Company SAR held by a Continuing Employee that is unexpired,
unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement be
assumed and converted by Parent in accordance with Section 5.11.

(b) _Vested Company Options, Company RSUs and Company SARs held by Continuing
Employees; and Company Options, Company RSUs and Company SARs held by Persons
Other than Continuing Employees_. Parent will not assume (i) any vested
Company Option, Company RSU or Company SAR held by a Continuing Employee that
is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (each, a "Vested Continuing Employee Equity Right"), or (ii) any Company
Option, Company RSU or Company SAR held by Persons that are not Continuing
Employees (each, a "Non-Continuing Employee Equity Right"). At the Effective
Time, each Vested Continuing Employee Equity Right and each Non-Continuing
Employee Equity Right shall, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for
any further action on the part of the holder thereof, subject to and in
accordance with _Section 1.10_, be converted into and represent the right to
receive the applicable Cash Out Amount for such Vested Continuing Employee
Equity Right or Non-Continuing Employee Equity Right; provided, however, that
the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Cash Out Amount the amount of withholding for Taxes required to be
deducted and withheld as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby.
The Cash Out Amount payable hereunder shall be rounded to the nearest cent and
computed after aggregating cash amounts for all Vested Continuing Employee
Equity Rights or Non-Continuing Employee Equity Rights represented by a
particular grant. At the Effective Time, each Vested Continuing Employee
Equity Right and each Non-Continuing Employee Equity Right will, by virtue of
the Merger and without any further action on the part of any holder thereof,
be cancelled and extinguished.

1.10 _Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Parents transfer agent, U.S. Bank N.A., shall act as
Paying Agent (the "Paying Agent") in the Merger for the purpose of
distributing the aggregate cash payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(i) upon
surrender of the Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.10.

 

(b) _Parent to Deposit Cash_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent,
or a direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent, shall make available to the
Paying Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article I the cash payable
pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(i).

 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall
instruct the Paying Agent to mail within three Business Days of the Effective
Time to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates
("Certificates") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, (i) a letter of transmittal (that
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent and shall contain such other provisions as Parent
may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use of such letter of
transmittal in effecting surrender of Certificates in exchange for the cash
payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(i). Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent (or receipt of an "agents message" by the
Paying Agent (or any other evidence of transfer that the Paying Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of the transfer of Company Common Stock held
in book-entry form) together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, each holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check
for the cash amount that such holder has the right to



 

9  receive pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(i) in respect of such Certificate, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so
surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to
receive cash pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(i).

 

(d) _No Interest_. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash payable
pursuant to Section 1.8(a), Section 1.8(d), Section 1.9(a), or Section
1.9(c).

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any cash amount payable pursuant to Section
1.8(a)(i) is to be paid to a Person other than the Person to which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of the payment thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such exchange shall have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment
of cash in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any
agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.10, none of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto
shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Legal Requirement.

 

(g) _Unclaimed Cash_. Any portion of funds held by the Paying Agent which have
not been delivered to any holders of Certificates pursuant to this Article I
within six months after the Effective Time shall promptly be paid to Parent,
and thereafter each holder of a Certificate who has not theretofore complied
with the exchange procedures set forth in and contemplated by Section 1.10(c)
shall look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar
laws) for its claim, only as a general unsecured creditor thereof, to the cash
payable to such holder pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(i). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, if any Certificate has not been
surrendered prior to the date on which the merger consideration contemplated
by Section 1.8(a)(i) in respect of such Certificate would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any amounts
payable in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of Parent, free and clear
of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

1.11 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. All cash paid
or payable following the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital
Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be so paid or
payable in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Capital Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, such Certificate shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

 

1.12 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall pay in
exchange for such Certificate, following the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the record holder thereof, such cash as may be required pursuant to
Section 1.8(a)(i) in respect of such Certificate; provided, however,
that Parent or the Paying Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the record holder of such
Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as Parent or the Paying Agent may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent and/or any of their
respective representatives or agents with respect to such Certificate.

 



 

10 1.13 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from (a) the cash otherwise deliverable under this
Agreement, (b) shares deliverable upon exercise or vesting, as applicable, of
Company Options, Company RSUs and Company SARs assumed by Parent pursuant to
this Agreement, subject to the applicable terms governing such Company
Options, Company RSUs and Company SARs, and (c) any other payments otherwise
required pursuant to this Agreement, to any holder of any shares of Company
Capital Stock, any Company Options, any Company RSUs, any Company SARs or any
Certificates, such amounts as the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to any such deliveries
and payments under the Code, any provision of state, local, provincial or
foreign Legal Requirements. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been delivered and paid to such holders in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

1.14 _Tax Consequences_. Parent makes no representations or warranties to
the Company or to any holder of Company Capital Stock (including Unvested
Company Shares), Company Options, Company RSUs or Company SARs regarding the
Tax treatment of the Merger, or any Tax consequences to the Company or any
such holder of this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other transactions
or agreements contemplated hereby. The Company acknowledges that the Company
and such holders are relying solely on their own Tax advisors in connection
with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions and agreements
contemplated hereby.

1.15 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and interest in, to and under, and/or possession of, all
assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company,
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized
in the name and on behalf of the Company or otherwise, to take all lawful
action necessary or desirable to accomplish such purpose or acts.

to be so qualified and in good standing, individually or in the aggregate with
any such other failures, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. The Company has delivered to Parent a true, correct and complete copy
of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws or other equivalent

outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any
Contract to which it is a party or by which it is otherwise bound to make any
loan to, or any equity or other investment (in the form of a capital
contribution or otherwise) in any other Person (other than the Company or a
Subsidiary) in an amount in excess of $100,000 in respect of any single
Person.

 

(c) As of the Agreement Date, the Company has provided to Parent or its
counsel true, correct and materially complete copies of the minute books

been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming due authorization, execution, and delivery thereof by each of
the other parties hereto, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject
only to the effect, if any, of (i) applicable bankruptcy and other similar

(i) approved and adopted this Agreement and the Merger, (ii) determined that
this Agreement and the terms and conditions of the Merger and this Agreement
are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its

outstanding on the record date set for the meeting of the Companys
stockholders to adopt this Agreement (such approval, the "Company Stockholder
Approval," and such stockholders meeting, the "Company Stockholders Meeting")
is the only vote of the holders of capital stock of the Company necessary to
adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger under applicable Legal
Requirements, the rules and regulations of NASDAQ and the Companys
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.



 

14 (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, (i) result
in the creation of any Encumbrance on any of the material properties or assets
of the Company or any Subsidiary, or (ii) conflict with, or result in any
violation of or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both), or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of
any obligation or loss of any benefit under, or require any consent, approval
or waiver from any Person pursuant to, (A) any provision of the Certificate
of Incorporation or Bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents of the
Company or any Subsidiary, in each case as amended as of the Agreement Date,
(B) subject to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and compliance with
the requirements set forth in Section 2.3(c), any Legal Requirement applicable
to the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or
assets, or (C) any Material Contract (as defined in Section 2.18), other
than, in the case of (i), (ii) and (iii) above, such conflicts, violations,
defaults, Encumbrances, terminations, cancellations, accelerations, losses,
consents, approvals or waivers as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(c) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required by or with
respect to the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions

laws or the rules and regulations of NASDAQ, and (v) such other consents,
authorizations, filings, approvals, notices and registrations which, if
not obtained or made, would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent and would not prevent,
materially alter or delay any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(d) The adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by
the Company Board referred to in Section 2.3(a) constitute all of the
approvals that are necessary to render inapplicable to this Agreement, the
Merger, and the transactions contemplated hereby the provisions of Section 203
of Delaware Law and represent the only actions necessary to ensure that
Section 203 of Delaware Law does not and will not apply to the execution,
delivery, or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger.
No other state takeover or other similar statute or regulation is applicable
to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

2.4 _SEC Filings; Company Financial Statements_.

prepared in all material respects in accordance with the requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Reports, and
(ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a
filing prior to the Agreement Date, then on the date of such filing) contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, except to the extent corrected prior to the Agreement
Date by a subsequently filed Company SEC Report. None of the Subsidiaries is
required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC.



 

15 (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any related notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports (the
"Financial Statements"), including each Company SEC Report filed after the
Agreement Date until the Closing, (i) complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, (ii) was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto or, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, as may be
permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q, 8-K or any successor form under the
Exchange Act), and (iii) fairly presented in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that
the unaudited interim financial statements may not contain footnotes and were
or are subject to normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments. The balance
sheet of the Company as of September 30, 2009 (the "Company Balance Sheet
Date") contained in the Company SEC Reports is hereinafter referred to as the
"Company Balance Sheet." Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any
liabilities of any nature (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) that
would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a consolidated
balance sheet of the Company prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for: (i)
liabilities incurred since the Company Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices, (ii) those reflected on,
or adequately reserved against in, the Company Balance Sheet (including the
notes thereto), (iii) the fees and expenses of investment bankers, attorneys,
consultants, and accountants incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby or (iv) liabilities that would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is a party to any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act ("Regulation
S-K")), where the result, purpose and intended effect of such Contract is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, the Company or any of the its Subsidiaries in the
Companys or such Subsidiaries published financial statements or other
Company SEC Reports. All reserves that are set forth in or reflected in the
Company Balance Sheet have been established in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied. The Financial Statements comply in all material respects
with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of
Position 97-2, 98-9, EITF 00-21 and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104\. The
Company has not had any material disagreement with any of its auditors
regarding accounting matters or policies during any of its past three full
fiscal years or during the current fiscal year, which disagreement would be
required under Item 304 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act
to be disclosed in the Company SEC Reports. The books and records of the
Company and each Subsidiary have been, and are being, maintained in
all material respects in accordance with applicable legal and accounting
requirements and the Financial Statements are materially consistent with such
books and records.

 

(c) The Company has heretofore furnished to Parent a complete and correct copy
of any amendments or modifications, which have not yet been filed with the
SEC but which have been prepared by the Company as of the Agreement Date and
are required to be filed, to agreements, documents or other instruments which
previously had been filed by the Company with the SEC pursuant to
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as well as any comment letters or
similar correspondence received by the Company from the SEC for the Companys
three prior fiscal years and its current fiscal year. As of the Agreement
Date, the SEC has not provided comments to the Company in connection with any
Company SEC Reports that to the Companys knowledge remain unresolved. To the
Companys knowledge, as of the Agreement Date, none of the Company SEC Reports
is the subject of any ongoing review by the SEC. To the Companys knowledge,
no investigation by the SEC with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary is
pending or threatened.



 

16 (d) The Company has established and maintains (i) "disclosure controls
and procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange
Act), and (ii) "internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rule
13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act). Each of the principal
executive officer of the Company and the principal financial officer of the
Company (or each former principal executive officer of the Company and each
former principal financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all
certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 ("SOXA") and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with
respect to the Company SEC Reports and the statements contained in such
certifications are true and accurate as of the date such statements were
made. The Company had not as any time after September 30, 2006 identified any
"significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as defined by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board) in the design or operation of the
Companys internal controls and procedures which were reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data. The Company has adopted a code of ethics, as defined
by Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K for senior financial, accounting and
compliance officers and those performing similar functions. The Company has
disclosed any violation or waiver of such code of ethics to the
extent required by Section 406(b) of SOXA. To the Companys knowledge, there
is no fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over
financial reporting.

(e) Since October 1, 2007 or such later date that any Subsidiary of the
Company became a Subsidiary of the Company, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor, to the Companys knowledge, any director, officer,
employee, auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any
Subsidiary had received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
in each case, regarding improper, wrongful, or fraudulent accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or
any Subsidiary or their respective internal accounting controls or any
material inaccuracy in the Companys financial statements. No attorney
representing the Company or any Subsidiary, whether or not employed by the
Company or any Subsidiary, has reported to the Company Board or any committee
thereof or to any director or officer of Company evidence of fraud or a
material violation of securities laws or other Legal Requirements, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by Company or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents.

(f) The Company is in compliance with the applicable criteria for
continued listing of the Company Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Market,
including all applicable corporate governance rules and regulations.

 

(g) All Company Options, Company RSUs and Company SARs granted by the Company
have been duly and validly approved. All grants of Company Options, Company
RSUs and Company SARs are in compliance in all material respects with the
terms of the applicable Company Option Plan under which such Company Options,
Company RSUs and Company SARs were granted. The Company has applied the
appropriate accounting measurement date in accordance with applicable
accounting principles to each Company Option, Company RSU and Company SAR
granted under each Company Option Plan. Subsequent to January 1, 2005, the
Company has not granted any Company Options or Company SARS at an exercise
price that represents a discount from the fair market value of the Company
Common Stock underlying such Company Option or Company SAR on the date of
grant of such Company Option or Company SAR and the Company has disclosed any
re-pricing of Company Options or Company SARS in its Financial Statements.
Neither the Company, the Company Board, any Company Board committee nor the
Chief Executive Officer has engaged in (i) the back-dating or falsification
of documentation with respect to the grant of any Company Option for the
purpose of lowering the exercise price at which such Company Option was
granted, or (ii) the intentional delay of the grant of Company Options in
anticipation of forthcoming public announcements regarding the Company



 

17  or its business that could reasonably be expected to result in an increase
or decrease of the trading price of the Companys capital stock on NASDAQ, in
either case for the purpose of increasing the value of such Company Options
for the relevant optionee as a result of such change in such trading price.
There is not pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened, any
investigation by the SEC or any other Governmental Authority with respect to
the Company Options, Company RSUs or Company SARs or the grant practices of
the Company.

the Company. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary, nor any director,
officer, Affiliate or employee thereof, has given, offered, paid, promised to
pay or authorized payment of any money, any gift or anything of value, with
the purpose of unlawfully influencing any act or decision of the recipient in

business or the holding of any such interest (all of the foregoing consents,
licenses, permits, grants, and other authorizations, collectively, the

of which to be so obtained or in effect would not result in a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, and all of the Company Authorizations are in

Company. The Company and the Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material

each of the Company Employee Plans and has provided to Parent true, correct
and complete copies of the Form 5500 reports filed for the last three plan

of the Code has either obtained from the Internal Revenue Service a favorable
determination letter as to its qualified status under the Code, including all
amendments to the Code effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent
legislation, or has applied (or has time 



 

29  remaining in which to apply) to the Internal Revenue Service for such a
determination letter prior to the expiration of the requisite period under
applicable Treasury Regulations or Internal Revenue Service pronouncements in
which to apply for such determination letter and to make any amendments
necessary to obtain a favorable determination or has been established under a
standardized prototype plan for which an Internal Revenue Service opinion
letter has been obtained by the plan sponsor and is valid as to the adopting

respect to any Foreign Plan. There has been no "prohibited transaction"
(within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code and
not exempt under Section 408 of ERISA and regulatory guidance thereunder)
that could reasonably be expected to result in a material excise tax under
ERISA or the Code with respect to any Company Employee Plan. Each Company
Employee Plan has been administered in all material respects in accordance
with its terms and in compliance in all material respects with the
requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, rules and regulations
(including ERISA and the Code), and the Company, each Subsidiary and each
ERISA Affiliate has performed all material obligations required to be
performed by it under, is not in material default under or in violation of,
and has no knowledge of any default or violation by any other party to, any of
the Company Employee Plans. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary or ERISA
Affiliate is subject to any material Liability or penalty under Sections 4976
through 4980 of the Code or Title I of ERISA with respect to any of the
Company Employee Plans. All material contributions required to be made by
the Company, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate to any Company Employee
Plan have been made on or before their due dates (including any applicable
dates set forth in regulations issued by the Department of Labor) and a
reasonable amount has been accrued for contributions to each Company Employee
Plan for the current plan years (and no further contributions will be due or
will have accrued thereunder as of the Closing Date, other than contributions
accrued in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice,
after the Company Balance Sheet Date as a result of the operations of Company
and its Subsidiaries after the Company Balance Sheet Date). No Company
Employee Plan is covered by, and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary or
ERISA Affiliate has incurred or expects to incur any Liability under Title IV
of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Subject to Section 2.13(i)(vii), each
Company Employee Plan that is maintained or sponsored by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates can be amended, terminated or
otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance with its terms,
without material Liability to Parent, the Surviving Corporation and/or any
Subsidiary (other than ordinary administrative expenses typically incurred in
a termination event). No suit, administrative proceeding, action or other
litigation has been brought, or to the knowledge of the Company, is
threatened, against or with respect to any such Company Employee Plan,
including any audit or inquiry by the Internal Revenue Service or United
States Department of Labor.

 

(d) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company, any Subsidiary or other ERISA
Affiliate relating to, or change in participation or coverage under, any
Company Employee Plan which would materially increase the expense of
maintaining such Company Employee Plan above the level of expense incurred
with respect to such Company Employee Plan for the most recent fiscal year
included in the Financial Statements. No Company Employee Plan will be subject
to any surrender fees or service fees upon termination other than the normal
and reasonable administrative fees associated with the termination of benefit
plans.

Affiliate currently maintains, sponsors, participates in or contributes to,
or has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or
contributed to, any pension plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA)
which is subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

(f) The actuarial present values of all (i) material accrued deferred
compensation entitlements (including entitlements under any executive
compensation, supplemental retirement, or employment agreement), and (ii) all
material liabilities associated with post-employment welfare benefits
(including any retiree health benefits and life insurance) of employees and
former employees of the Company, its ERISA Affiliates and their respective
beneficiaries, have been fully reflected on the Financial Statements to the
extent required by and in accordance with GAAP.

(g) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate is a party to,
or has made any contribution to or otherwise incurred any obligation under,
any "multiemployer plan" as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or
any "multiple employer plan" as such term is defined in Section 413(c) of the
Code.

(h) Each compensation and benefit plan maintained or contributed to by the
Company or any Subsidiary under the law or applicable custom or rule of the
relevant jurisdiction outside of the United States (each such plan, a "Foreign
Plan") is listed in _Schedule 2.13(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. As

with the provisions of the Legal Requirements of each jurisdiction in which
such Foreign Plan is maintained, to the extent those Legal Requirements are
applicable to such Foreign Plan, (ii) all material contributions to, and
material payments from, such Foreign Plan which may have been required to be
made in accordance with the terms of such Foreign Plan, and, when applicable,

maintained, have been timely made or shall be made by the Closing Date, and
all such contributions to such Foreign Plan, and all such payments under such
Foreign Plan, for any period ending before the Closing Date that are not yet,
but will be, required to be made, are reflected as an accrued liability on the
Company Balance Sheet, (iii) the Company, each Subsidiary, and each ERISA
Affiliate has materially complied with all applicable reporting and
notice requirements, and such Foreign Plan has obtained from the Governmental

benefits payable in the normal operation of such Foreign Plan), suits or
proceedings against such Foreign Plan or asserting any rights or claims to
benefits under such Foreign Plan, (vi) the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not by itself create or otherwise
result in any material Liability with respect to such Foreign Plan, and (vii)
except as required by applicable Legal Requirements, to the knowledge of the
Company and each Subsidiary, no condition exists that would prevent the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries from terminating or amending any Foreign
Plan maintained or sponsored by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
ERISA Affiliates at any time for any reason in accordance with the terms of
each such Foreign Plan without the payment of any material fees, costs or
expenses (other than the payment of benefits accrued on the Company Balance
Sheet and any normal and reasonable expenses typically incurred in a
termination event). No Foreign Plan has material unfunded liabilities
that will not be offset by insurance or that are not fully accrued on the
financial statements of the Company.

Letter, none of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the

termination of employment or service or any other event in connection

 _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

 

5.1 _Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Agreement Date (and shall in any event use its
reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC within fifteen (15)
Business Days after the Agreement Date), preliminary proxy materials relating
to the Company Stockholder Meeting. At the earliest practicable time
following the later of (i) receipt and resolution of SEC comments thereon,
(ii) receipt of notice from the SEC of pending SEC comments or that it may
have comments thereon and (A) the date of resolution of such comments or (B)
the date the SEC informs the Company that, contrary to such notice, it has no
comments thereon, or (ii) the expiration of the 10-day waiting period provided
in Rule 14a-6(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, the Company shall file
definitive proxy materials with the SEC (the "Proxy Statement") and cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders. The Company will cause all
documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory
authorities in connection with the Merger (or as required or appropriate to
facilitate the Merger) to (i) in the case of documents filed with the SEC,
comply as to form in all material respects with all applicable SEC
requirements, and (ii) otherwise be prepared in all material respects with
all applicable Legal Requirements. Prior to filing the preliminary proxy
materials, definitive proxy materials or any other filing with the SEC or any
other Governmental Entity, the Company shall provide Parent with reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on each such filing in advance and shall in
good faith consider including in the Proxy Statement all comments reasonably
proposed by Parent.

 

(b) The Company will notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or its staff (or of notice of the SECs intent to review the
Proxy Statement) and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or
any other filing or for additional/supplemental information, and will
supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of
its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other
government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement
or other filing. To the extent practicable, the Company and its outside
counsel shall permit Parent and its outside counsel to participate in all
communications with the SEC and its staff (including all meetings and
telephone conferences) relating to the Proxy Statement, this Agreement or the
Merger. The Company shall consult with Parent prior to responding to any
comments or inquiries by the SEC or any other Governmental Entity with respect
to any filings related to (or necessary or appropriate to facilitate)
the Merger, shall provide Parent with reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any such written response in advance and shall in good faith
consider including in such response all comments reasonably proposed by
Parent. If any event occurs before the Company Stockholders Meeting that is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
or any other filing, the Company shall promptly inform Parent of such
occurrence, provide Parent with reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on any such amendment or supplement in advance, shall in good faith consider
including in such amendment or supplement all comments reasonably proposed by
Parent, and shall cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials, and/or mailing to the stockholders of the Company, such
amendment or supplement.

(c) Parent shall supply to the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement
all information relating to Parent which is reasonably required to be included
therein. If at any time prior

 



 

45  to the Effective Time any event relating to the Company or any of its
Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company which is
required to be set forth in a supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company
shall promptly inform Parent. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any
event relating to Parent or any of its Affiliates, officers or directors
should be discovered by Parent which is required to be set forth in a
supplement to the Proxy Statement, Parent shall promptly inform the Company.

5.2 _Meeting of Stockholders; Board Recommendation_.

(a) _Meeting of Stockholders_. The Company shall, as promptly as practicable
after the Agreement Date, establish a record date (which date will be as
promptly as practicable following the Agreement Date) for, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold, the Company Stockholders Meeting for the sole
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholders Approval. The Company will use
its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor
of the Company Stockholders Approval and will take all other action reasonably
necessary or advisable to obtain such approvals and to secure the vote or
consent of its stockholders required by and in compliance with the rules and
regulations of NASDAQ, Delaware Law and its Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws. The Company (i) shall consult with Parent regarding the date of
the Company Stockholder Meeting, and (ii) shall not postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that (i) any necessary
(which determination shall not be made until after consultation with Parent)
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Companys
stockholders in advance of a vote on the Merger and this Agreement, (ii) if,
as of the time that the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled,
there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the Company Stockholders Meeting, or (iii) if, as of the time that the
Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled, adjournment of the
Company Stockholders Meeting is necessary to enable the Company to solicit
additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes in favor of the Company
Stockholders Approval. Without the prior written consent of Parent, approval
of this Agreement and the Merger (including adjournment of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, if necessary, if a quorum is present, to solicit
additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes in favor of the Company
Stockholder Approval) is the only matter which the Company shall propose to be
acted on by the Companys stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting.
The Company shall ensure that the Company Stockholders Meeting is called,
noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited by it in
connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance
with Delaware Law, its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and all other
applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(b) _Board Recommendation_. Except to the extent expressly permitted by
Section 5.3(d) and Section 5.3(e): (i) the Company Board shall unanimously
recommend that the Companys stockholders vote in favor of the Company
Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting (the "Company Board
Recommendation"); (ii) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the
effect that the Company Board has unanimously recommended that the Companys
stockholders vote in favor of the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company
Stockholders Meeting; and (iii) neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, or propose or
resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent, the unanimous recommendation of the Company Board that the Companys
stockholders vote in favor of the Company Stockholder Approval.

(c) _Continuing Obligation_. Until the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, the Companys obligation to call, give notice of,
or convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with this
Section 5.2 shall not be limited or otherwise 



 

46  affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal, or Superior Offer, or by any Change of
Recommendation (as defined in Section 5.3(d) below) or by any withholding,
withdrawal, amendment or modification in a manner adverse to Parent of the
unanimous recommendation of the Company Board that the Companys stockholders
vote in favor of the Company Stockholder Approval.

5.3 _No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) _No Solicitation Generally_. Except to the extent expressly permitted by
Sections 5.3(c), 5.3(d) and 5.3(e), from and after the Agreement Date until
the earlier of the Effective Time and termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Article VII, the Company and its Subsidiaries will not, nor will they
authorize or permit any of their respective Representatives to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, seek, knowingly encourage, knowingly
facilitate, or knowingly induce any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal
or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to,
an Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter defined), (ii) enter into,
participate in, maintain or continue any communications (except solely to
provide written notice as to the existence of these provisions) or
negotiations regarding, or deliver or make available to any Person any non-
public information with respect to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) agree to,
accept, approve, endorse or recommend (or publicly propose or announce any
intention or desire to agree to, accept, approve, endorse or recommend) any
Acquisition Proposal, (iv) enter into any letter of intent, understanding or
similar document or any other Contract (whether binding or not) contemplating
or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than confidentiality
agreements contemplated by Section 5.3(c)), or (v) submit any Acquisition
Proposal to the vote of any stockholders of the Company or any Subsidiary. The
Company and its Subsidiaries will, and each of them will cause
their respective Company Representatives to, immediately cease any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted
prior to or on the Agreement Date with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished to any Person with which the Company has engaged in any
such activities within the 12-month period preceding the Agreement Date. The
Company and its Subsidiaries shall enforce (and shall not, nor permit any
Subsidiary to, waive) any rights under any standstill, confidentiality or
similar agreements to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party. If any
Representative of the Company, whether in his or her capacity as such or in
any other capacity, takes any action that the Company is obligated pursuant to
this Section 5.3 not to authorize or permit such Representative to take, then
the Company shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have
breached this Section 5.3.

"Acquisition Proposal" shall mean, with respect to the Company, any agreement,
offer, proposal or indication of interest (other than this Agreement, the
Merger or any other offer, proposal or indication of interest by Parent), or
any public announcement of any intention to enter into any such agreement or
of (or intention to make) any offer, proposal or indication of interest,
relating to, or involving: (A) purchase from the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any acquisition by any Person or Group of more than a 15%
interest in the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any Person or Group beneficially owning 15% or more of the
total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any merger, consolidation, business combination or
similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant
to which the stockholders of the Company immediately preceding such
transaction hold securities representing less than 85% of the total
outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity of such
transaction (or parent entity of such surviving or resulting entity); (B) any
sale, lease, mortgage, pledge, exchange, transfer, license (other than in the
ordinary course of business), acquisition, or disposition of more than 15% of
the total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries in any single transaction
or series of related transactions; or (C) any liquidation or dissolution of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any extraordinary dividend, whether
of cash or other property.



 

47 (b) _Notice_. The Company as promptly as practicable (but in no event more
than one Business Day after receipt) shall advise Parent orally and in
writing of (A) an Acquisition Proposal, (B) any inquiry, expression of
interest, proposal, or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected
to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (C) any other notice that any Person is
considering making an Acquisition Proposal, or (D) any request for non-public
information which would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, as well as, in the event of any of (A)-(D) above, the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression of
interest, proposal, offer, notice or request, and the identity of the Person
or Group making any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression of
interest, proposal, offer, notice or request. The Company will keep Parent
reasonably informed as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than one
Business Day after receipt) of the status and material details (including
any amendments, modifications or proposed amendments or modifications) of any
such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer,
notice or request, and provide to Parent as promptly as practicable (but in no
event more than one Business Day after receipt) a copy of all material
written and other materials and information provided to the Company in
connection with any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression of
interest, proposal, offer, notice or request (including any amendments,
modifications or proposed amendments or modifications). The Company shall
provide Parent with at least two Business Days prior notice (or such lesser
prior notice as provided to the members of Company Board) of any meeting of
the Company Board at which the Company Board is reasonably expected to
discuss any Acquisition Proposal, including to determine whether such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer (as defined in Section 5.3(c)).

 

(c) _Superior Offers_. In the event that any Person or its Representative
submits to the Company after the Agreement Date (and does not withdraw) an
unsolicited, written, bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
a financial advisor of national standing) is, or could reasonably be
expected to become, a Superior Offer, then notwithstanding Section 5.3(a),
the Company may, so long as the Company Stockholder Approval has not yet been
obtained, (i) enter into discussions with such Person and its Representatives
regarding such Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) deliver or make available to
such Person and its Representatives nonpublic information regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries, _provided_ , in every case, that the Company,
its Subsidiaries and their Representatives comply with each of the following:
(A) the Acquisition Proposal did not result or arise from any breach of the
restrictions of Section 5.3(a), (B) the Company first shall have provided
Parent with written notice of the identity of such Person and all of the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and of the
Companys intention to take such actions, specifying which of such actions it
intends to take, (C) before delivering to such Person or its Representatives
any nonpublic information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, the
Company first shall have received from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement containing terms at least as restrictive with regard to the
Companys confidential information as the Confidentiality Agreement (as
defined in Section 5.5), which confidentiality agreement shall not include any
provision for any exclusive right to negotiate with such Person or having the
actual or purported effect of restricting the Company from fulfilling its
obligations under this Agreement, and (D) prior to or contemporaneously with
delivering or making available any such nonpublic information to such Person,
the Company shall deliver such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent
such nonpublic information has not been previously delivered by the Company to
Parent).

 

"Superior Offer" shall mean, with respect to the Company, an unsolicited, bona
fide written offer made after the Agreement Date by a third party to acquire,
directly or indirectly, (a) pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer,
merger, consolidation or other business combination (including by means of a
tender offer followed promptly by a back-end merger) beneficial ownership of
all or



 

48  substantially all of the outstanding voting securities of the Company or (b)
all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, in each case, for
consideration consisting exclusively of cash and/or publicly-traded equity
securities (and for which financing, to the extent required by the Person
making the offer, is then fully committed and non-contingent) that the Company
Board, by majority vote, has concluded in good faith (following consultation
with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of national standing),
taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory,
timing and other aspects of the offer, including conditions to consummation
and the Person making the offer, (i) would be, if consummated, more favorable,
from a financial point of view, to the Companys stockholders (in their
capacities as stockholders) than the terms of this Agreement (after
giving effect to any adjustments to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent in response to such Acquisition Proposal) and (ii) is reasonably likely
to be consummated on the terms proposed on a timely basis.

 

(d) _Change of Recommendation_. The Company Board or any committee thereof
shall not withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent the Company Board Recommendation for any reason (a "Change of
Recommendation") unless:

 

(i) the Company Stockholder Approval has not yet been obtained;

 

(ii) the Company shall have complied in all respects with the provisions and
requirements set forth in Section 5.3(a) and complied in all material
respects with the provisions and requirements set forth in Section 5.2,
Section 5.3(b) and Section 5.3 (c);

 

(iii) a Superior Offer is made to the Company that is not withdrawn and
continues to be a Superior Offer and is set forth in a final and definitive
written agreement submitted to the Company subject only to the Companys
acceptance thereof (the "Definitive Third Party Agreement");

 

(iv) the Company shall have provided to Parent four Business Days prior
written notice (unless such Superior Offer is made fewer than four Business
Days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting in which case such notice shall
be given as promptly as practicable) (a "Notice of Superior Offer") which
shall state expressly (1) that the Company has received a Superior Offer, (2)
the material terms and conditions of the Superior Offer and the identity of
the Person or Group making the Superior Offer, and (3) that it intends to
effect a Change of Recommendation and the manner and timing in which it
intends to do so, and shall have provided Parent with a copy of the Definitive
Third Party Agreement concurrently with the delivery of the Notice of Superior
Offer;

 

(v) the Company shall have provided to Parent any nonpublic information
delivered by the Company to the Person or Group making the Superior Offer (to
the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously delivered by the
Company to Parent) and, during the four Business Day period referred to in
subclause (iv) above, if requested by Parent, shall have engaged in good
faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
the Superior Offer would no longer be a Superior Offer;

 

(vi) Parent shall not have, within four Business Days of Parents receipt of
the Notice of Superior Offer, made an offer that the Company Board by a
majority vote concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and a financial advisor of national standing) to be at least as
favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Companys stockholders (in
their capacities as stockholders) as such Superior Offer (it being agreed that
(A) the Company Board shall convene a meeting to consider any such offer by
Parent following the receipt thereof, (B) that the Company Board will not
effect a Change of Recommendation for four Business Days after receipt by
Parent of the Notice of Superior Offer and the Definitive Third Party
Agreement, and (C) any change to the financial or other material terms of such
Superior Offer shall require a new Notice of Superior Offer to Parent and a
new four Business Day period under this clause (vi)); and



 

49 (vii) the Company Board, by a majority vote, has concluded in its good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel), that, in light of such
Superior Offer and any offer made by Parent pursuant to Section 5.3(d)(vi),
the Company Board is required to effect a Change of Recommendation in order to
comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements.

(e) _Intervening Event_. In addition, and notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary in this Section 5.3, at any time prior to the time the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, the Company Board may, in response to
a material development or change in material circumstances occurring or
arising after the Agreement Date, the existence and material consequences of
which were neither known nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board at or
prior to the Agreement Date (and not relating to any Acquisition Proposal)
(such material development or change in circumstances, an "Intervening
Event"), make a Change of Recommendation if the Company Board has in good
faith determined, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in
light of such Intervening Event and taking into account the results of any
negotiation with Parent as contemplated by clause (y) of this paragraph and
any offer from Parent contemplated by clause (z) of this paragraph, the
Company Board is required to effect a Change of Recommendation in order to
comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ that (x) the Company has provided
to Parent at least three Business Days prior written notice (the "Notice of
Intervening Event") (unless the Intervening Event arises fewer than three
Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting in which case
such notice shall be given as promptly as practicable) advising Parent that
the Company Board intends to take such action and specifying the reasons
therefor in reasonable detail, (y) during such three Business Day period, the
Company has, if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with
Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for a
Change of Recommendation as a result of the Intervening Event, and (z) Parent
shall not have, during such three Business Day period, offered to amend this
Agreement that the Company Board concludes in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of national standing)
would obviate the need for the Company Board to effect such Change of
Recommendation (it being agreed that (A) the Company Board shall convene a
meeting to consider any such offer by Parent following the receipt thereof,
(B) that the Company Board will not effect a Change of Recommendation for
three Business Days after receipt by Parent of the Notice of Intervening Event
and (C) any change in the facts, events or circumstances related to the
Intervening Event shall require a new Notice of Intervening Event to Parent
and a new three Business Day period). For the avoidance of doubt, in the
absence of another Intervening Event, a determination by the Company Board
after the Agreement Date that the Per-Share Cash Amount payable in the Merger
is not sufficient shall not constitute an Intervening Event in and of itself.

(f) _Compliance with Tender Offer Rules_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing
to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A, promulgated under the Exchange
Act, or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders that the
Company Board has reasonably concluded in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel) is required to be disclosed to comply with its
fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements (a "Required Fiduciary Disclosure"); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (x) any "stop, look, and listen" communication of the type contemplated
by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, and any substantially similar
communication that solely constitutes a recitation of the fact that an
Acquisition Proposal has been received and a factual description of the terms
thereof, and that no position has been taken by the Company Board as to the
advisability or

 



 

50  desirability of such Acquisition Proposal, shall not be deemed to be a
Change of Recommendation if it is also accompanied by a public statement by

making such press release or public statement and (ii) make statements that
are consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by Parent and the Company in compliance with this Section

following actions to the extent necessary to obtain the approval of any

laws regarding the transactions contemplated hereby: (i) entering
into negotiations; (ii) providing information required by applicable Legal
Requirements or governmental regulation; and (iii) substantially complying

to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement
as violative of any Antitrust Law, it is expressly understood and agreed that:
(i) Parent shall not have any obligation to litigate or contest any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding or any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent; and
(ii) Parent shall be under no obligation to, and the Company shall not
without Parents prior written consent, make proposals, execute or carry out
agreements or submit to orders providing for a Divestiture.

separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or
categories of assets of Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates, (2) the imposition of any limitation or restriction on the ability
of Parent or any of its Affiliates to freely conduct their business or the

contemplated hereby, including (a) taking all reasonable actions necessary to
satisfy the respective conditions set forth in Article VI, and (b) executing

(a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain prior to
the Closing, and deliver to Parent at or prior to the Closing, all consents,
waivers and approvals under each Contract listed or described on _Schedule

_Schedule 2.3(b)_ or _Schedule 2.3(c)_ if entered into prior to the Agreement
Date), using a form reasonably acceptable to Parent.

promptly after learning of: (i) any notice or other communication from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Merger; (ii) any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger; (iii) any action, suit,
arbitration, mediation, proceeding, claim or investigation by or before any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator initiated by or against it or any
Subsidiary, or known by the Company or any Subsidiary to be threatened against
Company or any Subsidiary or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or stockholders in their capacity as such, or of any verbal or
written correspondence from any Person asserting or implying a claim against
the Company or with respect to any of its assets or properties (including
Intellectual Property); (iv) any written claim by any taxing Authority
regarding material Taxes payable by the Company; or (v) any event that occurs
after the Agreement Date, that had it occurred prior to the Agreement Date,
would have constituted a material exception to the representation set forth in
Section 2.4(e); _provided_ that Parent shall not have any right to terminate
this Agreement or assert the failure of the condition to Closing set forth in
Section 6.3(b) due to a failure of the Company to notify Parent as required by
this first sentence of Section 5.9. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent of (x) any representation or warranty made by the Company in this
Agreement becoming to the Companys knowledge untrue or inaccurate such that
the condition to Closing set forth in Section 6.3(a) would not be satisfied as
of the time such representation or warranty becomes untrue or inaccurate, (y)
any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement such
that the condition to Closing set forth in Section 6.3(b) would not be
satisfied as of the time of such failure to comply with or satisfy, or (z) any
change, occurrence or event which, individually or in the aggregate with any
other changes, occurrences and events, would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; _provided_ , that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties herein or affect the satisfaction or non-
satisfaction of any conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to
Parent.

5.10  _Employees_.

(a) The Company shall cooperate with Parent and provide commercially
reasonable assistance to Parent in its efforts to obtain written consents,
waivers or other agreements from Company and Subsidiary employees with respect
to the amendment or termination of Company Employee Plans, or the adoption of
new arrangements with such employees, prior to the Closing.

(b) The Company shall cooperate and discuss with Parent the employee workforce
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Neither Parent nor Sub (including the
Surviving Corporation following the Merger) has any obligation to continue the
employment of any employee of the

 



 

54  Company. With respect to matters regarding the Merger or employment
compensation or benefits, the Company will consult with Parent (and will
consider in good faith the advice of Parent) prior to sending any notices or
other communication materials to its employees.

5.11 _Assumption of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company SARs; New
Company Options and Certain Other Matters_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each unvested Company Option held by a Continuing
Employee that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of the Effective
Time, shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, be assumed by Parent. Each such Company Option so assumed by
Parent under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the
same terms and conditions (including, if applicable, the vesting arrangements
and other terms and conditions set forth in the Company Option Plan that such
Company Option was granted under and the applicable stock option agreement)
as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) such
Company Option shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the next whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, with no cash being payable for any fractional
share eliminated by such rounding) of the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time and the Option Exchange Ratio, (ii) the per share
exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
such assumed Company Option shall be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the
next whole cent) obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to
the Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio, and (iii) Parents board of
directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority of the Company
Board or any committee thereof with respect to such Company Options and
Company Option Plans. It is the intent of the parties that to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, all assumed Company Options in
respect of Company Options that prior to the Effective Time were treated as
incentive or non-qualified stock options under the Code shall from and after
the Effective Time continue to be treated as incentive or non-qualified stock
options, respectively, under the Code. The Merger shall not terminate any of
the unvested and outstanding Company Options held by a Continuing Employee
under the Company Option Plans or accelerate the exercisability or vesting of
such Company Options or the shares of Parent Common Stock which shall be
subject to those Company Options upon Parents assumption of such Company
Options in the Merger. Promptly after the Closing Date, Parent shall issue to
each Person who immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of an
unvested and outstanding Company Option a document evidencing the foregoing
assumption of such Company Option by Parent. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts such that its assumption of Company Options pursuant to
this Section 5.11(a) complies with the guidance set forth in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-5(b)(V)(D).

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each unvested Company RSU held by a Continuing
Employee that is outstanding as of the Effective Time shall, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be assumed by Parent.
Each such Company RSU so assumed by Parent under this Agreement shall continue
to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including,
if applicable, the vesting arrangements and other terms and conditions set
forth in the Company Option Plan that such Company RSU was granted under and
the applicable award agreement) as are in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that (i) such Company RSU shall be for that number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the
next whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, with no cash being payable
for any fractional share eliminated by such rounding) of the number of shares
of Company Common Stock that were issuable under such Company RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time and the Option Exchange Ratio and (ii) Parents
board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority of
the Company Board or any committee thereof with respect to such Company RSUs
and Company Option Plans. The

 



 

55  Merger shall not terminate any of the unvested and outstanding Company RSUs
held by a Continuing Employee under the Company Option Plans or accelerate the
vesting of such Company RSUs or the shares of Parent Common Stock which shall
be subject to those Company RSUs upon Parents assumption of such Company RSUs
in the Merger. Promptly after the Closing Date, Parent shall issue to each
Person who immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of an
unvested and outstanding Company RSU a document evidencing the foregoing
assumption of such Company RSU by Parent.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, each unvested Company SAR held by a Continuing
Employee that is outstanding as of the Effective Time shall, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be assumed by Parent.
Each such Company SAR so assumed by Parent under this Agreement shall continue
to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including,
if applicable, the vesting arrangements and other terms and conditions set
forth in the Company Option Plan that such Company SAR was granted under and
the applicable award agreement) as are in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that (i) such Company SAR shall be for that number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the
next whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, with no cash being payable
for any fractional share eliminated by such rounding) of the number of shares
of Company Common Stock that were issuable under such Company SAR immediately
prior to the Effective Time and the Option Exchange Ratio, (ii) the per share
price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable under such assumed
Company SAR shall be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the next whole cent)
obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Option Exchange Ratio, and (iii) Parents board of directors or a committee
thereof shall succeed to the authority of the Company Board or any committee
thereof with respect to such Company SARs and Company Option Plans. The
Merger shall not terminate any of the unvested and outstanding Company SARs
held by a Continuing Employee under the Company Option Plans or accelerate the
vesting of such Company SARs or the shares of Parent Common Stock which shall
be subject to those Company SARs upon Parents assumption of such Company
SARs in the Merger. Promptly after the Closing Date, Parent shall issue to
each Person who immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of an
unvested and outstanding Company SAR a document evidencing the foregoing
assumption of such Company SAR by Parent. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts such that its assumption of Company SARs pursuant to this
Section 5.11(c) complies with the guidance set forth in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.409A-5(b)(V)(D).

(d) No earlier than two Business Days prior to the Effective Time, upon the
written request of Parent, Company will grant New Company Equity Rights
(specifying for each grant the recipient and the number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying such New Company Equity Rights) for an
aggregate amount not to exceed 750,000 shares of Company Common Stock. Unless
indicated otherwise by Parent in writing, the New Company Equity Rights shall
be issued upon such vesting and other terms to be specified by Parent in its
sole discretion, subject to the terms of the underlying Company Option Plan
from which such New Company Equity Rights are issued.

(e) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file
promptly and in any event within ten Business Days of the Closing Date with
the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 covering the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Company Options and settlement of
Company RSUs and Company SARs held by Continuing Employees and assumed by
Parent pursuant to this Section 5.11 for which a Form S-8 registration
statement is available as soon as reasonably practicable (assuming timely
receipt of all option documentation relating to the assumed Company Options
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time necessary for such filing,
all Company RSU documentation relating to the assumed Company
RSUs outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time necessary for such
filing, all Company SAR documentation relating to the assumed Company SARs
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time necessary for such filing,
and all 



 

56  signatures, opinions, and consents required for such registration statement)
after the Closing. The Company and its counsel shall reasonably cooperate with
and assist Parent in the preparation of such registration statement.

5.12 _Termination of Benefit Plans_. Effective as of the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, the Company shall terminate the 401(k) Plan
(unless Parent provides written notice to the Company no later than three
business days prior to the Closing Date that such 401(k) Plan shall not be
terminated). Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no
later than three business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) Plan has been terminated
(effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date)
pursuant to resolutions of the Companys Board of Directors. The form and
substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of
Parents counsel. The Company also shall take such other actions in
furtherance of terminating the 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably require.

5.13 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date
on which the Merger becomes effective, Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the
Company to its current and former directors and officers (the "Indemnified
Parties") pursuant to any indemnification agreements with the Company and any
indemnification provisions under the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws as in effect on the Agreement Date with respect to their acts and
omissions as directors and officers of the Company occurring prior to the
Effective Time, in each case, subject to applicable Legal Requirements. The
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will
contain provisions with respect to exculpation, advancement of expenses and
indemnification, covering acts and omissions of directors and officers
occurring prior to the Effective Time, that are at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the Agreement Date, which provisions
will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years
from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required
by Legal Requirements.

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Merger becomes effective, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain in effect, for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties with respect to
their acts and omissions as directors and officers of the Company occurring
prior to the Effective Time, the existing policy of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the Agreement Date in the
form delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the Agreement Date (the
"Existing DandO Policy"), to the extent that directors and officers liability
insurance coverage is commercially available; provided, however _,_ that: (i)
the Surviving Corporation may substitute for the Existing DandO Policy a policy
or policies of substantially similar coverage, including a "tail" insurance
policy; and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual
premiums for the Existing DandO Policy (or for any substitute or "tail"
policies) in excess of an amount equal to 300% of the most recently paid
annual premium for the Existing DandO Policy (the "Maximum Premium"). In the
event any future annual premiums for the Existing DandO Policy (or any
substitute policies) exceed the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to reduce the amount of coverage of the Existing DandO Policy
(or any substitute or "tail" policies) to the amount of coverage that can be
obtained for a premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

(c) This Section 5.13 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is
intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Parties subject to the occurrence
of the Closing, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent, shall be enforceable by each Indemnified
Party and his or her heirs and representatives, and may not be amended,
altered or



 

57  repealed after the Effective Time without the prior written consent of the
affected Indemnified Party (provided that any amendment, alteration or repeal
prior the Effective Time shall be governed by Section 7.4).

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
other assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause
proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the surviving entity, as the case may be, or transferee of such assets shall
expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.13.

5.14 _Exercise of Repurchase Option_. At least fifteen Business Days prior to
the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall provide NXP
with written notice (the "Repurchase Notice") stating that it is exercising
its option to repurchase all of the NXP Shares pursuant to and in accordance
with the terms and conditions of Annex K to the NXP APA (the "Repurchase").
The Repurchase Notice shall specify a date of Repurchase (the "Repurchase
Date") that is the eleventh Business Day following the date the Repurchase
Notice is sent, and such notice shall otherwise contain all of the
information required to be set forth therein pursuant to Annex K to the NXP
APA. The Company shall consummate the Repurchase on the Repurchase Date and
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause NXP to satisfy all of its
obligations therein in order to consummate the Repurchase on the Repurchase
Date. The Company shall notify Parent promptly following the consummation of
the Repurchase and provide Parent with documentation reasonably satisfactory
to Parent evidencing the consummation of the Repurchase.

5.15 _Section 16 Matters_. Provided that the Company delivers to Parent the
Section 16 Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion, Parent and the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted
under applicable Legal Requirements) to cause any disposition of Company
Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common
Stock) or acquisition of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities
with respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by Article I of this Agreement by each Company
Insider to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
"Section 16 Information" shall mean information regarding the Company
Insiders, the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by each such
Company Insider and expected to be exchanged for cash in connection with the
Merger, and the number and description of the Company Options, Company RSUs
and Company SARs held by each such Company Insider and expected to be
converted into options to purchase Parent Common Stock, restricted stock units
for Parent Common Stock and stock appreciation rights for Parent Common Stock,
in connection with the Merger. "Company Insiders" shall mean those
individuals who are subject to the reporting requirement of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company.

 

5.16 _Takeover Statutes_. The Company and the Company Board shall (i) take all
actions reasonably necessary to ensure that no takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) if any takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or
any transactions contemplated hereby, take all action reasonably necessary to
ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation
on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

5.17  _Certificates._ The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
prior to the Closing Date deliver FIRPTA documentation, including (a) a notice
to the Internal Revenue Service, in accordance with the requirements of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(2), in the form reasonably



 

58  requested by Parent, dated as of the Closing Date and executed by the
Company, together with written authorization for Parent to deliver such notice
form to the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of the Company after the
Effective Time, and (b) a FIRPTA Notification Letter, in the form reasonably
requested by Parent, dated as of the Closing Date and executed by the Company.

 

5.18 _Director and Officer Resignations_. Unless otherwise directed by Parent,
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a written
letter of resignation from each of the directors and officers of the Company
and from each of the directors and officers of each Subsidiary that will be
effective immediately before the Effective Time; provided that
such resignation shall not affect any change of control rights to which such
directors or officers may be entitled to and shall not change such directors
and officers status, if applicable, as an employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 _TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER_

 

7.1 _Termination_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may
be terminated and the Merger abandoned by action taken or authorized by the
Board of Directors of the terminating party or parties, which action (i) in
the case of termination pursuant to Section 7.1(a), Section 7.1(b), Section
7.1(c), Section 7.1(e) and Section 7.1(f), may be taken or authorized before
or after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, (ii) in the case
of termination pursuant to Section 7.1(g) and Section 7.1(h), may be taken or
authorized only before the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained,
and (iii) in the case of termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d), may be taken
or authorized only after the Company Stockholders Meeting has been held at
which a vote was taken on the Company Stockholder Approval:

(a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Company Board and the
board of directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) of Parent;

(b) by either Parent or the Company by written notice to the other party, if
the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the date that is six months
following the Agreement Date or any other date that Parent and the Company may
agree upon in writing (the "Initial End Date");  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if the Closing shall not have occurred by the Initial End Date, but on
such date, all of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI (other
than conditions that by their nature are only to be satisfied as of the
Closing) other than the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1(b), 6.1(c), and
6.3(c) have been satisfied or waived in writing, then neither party shall be
permitted to terminate the Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) until the
date that is three months following the Initial End Date (the "Extended End
Date") and, _provided_ , _further_ , in any event, a party shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) if

End Date, as the case may be, is principally caused by the breach by such
party of this Agreement;

  

 

61 (c) by either Parent or the Company by written notice to the other party, if a
Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any
other action, in any case having the effect of permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, which order, decree, ruling or
other action is final and nonappealable;

(d) by either Parent or the Company by written notice to the other party, if
the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the Company
Stockholders Meeting (including any adjournment thereof); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
7.1(d) shall not be available to the Company where the failure to obtain such
Company Stockholder Approval is caused by any action or failure to act of the
Company that constitutes a material breach of this Agreement;

 

(e) by the Company by written notice to Parent, if there has occurred a breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent
set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent
shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in
Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach
or as of the time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue;
_provided_ that if such inaccuracy in Parents representations and warranties
or breach by Parent is curable within 20 Business Days (but not later than
the Initial End Date or the Extended End Date, as the case may be) by Parent,
then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(e)
for 20 Business Days (or until the Initial End Date or the Extended End Date)
after delivery of written notice from the Company to Parent of such breach
(it being understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(e) if such breach by Parent is cured during such
20 Business Day period); 

(f) by Parent by written notice to the Company, (i) if there has occurred a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of
the Company set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty
of the Company shall have become untrue, in either case such that the
conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) would not be satisfied as of
the time of such breach or as of the time such representation or warranty
shall have become untrue; _provided_ that if such inaccuracy in the Companys
representations and warranties or breach by the Company, is curable within 20
Business Days (but not later than the Initial End Date or the Extended End
Date, as the case may be) by the Company, then Parent may not terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.1(f)(i) for 20 Business Days (or until the
Initial End Date or the Extended End Date) after delivery of written notice
from Parent to the Company of such breach (it being understood that Parent may
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(f)(i) if such breach
by the Company is cured during such 20 Business Day period) or (ii) if a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company shall have occurred; provided that if
any such Material Adverse Effect is curable within 20 Business Days (but not
later than the Initial End Date or the Extended End Date, as the case may be)
by the Company, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this
Section 7.1(f)(ii) for 20 Business Days (or until the Initial End Date or the
Extended End Date) after delivery of written notice from Parent to the
Company of such Material Adverse Effect (it being understood that Parent may
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(f)(ii) if such
Material Adverse Effect is cured during such 20 Business Day period); 

(g) by Parent by written notice to the Company, if a Triggering Event (as
defined below) shall have occurred; or

 

(h) by the Company by written notice to Parent, following a Change of
Recommendation solely in response to a Superior Offer effected by the Company
Board in compliance in



 

62  all material respects with Section 5.3(d); provided that such termination
shall not be effective until payment to Parent by the Company of all amounts
due pursuant to Section 7.3(b) of this Agreement in accordance with the terms
specified therein; provided, further, that immediately following such
termination, the Company accepts and enters into the Definitive Third Party
Agreement reflecting such Superior Offer.

 

For the purposes of this Agreement, a "Triggering Event" shall be deemed to
have occurred if: (i) the Company Board or any committee thereof shall have
effected a Change of Recommendation for any reason; (ii) the Company shall
have failed to convene or hold the Company Stockholders Meeting before the
Initial End Date, (iii) the Company shall have failed to include in the Proxy

Proposal or change in price of an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board
fails to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within 10 Business Days
after Parent requests in writing (which request may be made one time for each
Acquisition Proposal or change in price of an Acquisition Proposal) that such
recommendation be reaffirmed (or if such request is delivered less than 10
Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, no later than
one Business Day prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting; provided, that if
the price of such Acquisition Proposal is subsequently modified within such
period, then the Company Board shall be required to reaffirm such
recommendation no later than one Business Day prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting); or (viii) a tender or exchange offer relating to
Company Common Stock shall have been commenced by a Person unaffiliated with
Parent, and the Company (x) fails to send to its security holders pursuant to
Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, within 10 Business Days after
such tender or exchange offer is first published, sent or given, a statement
disclosing that the Company recommends rejection of such tender or exchange
offer (the "Rejection Recommendation") and reaffirms the Company Board
Recommendation or (y) fails to reaffirm the Rejection Recommendation in any
press release addressing an Acquisition Proposal published by the Company (or
by any of its Affiliates) or in any Schedule 14D-9 filed by the Company with
the SEC, in each case relating to such tender offer or exchange offer, at any
time after the Rejection Recommendation is sent.

 

7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent or the Company or
their respective Representatives, stockholders or Affiliates; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the provisions of Section 5.5(a) (Confidentiality), this
Section 7.2 (Effect of Termination), Section 7.3 (Expenses and Termination
Fees) and Article VIII (General Provisions) shall remain in full force and
effect and survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein
shall relieve any party hereto from liability in connection with any willful
breach of any of such partys representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement
shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination of this
Agreement in accordance with their terms.

 

7.3 _Expenses and Termination Fees_.

 

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this Section 7.3, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether or not the
Merger is consummated.

 

(b) _Company Payment_. The Company shall pay to Parent a fee equal to
$11,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") in the event that this Agreement is
terminated: (i) pursuant to



 

63  Section 7.1(g); (ii) pursuant to either Section 7.1(b) or 7.1(d) following
the occurrence of a Triggering Event; (iii) pursuant to Section 7.1(h); (iv)
pursuant to either Section 7.1(b) or 7.1(d) and (A) in the case of
termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b), prior to such termination or, in the
case of termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d), prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company was
publicly disclosed and not withdrawn (or, in the case of Section 7.1(b), an
Acquisition Proposal existed and was not withdrawn) and (B) within 12 months
following the termination of this Agreement, either an Acquisition (as
defined in Section 7.3(e)) with respect to the Company is consummated or the
Company enters into a Contract providing for an Acquisition; or (v) pursuant
to Section 7.1(f)(i) as a result of willful breach of this Agreement by the
Company and (A) prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal with
respect to the Company shall have been made and (B) within 12 months following
the termination of this Agreement, either an Acquisition is consummated or
the Company enters into a Contract providing for an Acquisition. The Company
shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Parent promptly but in no event
later than: (x) for a termination described in clause (i) or (ii) above, one
Business Day after the date of such termination; (y) for a termination
described in clause (iii) above, prior to or concurrently with such
termination; or (z) for a termination described in clauses (iv) or (v) above,
the earlier of the date of the Companys entry into such Contract providing
for an Acquisition or the consummation of such Acquisition. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be required
to pay to Parent the Termination Fee more than once.

(c) The Company acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in Section
7.3(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) the amount of, and the basis for payment of, the fee described
therein is reasonable and appropriate in all respects, and (iii) without this
agreement, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company fails to pay in a timely manner the fee due pursuant to Section
7.3(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim that
results in a judgment for the amounts set forth in Section 7.3(b), the Company
shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount set forth in Section 7.3(b) at the prime rate of Bank
of America, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
hereunder. Payment of the fee described in Section 7.3(b) shall not be in
lieu of damages incurred in the event of breach by the Company of this
Agreement, but otherwise shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to
Parent or Sub for such breach. All payments under this Section 7.3 shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Parent.

(d) For the purposes of this Agreement, an "Acquisition" shall mean any of
the following transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement); (i) a merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company immediately
preceding such transaction hold less than 50% of the aggregate equity
interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction or any
direct or indirect parent thereto, (ii) a sale or other disposition by the
Company or its Subsidiaries of assets (in a transaction or series of
transactions) representing in excess of 50% of the aggregate fair
market value of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to such sale, or (iii) the acquisition by any Person or Group (including
by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or issuance by the Company),
directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire
beneficial ownership of shares representing at least a majority of the voting
power of the then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

 

7.4 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after the Company
Stockholders Approval have been obtained; provided, after the Company
Stockholders Approval have been obtained, no amendment shall be made which by
law or in accordance



 

64  with the rules and regulations of NASDAQ requires further approval by such
stockholders without such further stockholder approval. This Agreement may not
be amended except by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each of Parent, Sub and the Company.

7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time any party
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, except that Parent may not extend for the benefit of Sub and vice
versa, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made
to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto,
and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the
benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The agreement of Parent
to any extension or waiver shall be deemed to be the agreement of Sub to such
extension or waiver. Delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall
not constitute a waiver of or estoppel with respect to, such right.

counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto; it being

8.5 _Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement and the documents
and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or
delivered pursuant hereto, including all the exhibits attached hereto, and the
Company Disclosure Letter, (i) constitute the entire agreement among the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and



 

66  understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter hereof, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which
shall continue in full force and effect, and shall survive any termination of
this Agreement, in accordance with its terms, and (ii) are not intended to
confer, and shall not be construed as conferring, upon any Person other than
the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, except as otherwise
expressly set forth in Section 5.13.

8.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any

remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of
any right to specific performance or injunctive relief. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief as a
remedy to prevent breaches of this Agreement, without any requirement to post
a bond or other security, and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction,

located within the City of Wilmington in the State of Delaware, in respect of
the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of
the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the

to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the

maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate
or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such
courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect

proceeding, venue shall lie solely in the City of Wilmington, Delaware.
