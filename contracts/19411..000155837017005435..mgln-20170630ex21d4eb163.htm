foregoing, if there is a Preliminary SWH Cash Deficiency and a Preliminary SWH

in the preparation of the Final Closing Statement, subject to the execution by
the Securityholders' Agent of any release or indemnification agreement

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) If Purchaser and the Securityholders' Agent are unable to
resolve the Disputed Items within the thirty (30) day period after Purchaser's
receipt of a Dispute Notice, the Securityholders' Agent and Purchaser shall
jointly engage a nationally recognized accounting firm selected promptly by
agreement of Purchaser and the Securityholders' Agent (the "Arbitrating
Accountant") or, if they are unable to agree, by lot conducted jointly by
Purchaser's accountant and the Securityholders' Agent's accountant (or an
accountant selected by the Securityholders' Agent) from among the "Big Four"
nationally-recognized accounting firms or such other accounting firm as agreed
to by the parties. Any Disputed Item shall only be deemed resolved by mutual
agreement of the parties if such resolution is set forth in a writing signed
by Purchaser and the Securityholders' Agent, and no other communication, oral
or written, including by electronic mail, shall establish any such resolution.
Neither Purchaser nor the Securityholders' Agent shall engage in any
communication of any kind, whether oral or written, with the Arbitrating
Accountant except in the presence (in person or telephonically) of the other
such party, or, in the case of written communications (including electronic
mail), without such other party simultaneously receiving a copy of any such
communications. The Arbitrating Accountant's sole function shall be to
arbitrate each Disputed Item in accordance with the requirements of Section
2.14. The Arbitrating Accountant shall allow Purchaser and the
Securityholders' Agent to present their respective positions regarding the
Disputed Items and shall thereafter as promptly as possible provide the
parties hereto a written determination of each Disputed Item, and such written
determination shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto, and judgment
may be entered on the award. The Arbitrating Accountant may, at its
discretion, conduct a conference concerning the Disputed Items, at which
conference each party shall have the right to present additional documents,
materials and other information and to have present its advisors, counsel and
accountants. In connection with such process, there shall be no other
hearings or any oral examinations, testimony, depositions, discovery or other
similar proceedings. The Arbitrating Accountant shall address only the issues
in dispute, shall make its decision solely on the basis of the evidence and
position papers presented to it, and may not assign a value to any Disputed
Item greater than the greatest value for such Disputed Item claimed by a party
or less than the smallest value for such Disputed Item claimed by a party.
The Arbitrating Accountant shall promptly, and in any event within sixty (60)
days after the date of its appointment, render its decision on the question in
writing and finalize the Final Closing Statement. The fees and expenses of
the Arbitrating Accountant ("Arbitration Costs"), if any, shall be borne by
the party whose calculations of the Disputed Items (a) are not selected by the
Arbitrating Accountant in its final determination of the Disputed Items or (b)
differ by the greater amount  \t\t

Items. Upon final resolution of the Final Closing Statement and each Disputed
Item, the Final Closing Statement shall be revised to reflect such resolution
and the Arbitrating Accountant's determination shall become binding on all
parties. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.16 Allocation. The parties agree to an allocation of
$100,000,000 of the Merger Consideration to the SWHNY Stock and the remaining
Merger Consideration to the SWH Units. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.17 Withholding. Each of Purchaser and the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it reasonably determines
that it is required to deduct and withhold under applicable Law with respect
to the making of such payment; provided, that Purchaser shall consult with the
Securityholders' Agent in good faith prior to withholding any amounts payable
to any Stockholder hereunder (other than in respect of any Stock Options or
payments of compensation arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement). To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
party in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.18 Tax Treatment of Escrow and Star Payment. All parties
hereto agree for all Tax purposes: (a) the right of the Stockholders to the
Star Payment and any amounts released from the Escrow Account shall be treated
as deferred contingent purchase price that is eligible for installment sale
treatment under IRC § 453 and any corresponding provision of state, local or
non-U.S. Law, as appropriate; (b) Purchaser shall be treated as the owner of
the Escrow Account solely for Tax purposes, and all interest and earnings
earned from the investment and reinvestment of the Escrow Account, or any
portion thereof, shall be allocable to Purchaser pursuant to IRC § 468B(g) and
Proposed Treasury Regulation Sections 1.468B-8; provided that 40% of such
interest and earnings shall be distributed to Purchaser on a quarterly basis
(and prior to the Release Date); and (c) if and to the extent the Star Payment
or amount of the Escrow Account, as applicable, is actually distributed to the
Stockholders, interest may be imputed on such amount, as required by IRC § 483
or 1274. All parties hereto shall file all Tax Returns consistent with the
foregoing. \t\t

the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit any party from
disclosing any information relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (i) to any current or prospective investor or limited partner of
such party to the extent such disclosure is made in the ordinary course of
such party's business, (ii) as may be required by Law, (iii) to the extent
such information was previously disclosed in accordance with the first
sentence of this Section 6.6 or (iv) in the case of Purchaser by its listing
agreement with any securities exchange as determined in its good faith
judgment (in which case such party shall not issue or cause the publication of
such press release or other public announcement without prior consultation
insofar as practicable with the Securityholders' Agent). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.7 Confidentiality. Each party hereto will, and will use
reasonable efforts to cause its officers, employees, accountants, consultants,
legal counsel and other representatives, not disclose to any Person any
information regarding the other parties or any of the terms or conditions of
this Agreement and transactions contemplated hereby, provided, however,
that: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) any of such information may be disclosed to a party's
officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel or other
representatives who need to know such information in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) any disclosure of such information to which the other
parties consent in writing may be made; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) any of such information may be disclosed if compelled by
judicial or regulatory process (including without limitation in connection
with obtaining the necessary approvals of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
the foregoing, this Section 6.7 shall not apply to information which (i) is
already in a party's possession (provided that such information is neither (A)
learned by such party as part of the due diligence for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement nor (B) known by such party to be subject to
another confidentiality agreement with, or other obligation of secrecy to,
another party), (ii) becomes generally available to the public other than as a
result of a disclosure by a party or its officers, employees, accountants,
consultants, legal counsel or other representatives (other than in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement), (iii) becomes available to a party on a
nonconfidential basis from a source other than another party or its officers,
employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel or other representatives
(provided that such source is not known by such party to be bound by a
confidentiality agreement with or other obligation of secrecy to another
party) or (iv) such party is required to disclose by Law. \t\t

Closing with respect to any event that occurs prior to Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall obtain and
fully pay the premium for the extension of the directors' and officers',
professional and fiduciary liability coverage of the Company's existing
directors' and officers', professional and fiduciary liability insurance
policies, for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years
from and after the Closing Date with respect to any claim related to any
period of time at or prior to the Closing Date from an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier
such insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are no less advantageous than the coverage provided under the Company's
existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement,
misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter
claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Closing Date (including in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.9 Access and Investigation. Between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, and upon reasonable advance written notice
received from Purchaser, the Company shall afford Purchaser, its
Representatives and its lenders and their Representatives reasonable access,
during regular business hours, to the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
properties, personnel, contracts, books and records and other documents and
data as Purchaser reasonably requests, and to make extracts and copies of such
books and records, such right of access shall to be exercised in a manner that
does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company's business.
No investigation by Purchaser prior to or after the date of this Agreement
shall diminish or obviate any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Company or the Seller contained in this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents. In order that Purchaser may have full opportunity to
make such physical, business, accounting and legal review, examination or
investigation as it may reasonably request regarding the affairs of the
Company, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Representatives to cooperate with Purchaser's Representatives in connection
with such review and examination, except to the extent prohibited by any
applicable Law or to the extent doing so would result in the waiver of any
legal protection. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.10 Employment and Benefit Matters. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) For the period commencing at the Closing and ending 12
months after the Closing, Purchaser agrees to maintain the compensation and
benefit levels, including base salary, annual cash incentive opportunities,
retirement benefits, and health and welfare benefits for the employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries who remain employed after the Closing (the
"Company Employees") at levels which are, in the aggregate, comparable to
those in effect for the Company Employees immediately prior to the Closing.
Purchaser will treat, and cause the applicable benefit plans to treat, the
service of the Company Employees with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
attributable to any period before the Closing as service rendered to Purchaser
or any Subsidiary of Purchaser for purposes of eligibility and vesting under
Purchaser's vacation program, health or welfare plan(s) maintained by
Purchaser, and Purchaser's defined contribution plans, except where credit
would result in duplication of benefits. Without limiting the foregoing, to
the extent that any Company Employee participates in any health or other group
welfare benefit plan of Purchaser following the Closing, (A) Purchaser shall
cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods
or required physical examinations under any health or similar welfare plan of
Purchaser to be waived with respect to the Company Employees and their
eligible dependents, to the extent waived under the corresponding plan in
which the Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing, and
(B) any deductibles paid by  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t58  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tCompany Employee under any of the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
health plans in the plan year in which the Closing occurs shall be credited
towards deductibles under the health plans of Purchaser or any Subsidiary of
Purchaser. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions
necessary and appropriate to terminate any Employee Plan identified by
Purchaser by providing the Company with written notice of such request to
terminate within a commercially reasonably time prior to the Closing Date,
with such terminations of such Employee Plans to be effective immediately
prior to the Closing Date. With respect to each Employee Plan to be
terminated as described in this Section 6.10(b), the Company shall deliver to
Purchaser, no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date,
evidence that the Company's board of directors has validly adopted resolutions
to terminate such Employee Plan (the form and substance of which shall be
subject to reasonable review and prior approval of Purchaser). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this Section 6.10 shall (i) be deemed or construed to be
an amendment or other modification of any Employee Plan or Purchaser employee
benefit plan, (ii) create any third party rights in any current or former
employee, director or other service provider of Purchaser, the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof) or
(iii) limit or interfere with the right of Purchaser and the Company to
terminate the employment of any Company Employee at any time after the
Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.11 No Negotiation. Until such time as this Agreement shall
be terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, none of the Stockholders, the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their or its Representatives shall directly
or indirectly solicit, initiate, encourage or entertain any inquiries or
proposals from, discuss or negotiate with or provide any nonpublic information
to any Person (other than the Purchaser) or its Representatives relating to
any business combination, recapitalization, sale of substantial assets, or
Investment transaction involving the Company or any Subsidiary, including the
merger or consolidation of the Company or any Subsidiary (an "Acquisition
Transaction"). The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and
the Stockholders shall, and each of the foregoing shall cause their
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Purchaser) conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Transaction. The Company and the
Stockholders shall promptly notify Purchaser if any proposals regarding an
Acquisition Transaction, or any inquiry or contact with any Person with
respect thereto, is made prior to this Agreement being terminated pursuant to
Section 9.1, and shall provide full and prompt disclosure of the details
thereof, including copies of all written materials with respect thereto, to
Purchaser. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.12 280G Shareholder Vote. The Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to submit to its shareholders promptly after the date hereof, for
approval (in a manner and with a disclosure document reasonably satisfactory
to Purchaser, with such disclosure document to be provided to Purchaser for
review and approval no later than five (5) Business Days prior to Closing) by
a vote of such shareholders as is required pursuant to Section 280G(b)(5)(B)
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the "280G Shareholder
Vote"), any such payments or other benefits that may, separately or in the
aggregate, constitute "excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder), such that,
if the 280G Shareholder Vote is received approving such payments and benefits,
such payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be "excess parachute
payments" under Section 280G of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder. Prior to such 280G Shareholder Vote, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain, from each "disqualified individual" (within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder) who might have or receive, or have the right or entitlement to
receive, a parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code, a written waiver
(in form and  \t\t

waiver to be provided to Purchaser for review and approval no later than five
(5) Business Days prior to Closing) pursuant to which such person agrees to
waive any and all right or entitlement to such parachute payment, to the
extent such payment would not be deductible pursuant to Section 280G of the
Code. Such waivers shall cease to have any force or effect with respect to
any item covered thereby to the extent the 280G Shareholder Vote for such item
is obtained. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser
evidence reasonably acceptable to Purchaser that the 280G Shareholder Vote was
solicited in accordance with Section 280G of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder and that whether the requisite number of votes of the
280G Shareholder Vote was obtained or not. \t\t

 \t\t

required, of any termination rights arising as a result of such transactions
from each such party. \t\t

Purchaser, for review and comment, an information statement to be delivered to

Agreement. Such information statement shall comply with and satisfy all
requirements under the Organizational Documents of the Company and applicable
Laws, including the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall

receiving such information statement. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, and not less than thirty (30) Business
Days after the date hereof, the Company (or the Paying Agent) will send such
information statement to each Stockholder, together with the Transmittal
Documents. The information statement will be mailed to Stockholders at least

Agent and the parties agree to cooperate in good faith to resolve any disputes
over such Tax Return, provided that if the Securityholders' Agent and
Purchaser are unable to reach an agreement, the matter shall be referred to a
nationally recognized independent accounting firm, whose determination shall
control. The costs of the accounting firm shall be borne equally fifty
percent (50%) by Stockholders and fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser. If the
accounting firm is unable to resolve such dispute prior to the filing due date
for any applicable Tax Return, the applicable Tax Return shall be filed as
prepared by Purchaser in respect of such disputed matter, the filing of which
shall not prejudice or otherwise control the accounting firm's resolution of
such matter. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Purchaser, the Company and their Subsidiaries shall cause
the Tax year of the Company and its Subsidiaries to end at the end of the day
on the Closing Date for federal and applicable state, local and foreign income
tax purposes. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.2 Books and Records; Cooperation; Post-Closing Tax
Actions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Following the Closing, each party shall (and shall cause
their Affiliates to) (i) provide the other party with such assistance as may
be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return,
any audit or any examination by any taxing authority or judicial or
administrative proceeding relating to Taxes with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries; (ii) retain (and provide the other party with reasonable
access to) all records or information which may be relevant to such Tax
Return, audit, examination or proceeding until the expiration of the statute
of limitations (including any extensions thereof) applicable to such taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
taxing authority, and (iii) give to the other party reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records
and, if such other party so requests, the party will allow the other party to
take possession of such books and records. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Unless (i) required by applicable Law, (ii) with the prior
written consent of the Securityholders' Agent, not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, or (iii) as provided for in Section 8.1
(except to the extent such Tax Return was originally due before the Closing
Date), Purchaser shall not file, amend, re-file or otherwise modify any
applicable portion of any Tax Return or Tax election of the Company or its
Subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected to increase the liability of
the Stockholders and the Vested Optionholders for Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing Tax Periods under this Agreement (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, making any election  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t64  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tpursuant to IRC §§ 336 or 338 in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement). In the case of any Pre-Closing Tax Returns
that Purchaser intends to file, amend, re-file or otherwise modify pursuant to
clause (i) of the preceding sentence, Purchaser shall notify the
Securityholders' Agent not less than thirty (30) days prior to taking such
action. Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall not take any action on the Closing Date (but after the
Closing) that is outside the ordinary course of business. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.3 Apportionment of Taxes. For purposes of the payment of
any Tax refund pursuant to Section 8.4 and the indemnity contained in Section
10.2(a)(ii) or as otherwise required under this Agreement, in the case of any
Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(a) based on or measured by income or receipts, sales or use, employment, or
withholding for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-
through entity in which the Company holds a beneficial interest shall be
deemed to terminate at such time) and (b) the amount of property and ad
valorem Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period for
the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for
the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Straddle Period prior to and including the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle
Period. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.4 Tax Refunds. Any refunds for Taxes (including any
interest in respect thereof payable by a Governmental Authority) received by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, (including any amounts credited against
Taxes to which Purchaser of any of its Affiliates are otherwise liable
(including by way of any amended Tax Return) in lieu of such a refund), that
relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and that are received in cash or credited
on a Tax Return filed prior to the Release Date (or such earlier date as the
funds held in the Escrow Account are exhausted) shall be for the account of
the Stockholders, except, in each case, to the extent that such refund is
attributable to the carryback of Tax items from any taxable period beginning
after the Closing Date (or the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after
the Closing Date) to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Subject to Section 2.14(d),
Purchaser shall pay to the Securityholders' Agent any such refund or the
amount of any such credit (net of out-of-pocket expenses and Taxes) on the
later of (x) thirty (30) days after receipt or use thereof and (y) five (5)
Business Days after the Final Closing Statement is deemed final as set forth
in Section 2.14(a) and Section 2.15. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall, if
the Securityholders' Agent so requests, cause the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to file for and use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any refund for any Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent permitted under
applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.5 Tax Contests. Purchaser shall notify the
Securityholders' Agent in writing within ten (10) days upon the receipt of any
notice, or becoming aware, of any audit, examination, or other legal
proceeding with respect to Taxes for which the Stockholders may be liable
pursuant to this Agreement (a "Tax Contest"); provided, however, no failure or
delay of Purchaser in providing such notice shall reduce or otherwise affect
the obligations of the Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement, except to the
extent that the Stockholders are materially and adversely prejudiced as a
result of such failure or delay. Purchaser shall control any Tax Contest;
provided, however, if a Tax Contest relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(excluding any Straddle Period), the Securityholders' Agent shall have the
right to assume control, at its own expense, of such Tax Contest if within ten
(10) days of receiving notice of the Tax Contest the Securityholders' Agent
notifies Purchaser of its intent to take control of such Tax Contest;
provided, however, that the Securityholders' Agent shall not be entitled to
assume the control of any such Tax Contest (unless otherwise consented to in
writing by Purchaser) if the Tax Contest has a reasonable likelihood of
resulting in indemnifiable Damages that would exceed the remaining balance of
the Escrow Account. If the Securityholders' Agent assumes control of such Tax
Contest, Purchaser shall have the right to participate, at its own expense, in
such Tax Contest, and the  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t65  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tSecurityholders' Agent shall not settle or compromise such Tax Contest
without Purchaser's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed) and provided that the funds held in the Escrow Account
are sufficient to fully satisfy such compromise or settlement. If the
Securityholders' Agent does not elect to control such Tax Contest, or if such
Tax Contest relates to a Straddle Period, Purchaser shall control such Tax
Contest, provided, that the Securityholders' Agent shall have the right to
participate, at its own expense, in such Tax Contest, and Purchaser shall not
settle or compromise such Tax Contest without the Securityholders' Agent's
prior written consent (not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed). For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that any conflict arises
between the provisions of this Section 8.5 and the provisions of Section 10.5,
the provisions of this Section 8.5 shall govern. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.6 Transfer Taxes. All stamp, transfer, documentary,
sales and use, value added, registration and other such Taxes and fees
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be borne equally by Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Stockholders, on
the other hand. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tTERMINATION \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.1 Termination Prior to Closing. This Agreement may be
terminated at any time prior to the Closing: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) by the mutual written consent of Purchaser and the
Securityholders' Agent; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) by either Purchaser or the Stockholders if the Closing
shall not have been consummated on or before 12 p.m. Eastern time on March 1,
2018 (the "Termination Date"); provided, that, if on the Termination Date the
conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7.1(c) or Section 7.1(d) shall not
have been satisfied or waived, but all other conditions to Closing shall have
been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions which by their nature
can only be satisfied at or immediately prior to the Closing, which conditions
would be satisfied if the Closing Date were the Termination Date), then the
Termination Date shall automatically be extended by one ninety (90) day
period; provided, however, that neither Purchaser nor the Stockholders may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(b) if the Closing shall
not have been consummated by such date by reason of the failure of such party
to perform in all material respects any of its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) by either Purchaser or the Stockholders upon written
notice given to the other if any Governmental Authority will have issued a
final, non-appealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions the contemplated hereby or there shall be any Law enacted or
deemed applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby that makes the
consummation of such transactions illegal; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) by Purchaser if it is not in material breach of its
obligations under this Agreement, and if there shall have been a material
breach by the Company or any of the Stockholders of any of their respective
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach would result in the failure to satisfy one or more of
the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) and such breach (if curable) has
not been cured within twenty (20) days after notice thereof by Purchaser to
the Company or Securityholders' Agent, as applicable; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) by the Company if it is not in material breach of its
obligations under this Agreement, and if there shall have been a material
breach by Purchaser of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach would result in the
failure  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t66  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tto satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a)
and such breach (if curable) has not been cured within twenty (20) days after
notice thereof by the Company to Purchaser. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination
of this Agreement as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall become null
and void and of no further force or effect, and there shall be no liability or
obligation hereunder on the part of Purchaser, the Stockholders or the Company
and its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents, Representatives, successors or
assigns except that: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Purchaser or the Company, as the case may be, may have
liability to Purchaser or the Company, as the case may be, if the basis of the
termination is a knowing and willful breach by Purchaser or the Company and/or
the Stockholders, as the case may be; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Section 6.6 (Public Announcement), Section 6.7
(Confidentiality), Section 9.2 (Effect of Termination), Section 12.1
(Expenses), Section 12.2 (Governing Law and Consent to Jurisdiction) shall
survive the termination of this Agreement; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement for a period of two (2) years following such
termination. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants.
The Fundamental Representations (other than the representations and warranties
of the Company set forth in Section 4.9 (Tax Matters)) and the representations
and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 4.22 (Health Care
Regulatory Compliance) and Section 4.24 (Illegal Payments) shall survive the
Closing until the second anniversary of the Closing Date. The representations
and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 4.9 (Tax Matters) and the
indemnity provided in Section 10.2(a)(iii) shall survive the Closing until
sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(as it may be extended). The representations and warranties of the Purchaser,
the Company and the Stockholders contained in this Agreement (other than the
Fundamental Representations and the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in Section 4.22 (Health Care Regulatory Compliance) and
Section 4.24 (Illegal Payments)) and the agreements and covenants of the
Company and the Stockholders to be performed prior to the Closing shall
survive the Closing until the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing

shall not affect the rights of a party in respect of any claim made by such
party in a writing received by the other party in accordance with the terms of
this Article X prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period
provided herein. All agreements and covenants contained herein which by their
terms contemplate actions or impose obligations following the Closing shall
survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms or in the case of any covenant or agreement without an express
date for completion or performance, the date that is two (2) years following
the Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.2 Right to Indemnification. \t\t

 \t\t

respective officers, directors, managers, employees, stockholders,
contractors, agents and other Representatives ("Purchaser Indemnified
Parties") against, and hold each of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties harmless
from, any Losses incident or related to or arising out of or in connection
with: \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) the failure of any representation or warranty of the
Company or the Signing Stockholders in this Agreement to be true and correct
as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, or if expressly made as of
an earlier date, as of such date (without giving effect to any materiality or
similar qualification contained or incorporated directly or indirectly in any
representation or warranty); \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) the breach of any agreement, covenant or obligation of the
Company or the Stockholders set forth in this Agreement;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) regardless of any disclosure of any matter set forth on

Company or its Subsidiaries or for which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is liable (1) under Treasury Regulations § 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of Law) by reason of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
having been a member of any group on or prior to the Closing Date, (2) by
reason of any contract (other than a customary commercial agreement entered
into in the ordinary course of business that is primarily not related to
Taxes, such as a license, lease or credit agreement) entered into prior to the
Closing, or (3) by reason of assumption, successor or transferee Liability or
operation of Law; or (C) the Taxes borne by the Stockholders under Section
8.6; (clauses (i)-(iii), collectively "Damages"); and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) any claim brought by any Securityholder with respect to
any exercise of dissenters' appraisal rights pursuant to the DGCL to the
extent (i) such claim relates to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) such Loss exceeds such
Securityholder's applicable portion of the Merger Consideration. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Purchaser shall indemnify the Stockholders against, and
hold the Stockholders harmless from, any Losses actually paid to third parties
or incurred by a Stockholder that are incident or related to or arise out of
or in connection with: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) the failure of any representation or warranty of Purchaser
in this Agreement to be true and correct as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing Date, or if expressly made as of an earlier date, as of such date;
and \t\t

Purchaser set forth in this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.3 Escrow; Threshold; Limitations on Indemnity. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) The maximum aggregate liability of the Indemnifying
Securityholders under Section 10.2(a)(i) (except in respect of the Fundamental
Representations and the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in Section 4.22 (Health Care Regulatory Compliance) and Section 4.24
(Illegal Payments)) shall be an amount equal to the Escrow Amount. The
maximum aggregate liability of the Indemnifying Securityholders under Section

 \t\t\t10.2(a)(i) solely with respect to Fundamental Representations and
under Sections 10.2(a)(ii) - Section 10.2(a)(iv) shall be an amount equal to
the Merger Consideration actually paid to the Indemnifying Securityholders.
The maximum aggregate liability of the Indemnifying Securityholders under
Section 10.2(a)(i) solely with respect to the representations and warranties
of the Company set forth in Section 4.22 (Health Care Regulatory Compliance)
and Section 4.24 (Illegal Payments) shall be forty million dollars
($40,000,000) less any amounts paid to Purchaser whether from the Escrow
Account or otherwise for indemnification claims hereunder.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) The amount in the Escrow Account shall be released to the
Securityholders as follows on the date that is five (5) Business Days
following the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the
"Release Date"): the difference, if positive, obtained by subtracting from the
remaining funds in the Escrow Account an amount equal to (x) the aggregate
amount of unsatisfied claims for Damages of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
under Section 10.2(a)(i) - (iv) properly made on or prior to the Release Date
in accordance with the provisions of this Article X and the Escrow Agreement.
Further, from and after the Release Date, to the extent that (A) any amounts
have been withheld in respect of unsatisfied claims made in accordance with
this Article X and (B) the applicable underlying claims are resolved in favor
of the Indemnifying Party, then such amount shall be promptly released to the
Securityholders in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) No payment from the Escrow Account with respect to any
Damages otherwise payable under Section 10.2(a)(i) shall be payable until such
time as all such Damages shall aggregate to more than one million five hundred
thousand dollars ($1,500,000) (the "Damage Threshold"), after which time the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be indemnified against and
compensated and reimbursed for the amount of all such Damages solely to the
extent that such amount exceeds the Damage Threshold; provided, that the
Damage Threshold shall not apply to any Damages related to the failure of any
of the Fundamental Representations or the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in Section 4.22 (Health Care Regulatory Compliance) and
Section 4.24 (Illegal Payments) to be true and correct. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Damage Threshold shall not apply to any claims for indemnification
under Section 10.2(a)(ii) - (iv). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) No payment from the Escrow Account with respect to any
particular Damage otherwise payable under Section 10.2(a)(i) shall be payable
unless such Damage (including any series of related Damages) equals or exceeds
fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) (the "De Minimis Threshold"); provided, that
the De Minimis Threshold shall not apply to any Damages related to the failure
of any of the Fundamental Representations or the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Section 4.22 (Health Care Regulatory
Compliance) and Section 4.24 (Illegal Payments) to be true and correct. For
avoidance of doubt, the De Minimis Threshold shall not apply to any claims for
indemnification under Section 10.2(a)(ii) - (iv). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Absent Fraud, the
indemnification provisions contained in this Article X are intended to provide
the sole and exclusive remedy following the Closing as to all money damages
for any action arising out of the subject matter of this Agreement (it being
understood that nothing in this Section 10.3(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall affect the parties' rights to specific performance or other equitable
remedies to enforce the parties' obligations under this Agreement). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t69  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Under no circumstance will any Indemnifying
Securityholder's obligation under Section 10.2 exceed an amount equal to such
Indemnifying Securityholder's Pro Rata Share of the Merger Consideration
actually paid to such Securityholder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Each Purchaser Indemnified Party's sole remedy for Losses
with respect to Taxes under this Agreement (including, but not limited to,
breaches of a representation or warranty contained in Section 4.9 (Tax
Matters) or otherwise) shall be limited to Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) The amount of any Losses subject to indemnification under
Section 10.2(a) shall be calculated net of any Loss Tax Benefit actually
realized by a Purchaser Indemnified Party in the year of the Losses giving
rise to such indemnification claim. For purposes hereof, "Loss Tax Benefit"
shall mean the Tax savings or benefits actually realized by a Purchaser
Indemnified Party that is attributable to any deduction, loss, credit, refund
or other reduction in Tax resulting from or arising out of such Losses, in
each case computed after taking into account all other items. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.4 Determination of Amount.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Subject to this Section 10.4, after the Closing, the
Indemnifying Party shall have no right of contribution against Purchaser or
the Company for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of the Company or the Securityholders. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Insurance. For purposes of determining the amount of
Losses against which any Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to Section 10.2, such Losses will be determined net of
any insurance proceeds arising from any insurance policies maintained by the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries and fully paid prior to the Closing Date
actually recovered by such Purchaser Indemnified Person from any third party
with respect thereto during the calendar year of such Loss or the calendar
year following such Loss (net of any costs of collection and the value of any
increases in premium to such Purchaser Indemnified Person as a result of such
claim for insurance proceeds). Any Purchaser Indemnified Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to recover any amounts from the Company's
insurance carrier or other third party from whom they may reasonably be
entitled to receive indemnification proceeds related to any Loss, provided
that no action need be taken in respect of such insurance carriers or third
parties prior to making an indemnification claim hereunder. In the event that
any Purchaser Indemnified Party receives amounts from an insurance carrier or
other third party that would have reduced the amount of Losses to which such
Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled hereunder pursuant to this Section
10.4(b) after such Purchaser Indemnified Party has received payment in respect
of such Losses hereunder (whether from the Escrow Amount or otherwise), such
Purchaser Indemnified Party shall refund to the Securityholders' Agent the
portion of such amount which would be payable to the Stockholders for further
distribution to such Stockholders and will refund the portion of such amount
to the Company for further distribution to the Vested Optionholders through
the Company's payroll system at the next payroll date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) No Duplication. Any Loss for which the Purchaser
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder shall be determined
without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to
such Loss constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty or
covenant or being indemnifiable under more than one provision hereof. Losses
shall not include any items (A) included on the Latest Balance Sheet or (B) to
the extent included in the calculation of (i) SWH Equity, (ii) SWHNY Equity or
(iii) Group (Ex NY and Mass) Working Capital (in each case, solely with
respect to the Pre-Closing Tax Period). \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.5 Indemnification Procedures. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Indemnification Notices. In order to obtain indemnity in
respect of a Loss as provided by Section 10.2, a Purchaser Indemnified Party
shall give an "Indemnification Notice" to the Securityholders' Agent. For the
purposes hereof, an "Indemnification Notice" shall mean a notice signed by any
officer of Purchaser and delivered to the Securityholders' Agent and (i)
stating that Purchaser has paid, incurred, sustained or accrued, or reasonably
anticipates that it will be obligated to pay, incur, sustain or accrue, a Loss
against which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder, (ii) specifying in
reasonable detail the nature of such Loss (including the calculation thereof
or the basis for estimation thereof), the date insofar as practicable such
Loss was paid or is expected to be incurred, sustained or accrued or the basis
on which it anticipates incurring, sustaining or accruing such Loss, and the
nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant, Tax matter or
other matter resulting in such Loss or out of which such Loss arose or to
which such Loss relates, (iii) providing copies of all documents, notices,
claims or other related materials relating to such Loss, and (iii) specifying
the amount of cash to be delivered to Purchaser (for the benefit of the
pertinent Purchaser Indemnified Party) as indemnity against each such Loss;
provided, that the failure in providing such notice shall not affect the
rights of the Purchaser Indemnified Party to indemnification hereunder except
to the extent that any of the Indemnifying Securityholders (as such) are
actually prejudiced by such failure. If a Loss is anticipated but not yet
incurred, sustained or accrued at the time an Indemnification Notice is given,
an additional Indemnification Notice shall be given providing such information
regarding the Loss incurred, sustained or accrued as was not included in an
earlier Indemnification Notice. In the case where a Purchaser Indemnified
Party other than Purchaser shall seek to obtain the indemnity provided by
Section 10.2, Purchaser shall give an appropriate Indemnification Notice on
behalf of such Purchaser Indemnified Party, provided, that such Purchaser
Indemnified Party has provided to Purchaser such information as Purchaser may
reasonably request for such purpose. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Third-Party Claims. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) Purchaser shall give the Securityholders' Agent written
notice (a "Third Party Claim Notice", which shall be part of an
Indemnification Notice) of any claim, assertion or action by or in respect of
a third party, including any civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory,
investigative or arbitral proceeding other than those relating to Taxes (a
"Third Party Claim"), as to which a Purchaser Indemnified Party may request
indemnification hereunder or as to which the Damages Threshold may be applied
as soon as is practicable and in any event within ten (10) days of the time
that such Purchaser Indemnified Party learns of such Third Party Claim;
provided, however, that the failure to so notify the Securityholders' Agent
shall not affect the rights of the Purchaser Indemnified Party to
indemnification hereunder except to the extent that any of the Indemnifying
Securityholders (as such) are actually prejudiced by such failure. The
Securityholders' Agent shall have the right, on behalf of the Indemnifying
Securityholders, at its sole option and expense, to assume control of the
defense of any Third Party Claim that relates to any Damages with respect to
which the Indemnifying Securityholders have acknowledged in writing its
obligation to provide indemnification for hereunder subject to the monetary
limitations set forth herein, and to employ counsel of its choosing in
connection therewith, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser; provided, however, that the Securityholders' Agent shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (unless otherwise
consented to in writing by Purchaser) if (A) the Third Party Claim relates to
or arises in connection with a Legal Proceeding that is criminal in nature or
being brought by a Governmental Authority, (B) the Third Party Claim seeks an
injunction restricting the conduct of the Company's business, (C) the Third
Party Claim has a reasonable likelihood of resulting in indemnifiable Damages
that would exceed two-times (2x) the remaining balance of the Escrow Account,
or (D) the Third  \t\t

 \t\t\tParty Claim involves as a claimant a customer, client or supplier of
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) The Securityholders' Agent shall have ninety (90) days
after receipt of a Third Party Claim Notice (or such shorter period of time as
may be necessitated by the nature of such Third Party Claim and specified in
the Third Party Claim Notice in order to avoid actual prejudice to Purchaser)
to notify Purchaser if the Securityholders' Agent will assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim. If the Securityholders' Agent has the right to and
elects to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (or Purchaser has
consented to Securityholders' Agent assumption of such defense), (A) Purchaser
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choosing at
Purchaser's expense; provided, however, that the reasonable fees and expenses
of separate counsel retained by Purchaser shall be paid out of the Escrow
Account if Purchaser, upon the advice of counsel, shall have reasonably
concluded that a conflict exists between Purchaser and the Indemnifying
Securityholders, or (y) Purchaser assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim
after the Securityholders' Agent has assumed the defense and then failed to
diligently pursue such Third Party Claim; and (B) the Securityholders' Agent
shall (w) conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim with reasonable
diligence and keep Purchaser reasonably informed of material developments in
the Third Party Claim at all stages thereof, except as prohibited by Law or to
the extent doing so would result in the waiver of legal protections, (x)
promptly submit to Purchaser copies of all pleadings, responsive pleadings,
motions and other similar legal documents and papers received or filed in
connection therewith, (y) permit Purchaser and its counsel to confer with
Stockholder's counsel on the conduct of the defense thereof and (z) permit
Purchaser and its counsel an opportunity to review all legal papers to be
submitted prior to their submission. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) For so long as the Indemnifying Party has asserted and
preserved its right to contest, defend, litigate and settle, in accordance
with the provisions of this Article X, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
exclusive right to contest, defend and litigate the Third Party Claim and
shall have the exclusive right, in its discretion in good faith, to settle
such matter, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, either before or after the initiation of litigation at such time,
upon such terms and conditions as it deems reasonable and fair, provided that
such judgment, compromise or settlement (i) provides exclusively for the
payment by the Indemnifying Party of money as the sole relief of the claimant
which is available for recovery from the Escrow Account or (ii) involves no
findings or admission of any violation of Law or the rights of any Person and
no effect on any other claims that may be made against the indemnified Person.
Any other compromise, settlement or offer of settlement of any Third Party
Claim by the Securityholders' Agent shall require the prior written consent of
Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Any compromise, settlement or offer of settlement of any Third Party
Claim by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates shall require the prior
written consent of the Securityholders' Agent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) If the Securityholders' Agent fails to notify Purchaser
within ninety (90) days after receipt of a Third Party Claim Notice of its
assumption of such Third Party Claim, Purchaser shall be entitled to assume
the defense of such Third Party Claim with the reasonable expenses of such
defense to be paid out of the Escrow Account, provided, however, that the
Securityholders' Agent may participate in the defense of such Third Party
Claim (with the same rights of Purchaser as are set forth in clause (ii)(B)
above) with its own counsel at the expense of the Securityholders. \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Resolution of Conflicts. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) If the Securityholders' Agent objects in writing to any
claim or claims for indemnification made in any Indemnification Notice within
thirty (30) days after delivery of such Indemnification Notice, then the
Securityholders' Agent and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to agree upon
the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If
the Securityholders' Agent and Purchaser should so agree, a memorandum setting
forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith
negotiation within sixty (60) days after delivery of an Indemnification
Notice, either Purchaser or the Securityholders' Agent may commence litigation
with respect to such matter unless the amount of the Loss is at issue in
pending litigation or arbitration with a third party, in which event such
litigation shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both
parties agree to arbitration.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.6 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Any indemnity
payment made pursuant to this Article X shall be treated as an adjustment to
the Merger Consideration for federal, state, local and foreign income tax
purposes unless a contrary treatment is required under applicable Law. \t\t

provided in this Agreement, subject to the Securityholders' Agent's right to
retain amounts to pay expenses incurred in connection with fulfillment of its

with and as required by the respective priorities, preferences and rights set

 \t\t

responsibilities hereunder, except as otherwise contemplated in this

 \t\t\tSection 11.5 Actions by Securityholders. Each Securityholder agrees
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, at the request of Purchaser or the
Securityholders' Agent, such Securityholder shall take all actions necessary
or appropriate to consummate the transaction contemplated hereby (including,

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.2 Governing Law and Consent to Jurisdiction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) This Agreement will be governed in all respects, including
validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws of the State of Delaware
(irrespective of its choice of law principles) applicable to contracts
executed and to be performed wholly within such state. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery or federal court located in

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.4 Waiver of Conflicts; Privilege. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that
Goodwin Procter LLP ("Goodwin") and Greenberg Traurig LLP ("GT") have acted as
counsel to the Company, the Company's Subsidiaries, the Securityholders' Agent
and each of the Stockholders in connection with the negotiation of this
Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t75  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Purchaser hereby consents and agrees to, and agrees to
cause the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries to consent and agree to,
Goodwin and/or GT representing the Securityholders' Agent and/or any of the
Stockholders (collectively, the "Securityholder Parties") after the Closing,
including with respect to disputes in which the interests of the
Securityholder Parties may be directly adverse to Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries (including the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries), and even
though Goodwin and/or GT may have represented the Company or the Company's
Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to any such dispute, or may be
handling ongoing matters for the Company or the Company's Subsidiaries.
Purchaser further consents and agrees to, and agrees to cause the Company and
the Company's Subsidiaries to consent and agree to, the communication by
Goodwin and/or GT to the Securityholder Parties in connection with any such
representation of any fact known to Goodwin or GT arising by reason of
Goodwin's or GT's prior representation of the Company and the Company's
Subsidiaries. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) In connection with the foregoing, Purchaser hereby
irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, and agrees to cause the Company
and the Company's Subsidiaries to irrevocably waive and not to assert, any
conflict of interest arising from or in connection with (i) Goodwin's or GT's
prior representation of the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries and (ii)
Goodwin's and GT's representation of the Securityholders' Agent and the
Stockholders prior to and after the Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Purchaser further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after
the Closing, on behalf of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, that all
communications in any form or format whatsoever between or among any of
Goodwin, GT, the Company, the Company's Subsidiaries, the Securityholders'
Agent and/or any Stockholder, or any of their respective directors, officers
employees or other agents that relate in any way to the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any dispute arising under this Agreement (collectively, the "Deal
Communications") shall be deemed to be retained and owned collectively by the
Stockholders, shall be controlled by the Securityholders' Agent on behalf of
the Stockholders and shall not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser, the Company
or any of the Company's Subsidiaries. All Deal Communications that are
attorney-client privileged (the "Privileged Deal Communications") shall remain
privileged after the Closing and the privilege and the expectation of client
confidence relating thereto shall belong solely to the Securityholders' Agent
and the Stockholders, shall be controlled by the Securityholders' Agent on
behalf of the Stockholders and shall not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser,
the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between Purchaser, the Company or the Company's Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and a third party other than the Securityholders' Agent or a
Stockholder, on the other hand, Purchaser, the Company or the Company's
Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent the
disclosure of the Privileged Deal Communications to such third party;
provided, however, that none of Purchaser, the Company or the Company's
Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the written consent of the
Securityholders' Agent. In the event that Purchaser, the Company or any
Company's Subsidiary is legally required by governmental order or otherwise to
access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Deal Communications,
Purchaser shall immediately (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days)
notify the Securityholders' Agent in writing (including by making specific
reference to this Section) so that the Securityholders' Agent can seek a
protective order and Purchaser agrees to use all commercially reasonable
efforts to assist therewith. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) To the extent that files or other materials maintained by
Goodwin or GT constitute property of their clients, only the Securityholders'
Agent and the Stockholders shall hold such property rights and Goodwin and GT
shall have no duty to reveal or disclose any such files or other  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t76  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tmaterials or any Privileged Deal Communications by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between Goodwin or GT, on the one hand, and the
Company or the Company's Subsidiaries, on the other hand. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) Purchaser agrees that it will not, and that it will cause
the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries not to, (i) access or use the Deal
Communications, including without limitation by way of review of any
electronic data, communications or other information, by seeking the same in
discovery or by seeking to have the Securityholders' Agent or any Stockholder
waive the attorney-client or other privilege, or by otherwise asserting that
Purchaser, the Company or any Company Subsidiary has the right to waive the
attorney-client or other privilege or (ii) seek to obtain the Deal
Communications from Goodwin or GT. In furtherance of the foregoing, it shall
not be a breach of any provision of this Agreement if prior to the Closing the
Company, the Company's Subsidiaries, the Securityholders' Agent and/or any
Stockholder, or any of their respective directors, officers employees or other
agents takes any action to protect from access or remove from the premises of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (or any offsite back-up or other
facilities) any Deal Communications, including without limitation by
segregating, encrypting, copying, deleting, erasing, exporting or otherwise
taking possession of any Deal Communications (any such action, a "Permitted
Removal"). In the event that, notwithstanding any good faith attempts by the
Securityholders' Agent or any Stockholder, or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees or other agents to achieve a Permitted Removal
of any Deal Communication, any copy, backup, image, or other form or version
or electronic vestige of any portion of such Deal Communication remains
accessible to or discoverable or retrievable by Purchaser (each, a "Residual
Communication"), Purchaser agrees that it will not, and that it will cause the
Company and the Company's Subsidiaries, and their respective directors,
officers, employees or other agents not to intentionally use or attempt to use
any means to access, retrieve, restore, recreate, unarchive or otherwise gain
access to or view any Residual Communication for any purpose. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, this Section 11.4 shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties and their respective successors and assigns. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.5 Notices. All notices, consents and other communications
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (a)
on the Business Day (or the next succeeding Business Day if the date of
delivery is not a Business Day) when delivered by hand or by Federal Express,
UPS or similar commercial overnight courier with provisions for a receipt; (b)
five days after being deposited in any United States Post Office postage
prepaid, registered or certified mail; or (c) on the Business Day (or the next
succeeding Business Day if the date of delivery is not a Business Day) when
successfully transmitted by telecopier (with a confirming copy of such
communication to be sent as provided in clauses (a) or (b) above), to the
receiving party at the address or telecopier number set forth below (or at
such other address or telecopier number for a party as shall be specified by
like notice); provided, however that any notice of change of address or
telecopier number shall be effective only upon receipt: \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
multiple counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be
deemed an original, and all of which shall together be considered one and the
same Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.7 Partial Invalidity. Whenever possible, each provision
of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and
valid under applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions
contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, this Agreement shall be construed as if such illegal
or unenforceable provision or provisions had never been contained in this
Agreement unless the deletion of such provision or provisions would result in
such a material change as to cause completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby to be unreasonable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.8 Service of Process. Each party irrevocably consents to
the service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts
referred to in Section 12.2(b) hereof in any such action or proceeding by
having copies thereof mailed by registered United States mail, postage
prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant
to Section 12.5 hereof. However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a
party to effect service of process on the other party by any other legally
available method. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.9 Assignment; Binding Agreement. Neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned,
in whole or in part, by any party (whether by operation of law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of Purchaser, on the one hand or
Securityholders' Agent, on the other hand. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted successors and
assigns. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.10 Waivers. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, any failure of either party to comply with any obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition herein may, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, be waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefits
thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver,
but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.11 No Double Recovery. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, no party shall be entitled to indemnification or
reimbursement under any provision of this Agreement for any amount to the
extent such party has been indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any
other provision of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.12 Delivery by Facsimile or PDF. This Agreement
and any agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and
delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by electronic transmission in
Portable Document Format (.pdf) or other electronic format, shall be treated
in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be
considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party
hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each other party hereto or
thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all other
parties. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise
the use of a facsimile machine or.pdf format or other electronic format to
deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument
was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or by
electronic transmission as a defense to the formation of a contract and each
such party forever waives any such defense. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.13 Specific Performance. Each party acknowledges
and agrees that the other parties would be damaged irreparably in the event
any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or otherwise is breached, so that a party shall be entitled to
injunctive relief without any requirement for the posting of a bond to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the
terms and provisions hereof in addition to any other remedy to which such
party may be entitled, at law or in equity. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.14 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the
instruments to be delivered by the parties pursuant to the provisions hereof,
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the
parties and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective legal Representatives, heirs, successors and
permitted assigns. Each Exhibit and Schedule shall be considered incorporated
into this Agreement. Any matter disclosed in any portion of the Schedules is
deemed to have been disclosed for the purpose of all relevant provisions of
this Agreement to the extent its relevance is readily apparent. The inclusion
of any item in the Schedules is not evidence of the materiality of such item
for the purposes of this Agreement. The parties make no representations or
warranties to each other, express or implied, except for the representations
and warranties expressly contained in this Agreement, and any and all prior
representations and warranties made by any party or its Representatives,
whether verbally or in writing, are deemed to have been merged into this
Agreement, it being intended that no such prior representations or warranties
shall  \t\t

acknowledges that any estimates, forecasts, or projections furnished or made
available to it concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries or their
properties, business or assets have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP,
SAP or standards applicable under applicable securities laws, and such
estimates, forecasts and projections reflect numerous assumptions, and are
subject to material risks and uncertainties. Purchaser acknowledges that
actual results may vary, perhaps materially. Purchaser further acknowledges
that it has relied solely on the representations and warranties of the Company
and the Stockholders expressly contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, upon the execution of this
Agreement by the Company, the Purchaser, the Securityholders' Agent and the
Signing Stockholders, this Agreement shall be binding upon such parties. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 12.15 Mutual Waiver of Jury Trial. As a specifically
bargained inducement for each of the parties to enter into this Agreement
(with each party having had opportunity to consult counsel), each party hereto
expressly and irrevocably waives the right to trial by jury in any lawsuit or
legal proceeding relating to or arising in any way from this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein, and any lawsuit or legal proceeding relating
to or arising in any way to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
herein shall be tried in a court of competent jurisdiction by a judge sitting
without a jury. \t\t
