indemnification against an Indemnifying Party under this Agreement (a &#147;<U>Third Party Claim</U>&#148;),

reduced by any amounts (or, in the case of a claim under Section&nbsp;13.1(b), one-half of such amounts
for each Indemnifying Party) actually received (including amounts received under insurance
policies) by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party from third parties (net out-of-pocket costs and

being expressly understood and agreed that no insurer or any other third party shall be entitled to
any benefit they would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions
