 SECTION 13.3 _Indemnification Procedures_. 

  

 (a) If any claim or demand is made against an Indemnified Party with respect to any matter, or any Indemnified Party shall otherwise learn of an assertion or of a potential claim, by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement (or an Affiliate thereof) which may give rise to a claim for indemnification against an Indemnifying Party under this Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), then the Indemnified Party will reasonably promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing and in reasonable detail of the Third Party Claim (including the factual basis for the Third Party Claim, and, to the extent known, the amount of the Third Party Claim); _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party will affect the Indemnifying Partys obligations under this Article XIII, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced as a result thereof (except that the Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any expenses incurred during the period in which the Indemnified Party failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the Indemnified Party will deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all non-ministerial notices and documents (including court papers) received or transmitted by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim. 

  

 (b) The Indemnifying Party will have the right to participate in or to assume (or in the case of a claim under Section 13.1(b), jointly assume) the defense of any Third Party Claim (in either case at the expense of the Indemnifying Party) with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense thereof (other than during any period in which the Indemnified Party shall have failed to give notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above). Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party reasonably agree that a conflict of interest exists in respect of such claim, such Indemnified Party will have the right to employ separate counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party to represent such Indemnified Party and in that event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel (but not more than one separate counsel for all Indemnified Parties) shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim the Indemnified Party, at its sole cost and expense, may retain separate counsel, and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party will control such defense. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) No Indemnifying Party will consent to any settlement, compromise or discharge (including the consent to entry of any judgment) of any Third Party Claim without each Indemnified Partys prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);  _provided_ , that, if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of such Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party may recommend and which by its terms obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of Damages in connection with such Third Party Claim and unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party and each member of such Indemnified Partys Group completely from all Liability in connection with such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party may refuse to agree to any such settlement, compromise or discharge (x) that provides for injunctive or other nonmonetary relief affecting the Indemnified Party or any member of such Indemnified Partys Group or (y) that, in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnified Party, would otherwise materially adversely affect the Indemnified Party or any member of such Indemnified Partys Group. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, admit any liability, consent to the entry of any judgment or agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge with respect to any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

  

 (d) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will keep the Indemnified Party informed of all material developments relating to or in connection with such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend a Third Party Claim, the Parties will cooperate in the defense thereof (and the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such cooperation), which cooperation will include the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. 

  

 (e) Any claim on account of Damages for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement that does not involve a Third Party Claim will be asserted by reasonably prompt written notice given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party from whom such indemnification is sought. The delay by any Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party will not affect the Indemnifying Partys obligations under this Article XIII, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced as a result thereof. 

  

 (f) In the event of payment in full by an Indemnifying Party (or, in the case of a claim under Section 13.1(b), by each Indemnifying Party) to any Indemnified Party in connection with any claim (an " _Indemnified Claim_ "), such Indemnifying Party will be subrogated to and will stand in the place of such Indemnified Party as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnified Party may have any right or claim relating to such Indemnified Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Indemnified Claim or against any other Person. Such Indemnified Party will cooperate with 

   ##### 

  

    

such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of
such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right or claim. 

  

 SECTION 13.4 _Certain Limitations_. 

  

 (a) The amount which an Indemnifying Party is or may be required to pay to an Indemnified Party in respect of Damages for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement will be reduced by any amounts (or, in the case of a claim under Section 13.1(b), one-half of such amounts for each Indemnifying Party) actually received (including amounts received under insurance policies) by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party from third parties (net out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with seeking to collect and collecting such amounts) in respect of such Damages (such net amounts are referred to herein as " _Indemnity Reduction Amounts_ "). If any Indemnified Party receives any Indemnity Reduction Amounts in respect of an Indemnified Claim for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement after the full amount of such Indemnified Claim has been paid by an Indemnifying Party or after an Indemnifying Party has made a partial payment of such Indemnified Claim and such Indemnity Reduction Amounts exceed the remaining unpaid balance of such Indemnified Claim, then the Indemnified Party will promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the amount theretofore paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Indemnified Claim, less (ii) the amount of the indemnity payment that would have been due if such Indemnity Reduction Amounts in respect thereof had been received before the indemnity payment was made. An insurer or other third party who would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or, solely by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof, have any subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being expressly understood and agreed that no insurer or any other third party shall be entitled to any benefit they would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof. Each Seller and Buyer will, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its Representatives to, pursue promptly any claims or rights it may have against all third parties which would reduce the amount of Damages for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement. 

  

 (b) The amount of Damages for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement will be (i) increased to take account of any Tax cost incurred (grossed up for such increase) by the Indemnified Party arising from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder (unless such indemnity payment is treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for tax purposes) and (ii) reduced to take account of any Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages. In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax benefit, the Indemnified Party will be deemed to be subject (A) to the applicable federal and/or local country Income Taxes at the maximum statutory rate then in effect and (B) to state and local Taxes (if applicable) at a combined State and local Tax rate of six percent, which will be tax effected at such maximum Tax rate. Any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Agreement will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes unless a determination (as defined in § 1313 of the Code) or a similar event under foreign Tax Law with respect to the Indemnified Party causes any such payment not to 

   ##### 

  

    

constitute an adjustment to the Purchase Price for United States federal
Income Tax purposes or foreign Tax purposes, as the case may be. 

  

 (c) Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no Seller will have any obligation to indemnify any member of the Buyer Group with respect to any matter if the Damages arise from a change in the accounting or Tax policies or practices of any of the Acquired Companies on or after the Closing Date. 

  

 (d) Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no member of the Seller Group and no member of the Buyer Group will be entitled to any recovery under this Agreement for its own special, punitive, exemplary or consequential damages or lost profits; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing herein shall prevent any member of the Seller Group or the Buyer Group from being indemnified for all components of awards against them in claims by third parties, including special, punitive, exemplary or consequential damages and lost profits components of such claims. 

  

 SECTION 13.5 _Dollar Limitations_. 

  

 (a) Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no monetary amount will be payable by any Seller to any member of the Buyer Group with respect to the indemnification of any claims pursuant to Section 13.1(b)(i) (other than with respect to claims relating to representations and warranties regarding brokers contained in Section 6.21) until the aggregate amount of Damages actually incurred by the Buyer Group with respect to such claims against both Sellers shall exceed on a cumulative basis an amount equal to One Million Five Hundred Thousand dollars ($1,500,000) (the " _Deductible_ "), in which event each Seller shall be responsible only for one-half of the amount in excess of the Deductible. In addition, no Seller will be responsible for making payments with respect to Damages for any individual items pursuant to Sections 13.1(a)(i) or Section 13.1(b)(i) (other than with respect to claims relating to representations and warranties regarding brokers contained in Sections 5.6 and 6.21) where the aggregate Damages relating thereto are less than Fifty Thousand dollars ($50,000) and such items shall not be aggregated for purposes of determining whether aggregate Damages incurred by the Buyer Group exceed the Deductible. In connection with any claim for indemnification under 13.1(b)(i), Buyer and the other members of the Buyer Group will promptly provide each Seller with written notice of all claims included in the Deductible and copies of all documents reasonably requested by any Seller relating thereto. 

  

 (b) Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event will the aggregate amount for which any Seller shall be responsible to indemnify all members of the Buyer Group for all claims under Sections 13.1(a)(i) and 13.1(b)(i) (other than with respect to claims relating to such Sellers representations and warranties with respect to title to the RSC Shares contained in Section 5.5 and brokers contained in Sections 5.6 and Section 6.21) exceed, and each Sellers aggregate liability under Sections 13.1(a)(i) and 13.1(b)(i) (other than with respect to claims relating to such Sellers representations and warranties with respect to title to the RSC Shares contained in Section 5.5 and brokers 

   ##### 

  

    

contained in Sections 5.6 and 6.21) shall be limited to, Eight Million Five
Hundred Thousand dollars ($8,500,000). 

  

 (c) Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event will the aggregate amount for which any Seller shall be responsible to indemnify all members of the Buyer Group for all claims under Sections 13.1(a)(i), 13.1(a)(ii), 13.1(b)(i), 13.1(b)(ii), 13.1(b)(iii), 13.1(b)(iv) and 13.1(b)(v) exceed, and each Sellers aggregate liability under Sections 13.1(a)(i), 13.1(a)(ii), 13.1(b)(i), 13.1(b)(ii), 13.1(b)(iii), 13.1(b)(iv) and 13.1(b)(v) shall be limited to, an amount equal to the portion of the Purchase Price paid to such Seller. 

  

 SECTION 13.6 _Termination of Indemnification Obligations_. 

  

 (a) The representations and warranties of any Seller, Sellers or Buyer contained in Articles V, VI and VII (other than representations and warranties with respect to brokers contained in Sections 5.6, 6.21 and 7.9, representations and warranties with respect to intellectual property matters contained in Section 6.14, representations and warranties with respect to employees contained in Section 6.17, representations and warranties with respect to environmental matters contained in Section 6.19 and representations and warranties with respect to ownership of the RSC Shares contained in Section 5.5), will survive the Closing Date solely for purposes of Sections 13.1(a)(i), 13.1(b)(i) and 13.2(a), as applicable, until (and will expire and be of no further force or effect) one year after the Closing Date. The representations and warranties with respect to intellectual property matters contained in Section 6.14 and the representations and warranties with respect to employees contained in Section 6.17 will survive the Closing Date solely for purposes of Section 13.1(b)(i) until (and will expire and be of no further force or effect), two years after the Closing Date. The representations and warranties with respect to environmental matters contained in Section 6.19 will survive the Closing Date solely for purposes of Section 13.1(b)(i) until (and will expire and be of no further force or effect), three years after the Closing Date. The representations and warranties with respect to brokers contained in Sections 5.6, 6.21 and 7.9 will survive the Closing Date solely for purposes of Sections 13.1(a)(i), 13.1(b)(i) and 13.2(a), as applicable, until (and will expire and be of no further force or effect when) all applicable statutes of limitation (including any extensions thereof) have expired. Each Sellers representations and warranties with respect to ownership of the RSC Shares contained in Section 5.5 will survive the Closing Date solely for purposes of Section 13.1(a)(i) without time limitation. Each other representation and warranty made by any Party contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or contained in or made pursuant to any closing certificate or other instrument or agreement delivered by any Party pursuant to this Agreement shall not survive (and will expire at) the Closing and shall thereafter be of no further force or effect and no Party will have any obligation to provide indemnification or other Liability in respect thereof. 

  

 (b) The obligations of each Party to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the applicable Persons (i) pursuant to Sections 13.1(a)(ii), 13.1(b)(ii), 13.1(b)(v) and 13.2(b), will terminate upon the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect to any extensions thereof), (ii) pursuant to Sections 13.1(a)(i), 13.1(b)(i) and 13.2(a), will terminate 

   ##### 

  

    

when the applicable representation or warranty expires pursuant to Section
13.6(a), (iii) pursuant to Sections 13.1(b)(iii), 13.1(b)(iv), 13.2(c),
13.2(d), 13.2(e), 13.2(f), 13.2(g), 13.2(h) and 13.2(i), will not terminate
at any time; _provided_ , _however_ , that as to clauses (i) and (ii) above,
such obligations to indemnify, defend and hold harmless will not terminate
with respect to any individual item as to which an Indemnified Party shall
have, before the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim
by delivering a notice (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim)
to the applicable Indemnifying Party. 

  

 SECTION 13.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, except for claims of fraud, the indemnification provided in this Article XIII and Section 15.3 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies available to each of the Parties and their respective Affiliates and each member of the Seller Group and Buyer Group for breaches of any of the terms, conditions, representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or for any other claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and shall preclude assertion by members of the Seller Group or Buyer Group of any of other rights, claims or causes of action or the seeking of any other remedies, whether in contract, tort, strict liability, under Law (including statutory or common law) or otherwise, against Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) or any Member, respectively, with respect to breaches of any of the terms, conditions, representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or for any other claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, all of which Buyer (on behalf of itself and the other members of the Buyer Group) and each Seller (on behalf of itself, its Affiliates and each of its and its Affiliates Representatives) hereby waives. 

  

ARTICLE XIV

 (a) by mutual written consent of each Seller and Buyer; 

  

 (b) by written notice by Buyer to each Seller, if there shall have been a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of any Seller set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty set forth in Article V or VI shall have become untrue in any material respect, or if there shall have occurred any change in the business, financial condition or operations of the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole, that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, in any such case such that the conditions set forth in Section 11.1, Section 11.2, or Section 11.5 as the case may be, would not be satisfied as of such time, provided that if such breach or Material Adverse Effect is curable by any Seller or Sellers prior to October 31, 2006 through the exercise of such Sellers or Sellers commercially reasonable efforts, then for so long as such Seller or Sellers continues to exercise such commercially reasonable efforts to cure the same, Buyer may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 14.1(b); 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) by written notice by Sellers to Buyer, if there shall have been a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty set forth in Article VII shall have become untrue in any material respect, in any such case such that the conditions set forth in Section 12.1 or Section 12.2, as the case may be, would not be satisfied as of such time, provided that if such breach is curable by Buyer prior to October 31, 2006 through the exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts, then for so long as Buyer continues to exercise such commercially reasonable efforts to cure the same, Sellers may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 14.1(c); 

  

 (d) by written notice by any Seller or Buyer to the other Parties if the Closing does not occur on or prior to October 31, 2006; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Party seeking termination pursuant to this subsection (d) is not in breach in any material respects of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; or 

  

 (e) by written notice by Buyer to Sellers or by any Seller to the other Parties, if any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall not be subject to appeal or shall have become final and unappealable. 

  

 SECTION 14.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1, this Agreement, other than with respect to the last sentence of Article VIII, Section 9.10 and Section 15.13, which will continue in effect, all rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement will terminate without any Liability on the part of any Party or its Affiliates (or, in the case of any Seller, any Member or Acquired Company) in respect thereof, except that nothing herein will relieve any Party from Liability for any willful breach of this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE XV 

   

MISCELLANEOUS  

  

 SECTION 15.1 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement is binding upon and is for the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement is not made for the benefit of any Person not a Party, and no Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns will acquire or have any benefit, right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement, except as provided in Section 9.14 and that members of the Buyer Group and the Seller Group will be entitled to the rights to indemnification provided to the Buyer Group and the Seller Group, respectively, under Article XIII. 

  

 SECTION 15.2 _Assignment_. No Party will convey, assign or otherwise transfer either this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Sellers (in the case of a conveyance, assignment or transfer by Buyer) 

   ##### 

  

    

or Buyer (in the case of a conveyance, assignment or transfer by any Seller)
in their sole and absolute discretion, except that any Party may (without
obtaining any consent) assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder to a
successor to all or any part of its business. Any conveyance, assignment or
transfer requiring the prior written consent of any Party which is made
without such consent will be void _ab_ _initio_. No assignment of this
Agreement (or any rights or obligations hereunder) will relieve the assigning
Party of its obligations hereunder. 

  

 SECTION 15.3 _Specific Performance_. In the event of any actual or threatened breach of any of the covenants or agreements in this Agreement (including Section 9.9), the Party or Parties who are or are to be thereby aggrieved shall have the right to specific performance and injunctive relief giving effect to its or their rights under this Agreement, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies at law or in equity, subject to Section 13.7. The Parties agree that any such breach or threatened breach would cause irreparable injury, that the remedies at law for any such breach or threatened breach, including monetary damages, are inadequate compensation for any loss and that any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate is waived. 

  

 SECTION 15.4 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications required or permitted to be given hereunder will be in writing and will be delivered by hand or telecopied, e-mailed or sent, postage prepaid, by registered, certified or express mail or reputable overnight courier service (and will be deemed duly given when so delivered by hand or telecopied, when e-mail confirmation is received if delivered by e-mail, or if mailed, three days after mailing (one business day in the case of express mail or overnight courier service)).

furnished as provided in this Section 15.4 by any Party to the other
Parties. 

   

 SECTION 15.5 _Waiver_. No delay on the part of any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any waiver on the part of any Party of any right, power or privilege hereunder operate as a waiver of any other right, power or privilege hereunder, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder. No waiver by any Party shall be effective unless it is evidenced by a written agreement making specific reference hereto executed by the Party granting such waiver. 

  

 SECTION 15.6 _Schedules_. 

  

 (a) All Schedules attached hereto are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full herein. The mere inclusion of information in any Schedule hereto as an exception to a representation, warranty or covenant (i) shall not be deemed an admission by any Party that such information represents a material exception or a material fact, event or circumstance or that such information has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or a "material adverse effect" on any Sellers or Buyers ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, as applicable, or (ii) constitute, or be deemed to be, an admission to any third party concerning such information. Matters reflected on any Schedule to this Agreement are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected on such Schedules. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. Matters disclosed by any Seller or Sellers to Buyer pursuant to any Section of or Schedule to this Agreement (or any section of any Schedule to this Agreement) will be deemed to be disclosed with respect to all Sections of and Schedules to this Agreement (and all sections of all Schedules to this Agreement) to the extent the disclosure is reasonably applicable to such other Sections or Schedules. Capitalized terms used in any Schedule to this Agreement but not otherwise defined therein will have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in this Agreement. If any matter set forth in the final Closing Date Schedule Supplement delivered to Buyer at the Closing was not included 

   ##### 

  

    

in the draft thereof delivered to Buyer at least three days prior to the
Closing and does not relate to matters arising after delivery of such draft
delivered at least three days prior to the Closing, Buyer shall have the
option to postpone the Closing Date for up to two business days. 

  

 (b) Sellers will have the right to deliver to Buyer at the Closing a supplement to the Schedules hereto (the " _Closing Date Schedule Supplement_") containing any matters arising or discovered after the date hereof which, if occurring prior to the date hereof, are required or permitted to be set forth or described on such Schedules. The Closing Date Schedule Supplement will have no effect for the purposes of determining the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 11.1 or any other condition to Closing. The Closing Date Schedule Supplement will, however, for purposes of determining whether any Person is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 13.1 or whether any Seller or Sellers have breached any of its representations and warranties hereunder for any purpose other than Section 11.1, be deemed to amend the Schedules hereto referenced in the Closing Date Schedule Supplement to reflect the matters set forth therein.
