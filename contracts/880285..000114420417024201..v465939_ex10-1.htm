Section 8.2   _Amendment or Supplement_. This Agreement may be
amended, supplemented or modified only by a written instrument duly executed
by Seller and Buyer, _provided, however_ , that this Agreement may not be
amended, modified or supplemented unless such amendment, modification or

decision, approval, consent or agreement of the Seller is required pursuant
to this Agreement (including any determination to exercise or refrain
from exercising any rights under this Agreement) or to enforce the terms of
this Agreement, such determination, decision, approval, consent or agreement
must be authorized by the Special Committee.

  



  

Section 8.3   _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc_. At any time prior

Buyer in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement
on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

  



  

Section 8.4   _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties, except that Buyer may assign, in
its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under
this Agreement to any Subsidiary of Buyer, but no such assignment shall
relieve Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the

respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not
permitted under this _Section 8.4_ shall be null and void.

  



  

Section 8.5   _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of

the parties and delivered to the other parties. Signatures to this Agreement
transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable
document format" (" _.pdf_ ") form, or by any other electronic means intended
to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will
have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the
original signature.

  



  

Section 8.6   _Entire Understanding; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.
This Agreement and any certificates delivered by any party pursuant to this

and (b) shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights (including third-party beneficiary rights or otherwise) or remedies
hereunder, except for, in the case of this _clause (b)_ , the provisions of
_Section 8.10_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
_Section 8.10_ shall be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, any financing
sources or lender providing financing in connection with the transaction
contemplated hereby. Any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
set forth in this Agreement are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in
accordance with _Section 8.3_ without notice or liability to any other
Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 8.7   _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  



  

(a)  This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts
executed in and to be performed entirely within that State, regardless of the
Law that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of
Law thereof. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal
action or Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder, shall be brought and determined exclusively in
the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within
the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto consents to service
of process being made upon it through the notice procedures set forth in
_Section 8.8_ , irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
Proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the aforesaid
courts. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably waives, and agrees not to
assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or Proceeding
with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other
than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section 8.7_ , (ii) any
claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of
any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any claim that (A) the suit,
action or Proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B)
the venue of such suit, action or Proceeding is improper or (C) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts. Each party hereto expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is
intended to be irrevocable under the Law of the State of Delaware and of the
United States of America; _provided_ , _however_ , that each such party's
consent to jurisdiction and service contained in this _Section 8.7(a_ ) is
solely for the purposes referred to in this _Section 8.7(a)_ and shall not be
deemed to be a general submission to such courts or in the State of Delaware
other than for such purposes.

  



  

(b)  EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
