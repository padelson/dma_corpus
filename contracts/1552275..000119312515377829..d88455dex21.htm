Section 2.4 _Borrowing by Acquiror; Tax Treatment of Consideration_.

 

(a) Prior to or upon the Closing, but no more than ninety (90) days prior to
the Closing, Acquiror shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to incur
a new and separate borrowing (which may be in the form of a new credit
facility, new term loan, a newly designated tranche of borrowings under any
existing credit facility, any new senior debt financing or any combination
thereof) that will be used by Acquiror exclusively to pay the Cash
Consideration and other expenses or disbursements directly related to the
Closing (the " _Acquiror Debt_ "). At the Closing, Contributor shall execute
and deliver to the lenders of the Acquiror Debt the Guarantee of Collection.
In the event Acquiror receives the proceeds from the Acquiror Debt prior to
the Closing, such proceeds shall be deposited and held separate from other
cash items of Acquiror until distributed to Contributor at the time of the
Closing.

 



17 (b) The Parties intend, solely for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, that (i)
the contribution by Contributor of the Acquired Interests to Acquiror in
exchange for the Unit Consideration and the Cash Consideration shall be
treated consistent with the requirements of Section 721(a) of the Code; (ii)
the distribution of the Cash Consideration to or on behalf of Contributor
shall be treated as a distribution to Contributor by Acquiror under Section
731 of the Code; (iii) the distribution of the Cash Consideration to or on
behalf of the Contributor shall be made out of proceeds of the Acquiror Debt
and shall qualify as a "debt-financed transfer" under Section 1.707-5(b) of
the Treasury Regulations; and (iv) Contributors allocable share of the
Acquiror Debt under Sections 1.752-2 and 1.707-5(a)(2)(i) of the Treasury
Regulations shall be the allocable amount of the Acquiror Debt as determined
under Section 1.707-5(b)(2) of the Treasury Regulations. Any Cash
Consideration in excess of the amount treated as a "debt-financed transfer"
or cash payments pursuant to Section 2.6(f) shall be treated (i) as a
reimbursement of Contributors preformation expenditures with respect to the
undivided interest in each asset contributed within the meaning of Section
1.707-4(d) of the Treasury Regulations to the extent applicable, and (ii) in a
transaction subject to treatment under Section 707(a) of the Code, and its
implementing Treasury Regulations, as in part a sale, and in part a
contribution, by Contributor of the Acquired Interests to the extent Section
1.707-4(d) of the Treasury Regulations is inapplicable. The Parties shall act
at all times in a manner consistent with the foregoing provisions of this 
_Section 2.4_ and agree to file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with
such treatment except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

Section 2.5 _Closing Payment Estimates_. At least two (2) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, Contributor shall prepare and deliver or cause to be
prepared and delivered to Acquiror a statement containing Contributors good
faith calculation of the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date for the
SUN Retail Business, based on the Contributor Financial Statements and
consistent with the methodology set forth on _Schedule 2.5_ (collectively, the
" _Estimated Closing Net Working Capital_ "). Contributors calculation of the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital shall be determined in accordance with
GAAP applied using the accounting principles, practices and methods that were
used in the preparation of the Contributor Financial Statements and consistent
with the methodology set forth on _Schedule 2.5_. The Cash Consideration
shall be increased by the greater of the amount of the Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital and $168,000,000.00.

 

Section 2.6 _Post-Closing Payment Reconciliation_.

 

(a) Prior to or on the date that is ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
Acquiror shall prepare and deliver or cause to be prepared and delivered to
Contributor a statement (the " _Adjustment Statement_ ") that shall set forth
Acquirors good faith calculation of the Net Working Capital as of the Closing
Date for the SUN Retail Business, based on the Contributor Financial
Statements and consistent with the methodology set forth on _Schedule 2.5_
(collectively, the " _Closing Net Working Capital_ "). Acquirors calculation
of the Closing Net Working Capital shall be determined in accordance with
GAAP applied using the accounting principles, practices and methods that were
used in the preparation of the Contributor Financial Statements and consistent
with the methodology set forth on _Schedule 2.5_.

 

(b) After receipt of the Adjustment Statement, Contributor shall have thirty
(30) days to review the factual basis, mathematical calculations and
accounting methods used

 



18  therein. On or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day after receipt of the
Adjustment Statement, Contributor shall deliver written notice to Acquiror
specifying any disputed items (the " _Initial Reconciliation Disputes_ ") and
the basis therefor and amount thereof. If Contributor fails to notify Acquiror
of any Initial Reconciliation Disputes on or prior to the thirtieth (30th)
day after receipt of the Adjustment Statement, then all calculations and
valuations of the Closing Net Working Capital set forth on the Adjustment
Statement shall be deemed accepted by Contributor and shall be final,
binding, conclusive and non-appealable for all purposes of this Agreement.

(c) If Contributor notifies Acquiror of any Initial Reconciliation Disputes
in accordance with _Section 2.6(b_), then Acquiror and Contributor shall,
over the fifteen (15) days following the date of such notice (the "
_Resolution Period_ "), attempt in good faith to resolve the Initial
Reconciliation Disputes, and any written resolution by them as to any disputed
item shall be final, binding, conclusive and non-appealable for all purposes
of this Agreement. If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, Acquiror
and Contributor have not reached an agreement on all disputed items, then all
Initial Reconciliation Disputes then remaining in dispute (the " _Final
Reconciliation Disputes_ ") shall be submitted by Acquiror and Contributor to
an Independent Auditor upon which Acquiror and Contributor shall reasonably
agree prior to expiration of the Resolution Period. All fees and expenses
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by such Independent
Auditor pursuant to this _Section 2.6_ shall be borne by Contributor, on the
one hand, and by Acquiror, on the other hand, based upon the percentage that
the amount ultimately awarded or not awarded, as applicable, to such Party by
such Independent Auditor bears to the amount actually contested by such Party
in the Final Reconciliation Disputes. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, all other costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection
with resolving any Final Reconciliation Disputes hereunder before such
Independent Auditor shall be borne by the Party incurring such cost and
expense. With respect to each disputed line item of the Closing Net Working
Capital, such Independent Auditors final determination, if not in accordance
with the position of Contributor, on the one hand, or Acquiror, on the other
hand, will not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the
amounts advocated by Acquiror in its calculation of the Closing Net Working
Capital or the corresponding amounts claimed by Contributor in the initial
notice of any Initial Reconciliation Disputes delivered by Contributor
pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Independent Auditor shall not review any line item or make any determination
with respect to any matter other than the Final Reconciliation Disputes. The
Parties shall instruct the Independent Auditor to render its reasoned written
decision, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, as soon as
practicable but in no event later than sixty (60) days after its engagement
(which engagement shall be made no later than ten (10) Business Days after the
end of the Resolution Period). Such decision shall be determined in
accordance with GAAP applied using the accounting principles, practices and
methods that were used in the preparation of the Contributor Financial
Statements and consistent with the methodology set forth on _Schedule 2.5_
 shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to Acquiror and
Contributor and shall be final, binding, conclusive and non-appealable for all
purposes hereunder. Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, no Party
may assert that any award issued by the Independent Auditor is unenforceable
because it has not been timely rendered. The term " _Final Adjustment
Statement_ " shall mean the definitive Adjustment Statement setting forth the
final determination of the Closing Net Working Capital (the " _Final Closing
Net Working_ _Capital_ ") and resulting from (i) agreement by Acquiror and
Contributor during the Resolution Period or otherwise, (ii) a deemed
acceptance pursuant to  _Section 2.6(b)_ and/or (iii) the determination by
an Independent Auditor in accordance with this _Section 2.6(c)_.

 



19 (d) If the Final Closing Net Working Capital is more than the greater of the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital and $168,000,000.00, then Acquiror
shall pay to Contributor an amount equal to the amount by which the Final
Closing Net Working Capital exceeds the greater of the Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital and $168,000,000.00, and any such payment shall be made in
the manner set forth in _Section 2.6(f)_.

(e) For purposes of calculating Closing Net Working Capital and without
limiting the provisions of _Section 2.6(a)_ and the generality of _Section
7.3_, during the period of any dispute contemplated in this _Section 2.6_,
Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide Contributor with
reasonable access to the relevant books and records, facilities and employees,
and their accountants work papers, schedules and other supporting data, all
during normal business hours as may be reasonably requested by Contributor.

(f) Any payment required pursuant to _Section 2.6(d)_ shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, in United States dollars, to the
account or accounts designated by Acquiror or Contributor, as the case may be,
within five (5) Business Days after the Final Adjustment Statement is finally
determined by (i) agreement by Acquiror and Contributor during the Resolution
Period or otherwise, (ii) a deemed acceptance pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_ or
(iii) the determination by an Independent Auditor in accordance with _Section
2.6(c)_.

 

Section 2.7 _Non-Assignable Assets_. To the extent that the sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery, or attempted sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or delivery, to Acquiror of any SUN Retail Asset (i) would result
in a violation of applicable law, (ii) cannot be effected due to any defect in
the chain of title of such SUN Retail Asset (including the failure of
Contributor to have marketable title to any SUN Retail Asset), or (iii) would
require the consent, authorization, approval or waiver of a Person who is not
a party to this Agreement, and such consent, authorization, approval
or waiver shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, this Agreement
shall not constitute a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, or
an attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, thereof;
provided, however, that, nothing in this _Section 2.7_ shall modify or
effect the requirement of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the
obligations of the Acquiror Parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement set forth in  _Section 8.2_. Following the
Closing, Contributor and Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts,
and shall cooperate with each other, to obtain any such required consent,
authorization, approval or waiver. To the extent that any SUN Retail Asset
cannot be transferred to Acquiror at the Closing or any transfer is later
voided or diminished due to a cause of the type described in clauses (i), (ii)
or (iii) of the first sentence of this _Section 2.7_, Contributor and
Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into such
arrangements to provide to the parties the economic and operational equivalent
of the transfer of such SUN Retail Asset to Acquiror as of the Closing and
the performance by Contributor and Acquiror of their respective obligations
with respect thereto.

21  execution, delivery or performance by Contributor of this Agreement or the

performance by Contributor of this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents to
which Contributor is a party nor the consummation by Contributor of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will (a) conflict with or result

the acquisition of the Unit Consideration has not been registered under the
Securities Act in reliance on an exemption therefrom and (ii) that the Unit
Consideration will, upon the issuance by Acquiror, be characterized as
"restricted securities" under state and federal securities Laws. Contributor
agrees that the Unit Consideration may not be sold, transferred, offered for
sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of except pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act or pursuant to an
available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act,
and in compliance with other applicable state and federal securities Laws.

operations as it and its representatives and advisors have deemed necessary to
enable it to make an informed decision with respect to the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Contributor has received all materials relating to the business of the
Acquiror Group that it has requested and has been afforded the opportunity to
obtain any additional information necessary to verify the accuracy of any
such information or of any representation or warranty made by Acquiror herein

Acquiror has answered to Contributors satisfaction all inquiries that
Contributor and its representatives and advisors have made concerning the
business of the Acquiror Group or otherwise relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(c) In entering into this Agreement, Contributor has relied solely upon its
own investigation and analysis and the representations and warranties of the
Acquiror Parties expressly contained in _Article 6_ and the Acquiror
Certificate and Contributor acknowledges that, other than as set forth in this
Agreement (as modified by the Schedules) and the certificates or
other instruments delivered pursuant hereto, none of Acquiror, the members of
the Acquiror Group or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, stockholders, agents or representatives makes or has made any
representation or warranty, either express or implied, (x) as to the accuracy
or completeness of any of the information provided or made available to
Contributor or any of its respective agents, representatives, lenders or
Affiliates prior to the execution of this Agreement (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, as set forth in this Agreement) or (y) with respect to any
projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of future revenues,
expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any component
thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future financial
condition (or any component thereof) of any member of the Acquiror Group
heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available to Contributor or any
of its respective agents, representatives, lenders or Affiliates. It is
understood that any cost estimates, projections or other predictions, any
data, any financial information or any memoranda or offering materials or
presentations are not and shall not be deemed to be or to include
representations or warranties of any member of the Acquiror Group or Acquiror
(other than, for the avoidance of doubt, as set forth in this Agreement as
modified by the Schedules), and are not and shall not be deemed to be relied
upon by such Contributor in executing, delivering and performing this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



23 Section 3.8 _Management Projections and Budget_. The projections and budget
set forth on _Schedule 3.8_ provided to Acquiror by Contributor and Retail
Parent as part of Acquirors review in connection with this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents were prepared by management of Contributor or Retail
Parent in good faith based on assumptions that they believe to be reasonable
as of the date of this Agreement and are consistent with Contributors or
Retail Parents managements expectations as of the date of this Agreement.

Contributor and Retail Parent, jointly and severally, hereby represent and

(a) Each Subject Entity is or, in the case of SUN Retail, immediately
following the Pre-Closing Transactions and at the Closing, will be a legal

jurisdiction in which the property and assets owned, leased or operated by it,

licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

(c) Contributor has or, in the case of SUN Retail, at the Closing, will have
made available true and correct copies of the respective Governing Documents
of each Subject Entity. There is no pending, or to the knowledge of
Contributor, threatened action for the dissolution, liquidation or insolvency

immediately following the Pre-Closing Transactions and at the Closing,
including the number of equity interests that are or will be authorized and
which are or will be issued and outstanding. There are or, in the case of SUN

capital stock or other equity interests of each Subsidiary of such Subject
Entity set forth on _Schedule 4.2(b)_, free and clear of any preemptive
rights and any Liens other than Permitted Liens, and all of such shares of
capital stock or other equity interests have been duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid (to the extent required by the Governing Documents
of the applicable Person) and nonassessable (except in the case of any

25 Section 4.3 _Authority_. Each Subject Entity has or, in the case of SUN
Retail, immediately following the Pre-Closing Transactions and at the

(assuming that this Agreement has been and the Ancillary Documents to which
such Subject Entity is a party will be duly and validly authorized, executed

being collectively referred to as the " _Acquiror SEC Documents_ ").

material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder applicable to such Acquiror SEC Document and (ii) did
not at the time it was filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing or
amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, then at the time of such filing
or amendment) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were

presented thereby and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position and operating results, equity and cash flows of Acquiror
as of, and for the periods ended on, the respective dates thereof, subject,
however, in the case of unaudited financial statements, to normal year-end
audit adjustments and accruals and the absence of notes and other textual

any of their respective current or former officers or directors, in their
capacity as such, before any Governmental Entity, to the extent that such
Proceedings would exceed $500,000, individually, or $3,000,000 in the
aggregate. Except as set forth on _Schedule 6.7_ , no member of the Acquiror
Group, nor any of their respective properties, assets or business, or, to

directors, in their capacity as such, is subject to any outstanding Order.

 



40 Section 6.8 _Tax Matters_. Since the date of its formation, Acquiror has

liable.

 

Section 6.10 _Solvency_. Immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, no member of the Acquiror Group (excluding
the Subject Entities after the Closing) will (a) be insolvent (either because
its financial condition is such that the sum of its debts is greater than the
fair value of its assets or because the fair salable value of its assets is
less than the amount required to pay its probable liability on its existing
debts as they mature), (b) have unreasonably small capital with which to
engage in its business or (c) have incurred debts beyond its ability to
pay as they become due.

Section 6.11 _Investigation; No Other Representations_.

 

(a) Acquiror and PropCo each has such knowledge and experience in financial
and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks
of its investment in the Acquired Interests and is capable of bearing the
economic risk of such investment. Acquiror and PropCo are each an "accredited
investor" as that term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D (without
regard to Rule 501(a)(4)) promulgated under the Securities Act. PropCo is
acquiring the Acquired Interests for investment for its own account and not
with a view toward or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof, or
with any present intention of distributing or selling the Acquired Interests.
Neither Acquiror nor PropCo is a party to any Contract or arrangement with any
Person to sell, transfer or grant participations to such Person or to any
third Person, with respect to the Acquired Interests in violation of
applicable Law. Acquiror and PropCo acknowledge and understand that (i) the
acceptance of the Acquired Interests has not been registered under the
Securities Act in reliance on an exemption therefrom and (ii) that the
Acquired Interests will, upon their contribution by Contributor, be
characterized as "restricted securities" under state and federal securities
Laws. Acquiror and PropCo agree that the Acquired Interests may not be sold,
transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of
except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities
Act or pursuant to an available exemption from the registration requirements
of the Securities Act, and in compliance with other applicable state and
federal securities Laws.

(b) Acquiror, on its behalf and on behalf of PropCo, (i) has conducted its
own independent review and analysis of, and, based thereon, has formed an
independent judgment concerning, the business, assets, condition, operations
and prospects of the Subject Entities and 

 



41  the Contributor Group (with respect to the SUN Retail Assets), and (ii) has
been furnished with or given full access to such documents and information
about the Subject Entities and their respective businesses and operations,
and the SUN Retail Business, as it and its representatives and advisors have
deemed necessary to enable it to make an informed decision with respect to the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Acquiror, on its behalf and on behalf of PropCo, has
received all materials relating to the business of the Subject Entities and
the SUN Retail Business that it has requested and has been afforded
the opportunity to obtain any additional information necessary to verify the
accuracy of any such information or of any representation or warranty made by
the Subject Entities or Contributor herein or to otherwise evaluate the merits
of the transactions contemplated hereby. Contributor, Contributor Group and
the Subject Entities have answered to Acquirors satisfaction all inquiries
that Acquiror and its representatives and advisors have made on its behalf or
on behalf of PropCo concerning the business of the Subject Entities and the
SUN Retail Business or otherwise relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(c) In entering into this Agreement, Acquiror has relied solely upon its own
investigation and analysis and the representations and warranties of
Contributor, the Subject Entities, Retail Parent and the Contributor Group
expressly contained in _Article 3_ , _Article 4_ and _Article 5_ ,
respectively, and the Company Certificate and Acquiror acknowledges that,
other than as set forth in this Agreement (as modified by the Schedules) and
the certificates or other instruments delivered pursuant hereto, none of the
Subject Entities, the Contributor Group, Retail Parent, Contributor, or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, stockholders,
agents or representatives makes or has made any representation or warranty,
either express or implied, (x) as to the accuracy or completeness of any of
the information provided or made available to Acquiror or any of its
respective agents, representatives, lenders or Affiliates prior to the
execution of this Agreement (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, as set
forth in this Agreement) or (y) with respect to any projections, forecasts,
estimates, plans or budgets of future revenues, expenses or expenditures,
future results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows
(or any component thereof) or future financial condition (or any component
thereof) of the Subject Entities heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made
available to Acquiror or any of its respective agents, representatives,
lenders or Affiliates. It is understood that any cost estimates, projections
or other predictions, any data, any financial information or any memoranda or
offering materials or presentations are not and shall not be deemed to be
or to include representations or warranties of the Subject Entities, the
Contributor Group, Retail Parent or Contributor (other than, for the avoidance
of doubt, as set forth in this Agreement as modified by the Schedules), and
are not and shall not be deemed to be relied upon by Acquiror in executing,
delivering and performing this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

Tax Returns of the Retail Entities or with respect to the SUN Retail Assets,
and pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown as due thereon, with the
appropriate federal, state, local and foreign Taxing Authorities due on or
before the Closing Date. Contributor shall allow the Acquiror Parties to
review, comment upon and reasonably approve without undue delay any such Tax
Returns at least fifteen (15) days before the filing of such Tax Returns.
Contributor will cause such Tax Returns (as revised to incorporate the
Acquiror Parties reasonable comments) to be timely filed and will provide a
copy to the Acquiror Parties.

(b) Acquiror shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all
Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax Returns required to be filed by the Subject
Entities after the Closing Date, and Tax Returns required to be filed by the
Subject Entities relating to tax periods that commence before the Closing Date
and end after the Closing Date (" _Straddle Periods_ "). Such Tax Returns
shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice except to the
extent otherwise required by applicable Law. Acquiror shall allow Contributor
to review, comment upon and reasonably approve without undue delay any such
Tax Returns at least fifteen (15) days before the filing of such Tax Returns.
Not later than five (5) days prior to the due date for payment of Taxes with
respect to any such Tax Returns, Contributor will pay to (or at the direction
of) Acquiror the amount of any Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns that are
allocable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Acquiror will cause such Tax
Return (as revised to incorporate Contributors reasonable comments) to be
timely filed and will provide a copy to Contributor.

(c) Unless required by applicable Law, Acquiror shall not make any elections
or file (or cause or permit the Subject Entities to file) any amended Tax
Return by or on behalf of the Subject Entities with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period without Contributors consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

(d) Acquiror and Contributor shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the preparation,
filing and execution of Tax Returns (including Tax Returns of Contributor with
respect to the business activities of the Subject Entities) and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding (each a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") with respect to
Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Subject Entities or the assets of the
Subject Entities or the SUN Retail Assets for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
other Partys request) the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify
at any such Tax Proceeding. Contributor agrees to retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Subject Entities until six (6)
months following the expiration of the statute of limitations (and any
extensions thereof) of the respective Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Contributor
shall have the right to settle, compromise or litigate any matter described
above in this subsection (d) that could give rise to an indemnification
obligation on the part of Contributor pursuant to this Agreement. Acquiror and
Contributor further agree, upon request, to use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Taxing Authority
or any

 



46  other Person or take any other action as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on any Party (including with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

(e) The amount of all Pre-Closing Tax Refunds of the Subject Entities for all
Pre-Closing Tax Periods shall be the property of Contributor. The Subject
Entities will not, and Acquiror will not permit the Subject Entities to,
forfeit, fail to collect or otherwise minimize any Pre-Closing Tax Refund
whether through any election to carry forward a net operating loss or
otherwise (regardless of whether Acquiror or the Subject Entities otherwise is
legally permitted to take such action). Acquiror shall pay to Contributor any
Pre-Closing Tax Refund, together with any interest thereon, received after the
Closing Date within fifteen (15) days of such receipt. A Pre-Closing Tax
Refund shall be "received" for purposes of this Agreement (i) on the day of
receipt of any actual refund of Taxes or (ii) on the day of filing of any Tax
Return that applies what would have been a Pre-Closing Tax Refund to the
payment of Taxes for another taxable period.

 

(f) The Parties do not expect that the transfer of Acquired Interests pursuant
to this Agreement will result in any state and local transfer, sales, use,
registration, stamp or other similar Taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_ "). However, if
any Transfer Taxes are imposed on the transfer of the Acquired Interests

_however_ , that the representations and warranties contained in _Section
4.11_ ( _Tax Matters_ ) shall survive through the date that is 30 days after
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and the Contributor
Fundamental Representations and the Acquiror Fundamental Representations shall
survive the Closing indefinitely (each, as applicable, the " _Cut-Off Date_
"). All covenants and agreements of the Parties contained herein shall
survive the Closing indefinitely or for the period explicitly specified
therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claims asserted in good faith with
reasonable specificity (to the extent known at such time) and in writing by
notice from the non-breaching Party to the breaching Party prior to the Cut-
Off Date or end of any other applicable survival period shall not thereafter
be barred by the expiration of the relevant representation, warranty or
covenant, and such claims shall survive until finally resolved.

Section 10.2 _Indemnification By Contributor_. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this  _Article 10_ , from and after the Closing, Contributor
shall indemnify and defend Acquiror and its Affiliates (including the Subject
Entities) and their respective representatives, including directors, managers,
officers, employees, consultants, financial advisors, counsel and accountants
(collectively, the " _Acquiror Indemnitees_ ") against, and shall hold each of
them harmless from and against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for,

(a) any breach of any of the representations or warranties of Contributor,
the Subject Entities, the Contributor Group, Retail Parent or their respective
Affiliates contained in this Agreement, as of the date such representation or
warranty was made or as if such representation or warranty was made on and as
of the Closing Date;

be performed by Contributor, the Retail Entities, the Contributor Group,

is defined in each of the April 2015 RRA and the July 2015 RRA) under the
April 2015 RRA or the July 2015 RRA, where such Registration Default occurs as
a result of Contributors failure to provide the financial statements pursuant
to _Section 7.11_;

 



57 (f) any liability arising with respect to the assets or Subsidiaries of SUN

Section 10.3 _Indemnification By Acquiror_. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this _Article 10_ , from and after the Closing, Acquiror shall
indemnify and defend Contributor and its Affiliates and their respective
representatives, including directors, managers, officers, employees,
consultants, financial advisors, counsel and accountants (collectively, the "
_Contributor Indemnitees_ ") against, and shall hold each of them harmless
from and against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any and all
Losses actually incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the
Contributor Indemnitees:

(a) as a result of any breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Acquiror contained in this Agreement, as of the date such representation or
warranty was made or as if such representation or warranty was made on and as
of the Closing Date;

(b) as a result of any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement
or obligation to be performed by the Acquiror Parties, or which Acquiror was
obligated to cause SUN LLC to perform, pursuant to this Agreement; and

 

(c) pursuant to _Section 7.7_.

 

Section 10.4 _Certain Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the indemnification provided for in  _Section 10.2_ and
_Section 10.3_ shall be subject to the following limitations:

(a) Contributor shall not be liable to the Acquiror Indemnitees for
indemnification under _Section 10.2(a)_ (other than with respect to a claim
for indemnification as a result of any inaccuracy in or breach of _Section
3.1_ ( _Organization and Qualification_ ),  _Section 3.2_ ( _Authority_ ),

")), until the aggregate amount of all Losses indemnifiable under _Section
10.2(a)_ (other than those with respect to any Contributor Fundamental
Representation and other than those excluded pursuant to _Section 10.4(b)_)
exceeds an amount equal to the Deductible, in which event the Acquiror
Indemnitees shall only be entitled to recover Losses in excess of such
amount, subject to the other limitations set forth herein.

(b) Contributor shall not be liable to the Acquiror Indemnitees
for indemnification under _Section 10.2(a)_ (other than with respect to a
claim for indemnification with respect to or by reason of any Contributor
Fundamental Representation) for any particular Loss (including any series of
related Losses) indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ (other

 



58  than those with respect to any Contributor Fundamental Representation),
unless such Loss (including any series of related Losses) equals or exceeds
the Per Claim Deductible, and any Losses (or series of related Losses) that
are less than the Per Claim Deductible (other than those with respect to any
Contributor Fundamental Representation) shall not be included in the aggregate
Losses indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_, including for purposes
of the calculation in _Section 10.4(a)_.

(c) Acquiror shall not be liable to the Contributor Indemnitees for
indemnification under _Section 10.3(a)_ (other than with respect to a claim
for indemnification as a result of any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation and warranty in _Section 6.1_ ( _Organization
and Qualification_ ), _Section 6.2_ ( _Authority_ ), _Section 6.4_ ( _Valid
Issuance; Listing_ ) and _Section 6.9_ ( _Brokers_ ) (collectively, the "
_Acquiror Fundamental Representations_ ")) until the aggregate amount of all
Losses in respect of indemnification under _Section 10.3(a)_ (other than
those with respect to any Acquiror Fundamental Representation and other than
those excluded pursuant to _Section 10.4(d))_ exceeds an amount equal to the
Deductible, in which event the Contributor Indemnitees shall only be entitled
to recover Losses in excess of such amount, subject to the other limitations
set forth herein.

 

(d) Acquiror shall not be liable to the Contributor Indemnitees for
indemnification under _Section 10.3(a)_ (other than with respect to a claim
for indemnification with respect to or by reason of any Acquiror Fundamental
Representation) for any particular Loss (including any series of related
Losses) indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_ (other than those
with respect to any Acquiror Fundamental Representation), unless such Loss
(including any series of related Losses) equals or exceeds the Per Claim
Deductible, and any Losses (or series of related Losses) that are less than
the Per Claim Deductible (other than those with respect to any Acquiror
Fundamental Representation) shall not be included in the aggregate Losses
indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_, including for purposes of the
calculation in _Section 10.4(c)_. 

(e) The maximum aggregate liability of Contributor (other than with respect to
a claim for indemnification with respect to a breach of a Contributor
Fundamental Representation) with respect to Losses indemnifiable pursuant to
_Section 10.2(a)_ shall be the Cap; _provided_ , that the maximum aggregate
liability of Contributor pursuant to this _Article 10_ shall not exceed the
Aggregate Cap.

(f) The maximum aggregate liability of Acquiror (other than with respect to a
claim for indemnification with respect to a breach of an Acquiror Fundamental
Representation) with respect to Losses indemnifiable pursuant to _Section
10.3(a)_ shall be the Cap; _provided_ , that the maximum liability of Acquiror
pursuant to this _Article 10_  shall not exceed the Aggregate Cap.

(g) An Indemnifying Party (as defined below) shall be obligated to pay for the
same Loss only once under this _Article 10_ even if a claim for
indemnification in respect of such Loss has been made as a result of a breach
of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement.

 



59 (h) For purposes of this _Article 10_ , any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty, and any damages resulting therefrom, shall be
determined without regard to any materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect
or Acquiror Material Adverse Effect or other similar qualification contained
in or otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty.

(i) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 10.4(i)_ the amount of any and
all Losses shall be determined net of (i) any amounts in payment for Losses
actually received by any of the Acquiror Indemnitees or Contributor
Indemnitees, as applicable, (net of any related costs and expenses incurred in
connection therewith, including the direct costs of premiums relating to any
such insurance proceeds) under or pursuant to (x) any insurance coverage or
storage tank fund and all arrangements set forth on _Schedule 4.10_ and (y)
any other indemnity or reimbursement arrangement or Contract, or from other
collateral sources (collectively, " _Alternative Arrangements_ "), and (ii)
any Tax benefits arising from the incurrence or payment of the underlying
obligations relating to such Losses actually realized for the year of such
incurrence or payment. The Acquiror Indemnitees shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect all amounts available and recoverable under any
Alternative Arrangements and Contributor shall provide reasonable cooperation
to the Acquiror Indemnitees undertaking such efforts, including by providing
reasonable access to any documents, reports, data or other information in the
possession of Contributor required by the Acquiror Indemnitees or
any Alternative Arrangements; _provided_ , _however_ , that, (A) in no event
shall the expenditure of such efforts require the Acquiror Indemnitees to
expend any such efforts prior to submitting a claim for indemnification under
this Agreement, (B) nothing provided herein shall require any Acquiror
Indemnitee to avail itself of any available policies of self-insurance other
than any Alternative Arrangements, and (C) if Acquiror seeks indemnification
from Contributor, Acquiror shall provide Contributor with documents and
information directly related to such efforts and recovery, as reasonably
requested by Contributor. For the avoidance of doubt, Contributor shall not be
liable for any Losses related to any breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 4.10_ ( _Environmental Matters_ ) unless and
until the Acquiror Indemnitees have exhausted their remedies under all
Alternative Arrangements reasonably available to such Acquiror Indemnitees,
and thereafter, Contributor shall only be responsible for the portion of any
Losses that is not satisfied or covered by any reasonably available
Alternative Arrangements (net of any related costs and expenses incurred
in connection therewith, including the direct costs of premiums relating to
any insurance proceeds) after satisfaction or payment of any deductible or
retention thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in no event, shall the
exhaustion of such remedies require the Acquiror Indemnitees to exhaust any
such remedies prior to submitting a claim for indemnification under this
Agreement. For purposes hereof, Acquiror shall have satisfied the "exhaustion
of remedies" of Alternative Arrangements as long as Acquiror has commenced a
Proceeding in pursuit of the Alternative Arrangements and Acquiror prosecutes
such Proceeding in good faith in an attempt to avail itself of the Alternative
Arrangements; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that "exhaustion of remedies" shall
not require Acquiror to pursue or appeal any decision issued in connection
with any Proceeding.

 

(j) In any case where a Acquiror Indemnitee, directly or indirectly through a
Subject Entity, recovers, under any Alternative Arrangements, any amount in
respect of a matter for which such Acquiror Indemnitee was, prior to such
recovery, indemnified pursuant to _Section 10.2_, such Acquiror Indemnitee,
or, if applicable, a Subject Entity, shall promptly pay over to 

 



60  Contributor any amount so recovered from Contributor (after deducting
therefrom the amount of the expenses incurred by such Acquiror Indemnitee in
procuring such recovery), but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount
previously so paid by Contributor to or on behalf of such Acquiror Indemnitee
in respect of such matter and (ii) any amount actually expended by Contributor
in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter that is
indemnifiable as a Loss hereunder.

(k) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent any
Acquiror Indemnitee has a claim under _Section 10.2_ for Losses suffered by
SUN LLC, such Acquiror Indemnitee shall not be entitled to recover any amounts
in excess of the Equity Percentage of such Losses.

 

(l) (i) The Acquiror Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 10.2_ for any Loss to the extent that such Loss is
reflected as a liability on the Latest Contributor Balance Sheet or reflected
in the Contributor Financial Statements and (ii) the Contributor Indemnitees
shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to  _Section 10.3_ for any
Loss to the extent that such Loss is reflected as a liability on the Latest
Acquiror Balance Sheet or reflected in the financial statements of Acquiror
included in the Acquiror SEC Documents, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii),
only to the extent that amounts associated with such Loss are included
therein.

(m) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Contributor shall not be
obligated to indemnify the Acquiror Indemnitees for any Loss with respect to
any environmental matter or condition, including for any inaccuracy or breach
of the representations and warranties in  _Section 4.10_ ( _Environmental
Matters_ ), that is discovered or detected by any sampling, investigation,
analysis or reporting unless: (i) such sampling, investigating, analysis or
reporting is affirmatively required by Environmental Laws or by a
Governmental Entity; (ii) such sampling, investigation, analysis or reporting
is necessary to conduct in defense of a Third Party Claim (as defined below)
against Acquiror Indemnitees alleging that Hazardous Substances have migrated
off of any Company Owned Real Property or Company Leased Real Property; or
(iii) such sampling, investigation, analysis or reporting is conducted in
connection with the bona fide construction or expansion of improvements by
any Acquiror Indemnitee at any Company Real Property undertaken in the
ordinary course of business, and in such case only to the extent such
sampling, investigation, analysis or reporting is consistent with industry
practice. Any indemnification of any of the Acquiror Indemnitees with respect
to any remediation, removal or cleanup, including any investigation,
monitoring, or remedial obligations, shall be limited to such cost effective
action that is required by Environmental Laws or by a Governmental Entity to
attain compliance with minimum applicable remedial standards for continued use
of the relevant property or facility as a gasoline fueling and service station
and/or convenience store with gasoline fueling operations, employing, if
appropriate, available or acceptable, permissible risk-based remedial
standards and reasonable deed or use restrictions and institutional controls.

 

Section 10.5 _Indemnification Procedures_. The party making a claim under this
_Article 10_ is referred to as the " _Indemnified Party_ ", and the party
against whom such claim is asserted under this _Article 10_ is referred to as
the " _Indemnifying Party_ ".

 



61 (a) _Third Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Proceeding made or brought by any Person who
is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement
or a representative of the foregoing (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated
to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in
any event not later than thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of such
notice of such Third Party Claim. The failure to give such prompt written
notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. Such notice
by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable
detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and
shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss
that has been or may reasonably be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving
written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the conduct and control of
the settlement or defense of any Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys
expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own counsel, and the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate in good faith in such defense; _provided_ , that if the
Indemnifying Party is Contributor, such Indemnifying Party shall not have the
right to defend or direct the defense of any such Third Party Claim that seeks
an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party. In the
event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party
Claim, subject to _Section 10.5(b)_, it shall have the right to take such
action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make
counterclaims pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in the name and on
behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by
it subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to control the settlement and
defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the
expense of the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that if in the reasonable
opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses
available to an Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to
those available to the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot
be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and
expenses of one counsel to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party
elects not to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party may, subject to _Section 10.5(b)_, pay, compromise or defend such Third
Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon,
arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim. Contributor and Acquiror
shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with
the defense of any Third Party Claim, including making available records
relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other
than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party,
such management employees of the non-defending party, information and
testimony, and attending such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials and appeals as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the
defense of such Third Party Claim.

(b) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of
any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, except to the extent such settlement does not provide for liability or
the creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified
Party and provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each

 



62  Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with
such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense
pursuant to _Section 10.5(a)_, it shall not agree to any settlement without
the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), and no such settlement shall be
determinative of the Indemnifying Partys obligations under this _Article
10_.

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall
be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than thirty (30)
calendar days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of the matter or
circumstance alleged to give rise to such Direct Claim. The failure to give
such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party
of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. Such notice
by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail,
shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the estimated amount of the Loss that has been or may be reasonably
sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate the matter
or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to
what extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim, and the
Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Partys investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including access to the premises and
personnel of any Subject Entity and the right to examine and copy any
accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its
professional advisors may reasonably request.

 

Section 10.6 _Subrogation_. In the event of payment by or on behalf of any
Indemnifying Party to any Indemnified Party (including pursuant to this
_Article 10_ ) in connection with any Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying
Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnified
Party as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnified
Party may have any right, defense or claim relating to such claim or demand
against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such claim or demand. Such
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable
manner, and at the cost of such Indemnifying Party, in presenting any
subrogated right, defense or claim.

Section 10.7 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an
adjustment to the Consideration for Tax purposes, and to the extent possible,
first as an adjustment to the Cash Consideration, unless otherwise required
by Law.

Section 10.8 _Exclusive Remedies_. Except with respect to  _Section 9.2_,
the Parties acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing, their sole
and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims (other than claims for
fraud on the part of a party in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, which such claims shall not be subject to any monetary or
survival limitations set forth herein, and other than claims to enforce, or
for breach of, Guaranteed Obligations pursuant to _Section 11.19_) for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set
forth herein or otherwise relating to or in any way arising from the subject
matter of this Agreement, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions
set forth in this _Article 10_ , and the Parties hereby waive any other
statutory and

 



63  common law remedies or claims. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that each Acquiror Indemnitees
right to indemnification under this  _Article 10_ for any environmental
matter, including for any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and
warranties contained in _Section 4.10_ ( _Environmental Matters_ ), shall
constitute such Acquiror Indemnitees sole and exclusive remedy against
Contributor with respect to any environmental matter, including any such
matter arising under any Environmental Laws. The Acquiror Indemnitees hereby,
except as specifically reserved under this _Article 10_ , (a) waive any
remedies or claims that may be available under Environmental Laws relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement, and (b) release Contributor from any
claim, demand or liability with respect to any environmental matters relating
to the subject matter of this Agreement, including any such claims arising
under Environmental Laws.

transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 11.13 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or
implied in this Agreement, each of the Acquiror Parties agrees and
acknowledges that no recourse under this Agreement or any documents or
instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement shall be had against
any current or future director, officer, employee or member of Contributor or

respect of this Agreement or any of the transactions related hereto, in each
case, whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether in contract,
tort, equity, or otherwise, including any claim, demand, action or cause of
action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to the Financing

of the consent of the Parties to the waiver of their right to trial by jury.

 

Section 11.15 _Jurisdiction and Venue_. Each of the Parties (i) submits to the
exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery for the State of
Delaware (the " _Chancery Court_ ") and any state appellate court therefrom
located within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Chancery Court declines
to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware) in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, (ii) agrees that all claims in respect of such Proceeding may
be heard and determined in any such court and (iii) agrees not to bring any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court.
Each of the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any Proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other
security that might be required of any other Party with respect thereto. Each
Party agrees that service of summons and complaint or any other process that
might be served in any Proceeding may be made on such Party by sending or
delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served at the address of
the Party and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section
11.2_. Nothing in this _Section 11.15_, _however_ , shall affect the right of
any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law. Each
Party agrees that a final, non-appealable judgment in any Proceeding so
brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in
any other manner provided by Law. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, WITHOUT
LIMITING THE PROVISIONS OF _SECTION 7.10(F)_, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO (A)
AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT BRING OR SUPPORT ANY ACTION, CAUSE OF ACTION, CLAIM,
CROSS-CLAIM OR THIRD-PARTY CLAIM OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION, WHETHER IN LAW
OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, AGAINST THE
FINANCING PROVIDERS OR THE OTHER FINANCING RELATED PARTIES IN ANY WAY RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, IN ANY FORUM OTHER THAN EXCLUSIVELY IN THE
SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, COUNTY OF NEW YORK, OR, IF
UNDER APPLICABLE LAW EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IS VESTED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS,
THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR

 



68  THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK (AND APPELLATE COURTS THEREOF), (B)
SUBMITS FOR ITSELF AND ITS PROPERTY WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH ACTION TO THE
EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS, (C) AGREES THAT SERVICE OF PROCESS,
SUMMONS, NOTICE OR DOCUMENT BY REGISTERED MAIL ADDRESSED TO IT AT ITS ADDRESS
PROVIDED IN _SECTION 11.2_ SHALL BE EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF PROCESS AGAINST IT
FOR ANY SUCH ACTION BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT, (D) IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER
HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF, AND THE DEFENSE OF AN INCONVENIENT FORUM TO
THE MAINTENANCE OF, ANY SUCH ACTION IN ANY SUCH COURT AND (E) AGREES THAT A
FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH ACTION SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN
OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY
LAW.

 

Section 11.16 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any
and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree and acknowledge
that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do
not perform their respective obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in
accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It
is accordingly agreed that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.1_, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or
undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law
or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at Law or equity.

Section 11.17 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time
periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

Section 11.18 _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, as and when
requested by any Party and at such Partys expense, any other Party shall
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents
and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or
other actions as such other Party may reasonably deem necessary to evidence
and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 11.19 _Contributor Guarantor_.

 

(a) Contributor Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees to the Acquiror Parties the due, full and punctual payment and
performance of all covenants, obligations, liabilities and agreements of
Contributor and Retail Parent hereunder (the

 



69  " _Guaranteed_ _Obligations_ "), subject to the terms and conditions
hereunder. If, for any reason whatsoever, Contributor or Retail Parent shall
fail or be unable to duly, punctually and fully pay or perform the Guaranteed
Obligations, Contributor Guarantor will forthwith pay and cause to be paid in
lawful currency of the United States, or perform or cause to be performed, the
Guaranteed Obligations. The foregoing obligation of Contributor Guarantor
constitutes a continuing guarantee of payment and performance, and is and
shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances, including
circumstances which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge
of a guarantor and including any amendment, extension, modification or waiver
of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any insolvency, bankruptcy,
liquidation or dissolution of Contributor or Retail Parent or any
assignment thereby. Contributor Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives (to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law) notice of acceptance of this
guaranty and notice of any liability to which it may apply, and waives
promptness, diligence, presentment, demand or payment, protest, notice of
dishonor or nonpayment, suit, filing objections with a court, any right to
require proceeding first against Contributor or Retail Parent (including
initiating a Proceeding against Contributor), any right to require the prior
disposition of the assets of Contributor or Retail Parent to meet any of its
obligations hereunder or the taking of any other action by the Acquiror Group
and all demands whatsoever. The guaranty set forth in this  _Section
11.19(a)_ will remain in full force and effect, and will be binding upon
Contributor Guarantor, until all of the Guaranteed Obligations have been
satisfied.

 

(b) Contributor Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to the Acquiror
Parties that:

 

(i) Contributor Guarantor is a limited partnership duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
organization;

(ii) Contributor Guarantor has all requisite limited partnership power and
authority and has taken all limited partnership action necessary in order to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement;

(iii) No material notices to, filings with, or authorizations, consents or
approvals of any Governmental Entity are necessary for the execution, delivery
or performance of this Agreement. Neither the execution, delivery and
performance by Contributor Guarantor of this Agreement nor the consummation
by Contributor Guarantor of the transactions contemplated thereby will (A)
conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of Contributor
Guarantors Governing Documents, (B) result in a violation or breach of, or
cause acceleration, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time
or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration) under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
any material Contract to which Contributor Guarantor is a party, other than
violations, breaches, accelerations or defaults which would not, or would not
be reasonably likely to, have a material effect on Contributors ability to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement or (C)
violate any material Law or Order of any Governmental Entity applicable to
Contributor Guarantor or any of its properties or assets; and

 

(iv) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Contributor
Guarantor and is a valid and binding agreement of Contributor Guarantor,

 



70  enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting
generally the enforcement of creditors rights and subject to general
principles of equity.

to be duly executed on its behalf as of the day and year first above written.
