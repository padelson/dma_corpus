all Seller Mortgage Loan documents is at the Seller Mortgage Vendor&#146;s risk and the Seller Mortgage Vendor&#146;s responsibility, and each Seller Mortgage Vendor has agreed to indemnify Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and hold
it harmless from all bona fide and reasonable loss, cost or expense (including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees) arising out of or incurred in connection therewith, except only for such loss, cost or expense, if any, that results solely from the

shall, and shall cause its financial advisors and outside legal counsel to, negotiate with Acquiror in good faith during the Notice Period (to the extent Acquiror desires to negotiate) to enable Acquiror to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement that obviate the need of Seller&#146;s board of directors to make a Change in the Seller Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section&nbsp;7.1(e), including in the case of a Superior Proposal, by proposing such terms so
as to make such Superior Proposal no longer a Superior Proposal. Promptly following the end of the Notice Period, Seller&#146;s board of directors shall have considered in good faith any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Acquiror
and any other information provided by Acquiror and shall have determined (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) whether or not, if such changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Acquiror were to be given
effect, the failure to make a Change in the Seller Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section&nbsp;7.1(e) would be inconsistent with the directors&#146; fiduciary duties under applicable Law and whether or not such Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. If during the Notice Period there are any material modifications to the financial terms (including any modifications to the form, amount or timing of payment of consideration) or any other
material terms of any Superior Proposal, Seller shall, in each case, have delivered to Acquiror an additional notice consistent with that described in Section&nbsp;5.3(a) and a new Notice Period under this paragraph shall commence, during which time
Seller shall be required to comply with the requirements of this Section&nbsp;5.3(b) anew with respect to such additional notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent a notice required under this Section&nbsp;5.3(b) (in connection with a
termination pursuant to Section&nbsp;7.1(e)) relates to a Superior Proposal for which the requisite notice or additional notice has been given pursuant to this Section&nbsp;5.3(b) (in connection with a Change in the Seller Recommendation), no new or
additional notice or Notice Period will be required for such termination pursuant to Section&nbsp;7.1(e). During the Notice Period, Seller and Seller Sub shall not terminate this Agreement unless Seller receives written notice from Acquiror that it
does not intend to enter into negotiations with Seller during the Notice Period to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement to match or better a Superior Proposal. If Acquiror does not notify Seller of its election by the seventh day after
Acquiror&#146;s receipt of the Notice, Seller may terminate this Agreement and proceed with the Superior Proposal as provided in this Agreement. </P>

Approval, effect a Change in the Seller Recommendation (and in the event that the board of directors of Seller determines such Acquisition Proposal to be a Superior Proposal, in accordance with this Section&nbsp;5.3, terminate this Agreement in

Seller determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors&#146; fiduciary duties under applicable Law. </P>

taken by the Heritage Official as such a director, including in exercising rights under the Plan of Merger, and no such actions or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement or (ii)&nbsp;will be construed to prohibit, limit or restrict the

Official&#146;s ability to engage in certain businesses during the period provided for above in the Restricted Area, but acknowledges that the Heritage Official will receive sufficient remuneration and other benefits under the Plan of Merger to
justify such restriction. Further, the Heritage Official acknowledges that his skills are such that he can be gainfully employed in non-competitive employment, and that the agreement not to compete will in no way prevent him from earning a living.

modified by the court making such determination so as to be reasonable and enforceable and, as so modified, to be fully enforced. By agreeing to this contractual modification prospectively at this time, the parties intend to make this provision
enforceable under the laws of Mississippi in the Restricted Area so that the entire agreement not to compete and this Agreement as prospectively modified shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be rendered void or illegal. </P>

injunctive relief as remedies for such breach or any threatened breach, without any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond or giving any other undertaking (except to the extent required by law). Such remedies shall not be deemed the
exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all remedies available at law or in equity to Acquiror, including, without limitation, the recovery of damages from the Heritage Official and his or her agents involved
in such breach. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">3.2 The Heritage Official acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement is executed in connection with the sale of all of

tax imposed by any comparable provision of state law, and any applicable federal, state and local income taxes), exceeds the total after-tax amount of such aggregate payments and benefits after application of the foregoing reduction. The
determination of whether any reduction in such payments or benefits to be provided hereunder is required pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be made at the expense of the Bank, if requested by the Executive or the Bank, by the Bank&#146;s
independent accountants or another independent accountant agreed upon by the Executive and the Bank. In the event that any payment or benefit intended to be provided hereunder is required to be reduced pursuant to this Section, then the reduction
shall occur in the following order: (i)&nbsp;reduction of continued benefits (or payments in lieu of benefits) described in Sections 7(c) and 7(d); (ii)&nbsp;reduction of bonus payments described in Sections 7(c) and 7(d); and (iii)&nbsp;reduction
of continued salary payments described in Sections 7(c) and 7(d). Within any category of payments and benefits (that is, (i), (ii)&nbsp;or (iii)), a reduction shall occur first with respect to amounts that do not qualify as a &#147;deferral of
compensation&#148; within the meaning of and subject to Section&nbsp;409A (&#147;Nonqualified Deferred Compensation&#148;) and then with respect to amounts that do qualify as Nonqualified Deferred Compensation with such reduction being applied in
each case to the payments in the reverse order in which they would otherwise be made, that is, later payments shall be reduced before earlier payments.&#148; </P>
