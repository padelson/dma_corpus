2  Law) and (ii) the Seller Designee has resigned as a director of the

with the Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(b) Prior to the effective time of the Subsidiary Merger, the parties shall

Subsidiary Merger, and subject to and in accordance with the Articles of
Incorporation and the Bylaws of Acquiror Sub, the number of directors of the
Subsidiary Surviving Bank shall be increased by one director and shall consist
of the directors of Acquiror Sub in office immediately prior to the effective
time of the Subsidiary Merger as well as one current director of Seller Sub

Designee"), until the next annual meeting of the Subsidiary Surviving Banks
sole stockholder and until their respective successors are duly elected,
appointed or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the
Subsidiary Surviving Bank. The Subsidiary Surviving Banks board of directors
shall consider in good faith the nomination for reelection of the Seller Sub
Designee at each subsequent annual meeting of the Subsidiary Surviving Banks
sole stockholder through the 2016 annual meeting. Additionally, after the 2016
annual meeting of the Subsidiary Surviving Banks sole stockholder, if both
(i) O. Leonard Dorminey has retired as an employee of the Surviving
Subsidiary Bank (provided that at the relevant time he is eligible to serve as
a director of the Surviving Subsidiary Bank under the Articles of
Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Surviving Subsidiary Bank and applicable
Law) and (ii) the Seller Sub Designee has resigned as a director of the
Surviving Subsidiary Bank, the board of directors of the Surviving Subsidiary
Bank shall consider in good faith the appointment of O. Leonard Dorminey to
fill the vacancy created by the Seller Sub Designee ceasing to serve as a
director and the nomination of O. Leonard Dorminey for election as a director
at the annual meeting of the Surviving Subsidiary Banks sole stockholder next
following O. Leonard Dormineys appointment as a director. The officers of
Acquiror Sub shall, from and after the effective time of the Subsidiary
Merger, continue as the officers of the Subsidiary Surviving Bank until their
successors shall have been duly elected, appointed or qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Articles of
Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Subsidiary Surviving Bank.

 

1.5 _Effect of the Mergers_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the separate existence of Seller shall cease, and
all right, title and interest in and to all real estate and other property
owned by, and every contract right possessed by, Seller shall be vested in
Acquiror, as the surviving corporation, without reversion or impairment,
without further act or deed and without any transfer or assignment having
occurred (but subject to any existing liens or other encumbrances thereon),
and all liabilities of Seller shall be vested in Acquiror, as the surviving
corporation, as primary obligor therefor and, except as set forth herein, no
other person shall be liable therefor, and all proceedings pending by or
against Seller shall be continued by or against Acquiror, as the surviving
corporation, and all liabilities, obligations, assets or rights associated
with such proceedings shall be vested in Acquiror, as the surviving
corporation.

(b) At the effective time of the Subsidiary Merger, the separate existence of
Seller Sub shall cease, and all right, title and interest in and to all real
estate and other property owned by, and every contract right possessed by,
Seller Sub shall be vested in Acquiror Sub, as the surviving corporation,
without reversion or impairment, without further act or deed and without any
transfer or assignment having occurred (but subject to any existing liens or
other encumbrances thereon), and all liabilities of Seller Sub shall be vested
in Acquiror Sub, as the surviving corporation, as primary obligors therefor
and, except as set forth herein, no other person shall be liable therefor, and
all proceedings pending by or against Seller Sub shall be continued by or

3 (c) The parties acknowledge and agree that it is intended that the Mergers
constitute reorganizations within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
(as hereinafter defined), and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted
as the "plans of reorganization" as that term is used in Sections 354 and 361
of the Code. From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Closing,
each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Mergers
to qualify as reorganizations under Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGERS ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT

ENTITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

2.1 _Conversion of Shares_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Parent Merger and
without any action on the part of Acquiror, Seller or the holder of any of
the following securities:



     | (i) | Each share of Acquiror Common Stock (as defined below)
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
issued and outstanding after the Effective Time and shall be unaffected by the
Parent Merger. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Subject to the other provisions of this Article II, each
share of Sellers common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Seller Common
Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any shares of Seller Common Stock to be canceled in accordance
with Section 2.1(a)(v)) shall, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section
2.1(a)(iv), be converted automatically into and thereafter represent
the right to receive the number of shares (or a fraction thereof) of Acquiror
Common Stock, rounded to the nearest four decimals, equal to the Exchange
Ratio (the "Merger Consideration"). As used in this Agreement, the
term "Acquiror Common Stock" means the common stock, $5.00 par value per
share, of Acquiror; the term "Exchange Ratio" means 0.9266. 
---|---|--- 



      | (iii) | Certificates previously evidencing shares of Seller
Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates evidencing the Merger
Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, no fractional shares of
Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued, and, in lieu thereof, a cash payment
shall be made pursuant to Section 2.1(b). 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding
shares of capital stock of Acquiror or Seller, respectively, shall occur (or
for which the relevant record date will occur) as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or other subdivision, combination or readjustment of shares, or as a
result of any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during
such period, the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably and proportionately
adjusted, if necessary and without duplication, to reflect such change. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (v) | Each share of Seller Common Stock held in the treasury of
Seller and each share of Seller Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to
the Effective Time that is owned by Acquiror or any subsidiary of Acquiror or
Seller (other than shares held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual
funds and the like or otherwise in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a
result of debts previously contracted) shall automatically be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof and no Merger Consideration or
other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 
---|---|--- 

(b) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Acquiror
Common Stock will be issued as a result of the Parent Merger. In lieu of the
issuance of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(a), cash adjustments
(without interest) will be paid to each holder of Seller Common Stock in
respect of any fraction of a share of Acquiror Common Stock that would
otherwise be issuable to such holder of Seller Common Stock, and the amount of
such cash adjustment shall be determined by multiplying (x) the fraction of a
share of Acquiror

 



4  Common Stock otherwise issuable by (y) the weighted average of the closing
sale prices of one share of Acquiror Common Stock as reported by the Nasdaq
Global Select Market, for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the
trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date. No such holder shall be
entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other right of stockholders in
respect of any fractional share.

 

2.2 _Exchange of Seller Stock Certificates_.

 

(a) Acquiror has appointed Registrar and Transfer Company to serve as exchange
agent in connection with the Parent Merger for the purpose of exchanging
shares of Seller Common Stock for the Merger Consideration (the "Exchange
Agent"). At or immediately following the Effective Time, Acquiror shall
deposit in trust with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of
Sellers stockholders the aggregate number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock
equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration (such shares of Acquiror Common
Stock, together with cash sufficient to make payments required with respect to
fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.1(b)
and pay any dividends or distributions with respect to such Acquiror Common
Stock in accordance with Section 2.3, the "Exchange Fund"). Acquiror shall
deposit such shares of Acquiror Common Stock with the Exchange Agent by
delivering to the Exchange Agent certificates representing, or providing to
the Exchange Agent an uncertificated book-entry for, such shares and
immediately available funds for such cash in accordance with Section 2.1(b)
and Section 2.3.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall mail to the former record holders of the shares of
Seller Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a): (i) a letter of transmittal (which
letter shall specify that the delivery of the Merger Consideration shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
a certificate or certificates formerly representing shares of Seller Common
Stock to the Exchange Agent (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such
certificate(s)) and shall otherwise be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Acquiror and the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender to the Exchange Agent of certificate(s) of
Seller Common Stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration. After the
Effective Time, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent by the holder thereof of
the certificate(s) representing shares of Seller Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, together with a letter of
transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto and any other documents reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the
Exchange Agent on behalf of Acquiror shall deliver the Merger Consideration
(in the form of an uncertificated share of Acquiror Common Stock, unless such
holder specifically requests certificated shares) to each such holder in
exchange for each such share plus a check in the amount (if any) equal to any
cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(b)
and, if applicable, Section 2.3, without interest. Holders of record of shares
of Seller Common Stock who hold such shares as nominees, trustees or in other
representative capacities (a "Representative") may submit multiple letters of
transmittal, provided that such Representative certifies that each such letter
of transmittal covers all the shares of Seller Common Stock held by such
Representative for a particular beneficial owner. Each certificate for Seller
Common Stock so surrendered and all transmittal materials shall be duly
completed and endorsed as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require. The
Exchange Agent shall not be obligated to deliver the Merger Consideration to
which any former holder of Seller Common Stock is entitled as a result of the
Parent Merger until such holder surrenders his, her or its certificate or
certificates representing shares of Seller Common Stock (or affidavits
of loss in lieu of such certificate(s)) for exchange as provided in this
Section 2.2. After the Effective Time, each certificate that represented
outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock prior to the Effective Time shall be
deemed for all corporate purposes (other than the payment of dividends and
other distributions to which the former stockholders of Seller Common Stock
may be entitled) to evidence only the right of the holder thereof to receive
the Merger Consideration in exchange for each such share as provided in this
Article II. Acquiror shall instruct the Exchange Agent to promptly pay the
Merger Consideration following the receipt of each letter of transmittal.

 

(c) Any portion of the Exchange Fund held by the Exchange Agent that remains
undistributed to the former stockholders of Seller for six months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Acquiror upon demand, and

 



5  any former stockholders of Seller who have not theretofore complied with
this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to Acquiror for payment of their
claims for Acquiror Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Acquiror Common Stock or any dividends or distributions with respect to
Acquiror Common Stock (all without any interest thereon). Any Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed as of a date which is immediately prior to
the time when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Acquiror free and clear of any claims or interest of
any person or entity entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Acquiror, Seller, any subsidiary of Acquiror or Seller or the Exchange Agent
or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Seller Common
Stock for shares of Acquiror Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with
respect thereto) or cash in lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock
delivered in good faith to public officials pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the holders of certificates of Seller
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to shares of Seller
Common Stock represented thereby except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by applicable Law. All rights to receive the Merger Consideration
issued upon conversion of the shares of Seller Common Stock pursuant to
this Article II shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such shares of Seller Common Stock.

(e) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be issued to a person
other than the person in whose name the shares of Seller Common Stock (each a
"Seller Stock Certificate") so surrendered is registered, it shall be a
condition to such issuance that such Seller Stock Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the person
requesting such issuance shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
similar Taxes (as defined in Section 3.7(c)) required as a result of such
issuance to a person other than the registered holder of such Seller Stock
Certificate, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable. Acquiror or the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, without duplication, from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Seller Common Stock such amounts as Acquiror or the Exchange Agent is
required to deduct and withhold under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), or any provision of Tax Law (as hereinafter defined),
with respect to the making of such payment and shall further be entitled to
sell Acquiror Common Stock otherwise issuable pursuant to this Agreement to
satisfy any such withholding requirement (which Acquiror Common Stock will be
valued with respect to such withholding at the average of the high and low
trading prices thereof on the day of such sale). To the extent the amounts
are so withheld by Acquiror or the Exchange Agent and paid over to the
applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of
Seller Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made
by Acquiror or the Exchange Agent.

 

(f) In the event any Seller Stock Certificate(s) shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Seller Stock Certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Acquiror or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a
bond in such amount as either of them may reasonably direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Seller Stock Certificate(s), the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Seller Stock
Certificate(s) the Merger Consideration (together with a check in the amount
(if any) of any dividends or distributions payable in accordance with Section
2.3).

(g) The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash balances in the Exchange Fund in
a demand deposit account or as directed by Acquiror. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Acquiror upon
termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 2.2(c).

2.3 _Rights as Stockholders_. All shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued
as Merger Consideration shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time. Former stockholders of Seller and any other persons who or
which are entitled to receive Acquiror Common Stock as a result of the Parent
Merger will be able to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of
Acquiror stockholders or pursuant to any written consent

 



6  procedure the number of whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which
their shares of Seller Common Stock are converted, regardless of whether they
have exchanged their Seller Stock Certificates. In addition, whenever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by Acquiror on the Acquiror Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time, the declaration shall
include dividends or other distributions on all shares of Acquiror Common
Stock issuable hereunder, but no stockholder will be entitled to receive his,
her or its distribution of such dividends until physical exchange of such
stockholders Seller Stock Certificates shall have been effected.
Upon exchange of a stockholders Seller Stock Certificates, any such person
shall be entitled to receive from Acquiror an amount equal to all dividends or
other distributions (without interest thereon less the amount of any taxes, if
any, that have been withheld by, imposed on or paid by Acquiror or the
Exchange Agent with respect to such dividends) declared, and for which the
payment has occurred, on the shares represented thereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that former stockholders of Seller shall not be entitled to
receive any dividend on their Acquiror Common Stock with respect to any period
for which Acquiror paid a dividend prior to the Effective Time.

 

2.4 _Stock Transfer Records_. Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall
continue to maintain its stock transfer records and to transfer and replace
stock certificates in accordance with its existing policies and past practices
with regard to such transfers and replacements. From and after the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration or transfers on the stock
transfer books of Seller or Acquiror of shares of Seller Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than
to settle transfers of Seller Common Stock that occurred prior to the
Effective Time. If after the Effective Time, the Seller Stock Certificates
are presented for transfer to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II.

2.5 _Subsidiary Merger_. At the effective time of the Subsidiary Merger, each
share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Seller Sub (the "Seller
Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the Subsidiary Merger shall automatically be cancelled and there shall
be no conversion or exchange of, or consideration paid or issued for, such
Seller Sub Common Stock. The certificate or certificates for such Seller Sub
Common Stock shall be surrendered and cancelled. All of the shares of Acquiror
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
Subsidiary Merger shall remain issued and outstanding after the effective time
of the Subsidiary Merger and shall be unaffected by the Subsidiary Merger.

 

2.6 _Seller Stock Options, Seller Restricted Stock and Related Matters_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Parent Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, each option, stock appreciation
right or similar right to purchase shares of Seller Common Stock
(collectively, "Seller Stock Options") granted by Seller under the Heritage
Financial Group 2006 Equity Incentive Plan or the Heritage Financial
Group, Inc. 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the "Seller Stock
Plans"), or otherwise, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and converted into
an obligation of Acquiror to pay (or cause to be paid) and a right of the
holder to receive, in full satisfaction of any rights in respect of the Seller
Stock Option, a cash payment, without interest, equal to the product of (i)
the total number of shares of Seller Common Stock subject to such Seller
Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of $27.00 over the
exercise price per share of Seller Common Stock subject to such Seller Stock
Option (with the aggregate amount of such payment to the holder to be rounded
to the nearest cent), less the amount of any required withholding Tax. No
holder of a Seller Stock Option that has an exercise price per share of Seller
Common Stock that is equal to or greater than $27.00 shall be entitled to any
payment with respect to such cancelled Seller Stock Option before, on, or
after the Effective Time. Acquiror shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the
holders of Seller Stock Options the cash payments described in this Section
2.6(a) on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but in
any event within ten Business Days following the Closing Date.

(b) At the Effective Time, each share of Seller Common Stock subject to
restrictions on transfer and/or forfeiture granted under a Seller Stock Plan
or otherwise ("Seller Restricted Stock") that is outstanding 

 



7  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested and shall
be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, less the amount of any required withholding
Tax, in accordance with Section 2.1(a)(ii).

(c) Before the Effective Time, Sellers board of directors (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the particular Seller Stock Plan)
shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to
effect the transactions described in this Section 2.6.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall deliver all required notices
(which notices shall have been approved in advance by Acquiror, in its
reasonable discretion) to each holder of Seller Stock Options and/or Seller
Restricted Stock, setting forth each holders or participants rights pursuant
to the particular Seller Stock Plan and stating that such Seller Stock
Options and/or Seller Restricted Stock shall be treated in the manner set
forth in this Section 2.6.

2.7 _Seller ESOP_. Prior to the Effective Time, Sellers board of directors
shall adopt resolutions to terminate the Seller Employee Stock Ownership Plan
effective as of the Closing Date, _provided_ , that such termination shall be
contingent on the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed
or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location
of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed, qualified
or in good standing, or to have such power or authority, individually or in
the aggregate, would not have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. The term
"Seller Material Adverse Effect" shall mean (i) any change, state of facts,
circumstance, event or development which, individually or in the

 



8  aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the business, operations, assets or financial condition of Seller, Seller Sub

a whole, other than (A) effects resulting from the impact of any action taken
by Seller or any of the Subsidiaries with the prior written consent of
Acquiror or required expressly by this Agreement or any action not taken by
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent such action is expressly
prohibited by this Agreement without the prior written consent of Acquiror and

or interpretations thereof that are generally applicable to the banking

(F) or (H), such change, state of facts, circumstance, event or development
does not have a disproportionate effect on Seller or Seller Sub as compared to
other financial institutions or their holding companies; or (ii) any event or
occurrence, including the Mergers, that results in or is reasonably likely to
result in the loss of any material amount of loss share coverage from the

duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each

character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Seller Material Adverse
Effect.

Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Except to the extent reflected, disclosed or reserved against in the
Seller Financial Statements or immaterial liabilities incurred
since September 30, 2014 in the ordinary course of business and consistent
with past practice (none of which arises from breach of any contract or
agreement, breach of warranty, tort, infringement, violation of any applicable
Law or any litigation or other proceeding or is otherwise a "loss
contingency" within the meaning of Accounting Standards Codification Topic
450, Contingencies), neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries has any
obligation or liability, whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise
and whether due or to become due, that is material to the business, result of

to any, and there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened,
legal, administrative, arbitration or other proceedings, claims, actions or
governmental investigations of any nature against Seller or any of the
Subsidiaries, other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course
of business, which, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. Neither Seller nor any of
the Subsidiaries is a party to any judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction
which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have
a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

3.7 _Taxes and Tax Returns_.

(a) Each of Seller and the Subsidiaries has duly filed (and until the
Effective Time will so file) all returns, declarations, reports, information
returns and statements ("Returns") required to be filed or sent by or with
respect to them in respect of any Taxes (as hereinafter defined) and has duly
paid (and until the Effective Time will so pay) all Taxes due and payable
other than Taxes or other charges which (i) are being contested in good faith
(and are set forth on _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.7(a)_ ) and (ii) have not

made a claim in writing that Seller or any of the Subsidiaries is required to
file a Return in such taxing authoritys jurisdiction. There is no currently

of the statute of limitations with respect to any Taxes or Returns with
respect to Seller or any of the Subsidiaries.

require Seller or any of the Subsidiaries to make any payments after the
Effective Time; (iii) is required to include in income any adjustment

for Taxes of any other entity under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or
any similar provision of any Law); or (vi) has ever engaged in any "listed
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

the Subsidiaries which is an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA"), is listed in _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.8(a)_ , and each

aggregate or by group or class, whether written or unwritten, qualified or
non-qualified, are listed in _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.8(a)_ (the "Seller
Plans"). Seller has furnished to Acquiror true and complete copies or

amendments, supplements, funding arrangements, policies, or other related
documents thereto, (ii) the most recent summary plan description for each such
Seller Plan for which a summary plan description is required, (iii)

ERISA, the Code, all regulations, rulings and announcements promulgated or
issued thereunder, and all other applicable governmental Laws, including but
not limited to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Family and Medical
Leave Act of 1994, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Americans with
Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008 and the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act of 2010, except for such instances of non-compliance that, either

in a Seller Material Adverse Effect; (ii) at all times after December 31,
2004, each Seller Plan that constitutes or includes a nonqualified plan of
"deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has
been operated in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of Section 409A of the Code and each such Seller Plan has been
timely amended to comply in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of such section; (iii) each Qualified Seller Plan has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS or is entitled to rely upon a
letter issued to a prototype sponsor or volume submitter sponsor covering all
required Tax Law provisions or has applied to the IRS for such favorable
determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period
under Section 401(b) of the Code and, to the Knowledge of Seller, no

 



14  fact or event has occurred since the date of such letter that could

Seller Plan except claims for benefits arising in the ordinary course of
the administration of such plans; (vi) neither Seller nor any of the
Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Seller Plan

subject Seller or any of the Subsidiaries to a Tax or penalty imposed by
either Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 502(i) and 4071 of ERISA; (vii)
neither Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate of Seller has ever sponsored,
maintained, or contributed to a plan, including any Seller Plan, which is a
"defined benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(35) of ERISA or subject
to Title IV of ERISA, and Seller has no Knowledge of any facts, circumstances,
or reportable events that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
liability of Acquiror to the IRS or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
under Title IV of ERISA; and (viii) neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries
has contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any "multi-employer
plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA or a "multiple employer
welfare arrangement" within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA, regardless
of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "ERISA Affiliate" shall mean any entity, which together
with Seller or Acquiror, as applicable, would be treated as a single employer
under Code Section 414 or ERISA Section 4001(b).

(c) All contributions required to be made by Seller or any of the Subsidiaries
under the terms of any of their Seller Plans, as of the date hereof, have

an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning
of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and neither Seller nor any
of its Subsidiaries has an outstanding funding waiver. It is not reasonably

412(l) of the Code. Neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries has provided,
or is required to provide, security to any Pension Plan pursuant to Section
401(a)(29) of the Code, and no such plan is or has been subject to any
limitation on accelerated distributions or amendments under Section 436 of
the Code.

Seller nor Seller Sub has any obligation to provide medical, health, dental,
vision, life insurance, or disability benefits under any Seller Plan for any
period after termination of employment, except as may be required by Section
4980B of the Code or Section 601 of ERISA or similar state or local law.

(e) There has been no amendment to, announcement by Seller or any of
the Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Seller Plan which would materially increase the expense of
maintaining such Seller Plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor
for the most recent fiscal year. Except as set forth on _Seller Disclosure
Schedule 3.8(e)_ , neither the execution of this Agreement, approval of this
Agreement by the stockholders of Seller or Seller Sub nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby (individually or in conjunction with any
other event) will (i) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in
any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation
or benefits or increase in the amounts payable or result in any other
material obligation pursuant to any Seller Plan; (ii) limit or restrict their
right or, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
right of Employer (as defined in Section 5.13(a)(i)) to merge, amend or
terminate any Seller Plan; (iii) entitle any Employee to severance pay or any
increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date
hereof; or (iv) cause Seller or any of the Subsidiaries to record additional
compensation expense on their income statements with respect to any
outstanding stock option or other equity-based award.

 

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as set forth on
_Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.8(e)_ , neither the execution of this
Agreement, approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of Seller or Seller
Sub

 



15  nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (individually
or in conjunction with any other event) could result in amounts paid or
payable that would (i) constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code or (ii) that would not be deductible under
Section 162(m) of the Code.

 

(f) Except as set forth on _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.8(f)_ , there are no
outstanding compensatory equity awards, including any contracts or
arrangements awarding stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock, deferred stock, phantom stock or any other equity or equity-based
compensation to any employee, officer, director, consultant or other service
provider of or to Seller or the Subsidiaries. With respect to the Seller
Stock Options, (i) the per share exercise price of all such options is equal
to or greater than the fair market value (determined in accordance with
Section 409A of the Code) of the underlying shares of Seller Common Stock as
of their effective grant date and (ii) all such options were granted either on
the date of approval by Sellers board of directors or the compensation
committee of Sellers board of directors or at a later date specified by such
board of directors or compensation committee, as applicable. All members of
Sellers compensation committee meet the independence standards and
requirements of NASDAQ, the Commission, if applicable, and the IRS.

(a) Since January 1, 2011, Seller has filed or furnished on a timely basis
with the Commission all final registration statements, prospectuses, annual,
quarterly or current reports and definitive proxy statements or other
communications (other than general advertising materials), forms, reports,
schedules, statements or other documents required to be filed or furnished by
it pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), or the rules and
regulations promulgated by the Commission (all such filed or furnished
documents since January 1, 2011, together with all exhibits and schedules
thereto and all information incorporated therein by reference, the "Seller SEC
Documents"). As of the respective dates of their filing or being furnished
(and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, as of the
dates of their effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively), except
to the extent that any Seller SEC Document has been amended or superseded by
a subsequently filed Seller SEC Document prior to the date hereof, in which
case, as of the date of such amended or superseded filing, each such final
registration statement, prospectus, annual, quarterly or current report and
definitive proxy statement or other communication, form, report, schedule,
statement or other document, as of its date, complied or, if not yet filed or
furnished, will comply in all material respects with all Laws applicable to
the Seller SEC Documents (including the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended) and did not, and any Seller SEC
Documents filed with or furnished to the Commission subsequent to the date of
this Agreement will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , that information as of a
later date filed publicly prior to the date hereof shall be deemed to modify
information as of an earlier date. None of Sellers Subsidiaries is required
to file periodic reports with the Commission.

 

(b) Since January 1, 2011, Seller and Seller Sub have duly filed in correct
form all monthly, quarterly and annual reports, forms, correspondence,
registrations and statements, together with any amendments required to be made
with respect thereto, that they were required to file with the Maryland
Department of Assessments and Taxation, GDBF, the FDIC, the FRB and any
other federal or state Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over Seller
and/or Seller Sub, other than the Commission, and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the failure
to file (or furnish, as applicable) such monthly, quarterly and annual
reports, forms, correspondence, registrations and statements or to pay such
fees and assessments, individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably
likely to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. As of their filing date,
each such report or other filing did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. To the extent not
prohibited by Law, Seller has delivered or made available to Acquiror accurate
and complete copies of such reports, forms, correspondence, registrations and
statements.  _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.9_ lists all examinations of
Seller and

 



16  Seller Sub conducted by the applicable bank regulatory authorities since
January 1, 2011 and the dates of any responses submitted thereto. In
connection with the most recent examinations of Seller or any of the
Subsidiaries by the applicable bank regulatory authorities, neither Seller nor
any of the Subsidiaries was required to correct or change any material action,
procedure or proceeding which Seller or Seller Sub believes has not been now
corrected or changed as required.

3.10 _Seller Information_. None of the information relating to Seller and
the Subsidiaries provided or to be provided by Seller or Seller Sub for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement (as
defined herein) and/or in the registration statement on Form S-4, in which the
Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a part thereof, to be filed by
Acquiror with the Commission in connection with the solicitation of the
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the
stockholders of Seller and Acquiror, as amended or supplemented (or on any
successor or other appropriate schedule or form) (the "Registration
Statement"), or in any application, notification or other document to be filed
with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, will, as of the date the Joint Proxy Statement is first
mailed to Sellers or Acquirors stockholders or at the time of the Special
Meetings, or at the time the Registration Statement becomes effective under
the 1933 Act or at the Effective Time, or at the time any such other
application, notification or other document are so filed, as the case may be,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading (except that this representation shall not apply to any
information in the Joint Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or such
other applications, notifications or other documents supplied by Acquiror or
Acquiror Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein), provided
that information as of a later date shall be deemed to modify information as
of an earlier date.

licenses, certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in full force
and effect, except for such failures to have such permits, licenses,
certificates of authority, orders and approvals of, to make all filings,

the Subsidiaries or (ii) in default with respect to any judgment, order,
writ, decree or injunction of any court or other Governmental Entity material
to the business or operations of Seller or any of the Subsidiaries, except in
the case of clause (i)(A) such violations which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to result in a Seller Material
Adverse Effect. Neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries has received any
written notice from any Governmental Entity asserting that Seller or any
of the Subsidiaries is in violation of or default with respect to any of the
foregoing, except for such violations or defaults which, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to result in a Seller Material
Adverse Effect. Neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries is subject to any
regulatory or supervisory cease and desist order, agreement, written
directive, memorandum of understanding or written commitment (other than those
of general applicability to all banks issued by Governmental Entities), and
neither of them has received any written communication requesting that it

Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the "FDIA"), and Seller Sub has
paid when due all premiums and assessments required by the FDIA and the
regulations thereunder. No action, suit or proceeding is pending or, to the
Knowledge of Seller, has been threatened by the FDIC against Seller or Seller
Sub with respect to the termination of such insurance. Seller Sub has
complied in all material respects with any agreements or commitments entered
into or made by Seller Sub in connection with obtaining "brokered" deposits
(as such term is defined in 12 C.F.R. § 337.6(a)(2)).

following consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(either alone or in connection with the occurrence of any additional acts or
events); (iv) any agreement, arrangement or understanding to which Seller or
any of the Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound which
limits the freedom of Seller or any of the Subsidiaries to compete in

the geographic area in which, or method by which, they may carry on their
business (other than as may be required by Law or any Governmental Entity);
(v) any assistance agreement, supervisory agreement, memorandum of
understanding, consent order, cease and desist order or condition of any

foregoing cases whether written or oral (each such agreement listed, or
required to be listed, in this Section 3.13(a) is referred to herein as a
"Seller Agreement"). Except as set forth in _Seller Disclosure Schedule
3.13(a)_ , neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries is a party to any

(b) Neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries is in default or in non-
compliance under any Seller Agreement, and there has not occurred any event
that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute
such a default or non-compliance, except for such default or non-compliance
which, individually or in the 

 



18  aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to result in a Seller Material
Adverse Effect. Each Seller Agreement is valid, binding and enforceable
against Seller or, as applicable, any of the Subsidiaries and, to the
Knowledge of Seller, the other parties thereto in accordance with their
respective terms, except as limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception,
and is in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and all
rents and other monetary amounts that may have become due and payable
thereunder have been paid, except for such failures to be valid, binding and
enforceable, to be in full force and effect or to have paid all rents and
other monetary amounts which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be likely to result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

3.14 _Properties and Insurance_.

(a) All of the tangible assets and other personal property owned or leased by
Seller or any of the Subsidiaries or presently used by either of them in
their respective business is in good condition (ordinary wear and tear
excepted) and is sufficient to carry on the business of Seller and Seller Sub
in the ordinary course consistent with past practices. Seller and each of the
Subsidiaries have title and, as to owned real property, good and marketable
title to all material assets and properties, whether real or personal,
tangible or intangible, reflected in Sellers consolidated unaudited
balance sheet as of September 30, 2014 or owned and acquired subsequent
thereto (except for such assets and properties that have been disposed of for
fair value in the ordinary course of business since September 30, 2014),
subject to no encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests or pledges,
except (i) those items that secure liabilities that are reflected in said
consolidated balance sheet or the notes thereto or have been incurred in the
ordinary course of business after the date of such consolidated balance
sheet; (ii) statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or which are being
contested in good faith; (iii) liens for real property Taxes not yet due and
payable; (iv) such encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests,
pledges and title imperfections that are not in the aggregate material to the
business, results of operations, assets or financial condition of Seller and
Seller Sub, taken individually or as a whole; and (v) with respect to owned
real property, (x) easements, rights-of-way, covenants, consents,
restrictions, encroachments, variations and other restrictions, charges or
encumbrances (whether recorded or not) that do not interfere materially with
the ordinary course of Sellers business or the business of any Subsidiary at
such property, (y) building restrictions, zoning laws and other Laws, now or
at any time hereafter adopted by any Governmental Entity having
jurisdiction that do not materially interfere with the ordinary course of
Sellers or Seller Subs business, or (z) imperfections or irregularities of
title noted in title reports delivered to Acquiror prior to the date hereof
(items (i)  (v) are collectively referred to herein as "Permitted Liens").
Seller and each of the Subsidiaries as lessees have the right under valid and
subsisting leases to occupy, use, possess and control all property leased by
them in all respects as presently occupied, used, possessed and controlled by
Seller and such Subsidiaries. _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.14(a)_ sets forth
an accurate listing of each lease pursuant to which Seller or any of
the Subsidiaries acts as lessor or lessee, including the expiration date and
the terms of any renewal options which relate to the same. Neither Seller nor
any of the Subsidiaries has any legal obligation, absolute or contingent, to
any other person to sell or otherwise dispose of any substantial part of its
assets or to sell or dispose of any of its assets except in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices.

 

(b) _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.14(b)_ sets forth a list of all policies of
fire, theft, public liability, business interruption and other insurance
(including fidelity bonds insurance) maintained by Seller and the Subsidiaries
as of the date thereof. The business operations and all insurable properties
and assets of Seller and the Subsidiaries are insured for their
benefit against all risks (including flood) which, to the Knowledge of
Seller, should be insured against, in each case, under valid, binding and
enforceable policies or bonds issued by insurers of recognized responsibility,
in such amounts with such deductibles and against such risks and losses as
are, to the Knowledge of Seller, adequate for the business engaged in by
Seller and such Subsidiaries. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of
Seller, neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries has received any written
notice of cancellation or written notice of a material amendment of any such
insurance policy or bond or is in default under such policy or bond, all
premiums and other payments due under any such policy or bond have been
paid, no coverage thereunder is being disputed, and all material claims
thereunder have been or will be filed in a timely fashion.

"Loan Portfolio Properties and Other Properties Owned" means those properties
owned, leased or operated by a person or its subsidiaries or those properties

3.16 _Allowance for Loan Losses and Real Estate Owned_. The allowance for
loan losses reflected on Sellers consolidated balance sheets included in the
consolidated financial statements referred to in Section 3.4 is in compliance
with Sellers existing methodology for determining the adequacy of its
allowance for loan losses and was, at the time recorded, or will be in the
case of subsequently delivered financial statements, as the case may be,
adequate in all material respects as of their respective dates under the
requirements of GAAP and the standards formally established by applicable
Governmental Entities to provide for reasonably anticipated losses on
outstanding loans net of recoveries. The real estate owned reflected on the
consolidated balance sheets included in the consolidated financial statements
referred to in Section 3.4 was, at the time recorded, or will be in the case
of subsequently delivered financial statements, as the case may be, carried at
the lower of cost or fair value, or the lower of cost or net realizable
value, as required by GAAP.

3.17 _Minute Books_. Since January 1, 2011, the minute books, including any
attachments thereto, of Seller and the Subsidiaries contain complete and
accurate records in all material respects of all meetings and other material
corporate action held or taken by their respective boards of directors or
comparable governing bodies (including committees thereof) and stockholders,
members or trustees, as applicable.

 



20 3.18 _Affiliate Transactions_. Except for (i) deposit agreements entered into
in the ordinary course of business with customers of Seller Sub; (ii) loans
covered by the second sentence of Section 3.23(a); and (iii) obligations under
employee benefit plans set forth on _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.8(a)_ ,
and except as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, since January 1,
2011, neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries has engaged in or agreed to
engage in (whether in writing or orally) any transaction with any
"affiliate," as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the 1933 Act.

3.19 _Internal Controls; Disclosure Controls_. Seller and the
Subsidiaries have maintained a system of "internal controls over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the 1934 Act)
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (i)
all transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets,
(ii) access to Sellers assets is permitted only in accordance with
managements general or specific authorization, and (iii) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals, and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.
Seller and the Subsidiaries have devised and maintained "disclosure controls
and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the 1934 Act)
effective for ensuring that information Seller is required to disclose in
reports that it files or submits under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commissions
rules and forms.

3.20 _Risk Management Instruments_. All interest rate swaps, caps, floors,
option agreements, futures and forward contracts (including commitments to
sell mortgage loans) and other similar risk management arrangements
(collectively, the "Risk Management Instruments"), whether entered into for
Sellers own account or for the account of one or more of Seller Sub or its
customers, were entered into, to the Knowledge of Seller, (i) in accordance
with all applicable Laws and (ii) with counterparties financially responsible
at the time; and each of the Risk Management Instruments are valid and legally
binding obligations of Seller or Seller Sub; and are enforceable in accordance
with their terms (except as limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception), and are in full force and effect. Except as would not reasonably
be likely to result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect, Seller and its
Subsidiaries have in place risk management policies and procedures sufficient
in scope and operation to protect against risks of the type and in amounts
reasonably expected to be incurred by entities of similar size and in similar
lines of business as Seller or the applicable Subsidiary. Seller and Seller
Sub have duly performed all of their material obligations under Risk
Management Instruments to the extent such obligations to perform have accrued.
To the Knowledge of Seller, there are no material breaches, violations or
defaults, or allegations or assertions thereof by any party
thereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of the date
hereof, no events or circumstances have occurred, or are reasonably likely to
occur prior to the Effective Time, that would require Seller or Seller Sub to
repurchase any mortgage loans sold to secondary market investors, nor has any
such investor made any assertion to that effect.

3.21 _Opinion_. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the board of
directors of Seller has received the oral opinion (to be confirmed in writing)
of its financial advisor, Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc., to the effect that,
as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the assumptions and
qualifications set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Seller Common Stock. Seller shall furnish an
accurate and complete copy of such opinion to Acquiror, solely for
informational purposes, as promptly as practicable following the execution of
this Agreement. Such opinion has not been amended or rescinded as of the date
of this Agreement.

 

3.22 _Broker Fees_. Except as set forth in _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.22_ ,
neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
directors or officers has employed any consultant, broker or finder or
incurred any liability for any consultants, brokers or finders fees or
commissions in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



21 3.23 _Loans_.

 

(a) Except as set forth on _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.23_ , all of the
loans and other evidences of indebtedness (including commitments to extend
credit) on the books of Seller and Seller Sub in the original principal amount
of $35,000 and above are valid and properly documented in all material
respects and were solicited and originated, and are and have been administered
and serviced, in the ordinary course of business consistent with Seller and
Seller Subs underwriting standards, and the security therefor, if any, is
valid and properly perfected in all material respects, and no material
collateral has been released from the lien granted to Seller and Seller Sub
with respect to any such loans unless approved by Seller and Seller Sub and
documented in their files. All loans and extensions of credit that have been
made by Seller Sub that are subject to Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve
Act, as amended, and Regulation O (12 C.F.R. Part 215) promulgated thereunder,
comply therewith in all material respects. There are no employee, officer,
director or other affiliate loans on which the borrower is paying a rate
other than that reflected in the note or other relevant credit or security
agreement or on which the borrower is paying a rate which was not in
compliance with Regulation O. Neither the terms of such loans nor any of
the loan documentation nor the manner in which such loans have been
originated, administered and serviced nor Sellers procedures and practices of
approving or rejecting loan applications violates in any material respect any
Law applicable thereto. Seller and Seller Sub have full power and authority
to hold such loans and have good and valid title to all such loans, free and
clear of any liens (other than liens in the ordinary course of business to the
FHLB or the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta), and the principal balance of
each such loan as shown on the books and records of Seller and Seller Sub is
true and correct as of the last date shown thereon. To the Knowledge of
Seller, each such loan is enforceable against the obligor(s) thereunder in
accordance with its terms, in each such case subject to the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception, except for such unenforceability which, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to result in a Seller
Material Adverse Effect. All such loans will continue in full force and
effect immediately after the Effective Time, other than any loans that are
paid or otherwise satisfied in full after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time, except for such failure to be in full force and effect which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to result in
a Seller Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Section 3.23, the term
"loans" includes the documents relating in any way to such loans, including
loan applications, notes or borrowing arrangements (including leases, credit
enhancements, commitments and interest-bearing assets), security agreements,
deeds of trust, appraisals, credit reports, disclosures, titles to
collateral, verifications (including employment verification, deposit
verification, etc.), mortgages, loan agreements, including building and loan
agreements, guarantees, pledge agreements, financing statements,
intercreditor agreements, participation agreements, sureties and insurance
policies (including title insurance policies) and all modifications, waivers
and consents relating to any of the foregoing. The electronic data files
delivered by Seller to Acquiror with respect to all outstanding Seller loans
as of October 31, 2014 are true, correct and complete in all material
respects.

(b) To the Knowledge of Seller, Seller and Seller Sub have administered and
serviced the loans, leases and other assets purchased by Seller Sub from the
FDIC, in its capacity as receiver of each of Citizens Bank of Effingham,
Springfield, Georgia and First Southern National Bank, Statesboro, Georgia,
in all material respects, in accordance with the relevant notes or other
credit or security documents, the requirements of the applicable Shared-Loss
Agreement and with all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations
and rules. To the Knowledge of Seller, Seller Sub (i) has not been underpaid
or overpaid any amounts under any of the Shared-Loss Agreements by the FDIC,
as receiver, (ii) has timely and properly filed all reports and documents
with the FDIC, as receiver, in accordance with the terms of the Shared-Loss
Agreements, and (iii) is not in default or violation of any of its duties or
obligations under any of the Shared-Loss Agreements, except, with respect
to clauses (ii) and (iii), such late or improper filings or defaults or
violations which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
likely to result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.23(c)_ sets forth a list of each request
received by Seller since January 1, 2011 for any recourse or request to
repurchase by a buyer of any loans, any pools or loans or participations in
loans or pools of loans, including all claims made or, to the Knowledge of
Seller, threatened, for repurchases of home mortgage loans sold to third
parties. 

 



22 (d) To the Knowledge of Seller, each agreement between Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries and a Seller Mortgage Vendor (a "Seller Mortgage Vendor
Agreement") is valid and in full force and effect and enforceable in
accordance with its respective terms, in each case subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting creditors rights generally (or the enforcement of the rights of
creditors of FDIC-insured institutions in particular), and except that the
availability of equitable remedies (including specific performance and
injunctive relief) is within the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding may be brought. To the Knowledge of Seller, no Seller Mortgage
Vendor is in material breach of its Seller Mortgage Vendor Agreement. Seller
or its Subsidiary, as applicable, has the right to stop funding immediately
the Seller Mortgage Vendor Agreement upon (i) an order or directive from any
depository institution regulatory authority; (ii) the justifiable suspension
of Seller Mortgage Vendor by any of its institutional end-loan Seller
Mortgage Investors (hereinafter defined); (iii) a material, negative change in
the Seller Mortgage Vendors financial condition; (iv) the Seller Mortgage
Vendors failure to comply with the terms of the Seller Mortgage Vendor
Agreement; or (v) the Seller Mortgage Vendors failure to comply with the
underwriting, closing delivery and funding requirements of its institutional
end-loan Seller Mortgage Investors. To the Knowledge of Seller, the relevant
seller has the obligation to repurchase any Seller loan subject to a Seller
Mortgage Vendor Agreement should the sale of any such loan or loans scheduled
for purchase by the Seller Mortgage Investor fail to be consummated within a
specified time, not to exceed 90 days, after the date on which an interest in
the Seller loan is purchased by Seller or its Subsidiary, as applicable. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Seller Mortgage Vendor" means a third-party that
originates or purchases mortgage loans from whom Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries purchases, or did purchase, a participation interest in such
mortgage loans or whose origination or purchase of mortgage loans was
financed by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.

(e) To the Knowledge of Seller, each mortgage loan made by a Seller
Mortgage Vendor in which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has purchased a
participating interest or which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has financed
(the "Seller Mortgage Loans") is secured by a first or second lien on the land
on which the dwelling is situated, and the Seller Mortgage Vendor has a
written agreement (a "Take-Out Letter") issued by an investor (the "Seller
Mortgage Investor") approved by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to
purchase the Seller Mortgage Loan. No Seller Mortgage Investor has indicated
that it has terminated, or intends to terminate, its relationship with Seller
or Seller Sub. The Seller Mortgage Loans are conforming loans eligible for
purchase under Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA"), Federal
National Mortgage Association ("FNMA"), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
("FHLMC"), or approved institutional investor criteria. The delivery of all
Seller Mortgage Loan documents is at the Seller Mortgage Vendors risk and the
Seller Mortgage Vendors responsibility, and each Seller Mortgage Vendor has
agreed to indemnify Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and
hold it harmless from all bona fide and reasonable loss, cost or expense
(including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of or incurred in
connection therewith, except only for such loss, cost or expense, if any, that
results solely from the negligent acts or omissions of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable.

(f) To the Knowledge of Seller, with respect to each Seller Mortgage Loan,
all applicable Laws have been complied with in all material respects,
including, but not limited to, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the
Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Flood Disaster Protection Act, the
Fair Housing Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act of 1968, the Depository
Institutions Deregulatory and Monetary Control Act of 1980, all as amended;
all usury laws and limitations; all conditions within the control of the
Seller Mortgage Vendor as to the validity of the insurance or guaranty
required by the National Housing Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and
regulations thereunder, and the Servicemens Readjustment Act of 1944, as
amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder; and all requirements of
the mortgage insurance companies or other insurers have been properly
satisfied, and such insurance or guaranty is valid or enforceable. A written
appraisal of the real property securing each such Seller Mortgage Loan has
been prepared by a duly-licensed appraiser and satisfies all requirements for
any applicable Department of Veterans Affairs guaranty, FHA insurance or
private mortgage insurance and all requirements imposed by the Seller Mortgage
Investor which issued the Take-Out Letter covering such Seller Mortgage Loan.
Seller Mortgage Loans that are secured by premises requiring flood insurance
due to their location in a special flood hazard as designated by the Secretary
of HUD, are and continue 

 



23  to be covered by special flood insurance under the National Flood Insurance
Program. Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries is now, nor has it been
since January 1, 2011, subject to any fine, sanction, settlement or other
administrative agreement with respect to Seller Mortgage Loans.

(g) To the Knowledge of Seller, since January 1, 2011, neither Seller nor any
of its Subsidiaries has foreclosed upon, or taken a deed or title to, any real
estate (other than single-family residential properties) without complying in
all material respects with all applicable FDIC environmental due diligence
standards (including FDIC Bulletin FIL-14-93, and update FIL-98-2006) or
foreclosed upon, or taken a deed or title to, any such real estate if the
environmental assessment indicates the liabilities under Environmental Laws
are likely in excess of the assets value.

(h) Except as set forth on _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.23_ , since January
1, 2011, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has acquired or disposed
of any pool of Seller loans, other than related to its mortgage purchase
business in the ordinary course of business.

 

(i) _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.23(i)_ sets forth a list of (i) each Seller
loan that as of October 31, 2014 had an outstanding balance and/or unfunded
commitment of $100,000 or more and that as of such date (A) was contractually
past due 90 days or more in the payment of principal and/or interest or was in
default of any other material provision, (B) was on non-accrual status, (C)
was classified as "substandard," "doubtful" "loss," "classified,"
"criticized," "impaired" or "special mention" (or words of similar import) by
Seller Sub or any Governmental Entity, (D) where the interest rate terms have
been reduced and/or the maturity dates have been extended subsequent to the
agreement under which the Seller loan was originally created due to
concerns regarding the borrowers ability to pay in accordance with such
initial terms, (E) where a specific reserve allocation exists in connection
therewith, or (F) which is required to be accounted for as a troubled debt
restructuring in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 15; and (ii) each asset of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries that as of
October 31, 2014 was classified as "other real estate owned," "other
repossessed assets" or as an asset to satisfy Seller loans, and the book
value thereof as of such date. For each Seller loan identified in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence, _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.23(i)_
sets forth the outstanding balance, including accrued and unpaid interest and
late fees, on each such loan and the identity of the borrower thereunder as of
October 31, 2014.

 

3.24 _Investment Securities; BOLI_.

 

(a) Except for securities pledged for reverse repurchase agreements, interest
rate swap, cap and floor contracts or pledged to secure public trust funds,
(i) none of the investments reflected in the audited consolidated balance
sheet of Seller as of December 31, 2013 under the heading "Securities
available for sale," (ii) none of the investments by Seller and
the Subsidiaries since December 31, 2013, and (iii) none of the assets
reflected in the audited consolidated balance sheet of Seller as of December
31, 2013 or in any unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Seller furnished to
Acquiror after December 31, 2013 under the heading "Cash and due from banks"
is subject to any restriction, whether contractual or statutory, that impairs
the ability of Seller or any of the Subsidiaries freely to dispose of such
investment at any time. With respect to all repurchase agreements of which
Seller or any of the Subsidiaries is a party, Seller or such Subsidiary, as
the case may be, has a valid, perfected first lien or security interest in or
evidence of ownership in book entry form of the government securities or
other collateral securing each such repurchase agreement, and the value of
such collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured thereby under
such agreement.

 

(b) _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.24(b)_ sets forth a true, correct and
complete description of all bank owned life insurance ("BOLI") owned by
Seller, Seller Sub or any of the other Subsidiaries, including the value of
its BOLI. Seller, Seller Sub and its other Subsidiaries have taken all actions
necessary to comply in all material respects with applicable Law in
connection with the purchase of BOLI. The value of such BOLI is and has been
fairly and accurately reflected in all material respects in the most recent
balance sheet included in the financial statements of Seller
delivered pursuant to Section 5.5 hereof, in accordance with GAAP. All BOLI
is owned

 



24  solely by Seller, Seller Sub or another Subsidiary, and no other person has
any ownership claims with respect to such BOLI or proceeds of insurance
derived therefrom and there is no split dollar or similar benefit under such
BOLI. Neither Seller, Seller Sub nor any of the other Subsidiaries has any
outstanding borrowings secured in whole or part by its BOLI.

 

3.25 _Employees; Compensation_.

 

(a) Except to the extent a failure to comply could not, alone or with any
other failure, have a Seller Material Adverse Effect, (i) each of Seller and
the Subsidiaries is and has been in compliance with all applicable Laws
respecting employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment, and wages and hours, including any Law relating to discrimination,
fair labor standards and occupational health and safety, wrongful discharge
or violation of the personal rights of employees, former employees or
prospective employees; and (ii) neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries is
or has engaged in any unfair labor practices. Additionally, there are no
strikes, slowdowns or work stoppages pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
threatened with respect to the employees; there is no representation claim or
petition or complaint pending before the National Labor Relations Board or
any state or local labor agency and, to the Knowledge of Seller, no question
concerning representation has been raised or threatened respecting the
employees; to the Knowledge of Seller, no charges with respect to or relating
to Sellers business are pending before the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, or any state or local agency responsible for the prevention of
unlawful employment practices, which could reasonably be likely to have a
Seller Material Adverse Effect; and to the Knowledge of Seller, neither
Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries has any obligations under any federal,
state, or local government contract, although Seller is a government
contractor pursuant to Executive Order 11246. No employee of Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries is an undocumented alien, and Seller has obtained a Form I-9
and all ancillary information required in connection therewith with respect to
each such employee.

 

(b) Except to the extent that such liability could not, alone or with any
other failure, have a Seller Material Adverse Effect, neither Seller nor any
of the Subsidiaries has any direct or indirect liability with respect to any
misclassification of any person as an independent contractor rather than a
"common law employee" or with respect to any person leased from
another employer.

(c) Except to the extent a failure to comply could not, alone or with any
other failure, have a Seller Material Adverse Effect, Seller has complied (or
will comply) prior to the Effective Time in all material respects with all
obligations existing on or before the Effective Time imposed by the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN Act") and any applicable
similar state or local law, including, but not limited to, providing all
notices required thereunder.

3.26 _Tax and Regulatory Matters_. Neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries
has taken or agreed to take any action which would or could reasonably be
expected to (i) cause the Parent Merger not to constitute a reorganization
under Section 368 of the Code or (ii) materially impede or delay receipt of
any unqualified consents of regulatory authorities referred to in Section 5.7
or result in failure of the condition in Section 7.1(c). No Seller Common
Stock has been or will be acquired by Seller Sub prior to and in connection
with the Mergers. Neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries has ever made or
been required to make an election under Section 338 of the Code.

all of Seller and each Subsidiarys material U.S. and foreign (i) trademark
or service mark registrations and applications, (ii) copyright registrations

applicable Subsidiary owns or has the valid right to use, in each case free
and clear of all material liens (other than Permitted Liens), all
applications, trademarks, service marks, trademark or service mark

software implementations of algorithms, models and methodologies, whether in
source code or object code, (ii) databases and compilations, including any and
all data and collections of data, whether machine readable or otherwise, (iii)

Effect. As of their filing date, each such report or other filing did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were

person, entity or group (other than Acquiror or Acquiror Sub) concerning any
Acquisition Transaction; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prevent Seller (on behalf of itself and Seller Sub) or
the board of directors of Seller prior to receipt of Seller Stockholder
Approval from (i) participating in discussions with a person regarding an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written proposal to engage in an
Acquisition Transaction (an "Acquisition Proposal") solely to clarify the
terms of such Acquisition Proposal, (ii) providing information in response to
an Acquisition Proposal upon the execution of a confidentiality agreement by
such person on customary terms and conditions; (iii) engaging in any
negotiations or discussions with any person who has made an Acquisition
Proposal; (iv) failing to make the Seller Recommendation, making a Change to
the Seller Recommendation or failing to call or convene the Special Meeting
of Sellers stockholders (as defined below); or (v) recommending such
Acquisition Proposal to the stockholders of Seller, if and only to the extent
that, in each such case referred to in clause (iii), (iv) or (v) above, (A)
Sellers board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the board of directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law and (B) Sellers board of directors determines, in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor, taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of
such Acquisition Proposal (including any applicable termination fees) that the
board of directors deems relevant, that the Acquisition Proposal is more
favorable to the Sellers stockholders from a financial point of view than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and is reasonably likely to be
consummated. An Acquisition Proposal which is received and considered by
Seller in compliance with this Section 5.3 and which meets the requirements
set forth in clauses (A) and (B) of the preceding sentence is herein referred
to as a "Superior Proposal". Seller shall communicate to Acquiror in writing
(the "Notice") as promptly as practicable (and in no event more than 48 hours
after receipt or determination (as applicable)) (i) the terms of any
Acquisition Proposal and shall provide Acquiror with copies of all such
Acquisition Proposals (and copies of any other information provided to the
person that made the Acquisition Proposal) and (ii) that it has determined to
make a Change in the Seller Recommendation (as defined below).

 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" means any offer or
proposal by a person or entity other than Acquiror or Acquiror Sub for (i) a
merger, tender offer, recapitalization or consolidation, or any similar
transaction, involving Seller or Seller Sub; (ii) a purchase, lease or other
acquisition or assumption of all or substantially all of the assets of Seller
or Seller Sub; (iii) a purchase or other acquisition (including by way of

 



40  merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of beneficial ownership
(the term "beneficial ownership" for purposes of this Agreement having the
meaning assigned thereto in Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act, and the rules and
regulations thereunder) of securities representing 51% or more of the voting
power of Seller; or (iv) any substantially similar transaction.

 

(b) During the six Business Days immediately following Acquirors receipt of
the Notice (the "Notice Period"), Seller shall, and shall cause its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel to, negotiate with Acquiror in good faith
during the Notice Period (to the extent Acquiror desires to negotiate) to
enable Acquiror to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement that
obviate the need of Sellers board of directors to make a Change in the Seller
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e),
including in the case of a Superior Proposal, by proposing such terms so as
to make such Superior Proposal no longer a Superior Proposal. Promptly
following the end of the Notice Period, Sellers board of directors shall have
considered in good faith any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Acquiror and any other information provided by Acquiror and shall have
determined (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) whether or not, if such changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Acquiror were to be given effect, the failure to make a Change in
the Seller Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(e) would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and whether or not such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal. If during the Notice Period there are any
material modifications to the financial terms (including any modifications to
the form, amount or timing of payment of consideration) or any other material
terms of any Superior Proposal, Seller shall, in each case, have delivered to
Acquiror an additional notice consistent with that described in Section 5.3(a)
and a new Notice Period under this paragraph shall commence, during which
time Seller shall be required to comply with the requirements of this Section
5.3(b) anew with respect to such additional notice. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent a notice required under this Section 5.3(b) (in
connection with a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(e)) relates to a
Superior Proposal for which the requisite notice or additional notice has been
given pursuant to this Section 5.3(b) (in connection with a Change in the
Seller Recommendation), no new or additional notice or Notice Period will be
required for such termination pursuant to Section 7.1(e). During the Notice
Period, Seller and Seller Sub shall not terminate this Agreement unless Seller
receives written notice from Acquiror that it does not intend to enter into
negotiations with Seller during the Notice Period to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement to match or better a Superior Proposal. If Acquiror
does not notify Seller of its election by the seventh day after Acquirors
receipt of the Notice, Seller may terminate this Agreement and proceed with
the Superior Proposal as provided in this Agreement.

 

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3 and Section 5.8, neither
the board of directors of Seller nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or
qualify, in a manner adverse to Acquiror, the Seller Recommendation (as
defined below) or take any action or make any statement in connection with
the Special Meeting of Seller inconsistent with such approval or the Seller
Recommendation (collectively, a "Change in the Seller Recommendation"); (ii)
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend,
any Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) cause Seller to enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement (each, a "Seller Acquisition Agreement") related to any
Acquisition Transaction. For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in the
Seller Recommendation shall include any approval or recommendation (or public
proposal to approve or recommend), by Sellers board of directors of an
Acquisition Proposal, or any failure by Sellers board of directors to
recommend against an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
board of directors of Seller (including any committee thereof) may, at any
time prior to obtaining the Seller Stockholder Approval, effect a Change in
the Seller Recommendation (and in the event that the board of directors of
Seller determines such Acquisition Proposal to be a Superior Proposal, in
accordance with this Section 5.3, terminate this Agreement in order to
concurrently enter into a Seller Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal), but only at a time that is after the compliance by Seller
with the terms of Sections 5.3(a), 5.3(b), 7.1 and 7.4., if the board of
directors of Seller determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel and its financial advisors, that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law.

 



41 (d) Upon the execution of this Agreement, Seller and Seller Sub shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and cause its and the other
Subsidiaries officers, directors and employees, investment bankers, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants and other representatives to immediately
cease and cause to be terminated, all discussions and negotiations, if any,
that have taken place prior to the date hereof with any persons with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal and, upon request by Acquiror, shall request the
return and destruction of all confidential information provided to any such
person.

5.4 _Negative Covenants of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub_. Except as expressly
provided in this Agreement, or as set forth on _Acquiror Disclosure Schedule
5.4_ , during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, each of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub and their Subsidiaries and their
respective boards of directors shall not:

 

(a) other than in connection with this Agreement, and except as would not have
a material adverse effect on the ability of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub to
perform their obligations hereunder, fail to conduct its business in the
ordinary and usual course consistent with past practices and prudent banking
practice, or fail to maintain and preserve intact its business
organization, properties, leases, employees and advantageous business
relationships and retain the services of its officers and key employees;

(b) knowingly take any action or knowingly fail to take any action which
would be reasonably expected to adversely affect or delay the ability of
Acquiror or Acquiror Sub to perform their respective covenants and agreements
on a timely basis under this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

(c) knowingly take any action or knowingly fail to take any action that would
reasonably be expected to result in any of its representations and warranties
contained in Article IV not being true and correct in any material respect at
the Effective Time;

 

(d) knowingly take any action which would be reasonably expected to adversely
affect or delay the ability of Acquiror or Acquiror Sub to obtain any
necessary approvals, consents or waivers of any Governmental Entity required
for the transactions contemplated hereby or which would reasonably be expected
to result in any such approvals, consents or waivers containing any condition
or restriction that would materially impair the value of the transaction to
Acquiror;

(e) agree to, or make any commitment to, take, or adopt any resolutions of
board of directors of Acquiror or Acquiror Sub in support of, any of the
actions prohibited by this Section 5.4;

 

(f) change any provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws (or
comparable organizational document) or other governing instrument of Acquiror
or Acquiror Sub;

(g) other than changes required by GAAP as concurred in by Acquirors
independent accountants, (A) make any change in its accounting methods or
practices or systems of internal accounting controls (or the manner in which
liabilities are accrued), (B) revalue in any material respect any of its
assets, including writing-off notes or accounts receivable or (C) change any
of its methods of reporting income and deductions for federal income tax
purposes, except as required by changes in Law;

 

(h) except as expressly permitted by Section 5.8, withdraw, modify or qualify,
or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to
Seller, the Acquiror Recommendation (as defined below) or take any action or
make any statement in connection with a Special Meeting of Acquiror
inconsistent with such approval or the Acquiror Recommendation (collectively,
a "Change in the Acquiror Recommendation").

5.5 _Current Information_. During the period from the date hereof to
the Effective Time, the parties will cause one or more of each of their
designated representatives to confer on a monthly or more frequent basis with
representatives of the other party regarding each of its business, results of
operations, prospects, assets and

 



42  financial condition and matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) in such conferences with representatives of Acquiror the
designated representative(s) of Seller and Seller Sub shall provide updates
with respect to loan charge-offs and sales of other real estate owned since
the last conference, (ii) within 10 days after the end of each calendar
month, Seller shall provide Acquiror with (A) an unaudited consolidated
balance sheet as of the end of such month, together with unaudited
consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders equity and cash
flows for the month and year-to-date period, and (B) a schedule of loans
charged-off during such month and other real estate owned sold during such
month. Within 30 days after the end of each fiscal quarter, Seller shall
provide Acquiror with a copy of the FDIC Call Report filed with the FDIC; in
addition, subject to applicable Laws (including relating to the exchange of
information), within five Business Days after filing Seller shall provide
Acquiror a copy of all reports, forms, correspondence, registrations and
statements, together with any amendments thereto, that Seller or Seller Sub
files during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time
with the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation, GDBF, the FDIC,
the FRB and any other federal or state Governmental Entity having
jurisdiction over Seller and/or Seller Sub, other than the Commission.

5.6  _Access to Properties and Records; Confidentiality_.

(a) Each of the parties shall permit the other party and its
representatives reasonable access to their properties and shall disclose and
make available to such party all books, papers and records relating to the
assets, properties, operations, obligations and liabilities of Seller and the
Subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, all books of account (including
the general ledger), tax records, minute books of directors and stockholders
meetings, organizational documents, bylaws, material contracts and agreements,
filings with any regulatory authority, litigation files, plans affecting
employees, and any other business activities in which Acquiror may have an
interest. Neither party shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of any customer or would contravene any Law, order or judgment. The
parties will use their best efforts to obtain waivers of any such restriction
and in any event make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. The
parties shall make their respective executive officers available to confer
with the other partys representatives, provided that such access shall be
reasonably related to the transactions contemplated hereby and not unduly
interfere with normal operations.

(b) All information furnished previously by the parties or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, or hereafter furnished prior to the Effective Time,
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or pursuant
hereto shall be treated as the sole property of the party furnishing the
information until consummation of the Mergers and, if the Mergers shall not
occur, the party receiving the information shall, at the request of the party
which furnished such information, either return to the party which
furnished such information or destroy all documents or other materials
containing, reflecting or referring to such information; shall use its best
efforts to keep confidential all such information; shall use such information
only for the purpose of consummating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and shall not directly or indirectly use such information for any
competitive or commercial purposes. The obligations of the parties to keep
such information confidential shall continue for three years (except for any
confidential customer information, which shall be kept confidential
indefinitely) from the date the Mergers are abandoned but shall not apply to
(i) any information which (A) was already in the possession of the party
receiving the information prior to the disclosure thereof to it by the party
furnishing the information; (B) was then generally known to the public; (C)
became known to the public through no fault of the party receiving
the information; or (D) was disclosed to the party receiving the information
by a third-party not known by the receiving party to be bound by an obligation
of confidentiality; or (ii) disclosures pursuant to a legal requirement or
in accordance with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction or any other
Governmental Entity with authority to compel disclosure.

5.7  _Regulatory Matters_.

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, and assist and cooperate with the
other parties in taking, all actions reasonably necessary, proper or

 



43  advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including obtaining any third-party consent
or waiver that may be required to be obtained in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and, to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (including actions required in order to effect the
Subsidiary Merger simultaneously with the Effective Time and to continue
any contract or agreement of Seller or Seller Sub following Closing or to
avoid any penalty or other fee under such contracts and agreements, in each
case arising in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby) and (ii)
obtain (and assist and cooperate with the other parties in obtaining) any
permit, consent, waiver, approval and authorization of, or any exemption by,
any Governmental Entity that is required or advisable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Mergers. The
parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and prepare and file, as
promptly as possible after the date hereof, all necessary documentation, and
effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as
promptly as practicable all permits, consents, waivers, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(b) Each of the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to resolve any
objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Such
consents and approvals and the transactions contemplated hereby shall not have
been contested by any Governmental Entity or any third party by formal
proceeding. It is understood that, if any such contest is brought by formal
proceeding, Acquiror and Seller may, but shall not be obligated to, answer and
defend such contest or otherwise pursue the Mergers and the transactions
contemplated hereby over such objection. Notwithstanding anything set forth
in this Agreement, under no circumstances shall a party be required, and
Seller and Seller Sub shall not be permitted (without Acquirors written
consent in its sole discretion), to take any action, or commit to take any
action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining
the foregoing permits, consents, waivers, approvals and authorizations, that
would have, or would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect or an Acquiror Material Adverse
Effect, as the case may be (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
determination by a Governmental Entity that the Subsidiary Merger may not be
consummated as contemplated herein, including simultaneously with the
Effective Time); _provided_ , that, if requested by Acquiror, then Seller and
Seller Sub will take or commit to take any such action, or agree to any such
condition or restriction, so long as such action, commitment, agreement,
condition or restriction is binding on Seller and Seller Sub only in the event
the Closing occurs.

 

(c) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
Acquiror and Seller shall, upon request, furnish each other with
all information concerning Acquiror, Seller, Acquiror Sub and Seller Sub and
their respective Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers and
stockholders, as applicable, and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary in connection with any statement, filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of Acquiror, Seller, Acquiror Sub and Seller Sub to any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

(d) Subject to applicable Laws (including those relating to the exchange of
information), Seller and Acquiror shall keep each other apprised of the status
of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject
to applicable Laws, the parties shall (i) promptly furnish each other with
copies of notices or other communications received by the other party (or
written summaries of communications received orally), from any third party or
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) provide the other party a reasonable opportunity to review in
advance, and accept the reasonable comments of the other party in connection
with, any proposed communication to, including any filings with or other
written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity, and (iii) consider in
good faith the other partys views with respect to, and confer in good faith
with the other party to resolve, any disagreement as to strategy with respect
to any communication by the other party with any Governmental Entity or third
party relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties
shall not, and shall cause their respective subsidiaries not to, participate
in any meeting or substantive discussion, either in person or by telephone,
with any Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed transactions

 



44  unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not
prohibited by applicable Laws, gives the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate. Any such disclosures or rights to participate may be made on
an outside counsel-only basis to the extent required under applicable Laws.

5.8 _Preparation of Registration Statement; Stockholder Approval_.

(a) The parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate to jointly prepare and file
with the Commission as promptly as practicable a proxy statement/prospectus
(the "Joint Proxy Statement") to be mailed to the stockholders of Seller and
Acquiror related to the Special Meetings and to be part of the Registration
Statement to be filed by Acquiror with the Commission pursuant to the 1933
Act with respect to the shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued in
connection with the Parent Merger. The parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective by the
SEC as promptly as practicable after its filing. The Joint Proxy Statement,
and any amendment thereto, shall include, subject to Section 5.3, the Seller
Recommendation and the Acquiror Recommendation. The parties shall notify each
other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the Commission or its staff
and of any request by the Commission or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or for
additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all
correspondence between such party or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the Commission or its staff, on the other hand, with respect
thereto. If, at any time prior to the Special Meetings, any event occurs with
respect to any party hereto, or any change occurs with respect to other
information supplied by a party for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement or
the Registration Statement, which is required to be described in an amendment
of, or a supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement, such party shall promptly notify the other party of such event, and
cooperate in the prompt filing with the Commission of any necessary amendment
or supplement thereto and, to the extent required by applicable Laws, in
disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the
stockholders of Seller and Acquiror. Acquiror will advise Seller promptly
after it receives notice thereof of the time when the Registration Statement
has become effective or any supplement or amendment thereto has been filed, of
the issuance of any stop order, of the suspension of the qualification of the
Acquiror Common Stock issuable in connection with the Parent Merger for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any
proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the
amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional
information. When the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment
thereto shall become effective, and at all times subsequent to such
effectiveness, up to and including the Effective Time, such
Registration Statement and all amendments or supplements thereto, with
respect to all information set forth therein furnished or to be furnished by
Acquiror and Acquiror Sub relating to Acquiror and Acquiror Sub and by Seller
and Seller Sub relating to Seller and or any of Sellers Subsidiaries, (i)
will comply in all material respects with the provisions of the 1933 Act and
the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and (ii) will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
contained therein not misleading.

 

(b) Each party shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5.3 (as it relates
to Seller) and this Section 5.8, (i) take all steps (including the
distribution of the Joint Proxy Statement) necessary to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its respective stockholders (including any
adjournments, the "Special Meeting(s)") as soon as reasonably practicable for
the purposes of securing the Seller Stockholder Approval and the Acquiror
Stockholder Approval, (ii) recommend to its stockholders the approval of this
Agreement, including the Parent Merger, and the transactions contemplated
hereby (as it relates to Seller, the "Seller Recommendation" and, as it
relates to Acquiror, the "Acquiror Recommendation"), and (iii) use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable, the Seller
Stockholder Approval and the Acquiror Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) Sellers board of directors may fail to hold such Special
Meeting of Seller or make a Change in the Seller Recommendation, if Sellers
board of directors, after having consulted with and considered the advice of
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, has determined in good faith
that the holding of such Special Meeting of Seller or the failure to make
such Change in the Seller Recommendation, would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and (ii) the board of
directors of

 



45  Acquiror may fail to hold such Special Meeting of Acquiror or make a Change
in the Acquiror Recommendation, if such board of directors, after having
consulted with and considered the advice of its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, has determined in good faith that the holding of such
Special Meeting of Acquiror or the failure to make such Change in the Acquiror
Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law. Promptly following approval of this Agreement by the
stockholders of Seller and Acquiror, Seller, as the sole stockholder of Seller
Sub, and Acquiror, as the sole stockholder of Acquiror Sub, each in
such capacity, will approve the Subsidiary Merger Document, whether at a
meeting or by written consent.

5.9 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable action and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to
satisfy the conditions to Closing contained herein and to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger
Documents.

 

5.10 _Disclosure Supplements_. Between the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, each party will supplement or amend its respective Disclosure
Schedules delivered pursuant hereto with respect to any matter hereafter
arising which, if existing, occurring or known as of the date hereof, would
have been required to be set forth or described in such Schedules or which
is necessary to correct any information in such Schedules which has been
rendered inaccurate thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the inclusion of
any information in any such amendment or supplement not included in the
original Disclosure Schedules which is necessary to correct any material
inaccuracy in such Schedules shall not limit or impair any right which a party
may have to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c) due to failure
to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.3(a), as
the case may be.

5.11 _Public Announcements_. Prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto
shall approve in advance the substance, and cooperate with each other in the
development and distribution, of all news releases and other public
disclosures with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except as may be otherwise required by Law and as to
which the parties releasing such information have used their reasonable
efforts to discuss with the other parties in advance.

 

5.12 _Termination Date_. In the event that either of the parties hereto
determines that one or more conditions to its respective obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby cannot be fulfilled on or
prior to September 30, 2015 and that such party will not waive such
condition(s), such party will promptly notify the other party. Acquiror (on
behalf of itself and Acquiror Sub) and Seller (on behalf of itself and Seller
Sub) will promptly inform the other of any facts applicable to them, or their
respective directors or officers, that would be likely to prevent or
materially delay unqualified approval of the Mergers by any Governmental
Entity or which would otherwise prevent or materially delay completion of such
Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

5.13 _Certain Post-Merger Agreements_.

 

The parties hereto agree to the following arrangements following the Effective
Time:

 

(a) _Employee Benefit Plans_.



     | (i) |

Subject to the provisions of this Section 5.13, Acquiror will either maintain
existing Seller benefit plans or shall offer coverage under applicable
Acquiror Plans to eligible employees of Seller or any of the Subsidiaries who
become employed by Acquiror, Acquiror Sub or any subsidiary or affiliate
thereof (as the case may be, "Employer") immediately following the Effective
Time ("Transferred Employees"). Following the Effective Time, Acquiror will
provide continuation coverage under Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601
of ERISA to all "qualified beneficiaries" (within the meaning of Code Section
4980(g)) who were entitled to such coverage under Sellers or any Subsidiarys
group health plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing,  

---|---|--- 
 



46 Transferred Employees in lieu of offering participation in the Acquiror Plans
providing similar benefits (e.g., medical and hospitalization benefits).
Alternatively, after the Effective Time, Employer may elect to terminate or
amend any of the Seller Plans or to merge any such benefit plans with the
Acquiror Plans. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Section
5.13 and/or as otherwise prohibited by Law, Acquiror shall provide credit to
any Transferred Employee for periods of service with Seller under the Acquiror
Plans for eligibility and vesting purposes, subject to applicable break-in-
service rules, and provided that such service shall not operate to duplicate
any benefit. Acquiror and Acquiror Sub agree that, to the extent waived,
satisfied or inapplicable to any Transferred Employee under the terms of any
group health, group term life insurance or long-term disability plan
maintained by Seller or any of the Subsidiaries at the Effective Time, any
preexisting condition or similar limitation or exclusion contained in an
Employers group health, long-term disability or group term life insurance
plans shall not apply to Transferred Employees or their covered dependents who
are covered under similar plans maintained by Seller or any of the
Subsidiaries at the Effective Time and who then change coverage to the
Employers group health, group term life insurance or long-term disability
plan at the time such Transferred Employees are first given the option to
enroll. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, after the Effective
Time, nothing herein shall restrict the ability of the Employer to amend or
terminate such Seller Plans in accordance with their terms. 
---|--- 



     | (ii) | Subject to Section 6.2(f), and except with respect to any
officer or employee of Seller or any of the Subsidiaries who does not execute
an assumption agreement as described in Section 5.24, as of the
Effective Time, Acquiror shall assume and honor and shall cause the
appropriate Employer to assume and honor in accordance with their terms all
employment agreements existing immediately prior to the Effective Time which
are between Seller or any of the Subsidiaries and any officer which have been
disclosed in _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.13(a)_. Nothing herein shall
prohibit Acquiror from amending or terminating such agreements in accordance
with their respective terms and conditions.  
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall have (A) adopted
resolutions of the Sellers board of directors to terminate its tax-qualified
defined benefit plan described in _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.8(a)_ ,
effective as of the Closing Date, provided that such termination shall be
contingent on the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(B) made a contribution as of or immediately prior to the Closing Date to
the Sellers tax-qualified defined benefit plan described in _Seller
Disclosure Schedule 3.8(a)_ in an amount to be mutually agreed upon by both
Seller and Acquiror, (C) adopted resolutions of the Sellers board of
directors to terminate its tax-qualified cash or deferred arrangement
described in _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.8(a)_ , effective as of the Closing
Date, and provided that such termination shall be contingent on the Closing of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (D) adopted resolutions
of the Sellers board of directors to terminate Sellers "account balance"
deferred compensation plan described in _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.8(a)_ ,
effective as of the Closing Date, and provided that such termination shall be
contingent on the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | No provision in this Agreement shall amend or modify or be
deemed to modify or amend any Seller Plan or any similar plan, policy,
arrangement or agreement maintained by Acquiror. Nothing contained herein
shall be deemed a guarantee of employment for any Transferred Employee or to
restrict the right of Acquiror, Acquiror Sub or affiliate thereof to terminate
the employment of any Transferred Employee or a guarantee of any type or
amount of compensation or benefits.  
---|---|--- 

(b) _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_. Acquiror shall indemnify and
hold harmless each present and former director and officer of Seller
(determined as of the Effective Time) and any of the Subsidiaries (determined
as of the effective time of the Subsidiary Merger) and their heirs, personal
representatives and estates (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties")
against, and shall promptly upon request advance or reimburse, any and all
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, interest,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or amounts paid in settlement
(collectively, "Costs") as they are incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, arbitrative or 

 



47  investigative ("Proceeding"), whether or not the Indemnified Party is a
party to such Proceeding, based upon or arising from the Indemnified Partys
acts or omissions as an officer or director of Seller and/or any of the
Subsidiaries, whether threatened, asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time (collectively, "Claims"), to the same extent as the
Indemnified Parties would have been indemnified under the articles of
incorporation and/or bylaws (or comparable organizational document) of Seller
as such documents were in effect on the date of this Agreement as if the
Indemnified Parties were officers or directors of Seller at all relevant
times except to the extent any Claim arises on account of an Indemnified
Partys service as an officer or director of another for-profit entity. This
indemnity shall be provided for six years following the Effective Time; or if
there shall be any Proceeding pending or threatened on the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Time, such indemnity shall continue in full force and effect
until such pending or threatened Proceeding is finally resolved.

 

The rights to indemnification granted by this Section 5.13(b) are subject to
the following limitations: (i) the total aggregate indemnification provided
by Acquiror pursuant to this Section 5.13(b) shall not exceed, as to all
Indemnified Parties as a group, a sum equal to the Indemnification Cap, and
Acquiror shall have no responsibility to the Indemnified Parties for the
manner in which such sum is allocated among that group; (ii) a director or
officer of Seller or any of the Subsidiaries (determined as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Effective Time) who would otherwise be a member
of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 5.13(b) shall not be entitled
to the benefits hereof unless such director or officer has executed a Joinder
Agreement in the form of _Schedule 5.13(b)_ hereto; and (iii) amounts
otherwise required to be paid by Acquiror to the Indemnified Parties pursuant
to this Section 5.13(b) shall be reduced by any amounts that such Indemnified
Parties recover from any third party. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Indemnification Cap" shall mean an amount equal to the sum of (y) $5,000,000
and (z) the policy limits of the insurance coverage obtained by Seller in
accordance with Section 5.13(c) below.

 

Acquiror agrees that the Indemnification Cap limit set forth in this Section
5.13(b) shall not apply to any damages, liabilities, judgments and claims
(and related expenses, including attorneys fees and amounts paid in
settlement) insofar as they arise out of or are based upon the matters for
which indemnification is provided in Section 5.19.

 

(c) _Insurance_. Seller shall obtain on or prior to the Effective Time a six-
year "tail" prepaid directors and officers liability insurance policy(ies)
covering each present and former director and officer of Seller and any of the
Subsidiaries as set forth in Section 5.13(b) at no cost to the beneficiaries
thereof with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred
prior to the Effective Time, in the same coverage amount as in effect under
Sellers directors and officers liability insurance policy(ies) (both
primary and excess) immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ ,
that if the aggregate premium Seller would be required to pay for such "tail"
policy(ies) is in excess of 300% of the premium for such coverage set forth in
_Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.14_ , then Seller shall purchase as much
coverage as is reasonably practicable for 300% of the premium set forth in
_Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.14_ , unless otherwise agreed in advance in
writing by Acquiror. Such policy shall survive the Mergers.

 

(d) _Subsequent Events_. In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of
its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all its
properties and assets to any entity, then, and in each such case, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successor and assign of the Surviving Corporation assumes the obligations set
forth in Sections 5.13(b) and (c). The provisions of Sections 5.13(b) and (c)
shall survive consummation of the Mergers and are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her legal representatives. This Section 5.13 may not be
amended, altered or repealed after the Effective Time without the prior
written consent of the affected Indemnified Party.

5.14 _Takeover Laws; No Rights Triggered_. If any Takeover Law may become, or
may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of
the parties and the members of their respective

 



48  Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Law on any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

5.15 _Adoption of Accounting Policies_. As soon as practicable after the
satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the Closing set forth in Article
VI and at such time as consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement seems reasonably assured and in any event prior to the Effective
Time (unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VII), Seller
and Seller Sub shall take any and all necessary or appropriate actions to
adopt all Acquiror accounting procedures and policies (including those
policies pertaining to charged-off and non-accrual assets); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such action taken by Seller or Seller Sub at the request
of Acquiror pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be, or be deemed to
cause, a breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller or Seller Sub
herein.

 

5.16 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, if Seller provides
Acquiror the Section 16 Information reasonably in advance of the Effective
Time, the parties will each take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Seller Common Stock or
conversion of any derivative securities in respect of shares of Seller Common
Stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act.
"Section 16 Information" shall mean information accurate in all respects
regarding Seller Insiders, the number of shares of Seller Common Stock held by
each such Seller Insider and the number and description of the Seller Stock
Options held by each such Seller Insider. "Seller Insiders" shall mean those
officers and directors of Seller who are subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act.

5.17  _Operating Functions_. Seller and Seller Sub shall cooperate with
Acquiror and Acquiror Sub in connection with planning for the efficient and
orderly combination of the parties and the operation of the Subsidiary
Surviving Bank after the Subsidiary Merger, and in preparing for the
consolidation of appropriate operating functions to be effective on the
Closing Date or such later date as Acquiror may decide. Seller shall take, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its data processing
consultants and software providers to take, any action Acquiror may reasonably
request prior to the Effective Time to facilitate the combination of the
operations of Seller Sub with Acquiror Sub. Without limiting the
foregoing, Seller shall provide office space and support services (and other
reasonably requested support and assistance) in connection with the foregoing,
and senior officers of Seller and Acquiror shall meet from time to time as
Seller or Acquiror may reasonably request, to review the financial and
operational affairs of Seller and Seller Sub, and Seller shall give due
consideration to Acquirors input on such matters, with the understanding
that, notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, (i)
neither Acquiror nor Acquiror Sub shall under any circumstance be permitted to
exercise control of Seller, Seller Sub or any of Sellers other Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be under any obligation to act in a manner that could reasonably be
deemed to constitute anti-competitive behavior under federal or state
antitrust laws and (iii) neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to agree to any material obligation that is not contingent upon the
consummation of the Merger.

5.18  _Certain Agreements_. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof
(but no later than ten days following the date of this Agreement), Seller and
Seller Sub shall have each director of Seller and Seller Sub who is not an
employee of Seller or Seller Sub, respectively, execute a Lock-Up and Non-
Competition Agreement in substantially the form of _Schedule 5.18-A_ hereto
and have each executive officer of Seller and Seller Sub who is also a
director of Seller or Seller Sub, respectively, execute a Lock-Up Agreement
in substantially the form of _Schedule 5.18-B_ hereto.

5.19 _Hold Harmless_. Acquiror will indemnify and hold harmless Seller,
Seller Sub, each of the directors and officers and each person, if any, who
controls Seller or Seller Sub within the meaning of the 1933 Act against any
losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint, several and solidary, to which
they or any of them may become

 



49  subject, under the 1933 Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are
based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in the Registration Statement, or in any amendment or supplement
thereto, or arising out of or based upon the omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, and will pay or promptly reimburse
such person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such person
in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror shall not be liable in any such case to
the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or actions in
respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the
Registration Statement or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon
and in conformity with information furnished to Acquiror by Seller or Seller
Sub for use therein. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder
of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if
a claim in respect thereof is to be made against Acquiror under this Section
5.19, notify Acquiror in writing of the commencement thereof. In case any
such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify
Acquiror of the commencement thereof, Acquiror shall be entitled to
participate therein; and to the extent that it shall wish to assume the
defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party, and,
after notice from Acquiror to such indemnified party of its election to so
assume the defense thereof, Acquiror shall not be liable to such indemnified
party under this Section 5.19 for any legal expenses of other counsel or of
any other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party; _provided_
, that except that if Acquiror elects not to assume such defense or counsel
for the indemnified parties advises that there are substantive issues which
raise conflicts of interest between Acquiror and the indemnified parties, the
indemnified parties may retain one counsel satisfactory to them, and Acquiror
shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for such
indemnified parties promptly as statements therefor are received.

5.20 _Stockholder Litigation_. Seller shall provide Acquiror the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation
against Seller and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement throughout the course of any such litigation, and Acquiror
shall in good faith consider the recommendations by Seller regarding such
litigation. Seller shall not settle any stockholder litigation without
Acquirors prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

5.21 _Stock Exchange De-listing; 1934 Act De-registration_. Seller shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, such actions prior
to the Effective Time of the Parent Merger to reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of from the
Nasdaq Global Select Market to enable Sellers shares of common stock to be
de-listed from the Nasdaq Global Select Market and de-registered under the
1934 Act as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

 

5.22 _Notice to Holders of Seller Stock Options_. Prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall notify each holder of a Seller Stock Option, other than those
individuals listed in Section 6.2(g), regarding the cancellation and payment
of the Seller Stock Options as provided in Section 2.6(a) and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to receive a written acknowledgement of receipt
thereof.

5.23 _Payment of 2014 Bonuses_. Seller will pay any bonus of any kind or
amount for calendar year 2014 payable to O. Leonard Dorminey and Carol
Slappey prior to December 31, 2014.

5.24 _Assumption Agreements_. Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain prior to the Closing Date from each officer or employee designated by
Acquiror and who is a party to an employment agreement with Seller or any of
the Subsidiaries and other officer or employee disclosed on
_Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.13(a)_ , other than O. Leonard Dorminey, Carol
Slappey, T. Heath Fountain and O. Mitchell Smith, an assumption agreement, in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Seller and Acquiror, executed by
such officer or employee.

7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Mergers may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding approval
thereof by the stockholders of Seller or Acquiror:

(a) by mutual written consent of each of Seller and Acquiror; 

(b) by either Acquiror (on behalf of itself and Acquiror Sub) or Seller (on
behalf of itself and Seller Sub):

 

(i) (A) if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or prior to September

pursuant to Section 6.1(a) is pending and has not been finally resolved or any
stockholder litigation referenced in Section 5.20 has not been resolved (by
dismissal, settlement or otherwise), in which event such date shall be
automatically extended to December 31, 2015; or (B) if a vote of the
stockholders of Seller or Acquiror is taken and either Acquiror fails to
obtain the Acquiror Stockholder Approval or Seller fails to obtain the Seller
Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , that, neither party shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(i) if the failure of
such occurrence shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement to perform or observe its agreements set forth herein to be
performed or observed by such party at or before the Effective Time or such
vote, as the case may be;

 

(ii) upon written notice to the other party (A) (x) 30 or more days after the
date upon which any application for a regulatory or governmental approval

the applicable Governmental Entity, unless within such 30-day period a
petition for rehearing or an amended application is filed or noticed, or (y)
30 or more days after any petition for rehearing or amended application filed
pursuant to clause (A)(x) is denied; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party
hereto shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1(b)(ii) if such denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal
shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth
herein; and in each case the time period for appeals and requests for
reconsideration has run; or (B) if any Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a final non-appealable order enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(c) by Acquiror (on behalf of itself and Acquiror Sub) in writing if Seller or
Seller Sub has, or by Seller (on behalf of itself and Seller Sub) in writing
if Acquiror or Acquiror Sub has, breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties covenants or undertakings contained herein, which
breach or failure to perform

 



53  would result in the failure to satisfy the closing conditions set forth in
Section 6.2(a) or 6.3(a), as the case may be, and cannot be or has not been
cured within 30 days after the giving of written notice of such breach to the
non-terminating party;

Change in the Acquiror Recommendation, or (iii) failed to call or convene the
Special Meeting of Acquiror in accordance with Section 5.8.

 

7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VII, no party to this Agreement shall have any liability
or further obligation hereunder to the other party hereto, except that this
Section 7.2, Section 5.6(b), Section 7.4 and Article VIII shall survive any
termination of this Agreement and termination will not relieve a breaching
party from liability for any willful breach of any covenant, undertaking,
representation or warranty in this Agreement giving rise to such termination.

 

7.3 _Amendment, Extension and Waiver_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, at any time prior to the consummation of the
Parent Merger, whether before or after approval thereof by the stockholders
of Seller or Acquiror, as the case may be, the parties may (i) amend this
Agreement; (ii) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties hereto; (iii) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto; or (iv) waive compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions contained herein (other than required stockholder and
regulatory approval); _provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval of the
Parent Merger by the stockholders of Seller and Acquiror, there may not be,
without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment or waiver of this
Agreement that requires further stockholder approval under applicable Law.

(b) This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party and which has
been authorized by or under the direction of its board of directors; but such
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with such obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other matter.

7.4 _Termination Fees_.

 

(a) In the event that (A) a Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal Event (as
defined below) shall occur after the date of this Agreement and thereafter
this Agreement is terminated by either Acquiror or Seller pursuant to Section
7.1(b)(i)(B) or by Acquiror pursuant to Section 7.1(c) as a result of a
willful breach by Seller or Seller Sub and (B) prior to the date that is 12
months after the date of such termination Seller consummates an Acquisition
Proposal with the party that caused rise to the Pre-Termination Takeover
Proposal Event, then Seller shall, on the date such Acquisition Proposal is
consummated, pay Acquiror a fee equal to the sum of (i) $10,300,000 plus (ii)
all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Acquiror in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including legal,
accounting, investment banking, travel and printing expenses up to $750,000
(collectively, the "Termination Fee"). The Termination Fee shall be paid by
wire transfer of same-day funds.

 



54 (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Acquiror pursuant to
Section 7.1(d) or by Seller pursuant to Section 7.1(e), then concurrently
with such termination, Seller shall pay to Acquiror the Termination Fee by
wire transfer of same-day funds, and such termination shall not be deemed
effective hereunder until payment by Seller of such fee. In no event shall
Seller be required to pay the Termination Fee under both this Section 7.4(b)
and Section 7.4(a).

 

(c) For purposes of this Section 7.4, a "Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal
Event" shall be deemed to occur if, prior to the event giving rise to the
right to terminate this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
made known to the senior management or board of directors of Seller or shall
have been made directly to its stockholders generally, or any
person reasonably qualified to consummate an Acquisition Proposal shall have
publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an
Acquisition Proposal, and such Acquisition Proposal or public announcement
shall not have been irrevocably withdrawn not less than five Business Days

approve this Agreement at such meeting (with respect to a termination pursuant
to Section 7.1(b)(i)(B)) or the date of termination (with respect to a
termination pursuant to Section 7.1(c).

(e) Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.4
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, each party would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Seller fails to pay promptly the Termination
Fee pursuant to this Section 7.4 and, in order to obtain such payment, the
other party commences a suit which results in a judgment against the other for
the fee set forth in this Section 7.4, the non-successful party shall pay to
the other party its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amount of the fee at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate published in
_The Wall Street Journal_ on the date such payment was required to be made,
plus 300 basis points.

(f) The parties agree that the payment of the Termination Fee shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy available to Acquiror and Acquiror Sub with respect
to this Agreement in the event any such payment becomes due and payable and is
paid, and, upon payment of the Termination Fee, Seller and Seller Sub (and
Sellers and Seller Subs affiliates and its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, stockholders and representatives) shall have no further
liability to Acquiror and Acquiror Sub under this Agreement;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller and Seller Sub shall not be relieved or released from
any liabilities or damages arising out of their willful and material breach of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the aggregate amount of any
damages determined by a court to be payable by Seller and Seller Sub pursuant
to the foregoing proviso shall be reduced by the amount of any Termination Fee
previously paid to Acquiror pursuant to this Section 7.4.

counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
each of which shall be deemed an original. Delivery of a copy of this
Agreement bearing an original signature by facsimile transmission or by

8.7 _Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Mississippi,
without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

(b) Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in respect
of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in any federal or state court sitting in the
State of Mississippi, and, solely in connection with claims arising under this
Agreement or the Mergers that are the subject of this Agreement, (i)
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such Mississippi courts,
(ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in
the Mississippi courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Mississippi
courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party
and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action or
proceeding will be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section
8.3.

(c) Each party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise
under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues,
and therefore each such party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law at the time of institution of the
applicable litigation, any right such party may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party
certifies and acknowledges that: (i) no representative, agent or attorney of
any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver;
(ii) it understands and has considered the implications of this waiver; (iii)
it makes this waiver voluntarily; and (iv) it has been induced to enter into
this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications
in this Section 8.7.

 

8.8 _Interpretation_. For the purposes of this Agreement, (i) words in the
singular shall be held to include the plural and vice versa and words of one
gender shall be held to include the other gender as the context requires, (ii)
the terms "hereof," "herein," and "herewith" and words of similar import
shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a
whole (including all of the Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits to this
Agreement) and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and Article,
Section, Disclosure Schedule and Exhibit references are to the Articles,
Sections, Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement unless otherwise
specified, (iii) whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation," (iv) the word "or" shall not be exclusive and (v) all
references to any period of days shall be deemed to be to the relevant number
of calendar days unless otherwise specified. This Agreement shall not be
interpreted or construed to require any person or entity to take any action,
or fail to take any action, if to do so would violate applicable Law.

 

The parties intend that each representation, warranty and covenant contained
herein shall have independent significance. If any party has breached any
representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein in any respect, the
fact that there exists another representation, warranty or covenant relating
to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity)
that the party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact
that the party is in breach of the first representation, warranty or covenant.
Further, it is understood and agreed that the specification of any dollar
amount in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or
the inclusion of any specific item in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the
Acquiror Disclosure Schedule is not intended to imply that such amounts or
higher or lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are
not material, and neither party shall use the fact of the setting of such
amounts or the fact of the

 



57  inclusion of any such item in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Acquiror
Disclosure Schedule in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described in this Agreement or
included in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Acquiror Disclosure Schedule
is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.

 

8.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that, subject to Section 7.4(f), the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. The parties agree to waive any requirements for
the securing or posting of any bond in connection with any remedy described
in this Section 8.9 (except to the extent required by Law).

8.10  _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

8.11 _Alternative Structure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, before the Effective Time, Acquiror may elect to
forgo the consummation of the Subsidiary Merger at its discretion; _provided_
that Acquiror may only elect to do so if such election will not have any
impact on the conditions to the consummation of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as set forth in Article VI or will not
otherwise delay the Closing. This Agreement and any related documents will
be appropriately amended in order to reflect any revised structure as
contemplated by this Section 8.11.

Law, as amended (the "MGCL"). Acquiror shall be the Surviving Corporation in

ARTICLE III

 

CONVERSION OF SHARES

3.1 CONVERSION OF SHARES. At the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror, Seller or the
holders of any of the following securities:

 

(a) Each share of Acquiror Common Stock (as defined below) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding after the Effective Time and shall be unaffected by the Merger.

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 3.1, each share of Seller
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any shares of Seller Common Stock to be canceled in accordance
with Section 3.1(e)) shall, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 3.1(d),
be converted automatically into and thereafter represent the right to receive
the number of shares (or a fraction thereof) of Acquiror Common Stock, rounded
to the nearest four decimals, equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Merger
Consideration"). As used in this Plan of Merger, the term "Acquiror Common
Stock" means the common stock, $5.00 par value per share, of Acquiror, and the
term "Exchange Ratio" means 0.9266.

(c) Certificates previously evidencing shares of Seller Common Stock shall be
exchanged for certificates evidencing the Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, no fractional shares of Acquiror
Common Stock shall be issued, and, in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be
made pursuant to Section 3.1(f).

 

(d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Plan of Merger
and the Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of
capital stock of Acquiror or Seller, respectively, shall occur (or for which
the relevant record date will occur) as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or other
subdivision, combination or readjustment of shares, or as a result of any
stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period,
the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted, if
necessary and without duplication, to reflect such change.

(e) Each share of Seller Common Stock held in the treasury of Seller and each
share of Seller Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective
Time that is owned by Acquiror or any subsidiary of Acquiror or Seller (other
than shares held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the
like or otherwise in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously
contracted) shall automatically be cancelled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof and no Merger Consideration or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor. (f) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Acquiror Common
Stock will be issued as a result of the Merger. In lieu of the issuance of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.1(b), cash adjustments (without
interest) will be paid to the holder of Seller Common Stock in respect of any
fraction of a share of Acquiror Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable
to such holder of Seller Common Stock, and the amount of such cash adjustment
shall be determined by multiplying (x) the fraction of a share of Acquiror
Common Stock otherwise issuable by (y) the weighted average of the closing
sales prices of one share of Acquiror Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq
Global Select Market for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the trading
day immediately prior to the Closing Date. No such holder shall be entitled
to dividends, voting rights or any other right of stockholders in respect of
any fractional share.

3.2 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES FOR STOCK. After the Effective Time, each holder
of a certificate previously representing outstanding shares of Seller Common
Stock shall surrender and exchange such certificates for the Merger
Consideration in the manner provided in Section 2.2 of the Merger Agreement.

ARTICLE IV

permitted to do so, of the conditions set forth in Article VI of the Merger
Agreement.

further act or deed of either of the parties in the event of the termination

WHEREAS, in consideration of the agreements made by Heritage in connection
with the Merger Agreement, Acquiror has agreed to indemnify the Heritage
Official under certain circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of Acquirors agreement to indemnify the
Heritage Official and the expenses and costs that may be incurred by Acquiror
in connection with such indemnification, the Heritage Official hereby agrees
as follows:

 

1\. _Assumption of and Cooperation in Defense_.

 

1.1 _Notice and Assumption of Defense_. In the event a claim arises for which
indemnification is or may be sought by the Heritage Official, the Heritage
Official shall promptly notify Acquiror, in writing at the address set forth
in Section 3 hereof, of the commencement of such legal action or existence of
and facts relating to such claim. Upon receipt of such notice, or at any time
thereafter, Acquiror shall be entitled to participate therein and, in its sole
discretion, to assume the defense of such claim, with counsel of its choice,
subject to the reasonable approval of the Heritage Official, and to consider
and decide on any proposed settlement, subject to the reasonable approval of
the Heritage Official. In any and all events, Acquiror shall have the right to
reasonable control over the nature and extent of expenses incurred in
connection with such claim(s). Acquiror shall notify the Heritage Official of
its assumption of the defense of such claim; and after such notice from
Acquiror to the Heritage Official, Acquiror shall not be liable to the
Heritage Official for indemnification under Section 5.13(b) of the Merger
Agreement for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses of
defense subsequently incurred by such indemnified party.

 

1.2 _Cooperation in Defense_. The Heritage Official agrees to cooperate in the
defense of any action for which indemnification is sought under Section
5.13(b) of the Merger Agreement. Such cooperation shall include, but not be
limited to, providing Acquiror and its counsel copies of any and all relevant
documents relating to the claim, consulting with Acquiror and its
counsel with regard to the claim, providing testimony, either in deposition
or at trial or both, regarding the facts relating to the claim, making himself
available at reasonable times for consultation, testimony and fact-finding and
otherwise furnishing such information to Acquiror and its counsel as the
Heritage Official would provide to his own counsel in the event he were
defending the action himself. Except as expressly permitted by Acquiror, the
Heritage Official shall not object to the production or use of any documents
heretofore prepared by or of information provided to Acquiror legal counsel on
the basis of any claim of privilege that is available only to Heritage or
Acquiror; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror agrees that it will not,
without the consent of the Heritage Official, waive any applicable privilege
of the Heritage Official. Such cooperation shall be provided regardless of
whether Acquiror assumes the defense of the action.

 



Schedule 5.13(b) - Page 1  2\. _Duplication of Payment; Limitations; Presumptions_.

 

2.1 _No Duplication of Payments_. Acquiror shall not be liable under this
Agreement to make any payment in connection with any claim against the
Heritage Official to the extent the Heritage Official has otherwise actually
received payment (under any insurance policy, certificate of incorporation,
bylaw provision or otherwise) of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.

 

2.2 _Limitation on Liability_. The Heritage Official hereby expressly
acknowledges and agrees that Acquiror shall not be liable in the aggregate
for more than the Indemnification Cap (as defined in the Merger Agreement) in
connection with its obligations under Section 5.13(b) of the Merger Agreement.
The Heritage Official further acknowledges and agrees that he shall have
no claim against Acquiror for any amount that, when aggregated with
indemnification amounts paid by Acquiror to other Heritage Officials that
would be subject to the Indemnification Cap as provided in the Merger
Agreement (the "Capped Amount"), exceeds the Indemnification Cap. Any claim
for reallocation of the amounts paid by Acquiror among Heritage Officials
shall be made against the other Heritage Official(s) involved, and Acquiror
shall not be liable in any way for the allocation of such Capped Amount among
Heritage Officials.

2.3 _No Presumption_. For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any
claim, action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement (whether with
or without court approval) shall not of itself create a presumption that the
Heritage Official did or did not meet any particular standard of conduct or
have any particular belief or that a court has determined that
indemnification is not permitted by applicable law.

3\. _Notices_. All notices or other communications which are required or
permitted hereunder shall be delivered in accordance with Section 8.3 of the
Merger Agreement, at the addresses listed below:

LOCK-UP AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT

 



Schedule 5.18-A - Page 1  LOCK-UP AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT

 

This Lock-Up and Non-Competition Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and
executed as of the  day of , 201 , between
Renasant Corporation, a Mississippi corporation ("Acquiror"), and the
undersigned non-employee director ("Heritage Official") of Heritage Financial
Group, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Heritage"), or HeritageBank of the
South, a Georgia savings bank ("HeritageBank").

Acquiror, Renasant Bank, a Mississippi banking association ("Acquiror Bank"),
Heritage and HeritageBank have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the "Plan of Merger"), pursuant to which the parties thereto agree that (i)
Heritage will merge with and into Acquiror (the "Merger"), and Acquiror shall
be the surviving entity of the Merger, and (ii) HeritageBank will merge with
and into Acquiror Bank (the "Bank Merger"), and Acquiror Bank shall be
the surviving entity of the Bank Merger. In consideration of the expenses
that Acquiror will incur in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Plan of Merger, and in order to preserve the value of the franchise to be
purchased by Acquiror and induce Acquiror to proceed to incur such expenses,
the Heritage Official makes the following agreements in favor of Acquiror:

1\. _Undertakings of Heritage Official_.

1.1 The Heritage Official agrees and undertakes during the term of this
Agreement to vote or cause to be voted in favor of the Plan of Merger all
shares of common stock of Heritage, $0.01 par value per share (the "Heritage
Stock"), as to which he has voting power (other than shares held in a
fiduciary capacity), which amount of shares is shown on the schedule attached
hereto and made a part hereof (the "Shares"), at any meeting or meetings of
the stockholders of Heritage at which such matters are considered (including
any and all adjournments thereof). The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that nothing in this section or this Agreement is intended to dictate or
require that the Heritage Official vote as a director in any manner, and
nothing in this Agreement: (i) will limit or affect any actions or
omissions taken by the Heritage Official as such a director, including in
exercising rights under the Plan of Merger, and no such actions or omissions
shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement or (ii) will be construed to
prohibit, limit or restrict the Heritage Official from exercising Heritage
Officials fiduciary duties as a director of Heritage.

1.2 The Heritage Official further agrees that during the term of this
Agreement, he will not transfer any of the Shares , except (i) for transfers
by operation of law and (ii) for transfers in connection with which Acquiror
has consented to the transfer and the transferee shall agree in writing with
Acquiror to be bound by this Agreement as fully as the undersigned.

1.3 This Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the
Effective Time and (ii) the date on which the Plan of Merger terminates in
accordance with its terms.

2.  _Noncompetition Obligations of Heritage Official_.

2.1 Heritage Official will not:

 

(a) directly or indirectly, for himself or in affiliation with any business or
entity in which he owns an equity or financial interest (except as to not
more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of any corporation, the
securities of which are regularly traded on a nationally recognized securities
exchange or over-the-counter market), carry on or engage in any
Competitive Business (as hereinafter defined) within the Restricted Area (as
hereinafter defined); or

(b) directly or indirectly, in affiliation with any individual or any
business or entity not covered by (a) above, whether as a partner, employee,
contractor, consultant or otherwise, carry on or engage in any Competitive
Business in the Restricted Area; or

 



Schedule 5.18-A - Page 2  (c) directly or indirectly, solicit or cause to be solicited any customers of
Acquiror or Acquiror Bank, with respect to any Competitive Business in the
Restricted Area; or

(d) directly or indirectly, solicit or cause to be solicited any employees,
contractors or agents of Acquiror or Acquiror Bank to terminate their
employment, contract or relationship with Acquiror or Acquiror Bank.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Restricted Area" shall mean the
State of Georgia, and the term "Competitive Business" shall mean the business
of banking, including, without limitation, checking and savings accounts,
business and personal loans, interim construction and residential loans,
student loans, automated tellers machines, internet banking services and
accounts receivable financing. For the avoidance of doubt, "Competitive
Business" shall exclude equipment leasing, insurance agency services,
insurance services, trust services and investment advisory services, any
entity in which the Heritage Official has an ownership interest in on the
date of this Agreement and engaging in those businesses, activities or
ventures set forth on Schedule A.

 

2.2. The noncompetition obligations set forth in Section 2.1 shall extend
until the second anniversary of the Closing (as defined in the Plan of
Merger) (the "Restricted Period").

2.3. Acquiror and the Heritage Official agree that the foregoing
restrictions are reasonable under the circumstances and that any breach of
the covenants contained in this Section 2 would cause irreparable injury to
Acquiror. The Heritage Official understands that the foregoing restrictions
may limit the Heritage Officials ability to engage in certain businesses
during the period provided for above in the Restricted Area, but acknowledges
that the Heritage Official will receive sufficient remuneration and other
benefits under the Plan of Merger to justify such restriction. Further, the
Heritage Official acknowledges that his skills are such that he can be
gainfully employed in non-competitive employment, and that the agreement not
to compete will in no way prevent him from earning a living. If any of the
aforesaid restrictions are found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
unreasonable, or overly broad as to geographic area or time, or otherwise
unenforceable, the parties intend for the restrictions therein set forth to
be modified by the court making such determination so as to be reasonable and
enforceable and, as so modified, to be fully enforced. By agreeing to this
contractual modification prospectively at this time, the parties intend to
make this provision enforceable under the laws of Mississippi in the
Restricted Area so that the entire agreement not to compete and this Agreement
as prospectively modified shall remain in full force and effect and shall not
be rendered void or illegal.

 

3\. _Miscellaneous_.

3.1 The Heritage Official acknowledges that money damages would not be an
adequate remedy for any breach of this Agreement by the Heritage Official, and
Acquiror shall be entitled to seek to enforce the provisions of this Agreement
by specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for such breach or
any threatened breach, without any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond or giving any other undertaking (except to the extent required by
law). Such remedies shall not be deemed the exclusive remedies for a breach
of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all remedies available at law
or in equity to Acquiror, including, without limitation, the recovery of
damages from the Heritage Official and his or her agents involved in such
breach.

3.2 The Heritage Official acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement is
executed in connection with the sale of all of the business of Heritage. The
Heritage Official further acknowledges and represents that the provisions of
this Agreement will not work a hardship on him and will not prevent him from
engaging in his occupation.

 

3.3 To the extent permitted under applicable law, any provision of this
Agreement may be amended or modified at any time, either before or after its
approval by an agreement in writing among the parties hereto.

3.4 This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed to constitute an original. Each such counterpart shall become effective
when one counterpart has been signed by each party hereto.

 



Schedule 5.18-A - Page 3  3.5 This Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Mississippi applicable to agreements made and
entirely to be performed within such State, except as federal law may be
applicable.

 

3.6 The Heritage Official may not assign any of his rights or obligations
under this Agreement to any other person.

 

3.7 This Agreement supersedes any and all oral or written agreements and
understandings heretofore made between the parties hereto relating to the
subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement of the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement does not modify or amend any
stock option agreement, employment agreement, option or similar employee
benefit agreement between Heritage or an affiliate of Heritage and the
Heritage Official. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall inure to
the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
successors, heirs and legatees.

3.8 In the event that any party institutes any legal suit, action
or proceeding against the other party to enforce the covenants contained in
this Agreement (or obtain any other remedy in respect of any breach of this
Agreement), the prevailing party in the suit, action or proceeding shall be
entitled to receive in addition to all other damages to which it may be
entitled, the costs incurred by such party in conducting the suit, action or
proceeding, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and court costs.

 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have signed this Agreement effective as of the
date first set forth above.

the State of Maryland (the " _Company_ "), and is intended to amend, restate,
and replace, in its entirety, that certain Executive Employment Agreement by
and between the Company, Heritagebank of the South (the " _Bank_ "), and
Executive, initially effective as of March 16, 2005, and most recently amended
as of November 30, 2010, and as extended from time to time (the " _Prior

Agreement_ "). This Agreement shall be effective as of the close of business
on the business day preceding the Effective Time, as defined in the Merger

As of the Effective Time, Executive agrees that, to the extent not
expressly provided herein, all rights and benefits provided under the Prior
Agreement shall be deemed extinguished and cancelled in their entirety.
Executive agrees that nothing contained in this Agreement and no payment or
benefit made outside of this Agreement is intended to constitute a
"substitution," within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), for any right or benefit provided
under the Prior Agreement that has been extinguished and cancelled hereunder,
and that this Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in a manner
consistent with such intent.

duties and responsibilities shall be those assigned to him hereunder, from

materially damaging to the business of the Company, which, if capable of being
cured, is not cured by the Executive within 30 days following his receipt of
written notice thereof (it being understood, however, that neither conduct

unintentional physical damage to any property of the Company by Executive
shall be a ground for such a determination); (iii) has been removed and/or
permanently prohibited from participating in the conduct of the Banks affairs
by an order issued under Section 8(e)(4) or (g)(1) of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 1818(e)(4) and (g)(1); or (iv) failed,

hereunder terminates for any reason.

 

4.2 Executives Termination. Executive may terminate his employment hereunder

c. An amount equal to the average of the last three annual Incentive Bonuses
paid to Executive prior to the Termination Date; such amount to be paid

paid or provided for the four-year period following his Termination Date.

provide written notice to Executive, including a description of the specific
reasons for the determination of Cause. Executive shall have the opportunity
to appear before the Board or committee, with or without legal representation,
to present arguments and evidence on his behalf. Following such presentation,
or upon Executives failure to appear, the Board or the committee as the case
may be, by an affirmative vote of a majority of its members, shall confirm
that the actions or inactions of Executive constitute Cause hereunder.
In such event, the Company shall pay to Executive his Accrued Benefits and
shall have no further obligations hereunder.

Employment Term, Executives employment hereunder shall cease, this Agreement

Company, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

the fouryear period thereafter.

 

5.3 Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition. Executive shall not, directly or
indirectly: (a) provide banking or bank-related services to, or solicit the

association, agent or agency, engage in any banking or bank-related business
or venture which competes with the business of the Protected Entities as
conducted during the Employment Term within a radius of 50 miles of the main
office of the Bank. For this purpose:

a. The covenant contained herein shall be applicable during the Employment
Term and, if Executive is involuntarily terminated on account of Cause, during

benefit otherwise due under Section 4 hereof, _except_ Executives Accrued

above and any Confidential Information or Trade Secret that is in the
possession or under the control of Executive, regardless of the form in which
it is maintained.

 

5.5 Reformation. The parties agree that each of the prohibitions set forth
herein is intended to constitute a separate restriction. Accordingly, should
any such prohibition be declared invalid or unenforceable, such prohibition
shall be deemed severable from and shall not affect the remainder thereof. The
parties further agree that each of the foregoing restrictions is reasonable
in both time and geographic scope. If and to the extent a court of competent
jurisdiction or an arbitrator, as the case may be, determines that any of the
restrictions or covenants set forth in this Agreement are unreasonable, then
it is the intention of the parties that such restrictions be enforced to the
fullest extent that such court or arbitrator deems reasonable and that this
Agreement shall be reformed to the extent necessary to permit such
enforcement.

 

5.6 Remedies. In the event of a breach or threatened breach by Executive of
the provisions of Section 5 hereof, Executive agrees that the Company shall
be entitled to a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction
(without the necessity of posting bond in connection therewith). Nothing
herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from pursuing any
other remedy available to it for such breach or threatened breach, whether in
law or equity, including the recovery of damages from Executive.

 



Schedule 6.2(f)-A - Page 6 6\. Miscellaneous:

 

6.1 Mitigation Not Required. As a condition of any payment hereunder,
Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of such payment by
seeking other employment, nor will any profits, income, earnings or other
benefits from any source whatsoever create any mitigation, offset, reduction
or any other obligation on the part of Executive under this Agreement.

 

6.2 Excess Parachute Payments. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary if the aggregate of all payments and benefits to Executive
hereunder, including any payment or benefit provided to Executive under a
separate plan or arrangement (collectively, the " _Aggregate Payments_ ")
would result in any payment being deemed to constitute a "parachute payment"
within the meaning of Code Section 280G, such payments shall be reduced to the
minimum extent necessary (but in no event to less than zero) so that no
portion of such payments and benefits, as so reduced, is deemed to constitute
an excess parachute payment; _provided that_ the amount of such reduction
shall be less than $100,000. If the amount such reduction would equal or
exceed $100,000, then no such reduction shall occur, the Executive shall
be entitled to all such Aggregate Payments, and the Company shall pay to
Executive a Gross-Up Payment. For this purpose:

a. The " _Gross-Up Payment_ " shall mean an amount that is sufficient to pay,
in its entirety, any excise tax imposed on the Aggregate Payments (including
the Gross-Up Payment) pursuant to Code Section 4999, or any successor
provision thereto, any tax imposed by any comparable provision of state law,
and any applicable federal, state, or local income tax.

b. The determination of whether any reduction in the Aggregate Payments is
required and the amount of such reduction and amount of the Gross-Up Payment,
if any, shall be made at the expense of the Company and by the Companys
independent accountants or another independent accountant agreed upon by
Executive and the Company.

c. In the event that any portion of the Aggregate Payments is required to be
reduced hereunder, then the reduction shall occur in the following order: (i)
reduction of Continuing Perquisite Amount described in Section 4.1d; (ii)
reduction of continued Incentive Bonus payments described in Section 4.1c;
and (iii) reduction of continued Base Compensation payments described in
Section 4.1b. Within any of the foregoing categories, a reduction shall occur
first with respect to amounts that are not deemed to constitute a "deferral
of compensation" within the meaning of and subject to Code Section 409A ("
_Nonqualified Deferred Compensation_ ") and then with respect to amounts that
are treated as Nonqualified Deferred Compensation, with such reduction being
applied in each case to the payments in the reverse order in which they would
otherwise be made, that is, later payments shall be reduced before earlier
payments.

 

d. If the Company is obligated to make a Gross-Up Payment hereunder, it will
be paid to Executive, or remitted by the Company to the appropriate tax
authorities to the extent subject to withholding, in the form of a single-sum
payment on the date that the excise tax is due (through withholding or
otherwise), but subject in each case to any six-month delay applicable under
Code Section 409A.

6.3 Enforcement of This Agreement. In addition to the Companys equitable
remedies provided under Section 5.6 hereof, which need not be exclusively
resolved by arbitration, in the event that any legal dispute arises in
connection with, relating to, or concerning this Agreement, or in the event of
any claim for breach or violation of any provision of this Agreement,
Executive agrees that such dispute or claim will be resolved by arbitration.
Any such arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the
rules of the American Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ "). Any such dispute
or claim will be presented to a single arbitrator selected by mutual agreement
of the Executive and the Company (or the arbitrator will be selected in
accordance with the rules of the AAA). All determinations of the arbitrator
will be final and binding upon the Executive and the Company. Except as
provided in Section 6.4 hereof, each party to the arbitration proceeding will
bear its own costs in connection with such arbitration proceedings, except
that unless otherwise paid by the Company in

 



Schedule 6.2(f)-A - Page 7  accordance with such section, the costs and expenses of the arbitrator will
be divided evenly between the parties. The venue for any arbitration
proceeding and for any judicial proceeding related to this arbitration
provision (including a judicial proceeding to enforce this provision) will be
in Albany, Georgia.

6.4 Attorneys Fees. In the event any dispute in connection with this
Agreement arises with respect to obligations of Executive or the Company, as
the case may be, the successful or prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys fees, court costs, and all expenses incurred in
that action or proceeding, even if not taxable as court costs, plus in each
case interest at the Applicable Federal Rate, in addition to any other relief
to which such party may be entitled.

6.5 Headings. Section and other headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

6.6 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the final and complete
understanding and agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof, and there are no other agreements, understandings,
restrictions, representations or warranties among the parties other than those
set forth herein. Executive acknowledges that this Agreement replaces in its
entirety any prior agreements between Executive and the Company concerning the
subject covered by this Agreement, including the Prior Agreement.

 

6.7 Amendments. This Agreement may be amended or modified at any time in any
or all respects, but only by an instrument in writing executed by the parties
hereto.

6.8 Choice of Law. The validity of this Agreement, the construction of its
terms, and the determination of the rights and duties of the parties hereto
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the
State of Georgia applicable to contracts made to be performed wholly within
such state, without regard to the choice of law provisions thereof.

6.9 Notices. All notices and other communications under this Agreement must be
in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when (a) delivered by
hand, (b) sent by electronic mail to the addresses described below, provided
that a copy is sent by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service
(receipt requested), or (c) when received by the addressee, if sent by a

severable. In the event that any one or more of the provisions contained in
this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the same shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any
other provision of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be construed as

clearly apparent under the circumstances that the parties would not have

hereunder, and the remedies and enforcement provided herein shall remain
operative and in full force and effect, regardless of the expiration or
termination of this Agreement.

 

6.14 Waiver. The failure of either party to insist in any one or more
instances upon performance of any terms or conditions of this Agreement will
not be construed as a waiver of future performance of any such term, covenant,
or condition and the obligations of either party with respect to such term,
covenant or condition will continue in full force and effect.

interpreted and construed in a manner consistent with the applicable
provisions of Code Section 409A, including any regulations or other guidance
promulgated thereunder. For purposes thereof: (a) each payment under this
Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment; (b) the exclusions
for short-term deferrals and payments on account of involuntary termination

deferred compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A shall be made
upon Executives "separation from service" as determined thereunder; (d) any
reference herein to the termination of Executives employment or
to Executives Termination Date or words of similar import shall mean and be
deemed to refer to the date of his "separation from service" within the

within the meaning of Code Section 409A, payments that are deemed to
constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A and

constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A
shall be made or provide in accordance with the requirements of such section.

construed as a whole, according to fair meaning, and not strictly for or
against any party. In drafting this Agreement, Executive has been fully
represented by counsel of Executives choosing, and the terms of this

(CAROL W. SLAPPEY)

THIS EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (the " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into by and between Carol W. Slappey (" _Executive_ ") and Heritage Financial
Group, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the
State of Maryland (the " _Company_ "), and is intended to amend, restate, and
replace, in its entirety, that certain Executive Employment Agreement by and
between the Company, Heritagebank of the South (the " _Bank_ "),
and Executive, initially effective as of March 16, 2005, and has been amended
and extended from time to time (the " _Prior Agreement_ ").

 

1\. Effectiveness; Relationship to Prior Agreement. This Agreement is
contingent upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by that certain
Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Renasant Corporation, Renasant Bank,
the Company and the Bank, dated as of December , 2014 (the " _Merger
Agreement_ "). This Agreement shall be effective as of the close of business
on the business day preceding the Effective Time, as defined in the Merger
Agreement (the " _Effective Date_ "). If the Effective Time shall not occur,
this Agreement shall be deemed void and of no effect, and the Prior Agreement
shall remain in force and effect.

As of the Effective Date, Executive agrees that, to the extent not
expressly provided herein, all rights and benefits provided under the Prior
Agreement shall be deemed extinguished and cancelled in their entirety.
Executive agrees that nothing contained in this Agreement and no payment or
benefit made outside of this Agreement is intended to constitute a
"substitution," within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), for any right or benefit provided
under the Prior Agreement that has been extinguished and cancelled hereunder,
and that this Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in a manner
consistent with such intent.

 

2\. Employment And Term:

 

2.1 Position. The Company shall employ and retain Executive as its [TITLE],
and the Bank shall retain Executive as its [TITLE] (unless the context
clearly indicates the contrary, the Bank and the Company are collectively
referred to hereinafter as the " _Company_ "). Executive agrees to be so
employed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein. Executives
duties and responsibilities shall be those assigned to her hereunder, from
time to time, by the Companys Chief Executive Officer, and shall include such
duties as are the type and nature normally assigned to similar
executive officers of a corporation of the size, type and stature of the
Company. Executive shall report directly to the Companys Chief Executive
Officer.

 

2.2 Full Time and Attention. During the Employment Term (defined below),
Executive shall devote her full time, attention and energies to the business
of the Company and will not, without the prior written consent of the Board,

or professional activity, whether or not such activities are pursued
for gain, profit or other pecuniary advantage. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Executive shall not be prevented from: (a) engaging in any civic or charitable
activity for which Executive receives no compensation or other pecuniary
advantage, including without limitation serving as an officer and/or director
of any community, civic, charitable, service or professional organization; (b)
managing her personal affairs and investments in businesses that do not
compete with the Company, provided that such activities do not interfere with
the responsible performance of Executives duties hereunder; or (c) purchasing
securities in any corporation whose securities are regularly traded, provided

time 5% or more of the equity securities of any corporation engaged in a
business competitive with that of the Company.

 

2.3 Term. Executives employment hereunder shall commence as of the Effective
Date and shall terminate on December 31, 2016 (such period referred to as the
" _Employment Term_ ").

Compensation_ "). Executives Base Compensation shall be reviewed no less
often than annually and may be increased or reduced by the Companys Chief

executive benefit plan, profit sharing, life insurance, and group medical and
other welfare benefit plans. Any such coverages and benefits shall be

documents evidencing any such plans, policies, and programs. Nothing herein
shall prevent the Company from amending or modifying the terms and conditions
of any benefit, contract or arrangement, replacing any such benefit, contract
or arrangement or eliminating or terminating any such benefit, contract or
arrangement, notwithstanding that such amendment, modification, replacement or
elimination may be adverse to Executive.

reasonable expenses as are directly incurred by Executive in carrying out her

cured, is not cured by the Executive within 30 days following her receipt of
written notice thereof (it being understood, however,

business judgment nor unintentional physical damage to any property of the
Company by Executive shall be a ground for such a determination); (iii) has

Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") with respect to a group health plan
sponsored by the Company or an affiliate (other than a health flexible
spending account under Code Section 125), in which event: (i) the Company
shall pay to Executive monthly the amount of the continuation coverage
premium for the same type and level of group health plan coverage received by
Executive and her electing dependents immediately prior to such termination of
Executives employment, during the continuation period contemplated under
Code Section 4980B; and (ii) thereafter, the Company shall pay to Executive
the premium amount for substantially the same type and level of coverage

_except that_ such coverage may be provided, in the discretion of the
Company, under a group medical plan maintained by the Company for the benefit
of its employees or under an individual policy of insurance. Nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to require the Company to maintain any type or level
of coverage under any group health plan, or to preclude the amendment,
substitution, replacement or termination of any type or level of coverage
under any group health plan.

 

c. " _Continuing Perquisite Amount_ " means a dollar amount payable to the
Executive in lieu of continuing Executives coverage in the Companys benefit
plans and in lieu of continuing to provide Executive with various perquisites
following her Termination Date. The Continuing Perquisite Amount shall be
calculated as of Executives Termination Date and shall be the sum of: (i)
the annual premium cost of the welfare plans, such as group life and
disability insurance, under which Executive was covered prior to her
Termination Date, _but_ expressly excluding the Continuing Health
Benefit provided separately above and any voluntary benefits under which
Executive may have elected to be covered; (ii) aggregate Company contributions
or accruals under any qualified or nonqualified retirement plans made on
behalf of the Executive for the calendar year prior to the year in which her

applicable laws; and (iii) the amount of any car allowance or country club
dues provided for the benefit of Executive during the calendar year prior to

Amount shall be calculated as an annual fixed amount and prorated and paid in
accordance with the Companys regular payroll practices and plans.

d. " _Good Reason_ " means a good faith determination by Executive, in
Executives sole and absolute judgment, that any one or more of the following
events has occurred, without Executives express written consent: (i) a
reduction by the Company in Executives Base Compensation, as the same may be
increased from time to time; (ii) a change in the eligibility requirements or
performance criteria under any bonus, incentive, compensation, benefit or
retirement plan, program or arrangement under which Executive is covered
which adversely affects Executive; (iii) the Company requires Executive to be
based anywhere other than a job location within the boundaries of Dougherty
County, Georgia; (iv) without replacement by a plan providing benefits to
Executive equal to or greater than those discontinued, the failure by the
Company to continue in effect, within its maximum stated term, any pension,
bonus, incentive, retirement, stock ownership, purchase, option, life
insurance, health, accident, disability, or any other employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement in which Executive is participating; (v) the taking of
any action by the Company that would adversely affect Executives
participation or materially reduce Executives benefits under any of such
plans unless such action is part of Company-wide reduction in benefits which
affects other senior executives in the same fashion as the Executive; or (vi)
the taking of any action by the Company that would materially adversely
affect the physical conditions under which Executive performs Executives
employment duties.

 



Schedule 6.2(f)-B - Page 4 e. " _Termination Date_ " means the date on which Executives
employment hereunder terminates for any reason.

4.2 Executives Termination for Good Reason. Executive may terminate her
employment hereunder for Good Reason, with 30 days prior written notice to
the Board, or such shorter period as may be agreed upon by the Board and
Executive, or Executives employment may be terminated on account of her death
or Disability. Upon Executives termination for Good Reason, death or
Disability, the Company shall pay or provide to Executive the following
amounts or benefits, subject to any delay required under Section 6.15 below:

 

a. Her Base Compensation accrued but not yet paid as of her Termination Date,
any Incentive Bonus for the year prior to the year in which Executives
Termination Date occurs to the extent not yet paid as of her Termination Date,
any benefits or payments required by law to be provided, and any benefits
accrued and vested under a separate benefit plan or arrangement maintained
by the Company (collectively, Executives " _Accrued Benefits_ ").

b. Three years of Executives Base Compensation in effect as of the
Termination Date (ignoring any decrease in such Base Compensation occurring
within four months of such Termination Date), which amount shall be paid over
the three-year period following her Termination Date, in accordance with
the Companys regular payroll practices and policies.

c. An amount equal to the average of Executives last three annual
Incentive Bonuses paid prior to the Termination Date, such amount to be paid
annually for three years following her Termination Date, at the time or times
Executives Incentive Bonus would otherwise be payable (for avoidance of
doubt, the parties intend that Executive shall receive three annual payments
hereunder.

d. The Continuing Health Benefit and Continuing Perquisite Amount, each to be
paid or provided for the three-year period following her Termination Date.

As used herein, the term " _Disability_ " shall have the meaning ascribed to
such term under Code Section 409A.

4.3 Companys Termination Without Cause. The Board may terminate Executives
employment hereunder, without Cause, with 30 days prior written notice to
Executive, or such shorter period as may be agreed upon by the Board and

below), during the period commencing as of the first day of the
calendar month following Executives Termination Date and continuing until
December 31st of the calendar year that is three whole calendar years
following the end of the year in which Executives Termination Date occurs,
it being understood that Executive shall receive not less than four annual
bonus payments under Section 4.2c hereof.

 

4.4 Companys Termination for Cause. Executives employment hereunder may be
terminated by the Board at any time, acting in good faith, on account of
Cause. The Board shall provide written notice to Executive, including a
description of the specific reasons for the determination of Cause. Executive
shall have the opportunity to appear before the Board, or a committee thereof
formed for this purpose, with or without legal representation, to present
arguments and evidence on her behalf. Following such presentation, or upon
Executives failure to appear, the Board, or such committee as the case may
be, by an affirmative vote of a majority of its members, shall confirm that
the actions or inactions of Executive constitute Cause hereunder. In such
event, the Company shall pay to Executive her Accrued Benefits and shall have
no further obligations hereunder.

4.5 Executives Voluntary Termination. In the event Executive voluntarily
terminates her employment without Good Reason, the Company shall pay to
Executive her Accrued Benefits and shall have no further obligations
hereunder.

 



Schedule 6.2(f)-B - Page 5 4.6 Expiration of Employment Term. Upon the expiration of Executives
Employment Term, Executives employment hereunder shall cease, this Agreement
shall be deemed terminated, and the Company shall pay to Executive the amounts
and benefits described in Section 4.2 hereof; _provided that_ Executive shall
execute and timely deliver a wavier and release of claims in favor of the
Company, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

 

5\. Executives Covenants:

 

5.1 Consideration for Covenants. Executive acknowledges that the execution of
this Agreement and the payments described herein constitute consideration for
the covenants set forth in this Section 5, the adequacy of which is hereby
expressly acknowledged by Executive.

 

5.2 Confidential Information. Executive shall not divulge, furnish or use,
whether directly or indirectly, any Trade Secret or Confidential Information,
_except_ in the ordinary course of providing services hereunder, to a duly
authorized officer of a Protected Entity (as defined below) or as may be
required by legal process. For this purpose:

 

a. " _Trade Secret_ " is as defined in § 10-1-761 of the Official Code of
Georgia Annotated.

 

b. " _Confidential Information_ " means confidential, proprietary, non-public
information concerning the Company, the Bank and their affiliates (the "
_Protected Entities_ "), whether or not a Trade Secret, which includes,
without limitation: (i) books, records and policies relating to operations,
finance, accounting, personnel and management of Protected Entities; (ii)
information related to any business entered into by the Protected Entities;
(iii) credit policies and practices, databases, customer lists, information
obtained on competitors, and tactics; (iv) various other non-public trade or
business information, including business opportunities and strategies,
marketing, acquisition or business diversification plans, methods and
processes and work product of the Protected Entities; and (v) selling and
operating policies and practices, including without limitation, policies and
practices concerning the identity, solicitation, acquisition, management,
resale or cancellation of unsecured or secured credit card accounts, deposits,
loan or lease accounts or other accounts relating to consumer products and
services of the Protected Entities. No item of information shall be considered
Confidential Information hereunder if it is generally known to the public,
except as a result of a breach by Executive hereunder.

c. The covenant contained herein shall apply during the Employment Term and
the fouryear period thereafter.

 

5.3 Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition. Executive shall not, directly or
indirectly: (a) provide banking or bank-related services to, or solicit the
banking or bank-related business of, any customer of the Protected Entities in
any city, town, borough, township, village or other place in which Executive
performed services for the Protected Entities; (b) assist any actual or
potential competitor of the Protected Entities to provide banking or bank-
related services to, or solicit any such customers banking or bank-related
business in any such place; or (c) whether as principal, agent, or
trustee, or through the agency of any corporation, partnership, trade
association, agent or agency, engage in any banking or bank-related business
or venture which competes with the business of the Protected Entities as
conducted during the Employment Term within a radius of 50 miles of the main
office of the Bank. For this purpose:

a. The covenant contained herein shall be applicable during the Employment
Term and, if Executive is involuntarily terminated on account of Cause, during
the two-year period thereafter.

b. If Executive is involuntarily terminated by the Company without Cause or
Executive terminates her employment before the expiration of the Employment
Term, and she thereafter breaches the covenant contained herein, the Company
may immediately cease, and shall not be required to continue, any payment or
benefit otherwise due under Section 4 hereof, _except_ Executives Accrued
Benefits.

 

5.4 Companys Property. Upon termination or Executives termination of
employment hereunder for any reason, Executive or her estate shall promptly
return to the Company all of the property of the Company,

 



Schedule 6.2(f)-B - Page 6  including, without limitation, automobiles, equipment, computers, fax
machines, portable telephones, printers, software, credit cards, manuals,
customer lists, financial data, letters, notes, notebooks, reports and copies
of any of the above and any Confidential Information or Trade Secret that is
in the possession or under the control of Executive, regardless of the form in
which it is maintained.

 

5.5 Reformation. The parties agree that each of the prohibitions set forth
herein is intended to constitute a separate restriction. Accordingly, should
any such prohibition be declared invalid or unenforceable, such prohibition
shall be deemed severable from and shall not affect the remainder thereof. The
parties further agree that each of the foregoing restrictions is reasonable
in both time and geographic scope. If and to the extent a court of competent
jurisdiction or an arbitrator, as the case may be, determines that any of the
restrictions or covenants set forth in this Agreement are unreasonable, then
it is the intention of the parties that such restrictions be enforced to the
fullest extent that such court or arbitrator deems reasonable and that this
Agreement shall be reformed to the extent necessary to permit such
enforcement.

 

5.6 Remedies. In the event of a breach or threatened breach by Executive of
the provisions of Section 5 hereof, Executive agrees that the Company shall
be entitled to a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction
(without the necessity of posting bond in connection therewith). Nothing
herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from pursuing any
other remedy available to it for such breach or threatened breach, whether in
law or equity, including the recovery of damages from Executive.

6. Miscellaneous:

6.1 Mitigation Not Required. As a condition of any payment hereunder,
Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of such payment by
seeking other employment, nor will any profits, income, earnings or other
benefits from any source whatsoever create any mitigation, offset, reduction
or any other obligation on the part of Executive under this Agreement.

6.2 Excess Parachute Payments. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary if the aggregate of all payments and benefits to Executive
hereunder, including any payment or benefit provided to Executive under a
separate plan or arrangement (collectively, the " _Aggregate Payments_ ")
would result in any payment being deemed to constitute a "parachute payment"
within the meaning of Code Section 280G, such payments shall be reduced to the
minimum extent necessary (but in no event to less than zero) so that no
portion of such payments and benefits, as so reduced, is deemed to constitute
an excess parachute payment; _provided that_ the amount of such reduction
shall be less than $50,000. If the amount such reduction would equal or exceed
$50,000, then no such reduction shall occur, the Executive shall be entitled
to all such Aggregate Payments, and the Company shall pay to Executive a
Gross-Up Payment. For this purpose:

a. The " _Gross-Up Payment_ " shall mean an amount that is sufficient to pay,
in its entirety, any excise tax imposed on the Aggregate Payments (including
the Gross-Up Payment) pursuant to Code Section 4999, or any successor
provision thereto, any tax imposed by any comparable provision of state law,
and any applicable federal, state, or local income tax.

b. The determination of whether any reduction in the Aggregate Payments is
required and the amount of such reduction and amount of the Gross-Up Payment,
if any, shall be made at the expense of the Company and by the Companys
independent accountants or another independent accountant agreed upon by
Executive and the Company.

c. In the event that any portion of the Aggregate Payments is required to be
reduced hereunder, then the reduction shall occur in the following order: (i)
reduction of Continuing Perquisite Amount described in Section 4.1d; (ii)
reduction of continued Incentive Bonus payments described in Section 4.1c;
and (iii) reduction of continued Base Compensation payments described in
Section 4.1b. Within any of the foregoing categories, a reduction shall occur
first with respect to amounts that are not deemed to constitute a "deferral
of compensation" within the meaning of and subject to Code Section 409A ("
_Nonqualified Deferred Compensation_ ") and then with

 



Schedule 6.2(f)-B - Page 7  respect to amounts that are treated as Nonqualified Deferred Compensation,
with such reduction being applied in each case to the payments in the reverse
order in which they would otherwise be made, that is, later payments shall be
reduced before earlier payments.

d. If the Company is obligated to make a Gross-Up Payment hereunder, it will
be paid to Executive, or remitted by the Company to the appropriate tax
authorities to the extent subject to withholding, in the form of a single-sum
payment on the date that the excise tax is due (through withholding
or otherwise), but subject in each case to any six-month delay applicable
under Code Section 409A.

6.3 Enforcement of This Agreement. In addition to the Companys equitable
remedies provided under Section 5.6 hereof, which need not be exclusively
resolved by arbitration, in the event that any legal dispute arises in
connection with, relating to, or concerning this Agreement, or in the event
of any claim for breach or violation of any provision of this Agreement,
Executive agrees that such dispute or claim will be resolved by arbitration.
Any such arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the
rules of the American Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ "). Any such dispute or
claim will be presented to a single arbitrator selected by mutual agreement of
the Executive and the Company (or the arbitrator will be selected in
accordance with the rules of the AAA). All determinations of the arbitrator
will be final and binding upon the Executive and the Company. Except as
provided in Section 6.4 hereof, each party to the arbitration proceeding will
bear its own costs in connection with such arbitration proceedings, except
that unless otherwise paid by the Company in accordance with such section, the
costs and expenses of the arbitrator will be divided evenly between the
parties. The venue for any arbitration proceeding and for any judicial
proceeding related to this arbitration provision (including a judicial
proceeding to enforce this provision) will be in Albany, Georgia.

 

6.4 Attorneys Fees. In the event any dispute in connection with this
Agreement arises with respect to obligations of Executive or the Company, as
the case may be, the successful or prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys fees, court costs, and all expenses incurred in
that action or proceeding, even if not taxable as court costs, plus in
each case interest at the Applicable Federal Rate, in addition to any other
relief to which such party may be entitled.

6.5 Headings. Section and other headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 

6.6 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the final and complete
understanding and agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof, and there are no other agreements, understandings,
restrictions, representations or warranties among the parties other than those
set forth herein. Executive acknowledges that this Agreement replaces in
its entirety any prior agreements between Executive and the Company
concerning the subject covered by this Agreement, including the Prior
Agreement.

 

6.7 Amendments. This Agreement may be amended or modified at any time in any
or all respects, but only by an instrument in writing executed by the parties
hereto.

6.8 Choice of Law. The validity of this Agreement, the construction of its
terms, and the determination of the rights and duties of the parties hereto
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the
State of Georgia applicable to contracts made to be performed wholly within
such state, without regard to the choice of law provisions thereof.

6.11 Severability. Each provision of this Agreement is intended to be
severable. In the event that any one or more of the provisions contained in
this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or

other provision of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be construed as if

Company to make any payment due and payable under Section 4 or Section 6.2
hereunder, and the remedies and enforcement provided herein shall remain
operative and in full force and effect, regardless of the expiration or
termination of this Agreement.

6.14 Waiver. The failure of either party to insist in any one or more
instances upon performance of any terms or conditions of this Agreement will
not be construed as a waiver of future performance of any such term, covenant,
or condition and the obligations of either party with respect to such term,
covenant or condition will continue in full force and effect.

6.15 Code Section 409A. The parties intend that this Agreement shall be
interpreted and construed in a manner consistent with the applicable
provisions of Code Section 409A, including any regulations or other guidance

employment shall be applied to the fullest extent applicable; (c) payments to
be made upon a termination of employment that are deemed to constitute
deferred compensation within the meaning of Code

determined thereunder; (d) any reference herein to the termination of
Executives employment or to Executives Termination Date or words of similar
import shall mean and be deemed to refer to the date of her "separation from
service" within the meaning of Code Section 409A; and (e) if Executive is a
"specified employee" within the meaning of Code Section 409A, payments that
are deemed to constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Code

of investment opportunity thereon. All reimbursements and in-kind payments
hereunder that constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Code

_Executive_ "). As used herein, the term " _Company_ " shall be deemed to
include the Company, Renasant Bank and any one or more subsidiaries or other

Section 425(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) 50% or more
of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock or other equity
interests.

 

1 Consideration; Effectiveness. This Agreement is made in consideration of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated under that certain Agreement
and Plan of Merger by and between the Company, including Renasant Bank, and
Heritage Financial Group, Inc. and Heritagebank of the South (the " _Legacy
Companies_ "; the " _Merger Agreement_ "), and the execution of that certain
Assumption Agreement by and between Executive and the Company dated the date
hereof (the " _Assumption Agreement_ "), the sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged. This Agreement is to be effective as of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated under the Merger Agreement; if such transactions
shall not be consummated as provided therein, this Agreement shall be void and
of no effect.

 

2\. Confidential Information. Executive recognizes and acknowledges that
during the term of his employment with the Company, he will have access to
the Companys Confidential Information and Trade Secrets (as defined below).
Executive agrees that he will not at any time, either during the term of his
employment with the Company, or at any time thereafter, make any independent
use of, or disclose to any person or organization, any Confidential
Information or Trade Secret, _except_ : (a) as may be expressly authorized by
the Chief Executive Officer of the Company; (b) in the ordinary course
of Executives employment with the Company; (c) as may be required by law or
legal process; or (d) to the extent any such information becomes generally
known to the public, other than on account of a breach of this Agreement
by Executive. As used herein:

a. The term " _Confidential Information_ " means, regardless of the form in
which maintained and whether or not a Trade Secret under applicable law,
confidential, proprietary, non-public information concerning the Company,
including the Legacy Companies, including, without limitation: (a) books,
records and policies relating to operations, finance, accounting, personnel
and management; (b) information related to any business entered into by the
Company; (c) credit policies and practices, databases, customer and
prospective customer lists, depositor and prospective depositor lists, and
information obtained on competitors and tactics; (d) various other non-public
trade or business information, including business opportunities and expansion
or acquisition strategies, marketing, business diversification plans,
methods and processes; and (e) retail marketing and operating policies and
practices, including without limitation, policies and practices concerning the
identity, solicitation, acquisition, management, resale or cancellation of
unsecured or secured credit card accounts, loan or lease accounts, other
accounts relating to consumer products and services and depository
arrangements.

b. The term " _Trade Secret_ " shall have the meaning ascribed to it in §
10-1-761 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.

 

3\. Non-Solicitation. Executive agrees that during the two-year period
commencing on the date that Executives employment with the Company ceases
for any reason (such date, the "Termination Date"; such period, the
"Restricted Period"), he shall not, directly or indirectly, for his own
benefit or on behalf of or to the benefit of another or to the Companys
detriment:

a. Solicit, hire or offer to hire, or participate in the hiring of, any of the
Companys officers, employees or agents;

b. Persuade, or attempt to persuade, in any manner any officer, employee or
agent of the Company to interrupt or discontinue any business relationship
with the Company; or

 



Schedule 6.2(f)-C - Page 5 c. Solicit or divert, or attempt to solicit or divert, any customer or
depositor of the Company, including any prospective or potential customer or
depositor of the Company with respect to which: (i) the Company has expended
material efforts to solicit before the Termination Date, and (ii) Executive
has participated in such solicitation or knows, or should know, of such
solicitation.

4\. Non-Competition. The Executive agrees that during the Restricted Period
he shall not, whether as an employee, officer, director, shareholder, owner,
member, partner, joint venturer, independent contractor, consultant or in any
other capacity, engage, directly or indirectly, in the Banking Business in
the Restricted Area. For this purpose, the term " _Banking Business_ " shall
mean the management and/or operation of a retail bank or other financial
institution, securities brokerage, or insurance agency or brokerage; the
term " _Restricted Area_ " shall mean within the 50-mile radius of any
geographic location in which the Company has a substantial office or branch
location on the Termination Date.

 

5\. Business Reputation. Executive agrees that during his employment with the
Company and at all times thereafter, he shall refrain from making or
publishing any adverse, untrue or misleading statement which has, or may
reasonably be anticipated to have, the effect of demeaning the name or
business reputation of the Company, except as may be required by law or legal
process. 

6\. Reformation. The parties agree that each of the covenants set forth herein
is intended to constitute a separate restriction. Should any such covenant be
declared invalid or unenforceable, such covenant shall be deemed severable
from and shall not affect the remainder thereof. The parties further agree
that each of the foregoing covenants is reasonable in both time and
geographic scope. If and to the extent a court of competent jurisdiction or an
arbitrator, as the case may be, determines that any of the covenants set forth
herein are unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable, then it is the intention
of the parties that such covenant shall be enforced to the fullest extent
that such court or arbitrator deems reasonable and that this Agreement shall
be deemed reformed to the extent necessary to permit such enforcement.

 

7\. Remedies. In the event of a breach or threatened breach by Executive of
the provisions of this Agreement, Executive agrees that the Company shall be
entitled to obtain a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction,
without the necessity of posting bond in connection therewith. Executive
further agrees that upon the issuance of a temporary restraining order,
the Company may, in its discretion, suspend any additional payments or
benefits due to Executive or his dependents under the Assumption Agreement;
_provided that_ such payments shall be resumed when the Company reasonably
determines that such breach or threatened breach has been corrected or cured
(to the extent that such breach is susceptible of correction or cure).

The Company shall provide to Executive written notice of the events giving
rise to Executives breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this
Agreement, including a statement as to whether the Company reasonably believes
that such breach or threatened breach is susceptible of cure, at least two
business days before seeking a temporary restraining order hereunder.
Thereafter, Executive may correct such breach or threatened breach to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Company;  _provided that_ if Executive fails
to correct such breach or threatened breach within such two-day period,
nothing contained herein shall preclude or delay the Companys ability to seek
a temporary restraining order hereunder.

 

Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from pursuing any
other remedy available to it for such breach or threatened breach, whether in
law or equity.

8\. General:

 

a. In addition to the Companys equitable remedies provided under paragraph 7
hereof, which need not be exclusively resolved by arbitration, in the event
that any legal dispute arises in connection with, relating to, or concerning
this Agreement, or in the event of any claim for breach or violation of any
provision of this Agreement, Executive agrees that such dispute or claim will
be resolved by arbitration. Any such arbitration proceeding shall be conducted
in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (" _AAA_
").

 



Schedule 6.2(f)-C - Page 6  Any such dispute or claim will be presented to a single arbitrator selected
by mutual agreement of the Executive and the Company (or the arbitrator will
be selected in accordance with the rules of the AAA). All determinations of
the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the Executive and the Company.
Each party to the arbitration proceeding will bear its own costs in connection
with such arbitration proceedings, and the costs and expenses of the
arbitrator will be divided evenly between the parties. The venue for any
arbitration proceeding and for any judicial proceeding related to this
arbitration provision, including a judicial proceeding to enforce this
provision, will be in Albany, Georgia.

b. This Agreement constitutes the final and complete understanding and
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof,
and there are no other agreements, understandings, restrictions,
representations or warranties among the parties other than those set forth
herein. Executive acknowledges that this Agreement replaces in its entirety
any prior agreements between Executive and the Company or the Legacy Companies
concerning the subject covered by this Agreement.

 

c. This Agreement may be amended or modified at any time in any or all
respects, but only by an instrument in writing executed by the
parties hereto.

d. The validity of this Agreement, the construction of its terms, and the
determination of the rights and duties of the parties hereto shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
Georgia applicable to contracts made to be performed wholly within such state,
without regard to the choice of law provisions thereof.

 

e. All notices and other communications under this Agreement must be in
writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when (i) delivered by
hand, (ii) sent by electronic mail to the addresses described below, provided
that a copy is sent by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service
(receipt requested), or (iii) when received by the addressee, if sent by a

substantially all of the Companys assets or business or with or into which
the Company may be liquidated, consolidated, merged or otherwise combined.

and legal representatives.

to the contrary, the obligations of Executive hereunder, and the remedies and
enforcement provided herein, shall remain operative and in full force and
effect, regardless of the occurrence of Executives Termination Date or the
expiration, termination or cancellation of the Assumption Agreement.

h. The failure of the Company to insist in any one or more instances upon
performance of any terms or conditions of this Agreement will not be construed
as a waiver of future performance of any such term, covenant, or condition and
the obligations of either party with respect to such term, covenant
or condition will continue in full force and effect.

this Notice.

1\. Purpose and Status of Award. This Award is intended to induce your
employment with the Company and to act as a retention incentive to remain
employed with the Company. This Award shall be effective (the " _Effective
Date_ ") as of  , 2015, or the date thereafter on which
you first perform services for the Company or one of its subsidiaries or
affiliates. If and to the extent you do not perform services for the Company
or one of its subsidiaries or affiliates, this Award shall be void and of no
effect.

2. Limitations and Restrictions. During the Service Period (as defined
below), your Award cannot be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, mortgaged,
hypothecated, or otherwise disposed of, whether voluntarily, by operation of
law or otherwise (the " _Restrictions_ "). During such period, your Award
will be maintained by the Company in book entry form, and you may be asked to
deliver to the Company stock powers endorsed in blank as a condition of your
Award. As and when the Service Period is complete and the Restrictions lapse,
the Company will settle your Award by transferring to you the applicable
number of shares of Common Stock. Your Award may be settled in the form of
certificated shares or by means of book entry, in the Companys discretion.

For this purpose, the term " _Service Period_ " refers to the period during
which your Award is subject to the Restrictions. The Service Period begins on
the Effective Date and remains in effect through December 31, 2018, as
follows:

a. The Restrictions shall lapse and the Service Period shall be deemed
complete as to one-fourth of the shares awarded hereunder as of December 31,
2015 (the " _Vesting Anniversary_ "), _provided that_ you have remained
continuously employed by the Company or a subsidiary or affiliate thereof and
are then in good standing (the " _Vesting Conditions_ "); and

 

b. The Restrictions shall lapse and the Service Period shall be deemed
complete as to an additional one-fourth of the shares awarded hereunder on
each anniversary of the Vesting Anniversary thereafter, such that the
Restrictions shall lapse and the Service Period shall be deemed complete for
the final one-fourth of the shares as of December 31, 2018, _provided that_
you are in compliance with the Vesting Conditions on each such date.

3\. Shareholder Rights. During the Service Period, you are entitled to the
rights of a shareholder with respect to the number of shares of Common Stock
subject to your Award, including the right to vote the shares and to receive
cash dividends if, as and when declared by the Board.

 

4\. Termination of Employment:

a. If your employment is involuntarily terminated for Cause before the
Service Period is complete and the Restrictions lapse, your Award, to the
extent then subject to the Restrictions, will be forfeited to and cancelled by
the Company. For this purpose, the term " _Cause_ " shall have the meaning
ascribed to it in the employment agreement between you and the Company.

b. If your employment is involuntarily terminated without Cause before the
Service Period is complete, your Award will vest in its entirety, the
Restrictions will lapse, and shares of Common Stock previously subject to the
Restrictions will be immediately transferred to you.

c. If your employment ends before the completion of the Service Period on
account of your death or Disability, your Award will vest in its entirety,
the Restrictions will lapse, and shares of Common Stock

 



Schedule 6.2(f)-C - Page 9  previously subject to the Restrictions will be immediately transferred to
you (or upon your death, to your beneficiary, or if none, to your estate). For
this purpose, the term " _Disability_ " shall have the meaning ascribed to it
in the Companys 2010 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan, as the same may
be amended, superseded or replaced from time to time (the " _Incentive Plan_
").

 

5\. Change in Control. If a Change in Control is consummated during the
Service Period, your Award will vest, in its entirety, the Restrictions
shall lapse, and shares of Common Stock will be transferred to you free of
the Restrictions. For this purpose, the term " _Change in Control_ " shall
have the meaning ascribed to it in the Incentive Plan.

 

6\. Taxes. The fair market value of the number of shares of Common Stock with
respect to which the Restrictions lapse, from time to time, will be treated
as compensation, reported by the Company on IRS Form W-2, and will be subject
to withholding for applicable income and employment taxes. Unless you
otherwise provide, the Company will determine the amount of your withholding
and satisfy this obligation by "netting" from your Award shares of Common
Stock with a fair market value equal to your withholding obligation. The
Company calculates withholding at the supplemental wage rate and the highest
applicable marginal state income tax rate.

7\. No Assignment. During the Service Period, your Award shall not be subject
in any manner to sale, transfer, pledge, assignment or other encumbrance or
disposition, whether by operation of law or otherwise, and whether voluntarily
or involuntarily, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. In
the event of a purported assignment, transfer or division on account of the
division of your community property or the dissolution of your marriage, the
portion of your Award purportedly subject to such assignment, transfer or
division will be forfeited and cancelled, without the requirement of notice or
the payment of compensation.

8\. Additional Requirements. Common Stock issued hereunder has not be
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, as amended. If shares
of Common Stock acquired hereunder are certificated, such certificates may
bear legends as the Company deems appropriate to comply with applicable
Federal or state securities laws. Prior to the issuance of such shares, you
may be required to deliver to the Company such other documents as may be
reasonably required to ensure compliance with applicable Federal or state
securities laws.

 

9\. Amendment. The Board, in its discretion and without your consent, may
amend or modify your Award, except that any amendment that
materially diminishes your Award can be effective only with your prior
written consent.

10\. No Continued Employment. Your Award is not a promise of your continued
employment with the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate, nor does it
otherwise modify your employment status.

11\. Governing Law. Your Award hereunder shall be governed by the laws of the
State of Mississippi, without regard to the conflicts of law provisions
thereof.

12\. Binding Effect. Your Award shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Company, including its successors and assigns. The Company
shall require any successor or assign to expressly assume such Award in the
same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to
perform if no such succession or assignment had taken place. To the extent
expressly provided herein, your Award shall inure to the benefit of your
beneficiaries and successors; your obligations hereunder shall further be
binding upon such parties.

13\. Entire Agreement. This Award, including any additional documents
necessary to effect the terms and conditions hereof, constitutes the entire
understanding and agreement among the parties hereto, and there are no other
agreements, understandings, restrictions, representations or warranties among
the parties, other than those set forth herein.

 

14\. Administration. All matters of administration arising with respect to
your Award shall be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board,
in its discretion, including the resolution of any ambiguity or the

 



Schedule 6.2(f)-C - Page 10  provision of any omitted term or condition. Any determination by the Board
need not be uniform as among similarly situated officers and employees and
shall be final and binding upon you and your representatives, heirs,
beneficiaries and assigns.

15\. Dilution. Upon the consummation of a merger, consolidation or
reorganization of the Company with another entity there shall be substituted
for each of the shares of Common Stock then subject to your Award the number
and kind of shares of stock or other securities to which the holders of Common
Stock are entitled in such transaction. In the event of any recapitalization,
stock dividend, stock split or reverse stock split, combination of shares or
other change in the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding for
which the Company does not receive consideration, the number of shares of
Common Stock then subject to your Award shall be adjusted in proportion to the
change in outstanding shares of Common Stock resulting from such

the Company may, in its discretion, suspend any additional payments or
benefits due to Executive or her dependents under the Assumption Agreement;
_provided that_ such payments shall be resumed when the Company reasonably
determines that such breach or threatened breach has been corrected or cured
(to the extent that such breach is susceptible of correction or cure).

The Company shall provide to Executive written notice of the events giving
rise to Executives breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this
Agreement, including a statement as to whether the Company reasonably believes
that such breach or threatened breach is susceptible of cure, at least two
business days before seeking a temporary restraining order hereunder.
Thereafter, Executive may correct such breach or threatened breach to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Company;  _provided that_ if Executive fails
to correct such breach or threatened breach within such two-day period,
nothing contained herein shall preclude or delay the Companys ability to seek
a temporary restraining order hereunder.

 

Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from pursuing any
other remedy available to it for such breach or threatened breach, whether in
law or equity.

8\. General:

 

a. In addition to the Companys equitable remedies provided under paragraph 7
hereof, which need not be exclusively resolved by arbitration, in the event
that any legal dispute arises in connection with, relating to, or concerning
this Agreement, or in the event of any claim for breach or violation of any
provision of this Agreement, Executive agrees that such dispute or claim will
be resolved by arbitration. Any such arbitration

 



Schedule 6.2(f)-D - Page 6  proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American
Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ "). Any such dispute or claim will be
presented to a single arbitrator selected by mutual agreement of the
Executive and the Company (or the arbitrator will be selected in accordance
with the rules of the AAA). All determinations of the arbitrator will be final
and binding upon the Executive and the Company. Each party to the arbitration
proceeding will bear its own costs in connection with such arbitration
proceedings, and the costs and expenses of the arbitrator will be divided
evenly between the parties. The venue for any arbitration proceeding and for
any judicial proceeding related to this arbitration provision, including a
judicial proceeding to enforce this provision, will be in Albany, Georgia.

 

b. This Agreement constitutes the final and complete understanding and
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof,
and there are no other agreements, understandings, restrictions,
representations or warranties among the parties other than those set forth
herein. Executive acknowledges that this Agreement replaces in its entirety
any prior agreements between Executive and the Company or the Legacy
Companies concerning the subject covered by this Agreement.

c. This Agreement may be amended or modified at any time in any or all
respects, but only by an instrument in writing executed by the parties hereto.

d. The validity of this Agreement, the construction of its terms, and the
determination of the rights and duties of the parties hereto shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Georgia
applicable to contracts made to be performed wholly within such state,
without regard to the choice of law provisions thereof.

e. All notices and other communications under this Agreement must be in
writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when (i) delivered by hand,
(ii) sent by electronic mail to the addresses designated below, provided that
a copy is sent by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service (receipt

Schedule 6.2(f)-E - Page 1 AMENDMENT TO THE

 

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN

 

 AND HERITAGEBANK OF THE SOUTH 

This Amendment is made and entered into as of this day
of December, 2014, by and between HERITAGEBANK OF THE SOUTH (the "Bank") and
(the "Executive");

 

WHEREAS, the Bank and the Executive previously entered into an Employment
Agreement dated July 21, 2010 (the "Agreement"), the term of which has been
extended from time to time;

WHEREAS, Section 13 of the Agreement provides that the Agreement may be
modified as agreed to in a writing signed by the Executive and the Bank; and

WHEREAS, the parties now desire to amend the Agreement in the
manner hereinafter provided to clarify certain provisions in accordance with
the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code") and to make certain other desirable modifications.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, the Bank and the Executive hereby clarify and amend the
Agreement effective as of the date first set forth above as follows: 

1\. The Executive and the Bank confirm that the Term of the Agreement (as
defined in Section 3 of the Agreement) has been extended from time to
time and currently extends through July 21, 2016.

2\. A new Section 18 is hereby added to the Agreement as follows:

 

"18. _Section 409A_

 

(a) _General_. This Agreement will be construed and administered to preserve
the exemption from Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code") of payments that qualify as short-term deferrals pursuant
to Treas. Reg. §1.409A-1(b)(4) or that qualify for the two-times compensation
separation pay exemption of Treas. Reg. §1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) or that qualify
under other exemptions in Code Section 409A. With respect to other amounts
that are subject to Code Section 409A, if any, it is intended, and this
Agreement will be so construed, that any such amounts payable under this
Agreement and the Banks and the Executives exercise of authority or
discretion hereunder shall comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the
Code and the regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder
(collectively, " _Section 409A_ ") so as not to subject the Executive to the
payment of interest and additional tax that may be imposed under Section 409A.
As a result, in the event the Executive is a "specified employee" on the date
of the Executives separation from service, any payment that is subject to
Section 409A and that is payable to the Executive in connection with the
Executives separation from service shall not be paid until the first
business day following the expiration of six months after the Executives
separation from service (if the Executive dies after the Executives
separation from service but before any payment has been made, such remaining
payments that were or could have been delayed will be paid to the Executives
estate without regard to such six-month delay).

 

(b) _Meaning of Termination of Employment_. Solely as necessary to comply with
Section 409A, for purposes the Agreement, "termination of employment" or
"employment termination" or similar terms shall have the same meaning as
"separation from service" under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code.

 

(c) _Installment Payments_. For purposes of Section 7 with respect to
severance amounts payable in the event of termination of the Executives
employment by the Bank without Cause or by the Executive for "good reason",
each such payment is a separate payment within the meaning of the final
regulations under Section 409A. Each such payment that is made before the
later of (i) 2 1⁄2 months following the end of the calendar year or (ii) 2
1⁄2 months following the end of the Banks fiscal year, in each case that
contains the date of the Executives termination of employment, is intended
to be exempt from Section 409A as a short-term deferral within the meaning of
the final regulations under Section 409A. Each such payment that is

 



Schedule 6.2(f)-E - Page 2  made later than 2 1⁄2 months following the end of the applicable year that
contains the date of the Executives termination of employment is intended to
be exempt under the two-times compensation separation pay exception of
Treasury Reg. § 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) up to the limitation on the availability
of such exception specified in such regulation. To the extent applicable,
continued medical and dental coverage provided by the Bank or reimbursements
of medical and dental plan premiums is intended to be exempt from Section 409A
under the exemption for health benefits in Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v)(B)
up to the limitation on the availability of such exception specified in such
regulation."

3\. A new Section 19 is hereby added to the Agreement as follows:

"19. _Section 280G_

 

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any
payment or benefit to be paid or provided hereunder would be a "Parachute
Payment," within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, or any successor
provision thereto, but for the application of this sentence, then the payments
and benefits to be paid or provided hereunder shall be reduced to the minimum
extent necessary (but in no event to less than zero) so that no portion of any
such payment or benefit, as so reduced, constitutes a Parachute Payment;
provided, however, that the foregoing reduction shall not be made if
the total of the unreduced aggregate payments and benefits to be provided to
the Executive, determined on an after-tax basis (taking into account the
excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code, or any successor
provision thereto, any tax imposed by any comparable provision of state law,
and any applicable federal, state and local income taxes), exceeds the total
after-tax amount of such aggregate payments and benefits after application of
the foregoing reduction. The determination of whether any reduction in such
payments or benefits to be provided hereunder is required pursuant to the
preceding sentence shall be made at the expense of the Bank, if requested by
the Executive or the Bank, by the Banks independent accountants or another
independent accountant agreed upon by the Executive and the Bank. In the event
that any payment or benefit intended to be provided hereunder is required to
be reduced pursuant to this Section, then the reduction shall occur in the
following order: (i) reduction of continued benefits (or payments in lieu of
benefits) described in Sections 7(c) and 7(d); (ii) reduction of bonus
payments described in Sections 7(c) and 7(d); and (iii) reduction of
continued salary payments described in Sections 7(c) and 7(d). Within any
category of payments and benefits (that is, (i), (ii) or (iii)), a reduction
shall occur first with respect to amounts that do not qualify as a "deferral
of compensation" within the meaning of and subject to Section 409A
("Nonqualified Deferred Compensation") and then with respect to amounts that
do qualify as Nonqualified Deferred Compensation with such reduction being
applied in each case to the payments in the reverse order in which they would
otherwise be made, that is, later payments shall be reduced before earlier
payments."

 

Except as specifically amended above, the Agreement shall remain unchanged and
in full force and effect.

 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Amendment as of the
date first written above.
