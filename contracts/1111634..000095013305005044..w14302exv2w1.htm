 TERMS OF THE TRANSACTION

 2.2 _Purchase Price and Payment_. In consideration of the sale of the Equity Interests to Buyer, Buyer shall pay to Seller at the Closing, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to the Base Purchase Price _._ The Base Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment in respect of the Adjustment Amount as provided in Section 2.3.

 2.3 _Calculation and Payment of Adjustment Amount_. 

   

 (a) _Adjustment Amount_. The " _Adjustment Amount_ " equals the amount by which the amount of Net Working Capital shown on the Closing Date Balance Sheet is greater than or less than the Baseline Working Capital. For the avoidance of doubt, if the amount of Net Working Capital shown on the Closing Date Balance Sheet is greater than the Baseline Working Capital, the Base Purchase Price will be effectively increased by the Adjustment Amount and if the amount of Net Working Capital shown on the Closing Date Balance Sheet is less than the Baseline Working Capital, the Base Purchase Price will be effectively decreased by the Adjustment Amount. 

   

 (b) _Closing Date Balance Sheet and Adjustment Amount_. As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, and in any event not later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller (i) a balance sheet of the Business showing Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") 

    ##### 

  

    

prepared in accordance with GAAP applied in a manner consistent with the
Reference Balance Sheet, and (ii) a statement of Buyer (the " _Adjustment
Statement_ ") showing in reasonable detail its calculation of the Adjustment
Amount. Buyer agrees, at no cost to Seller, to give Seller and its authorized
representatives reasonable access to the Companys (and any
Subsidiarys) employees, premises, offices and other facilities and to the
Companys and each Subsidiarys books and records, as are reasonably
necessary to allow Seller and its authorized representatives to review,
verify and audit the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Adjustment
Statement. 

   

 (c) _Dispute Resolution_. The Adjustment Statement shall become final and binding on Seller and Buyer as to the Adjustment Amount on the 30th day following the date the Adjustment Statement is received by Seller (the " _Dispute Deadline Date_ "), unless prior to the Dispute Deadline Date, Seller delivers Notice to Buyer of its disagreement. Sellers Notice shall set forth all of Sellers disputed items together with Sellers proposed changes thereto, including an explanation in reasonable detail of the basis on which Seller proposes such changes. If Seller has delivered a timely Notice of disagreement, then Buyer and Seller shall use their good faith efforts to reach written agreement on the disputed items to determine the Adjustment Amount, which in no event shall be more favorable to Buyer than reflected on the Adjustment Statement prepared by Buyer nor more favorable to Seller than shown in the proposed changes delivered by Seller pursuant to its Notice of disagreement. If all of Sellers disputed items have not been resolved by Buyer and Seller by the 60th day following Sellers receipt of the Adjustment Statement, then Sellers disputed items shall be submitted to binding arbitration by an independent nationally recognized accounting firm without any material financial relationship to either Buyer or Seller, as mutually selected by Buyer and Seller within five (5) business days after the end of the foregoing 60-day period (or in the absence of agreement between Buyer and Seller by the close of business on such 5th business day as selected by Seller). The fees and expenses of such arbitration shall be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer. The determination of the Adjustment Amount by such arbitration shall be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller as to the Adjustment Amount. 

   

 (d) _Final Date_. The Adjustment Amount shall be deemed to be finally determined in the amount set forth in the Adjustment Statement on the Dispute Deadline Date unless a dispute Notice is given in accordance with _Section 2.3(c)_ with respect to the calculation thereof. If such a dispute Notice is given, the Adjustment Amount shall be deemed finally determined on the date that the selected accounting firm gives Notice to Buyer and Seller of its determination with respect to all disputes regarding the calculation thereof, or, if earlier, the date on which Seller and Buyer agree in writing on the amount thereof, in which case the Adjustment Amount shall be calculated in accordance with such determination or agreement, as the case may be. 

   

 (e) _Payments_. If the Adjustment Amount, as finally determined, reflects that the amount of Net Working Capital shown on the Closing Date Balance Sheet is greater than the Baseline Working Capital, then Buyer shall pay to Seller the Adjustment Amount, plus interest on such amount from (and including) the Closing Date to (but excluding) the date of payment at the Prime Rate. If the Adjustment Amount, as finally determined, reflects that the amount of Net Working Capital shown on the Closing Date Balance Sheet is less than the Baseline Working Capital, then Seller shall pay to Buyer the Adjustment Amount, plus interest on such amount from (and including) the Closing Date to (but excluding) the date of payment at the Prime Rate. 

    ##### 

   

    

Any payment shall be made within ten (10) business days of the date the
Adjustment Amount is deemed to be finally determined pursuant to _Section
2.3(d)_.

ARTICLE 7 
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

   

 Except with respect to the Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities, the parties hereby covenant and agree as follows: 

  

 7.1 _Access to Information and Confidentiality_. 

   

 (a) _Access_. Between the date hereof and the Closing, Seller (i) shall give the Buyer and its authorized representatives reasonable access, during regular business hours and upon reasonable advance Notice, to such employees, facilities, and such books and records, of the Company and the Subsidiaries, as are reasonably necessary to allow the Buyer and its authorized representatives to make such inspections as they may reasonably require to verify the accuracy of any representation or warranty contained in _Article 4_ and (ii) shall cause officers of the Company and the Subsidiaries to furnish the Buyer and its authorized representatives with such financial and operating data and other information with respect to the Company and the Subsidiaries as the Buyer may from time to time reasonably request. Seller shall have the right to have a representative present at all times during any such inspections, interviews and examinations. Additionally, between the date hereof and the Closing, the Buyer shall hold in confidence all such information on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in _Section 7.1(e)_ or any applicable confidentiality agreement between the Parties containing standard terms for a transaction of the nature contemplated by this Agreement (and in no event less than the standard set forth in _Section 7.1(e)_). The Buyer shall have no right of access to, and Seller shall have no obligation to provide to the Buyer, (1) bids received from others in accordance with  _Section 7.3_ and information and analysis (including financial analysis) relating to such bids, or (2) any information the disclosure of which would jeopardize any privilege available to the Company, any Subsidiary or Seller relating to such information or would cause Seller, the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates to breach a confidentiality obligation or (3) except to the extent contemplated in _Section 7.1(d)_, Retained E-Mail (the " _Excluded Information_ "). The Buyer agrees that if the Buyer or its authorized representatives receive, or if the information (whether in electronic mail format, on computer hard drives or otherwise) held by the Company or any Subsidiary as of the Closing includes, information that relates to the business operations or other strategic matters of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company and the Subsidiaries), such information shall be held in confidence on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in any applicable confidentiality agreement or in _Section 7.1(e)_ , as applicable, but the term of the restriction on the disclosure and use of such information 

    ##### 

  

    

shall continue in effect as to such information for a period of two years from
the Closing. The Buyer further agrees that if Seller, the Company or any
Subsidiary inadvertently furnishes to the Buyer copies of or access to
information that is subject to clause (2) of the second preceding sentence,
the Buyer will, upon Sellers request promptly return same to Seller, the
Company or such Subsidiary together with any and all extracts therefrom or
notes pertaining thereto (whether in electronic or other format) and delete
any e-mail containing any such information after providing copies of such
e-mail to Seller. The Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller
and its Affiliates from and against any Losses asserted against or suffered
by Seller or its Affiliates relating to, resulting from, or arising out of
the negligence of Buyer or its authorized representatives in performing any
examinations or inspections pursuant to this _Section 7.1(a)_. 

   

 (b) _Retention by Seller_. The Buyer agrees that Seller may retain (i) a copy of all materials included in the Data Room, together with a copy of all documents referred to in such materials, (ii) all books and records prepared in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including bids received from others and information relating to such bids, (iii) copies of any books and records which may be relevant in connection with disputes arising hereunder, (iv) all consolidating and consolidated financial information and all other accounting books and records prepared or used in connection with the preparation of financial statements of Seller or any of its Affiliates, and (v) all Retained E-Mail; provided however, that if the Closing occurs Seller shall not disclose any of the foregoing to any Third Party without the prior written consent of Buyer unless Seller is advised by legal counsel that such disclosure is required by Applicable Law and provides prompt Notice of such advice to Buyer. 

   

 (c) _Record Preservation by Buyer_. The Buyer agrees that Buyer shall preserve and keep all books and records relating to the business or operations of any of the Company and the Subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date in Buyers possession for a period of at least 10 years from the Closing Date. After such 10-year period, before Buyer shall dispose of any of such books and records, at least 90 calendar days prior Notice to such effect shall be given by Buyer to Seller, and Seller shall be given an opportunity, at its cost and expense, to remove and retain all or any part of such books and records as Seller may select. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer agrees that it shall preserve and keep all books and records of the Company and the Subsidiaries relating to any investigation instituted by a Governmental Entity or any litigation (whether or not existing on the Closing Date) if any possibility exists that such investigation or litigation may relate to matters occurring prior to the Closing, without regard to the 10-year period set forth in this _Section 7.1(c)_. 

   

 (d) _Cooperation_. Each Party agrees that it will cooperate with and make available to the other Party during normal business hours, all books and records, information and employees (without substantial disruption of employment) retained and remaining in existence with respect to the Company and the Subsidiaries after the Closing Date which are necessary or useful in connection with (i) any Tax inquiry, audit, investigation or dispute, (ii) any litigation or investigation, or (iii) any other matter requiring any such books and records, information or employees for any reasonable business purpose; provided that with respect to providing the Buyer access to Retained E-Mail, Seller need provide access to the Buyer upon the Buyers request, and need furnish the Buyer with copies of, only those portions of the Retained E-Mail that pertain or relate to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or their respective business or assets. The Party requesting any such books and records, information, or employees shall bear 

    ##### 

  

    

all of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and
reimbursement for the reasonable salaries and employee benefits for those
employees who are made available) reasonably incurred in connection with
providing such books and records, information, or employees. Seller may
require certain financial information relating to the Company and the
Subsidiaries businesses for periods prior to the Closing Date for the
purpose of filing federal, state, local, and foreign Tax Returns and other
governmental reports, and Buyer agrees to furnish such information to Seller
at Sellers request and expense. 

   

 (e) _Confidentiality_. The Parties agree that the terms and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and information provided to the Buyer in connection with the execution of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be subject to the same standard of confidentiality as is contained in any confidentiality agreement regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement between Seller and the Buyer or, if no such confidentiality agreement exists, the standards and procedures used by each of Seller and the Buyer in maintaining its own confidential information, but in any case, shall be no less than the standards of confidentiality reasonable and typical for transactions of this kind. 

   

 7.2 _Antitrust, FCC and Other Authorizations and Consents_. 

   

 (a) _Filings_. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of, and to give all notices to and make all filings with, all Governmental Entities (including those pertaining to approval from the FCC, if required, and other Regulatory Approvals) and other Third Parties that may be or become necessary for its execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and will cooperate fully with the other Party in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders and approvals, giving such notices, and making such filings. To the extent required by the HSR Act, each Party shall (i) file or cause to be filed, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than the first business day after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, with the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice, all reports and other documents required to be filed by such Party under the HSR Act concerning the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) promptly comply with or cause to be complied with any requests by the Federal Trade Commission or the United States Department of Justice for additional information concerning such transactions, in each case so that the waiting period applicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act shall expire as soon as practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Each Party agrees to request, and to cooperate with the other Party in requesting, early termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. Buyer shall pay the filing fees payable in connection with the filings by the Parties required by the HSR Act. 

   

 (b) _Transfer_. If the transfer of any instrument, contract, license, lease, permit, or other document to Buyer hereunder shall require the consent of any party thereto other than Seller, then this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign the same, and such item shall not be assigned to or assumed by Buyer, if an actual or attempted assignment thereof would constitute a breach thereof or default thereunder. In such case, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and each shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consents to the extent required of such other parties and, if and when any such consents are obtained, to transfer the applicable instrument, contract, license, lease, permit or other document. If any such consent cannot be 

    ##### 

  

    

obtained, Seller shall cooperate in any reasonable arrangement designed to
obtain for Buyer all benefits, privileges, obligations and privileges of the
applicable instrument, contract, license, lease, permit or document,
including, without limitation, possession, use, risk of loss, potential for
gain and dominion, control and demand. Buyer agrees that (a) if any of the
assets referred to in _Section 7.11_ require the consent of any party
thereto other than the Company, any Subsidiary, Seller or any of its
Affiliates and such consent is not received prior to Closing, Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate and each shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain such consents to the extent required of such other parties and, if
and when any such consents are obtained, to transfer the applicable
instrument, contract, license, lease, permit, or other document, and (b) if
any such consent cannot be obtained, Buyer shall cooperate in any reasonable
arrangement designed to obtain for Seller all benefits, privileges,
obligations and privileges of the applicable instrument, contract, license,
lease, permit, or document, including, without limitation, possession, use,
risk of loss, potential for gain and dominion, control and demand. 

   

 (c) _Third Party Consents_. The Parties shall each use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers, authorizations and approvals of all Third Parties required in connection with the Closing and the performance of this Agreement as soon as practicable. The Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to assist Seller in obtaining any consents of Third Parties necessary or advisable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including providing to such Third Parties such financial statements and other publicly available financial information with respect to the Buyer as such Third Parties may reasonably request. 

   

 (d) _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (to the extent a higher standard is indicated) each of the Parties will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable consistent with Applicable Law to consummate and make effective in the most expeditious manner practicable the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 7.3 _Alternative Transactions_. 

   

 (a) From and after the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company and Seller shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and (using XOs and Sellers commercially reasonable efforts) their respective attorneys, investment bankers, accountants and other agents and representatives (collectively, the " _Representatives_ ") to, (i) cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with Third Parties conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to the direct or indirect sale, transfer or other disposition, in one or more transactions, of all or substantially all, or any material portion, of the assets or stock of the Company, Seller or the Business (an " _Alternative Transaction_ ") and (ii) not initiate or solicit any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to an Alternative Transaction. In addition to the notification required under  _Section 7.3(c)_, from and after the date hereof, the Company shall notify the Buyer promptly after receipt by the Company or Seller (or any of its Representatives) of any inquiry relating to any potential Alternative Transaction and the terms of such proposal or inquiry, including the identity of the Person and its affiliates making the same, that it may receive in respect of any such transaction, and shall keep the Buyer informed on a current basis with respect to any significant 

    ##### 

  

    

developments with respect to the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
provisions of this _Section 7.3(a)_ shall not apply to the Companys ongoing
discussions and negotiations with the Competing Bidder and its investment
bankers, attorneys, agents and other representatives through November 15,
2005. 

   

 (b) Prior to the date hereof, the Special Committee has affirmatively recommended, and the Board, acting upon such affirmative recommendation of the Special Committee, has adopted a resolution resolving (subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement) to recommend that the stockholders of the Company and Seller vote for the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Related Documents (in each case, the Special Committee or Boards " _Recommendation_ "). Subject to _Section 7.3(c)_ and _Section 7.3(d)_ , neither the Board nor the Special Committee shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in each case, in a manner adverse to Buyer, the Recommendation or make any statement, filing or release in connection with the Stockholders Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the Recommendation, (ii) approve, recommend or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Alternative Transaction and/or (iii) enter into (or cause Seller to enter into) any letter of intent, agreement in principle or acquisition agreement relating to any Alternative Transaction. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing _Section 7.3(a)_ and _Section 7.3(b)_, if, prior to Stockholder Approval, (i) either the Company or Seller has received a Competing Proposal or a bona fide unsolicited written proposal for an Alternative Transaction from a Third Party and (ii) the Special Committee has reasonably determined that such Competing Proposal or proposed Alternative Transaction constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Special Committee or the Board acting upon the Recommendation of the Special Committee, may change its Recommendation and following such change, may take any of the actions described in _Section 7.3(a)_ and may enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, but only if (A) the Company or the Special Committee notifies the Buyer in writing of its intention to take such action at least three (3) business days prior to taking such action, specifying the material terms of such Superior Proposal and identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal, and (B) Buyer does not make, within three (3) business days of receipt of such written notification, an offer that the Special Committee determines, in good faith after consultation with its legal and financial advisors, is at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Superior Proposal, it being understood that the Seller shall not change the Recommendation as a result of such Superior Proposal or enter into any binding agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal prior to the expiration of such three (3) business day period, and that the Company shall postpone or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting, as necessary, to accommodate the procedures set forth in this sentence. If within such three (3) business day period, Buyer makes an offer that the Special Committee determines, in good faith after consultation with its legal and financial advisors, is at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Superior Proposal, the Company, Seller and their respective Representatives shall continue to negotiate in good faith with each of Buyer and the Competing Bidder or Third Party bidder, as the case may be, until the Special Committee reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with, and based in part on the advice of, its legal and financial advisors, that the final proposal of either Buyer or the Competing Bidder or Third Party bidder, as the case may be (such party, the "Superior Bidder") is more favorable to the Company than the final proposal made by the other bidding party (such party, the "Inferior Bidder") after taking into account any conditions to and risks of 

    ##### 

  

    

consummation of such proposal; provided, however, in no event shall the
Special Committee make any such determination without providing the then
Inferior Bidder with an additional three (3) business days to increase its
proposal and thereby become the Superior Bidder. After such three (3)
business day period, the Board, acting upon the Recommendation of the Special
Committee, may approve or recommend that the stockholders of the Company and
Seller vote for any Competing Proposal or Alternative Transaction that the
Special Committee has determined constitutes a Superior Proposal and
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 11.1(c)_ 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.3_ to the contrary, but subject to Section 7.3(c), the Parties agree that the Board or the Special Committee may take to the Companys and Sellers stockholders and disclose to them a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act and may make any disclosure required under Applicable Law or any disclosure to the Companys and Sellers stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board, after consultation with its legal and financial advisors, such disclosure is necessary for the Board or the Special Committee to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Companys and Sellers stockholders under Applicable Law. 

   

 7.4 _Employee Benefit Matters_. 

   

 (a) _Transfer of Employees_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries listed on _Schedule 7.4(a)(i)_ shall be transferred to, and become employees of, Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company and the Subsidiaries) (the " _Seller s Retained Employees_"). On or prior to the Closing Date, the employees of Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company and the Subsidiaries) listed on _Schedule 7.4(a)(ii)_ shall be transferred to, and become employees of, the Company or any Subsidiary (the " _Retained Employees_ ").

 (c) _Severance Benefits_. Buyer agrees that, in the event the employment of any Transferred Employee is terminated by Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer, as applicable, during the one-year period immediately following the Closing Date and as a result such Transferred Employee ceases employment with the Buyer and all its Affiliates, Buyer shall provide such Transferred Employee with severance benefits equal to the greater of either (i) the severance benefits available to employees in comparable positions within Buyers organization or (ii) the severance benefits available to such Transferred Employee under the Change in Control Severance Plan for Certain Covered Executives (Director and Above) of XO (the " _XO Severance Plan_ ") and the standard severance plan of XO (the " _XO Standard Plan_ "), as applicable to such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, had such Transferred Employee been terminated under the same circumstances by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller. For purposes 

    ##### 

  

    

of this Section 7.4(c) the parties agree that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be deemed to be a "Change in Control" under Section 3 of
the XO Severance Plan. 

   

 (d) _Other Employee Benefits_. For a period of at least one year following the Closing Date (commencing on the Closing Date), Buyer shall provide, or shall cause an Affiliate of Buyer to provide, the Transferred Employees with compensation and employee benefits under the compensation and employee benefit plans or arrangements (other than equity-based compensation) maintained by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer (which may include the Company Employee Plans acquired by the Buyer upon consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) (the " _Buyer Employee Plans_ ") that are at least as favorable in the aggregate as those employee benefits currently provided to the Transferred Employees by Seller and its Affiliates under the Seller Employee Plans and Company Employee Plans (the " _Current Employee Benefits_ "). To the extent that Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer does not maintain Buyer Employee Plans that provide for the Current Employee Benefits as of the Closing Date, then on or prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall establish, or cause one or more Affiliates of Buyer to establish, one or more Buyer Employee Plans to provide for such Current Employee Benefits to ensure that there is no lapse in Current Employee Benefit coverage for the Transferred Employees on or following the Closing Date. For purposes of participation in any Buyer Employee Plan, Buyer and its Affiliates shall recognize (or cause to be recognized) prior service of the Transferred Employees with Seller and its Affiliates and any predecessor entities (and any other service credited by Seller and its Affiliates under Seller Employee Plans or Company Employee Plans) for (i) vesting, eligibility to participate and eligibility to commence benefits for all such Buyer Employee Plans, and (ii) benefit accrual with respect to vacation, sick leave and other time off polices. From and after the Closing Date, with respect to any welfare benefits that are provided to the Transferred Employees, Buyer and its Affiliates shall (i) waive any pre-existing condition limitations and waiting periods (without any evidence of insurability) under the Buyer Employee Plans and (ii) credit any flexible spending account balances, deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket expenses under any applicable Buyer Employee Plans with respect to which contributions were made by or deductibles, co-payments and/or expenses were incurred by the Transferred Employees and/or their beneficiaries under the Seller Employee Plans and/or Company Employee Plans during the portion of the applicable plan year prior to the Closing Date, as applicable. The provisions of this _Section 7.4_ shall apply to any Transferred Employees who are on disability or leave of absence. Buyer shall assume full responsibility for providing COBRA Continuation Coverage to Transferred Employees and former employees of the Company or the Subsidiaries who are "MandA Qualified Beneficiaries" as the term is defined in Treas. Reg. §§ 54.4980B-9. 

   

 (e) _Stock Appreciation Rights Program_. Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Company to establish an equity appreciation rights program (the "SARs Program") (or other equivalent equity compensation or long term bonus plan) which shall enable the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to grant to the Transferred Employees cash-settled appreciation rights ("SARs") (similar to the stock appreciation rights of a corporate entity) on the LLC membership interests of the Company or such other equity interests as shall represent the equity ownership in the Companys business. The terms and conditions of the SARs Program shall be substantially equivalent to those of the Companys 2002 Stock Incentive Plan. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) _Bonus Plan_.

    ##### 

  

    

from and after the Closing Seller shall, and shall cause the applicable
Affiliates to, cease to use in any form whatsoever any marks, designs, logos,

If any claims are made or losses occur prior to the Closing Date that relate solely to the business activities of the Excluded Assets and such claims, or the claims associated with such losses, may be made against the policies retained by the Company or the Buyer, then Buyer and the Company shall use its reasonable commercial efforts so that Seller can file, notice, and otherwise continue to pursue these claims pursuant to the terms of such policies. Buyer shall be reimbursed by Seller (or otherwise indemnified and held harmless) for any Losses or other costs incurred by Buyer (including (i) by way of any reduction in, or loss of, available insurance to cover other insurable losses or associated expenses of Buyer, or (ii) increases in premium) arising out of Buyer pursuing these claims under such policies. 

   

 7.14 _Real Property Rights_. 

   

 (a) At any time following the date hereof through the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Review Period_ "), Buyer shall cooperate with Seller to effect the (i) assignment or transfer to Seller, (ii) sublease to Seller, or (iii) use or occupancy by Seller, in each case of any rights of the Company or its affiliates to install, maintain, or operate telecommunications equipment on the roof of any leased real property of Company or its affiliates, including any rights to associated risers, conduit, technical space, office space, utilities, access, and other customary rights (in aggregate, " _Roof Rights_ "). In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer agrees to provide Seller within sixty (60) days of the date hereof with copies of all real property leases, draft or proposed real property leases or term sheets, and contact information for all lessors or proposed lessors of such property. 

   

 (b) Buyer agrees to assign to Seller on commercially reasonable terms any and all Roof Rights requested in writing by Seller to the extent such assignment is permitted under the applicable leases or building licenses, or if Buyer and Seller through the exercise of reasonable efforts are able to obtain the consent of the applicable lessor or licensor to such assignment. Buyer agrees that, in the event any proposed assignment is not permitted or obtained, Buyer shall enter into a sublease of such lease for the purpose of conveying the requested Roof Rights to Seller to the extent such sublease is permitted under the terms of the applicable lease, or if Buyer and Seller through the exercise of reasonable efforts are able to obtain the consent of the applicable lessor to such subtenancy. Buyer agrees that Seller shall be permitted to contact, discuss, and negotiate the terms of any such proposed assignment or subtenancy with the applicable lessors or proposed lessors provided that Seller shall provide reasonable advance notice to Buyer of any intended written or oral communications with lessors or such licensors 

    ##### 

  

    

and permit Buyer to participate in any such discussions or negotiations. In
the event that any assignment or subtenancy is not permitted under the terms
of the applicable lease and consent can not be obtained with respect thereto
by Buyer and Seller through the exercise of reasonable efforts, Buyer agrees
to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain wireless
reserve capacity services from Seller to provide fixed wireless
telecommunications services to the customer or customers identified by
Seller, and to engage Seller to provide the wireless spectrum and related
technical services to permit Buyer to provide such services (a "Resale
Implementation"). In connection with such Resale Implementation, Buyer shall
enter into subcontracting or services agreements on commercially reasonable
terms to permit Seller to install the necessary equipment and complete the
technical analysis to permit Buyer to provide the services to the end user
customer in the Resale Implementation. 

   

 (c) Seller agrees that it shall not have any right to alter, or seek the alteration of, the terms of existing leases or building licenses without the expressed written consent of Buyer, except to seek the conveyance of Roof Rights from Buyer to Seller as provided in _Section 7.14(b)_. Seller agrees that the Roof Rights do not, and will not, include any rights in use by Buyer at such time, or planned to be used by Buyer within six months of the end of the Renewal Period. Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer from any damages, claims, costs, expenses, or other liabilities arising from any agreement by Seller amending the terms of any existing lease or building license not agreed to in writing by Buyer. 

   

 (d) Upon renewal of any lease containing Roof Rights, Buyer shall cooperate with Seller to effect the renewal of such Roof Rights at the expense of Seller. 

   

 7.15 _Termination of Representation and Warranties/Disclaimer_. 

   

 (a) All representations and warranties contained in this Agreement will terminate effective as of the Closing Date and shall be of no further force and effect. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, it is the explicit intent of each Party that Seller is not making any representations or warranties whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly given in _Article 4_ of this Agreement, and it is understood that, except for the representations and warranties contained herein, Buyer takes the Equity Interests and the business and assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries "as is" and "where is." Without limiting the generality of the immediately foregoing, except for the representations and warranties contained in _Article 4_, Seller hereby expressly disclaims and negates any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, at common law, by statute, or otherwise, relating to (a) the condition of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries (including any implied or expressed warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, or of conformity to models or samples of materials) or (b) any infringement by Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and the Subsidiaries) of any patent or proprietary right of any Third Party; it being the intention of Seller and Buyer that the business and assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries are to be accepted by Buyer in their present condition and state of repair. It is understood that any cost estimates, projections, or other predictions contained or referred to in the offering materials that have been provided to Buyer are not and shall not be deemed to be representations or warranties of Seller, any of its Affiliates, the Company or the Subsidiaries.

Company and the subsidiaries. At Buyers request, Seller and its subsidiaries
(including LMDS Holdings) shall make or join with Buyer in making any Non
Adverse Election, if the making of such election does not subject Seller or
any of its subsidiaries (including LMDS Holdings) to any unreimbursed cost,

subsidiaries (including LMDS Holdings). Seller shall, at the request of and
to the extent requested by Buyer, make the apportionment elections pursuant
to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-95(c) with respect to the items

Such notice shall contain factual information describing the asserted Tax Claim in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other document received from any Taxing Authority or other Person in respect of any such asserted Tax Claim.
