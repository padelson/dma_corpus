TERMS OF THE TRANSACTION</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1 <U>Agreement to Sell and to Purchase the Equity Interests</U>. At the Closing, and on
the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement, Seller shall sell, assign, transfer,
deliver and convey the Equity Interests to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and accept the Equity
Interests, in each case free and clear of all Encumbrances.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2 <U>Purchase Price and Payment</U>. In consideration of the sale of the Equity Interests
to Buyer, Buyer shall pay to Seller at the Closing, in immediately available funds, an amount equal
to the Base Purchase Price<I>. </I>The Base Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment in respect of
the Adjustment Amount as provided in Section&nbsp;2.3. Such payment shall be made by confirmed wire
transfer to a bank account or accounts to be designated by Seller in the amount shown in Seller&#146;s
statement delivered to Buyer in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;2.3</U> (which may include the accounts
of lender under the Credit Agreement and holders of Preferred Securities).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3 <U>Calculation and Payment of Adjustment Amount</U>.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <U>Adjustment Amount</U>. The &#147;<U>Adjustment Amount</U>&#148; equals the amount by which the
amount of Net Working Capital shown on the Closing Date Balance Sheet is greater than or less than
the Baseline Working Capital. For the avoidance of doubt, if the amount of Net Working Capital
shown on the Closing Date Balance Sheet is greater than the Baseline Working Capital, the Base
Purchase Price will be effectively increased by the Adjustment Amount and if the amount of Net
Working Capital shown on the Closing Date Balance Sheet is less than the Baseline Working Capital,
the Base Purchase Price will be effectively decreased by the Adjustment Amount.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Closing Date Balance Sheet and Adjustment Amount</U>. As promptly as practicable
after the Closing Date, and in any event not later than sixty (60)&nbsp;days after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller (i)&nbsp;a balance sheet of the Business showing Net Working
Capital as of the Closing Date (the &#147;<U>Closing Date Balance Sheet</U>&#148;)

Sheet, and (ii)&nbsp;a statement of Buyer (the &#147;<U>Adjustment Statement</U>&#148;) showing in reasonable
detail its calculation of the Adjustment Amount. Buyer agrees, at no cost to Seller, to give
Seller and its authorized representatives reasonable access to the Company&#146;s (and any Subsidiary&#146;s)
employees, premises, offices and other facilities and to the Company&#146;s and each Subsidiary&#146;s books

Seller and Buyer as to the Adjustment Amount on the 30th day following the date the Adjustment
Statement is received by Seller (the &#147;<U>Dispute Deadline Date</U>&#148;), unless prior to the Dispute
Deadline Date, Seller delivers Notice to Buyer of its disagreement. Seller&#146;s Notice shall set
forth all of Seller&#146;s disputed items together with Seller&#146;s proposed changes thereto, including an
explanation in reasonable detail of the basis on which Seller proposes such changes. If Seller has
delivered a timely Notice of disagreement, then Buyer and Seller shall use their good faith efforts
to reach written agreement on the disputed items to determine the Adjustment Amount, which in no
event shall be more favorable to Buyer than reflected on the Adjustment Statement prepared by Buyer
nor more favorable to Seller than shown in the proposed changes delivered by Seller pursuant to its
Notice of disagreement. If all of Seller&#146;s disputed items have not been resolved by Buyer and
Seller by the 60th day following Seller&#146;s receipt of the Adjustment Statement, then Seller&#146;s
disputed items shall be submitted to binding arbitration by an independent nationally recognized
accounting firm without any material financial relationship to either Buyer or Seller, as mutually
selected by Buyer and Seller within five (5)&nbsp;business days after the end of the foregoing 60-day
period (or in the absence of agreement between Buyer and Seller by the close of business on such
5th business day as selected by Seller). The fees and expenses of such arbitration shall be borne
50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer. The determination of the Adjustment Amount by such arbitration
shall be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller as to the Adjustment Amount.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <U>Final Date</U>. The Adjustment Amount shall be deemed to be finally determined in the
amount set forth in the Adjustment Statement on the Dispute Deadline Date unless a dispute Notice
is given in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;2.3(c)</U> with respect to the calculation thereof. If such a
dispute Notice is given, the Adjustment Amount shall be deemed finally determined on the date that
the selected accounting firm gives Notice to Buyer and Seller of its determination with respect to
all disputes regarding the calculation thereof, or, if earlier, the date on which Seller and Buyer
agree in writing on the amount thereof, in which case the Adjustment Amount shall be calculated in
accordance with such determination or agreement, as the case may be.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) <U>Payments</U>. If the Adjustment Amount, as finally determined, reflects that the
amount of Net Working Capital shown on the Closing Date Balance Sheet is greater than the Baseline
Working Capital, then Buyer shall pay to Seller the Adjustment Amount, plus interest on such amount
from (and including) the Closing Date to (but excluding) the date of payment at the Prime Rate. If
the Adjustment Amount, as finally determined, reflects that the amount of Net Working Capital shown
on the Closing Date Balance Sheet is less than the Baseline Working Capital, then Seller shall pay
to Buyer the Adjustment Amount, plus interest on such amount from (and including) the Closing Date
to (but excluding) the date of payment at the Prime Rate.

covenant and agree as follows:

and its authorized representatives reasonable access, during regular business hours and upon
reasonable advance Notice, to such employees, facilities, and such books and records, of the
Company and the Subsidiaries, as are reasonably necessary to allow the Buyer and its authorized

any representation or warranty contained in <U>Article&nbsp;4</U> and (ii)&nbsp;shall cause officers of the
Company and the Subsidiaries to furnish the Buyer and its authorized representatives with such
financial and operating data and other information with respect to the Company and the Subsidiaries
as the Buyer may from time to time reasonably request. Seller shall have the right to have a
representative present at all times during any such inspections, interviews and examinations.
Additionally, between the date hereof and the Closing, the Buyer shall hold in confidence all such
information on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in <U>Section&nbsp;7.1(e)</U> or any
applicable confidentiality agreement between the Parties containing standard terms for a
transaction of the nature contemplated by this Agreement (and in no event less than the standard

<U>Section&nbsp;7.3</U> and information and analysis (including financial analysis) relating to such
bids, or (2)&nbsp;any information the disclosure of which would jeopardize any privilege available to
the Company, any Subsidiary or Seller relating to such information or would cause Seller, the
Company, any Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates to breach a confidentiality obligation or (3)
except to the extent contemplated in <U>Section&nbsp;7.1(d)</U>, Retained E-Mail (the &#147;<U>Excluded

or if the information (whether in electronic mail format, on computer hard drives or otherwise)
held by the Company or any Subsidiary as of the Closing includes, information that relates to the
business operations or other strategic matters of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the

The Buyer further agrees that if Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary inadvertently furnishes to
the Buyer copies of or access to information that is subject to clause (2)&nbsp;of the second preceding
sentence, the Buyer will, upon Seller&#146;s request promptly return same to Seller, the Company or such
Subsidiary together with any and all extracts therefrom or notes pertaining thereto (whether in
electronic or other format) and delete any e-mail containing any such information after providing
copies of such e-mail to Seller. The Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and
its Affiliates from and against any Losses asserted against or suffered by Seller or its Affiliates
relating to, resulting from, or arising out of the negligence of Buyer or its authorized
representatives in performing any examinations or inspections pursuant to this <U>Section

Seller or any of its Affiliates, and (v)&nbsp;all Retained E-Mail; provided however, that if the Closing
occurs Seller shall not disclose any of the foregoing to any Third Party without the prior written
consent of Buyer unless Seller is advised by legal counsel that such disclosure is required by
Applicable Law and provides prompt Notice of such advice to Buyer.

all books and records relating to the business or operations of any of the Company and the
Subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date in Buyer&#146;s possession for a period of at least 10&nbsp;years
from the Closing Date. After such 10-year period, before Buyer shall dispose of any of such books
and records, at least 90 calendar days&#146; prior Notice to such effect shall be given by Buyer to
Seller, and Seller shall be given an opportunity, at its cost and expense, to remove and retain all
or any part of such books and records as Seller may select. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer
agrees that it shall preserve and keep all books and records of the Company and the Subsidiaries
relating to any investigation instituted by a Governmental Entity or any litigation (whether or not
existing on the Closing Date) if any possibility exists that such investigation or litigation may

with (i)&nbsp;any Tax inquiry, audit, investigation or dispute, (ii)&nbsp;any litigation or investigation, or
(iii)&nbsp;any other matter requiring any such books and records, information or employees for any
reasonable business purpose; provided that with respect to providing the Buyer access to Retained
E-Mail, Seller need provide access to the Buyer upon the Buyer&#146;s request, and need furnish the
Buyer with copies of, only those portions of the Retained E-Mail that pertain or relate to the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries or their respective business or assets. The Party requesting

other document to Buyer hereunder shall require the consent of any party thereto other than Seller,
then this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign the same, and such item shall not
be assigned to or assumed by Buyer, if an actual or attempted assignment thereof would constitute a
