    final disposition of such matter; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
    payment of such expense incurred by an Indemnitee in advance of
    the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon
    receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to
    repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall
    ultimately be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to
    be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article.
    Such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the
    financial ability of the Indemnitee to make such repayment.

    (10)&#160;<I><U>PROCEDURE FOR
    INDEMNIFICATION</U>.</I>&#160;&#160;In order to obtain
    indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to
    Section&#160;5,&#160;6, 7 or 9 of this Article, the Indemnitee
    shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including in
    such request such documentation and information as is reasonably
    available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to
    determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled
    to indemnification or advancement of expenses. Any such
    indemnification or advancement of expenses shall be made
    promptly, and in any event within 60&#160;days after receipt by
    the Corporation of the written request of the Indemnitee, unless
    with respect to requests under Section&#160;5, 6 or 9 the
    Corporation determines, by clear and convincing evidence, within
    such <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">60-day</FONT>
    period that the Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard
    of conduct set forth in Section&#160;5 or&#160;6, as the case
    may be. Such determination shall be made in each instance by
    (a)&#160;a majority vote of the directors of the Corporation
    consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the
    action, suit or proceeding in question (&#147;disinterested
    directors&#148;), even though less than quorum, (b)&#160;a
    majority vote of a quorum of the outstanding shares of stock of
    all classes entitled to vote for directors, voting as a single
    class, which quorum shall consist of stockholders who are not at
    that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question,
    (c)&#160;independent legal counsel (who may be regular legal
    counsel to the Corporation), or (d)&#160;a court of competent
    jurisdiction.

    (11)&#160;<I><U>REMEDIES</U>.</I>&#160;&#160;The right to
    indemnification or advances as granted by this Article shall be
    enforceable by the Indemnitee in any court of competent
    jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or
    in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within the
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">60-day</FONT>
    period referred to above in Section&#160;6. Unless otherwise
    provided by law, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is
    not entitled to indemnification or advanced of expenses under
    this Article shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of
    the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the
    commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in
    the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable
    standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the
    Corporation pursuant to Section&#160;10 that the Indemnitee has
    not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense
    to the action or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has
    not met the applicable standard of conduct. The
    Indemnitee&#146;s expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees)
    incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right
    to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding
    shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.
