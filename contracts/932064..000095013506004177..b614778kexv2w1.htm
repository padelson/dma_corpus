   Agreement  and Plan of Merger 

  



  

  This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this  " _Agreement_ ") is dated as of
June 29, 2006,  among EMC Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (the  
_Buyer_ "), Entrust Merger Corporation, a  Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Buyer  (" _Merger Sub_ "), and RSA Security Inc., a 
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  



  

   _Introduction_  

  



  

  This Agreement contemplates the merger (the  " _Merger_ ") of Merger Sub
with and into the  Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in  this Agreement, with the Company surviving the Merger. As a 
result of the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned  subsidiary of
the Buyer. The Boards of Directors of each of the  Buyer, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved and declared  advisable the Merger and adopted this
Agreement. 

  



  

  Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company therefore agree as follows: 

  



  

   ARTICLE I 
   

  



  

   The  Merger   

  



  

  1.1 __Effective Time of the  Merger_._ Subject to the provisions of this 
Agreement, prior to the Closing, the Buyer and the Company shall  jointly
prepare, and immediately following the Closing, the  Company shall cause to
be filed with the Secretary of State of  the State of Delaware, a certificate
of merger (the  " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form as is  required
by, and executed by the Company in accordance with, the  relevant provisions
of the General Corporation Law of the State  of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and
shall make all  other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The
Merger  shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of  Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or  at such later time
as is established by the Buyer and the  Company and set forth in the
Certificate of Merger (the  " _Effective Time_ "). 

  



  

  1.2 __Closing_._ The closing of  the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at  10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on a date to be specified by the  Buyer
and the Company (the " _Closing Date_ "),  which shall be no later than the
second Business Day after  satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in  Article VII (other than delivery of items to be delivered  at the
Closing and other than satisfaction of those conditions  that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, it  being understood that the occurrence
of the Closing shall remain  subject to the delivery of such items and the
satisfaction or  waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at the offices
of  WilmerHale, 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts, unless  another
date, place or time is agreed to in writing by the Buyer  and the Company.
For purposes of this Agreement, a  " _Business Day_ " shall be any day other
than  (a) a Saturday or Sunday or (b) a day on which banking  institutions
located in Boston, Massachusetts are permitted or  required by law, executive
order or governmental decree to  remain closed. 

  



  

  1.3 __Effects of the  Merger_._ At the Effective Time (a) the  separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Merger Sub  shall be merged with and
into the Company (the Company following  the Merger is sometimes referred to
herein as the  " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and (b) the  certificate of
incorporation of the Company as in effect on the  date of this Agreement
shall be amended in its entirety to read  as set forth on _Exhibit A_, until
further amended in  accordance with the DGCL. In addition, subject to 
Section 6.8(b) hereof, the Buyer shall cause the bylaws of  the Surviving
Corporation to be amended and restated in their  entirety so that,
immediately following the Effective Time, they  are identical to the bylaws
of Merger Sub as in effect  immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
that all  references to the name of Merger Sub therein shall be changed to 
refer to the name of the Company, and, as so amended and  restated, such
bylaws shall be the bylaws of the Surviving  Corporation, until further
amended in accordance with the DGCL.  The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 259  of the DGCL. 

  



  

  1.4 __Directors and Officers of the Surviving  Corporation_._ The
directors and officers of  Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the  initial directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of  incorporation
and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  



  

   ARTICLE II 
   

  



  

   Conversion  of Securities   

  



  

  2.1 __Conversion of Capital  Stock_._ As of the Effective Time and upon
the  terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, by virtue  of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder  of any shares of
the capital stock of the Company or capital  stock of Merger Sub: 

  



  

  (a) __Capital Stock of Merger  Sub_._ Each share of the common stock of
Merger  Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time
shall be converted into and become one fully paid and  nonassessable share of
common stock, $0.01 par value per  share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  



  

  (b) __Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Buyer-Owned  Stock_._ All shares
of common stock,  $0.01 par value per share, of the Company (" _Company 
Common Stock_ ") that are owned by the Company as  treasury stock or by any
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company  and any shares of Company Common
Stock owned by the Buyer,  Merger Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of
the Buyer  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and 
shall cease to exist and no stock of the Buyer or other  consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  



  

  (c) __Merger Consideration for Company Common  Stock_._ Subject to Section
2.2, each  share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled 
in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares (as  defined in
Section 2.4(a) below)) issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be automatically  converted into the right to receive
$28 in cash per share (the  " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the
Effective  Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be 
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease  to exist,
and each holder of a certificate representing any such  shares of Company
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights  with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger  Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(c)
upon the  surrender of such certificate in accordance with  Section 2.2,
without interest. 

  



  

  (d) __Adjustments to Merger  Consideration_._ The Merger Consideration
shall  be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, 
stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any  dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company  Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization or other like  change with respect to
Company Common Stock occurring (or for  which a record date is established)
after the date hereof and  prior to the Effective Time. 

  



  

  2.2 __Exchange of  Certificates_._ The procedures for exchanging 
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger  Consideration
pursuant to the Merger are as follows: 

  



  

  (a) __Exchange Agent_._ At or prior to  the Effective Time, the Buyer
shall deposit with Citibank, N.A.  or another bank or trust company mutually
and reasonably  acceptable to the Buyer and the Company (the " _Exchange 
Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of  Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time, for payment through the
Exchange Agent in  accordance with this Section 2.2, cash in an amount 
sufficient to make payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant  to Section
2.1(c) in exchange for all of the outstanding  shares of Company Common Stock
(the " _Exchange  Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any 
other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the  Exchange Agent as
directed by the Buyer; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such investments shall
be in obligations of  or guaranteed by the United States of America, in
commercial  paper obligations rated  A-1 or  P-1 or  better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or  Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or
in  certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or  bankers
acceptances of commercial banks with capital  exceeding $1 billion (based on
the most recent financial  statements of such bank which are then publicly
available). 

  



  

  (b) __Exchange Procedures_._ Promptly  (and in any event within five
Business Days) after the Effective  Time, the Buyer shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each  holder of record of a certificate 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented  outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (each, a  " _Certificate_ ") (i) a letter of
transmittal  in customary form and (ii) instructions for effecting the 
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger  Consideration
payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a  Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together  with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly  executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be paid promptly  in exchange therefor cash in an amount
equal to the Merger  Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant  to the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate  so
surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. No interest will  be paid or
accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of  such Certificate or
Certificates. In the event of a transfer of  ownership of Company Common
Stock which is not registered in the  transfer records of the Company, the
Merger Consideration may be  paid to a Person (as defined in this Section
2.2(b)) other  than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered
is  registered, if such Certificate is presented to the Exchange  Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and  effect such transfer
and by evidence that any applicable stock  transfer taxes have been paid.
Until surrendered as contemplated  by this Section 2.2, each Certificate
shall be deemed at  any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to  receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as 
contemplated by this Section 2.2. As used in this  Agreement, " _Person_ "
means any individual,  corporation, partnership, limited liability company,
joint  venture, association, trust, Governmental Entity, unincorporated 
organization or other entity. 

  



  

  (c) __No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common  Stock_._ All Merger
Consideration paid upon the  surrender of Certificates in accordance with the
terms hereof  shall be deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of all
rights  pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly 
represented by such Certificates, and from and after the  Effective Time
there shall be no further registration of  transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving  Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock
which were  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after 
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving  Corporation
or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be  cancelled and exchanged
as provided in this Article II  subject to Section 2.2(d). 

  



  

  (d) __Termination of Exchange  Fund_._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which  remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for  one
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the  Buyer, upon demand,
and any holder of Company Common Stock who  has not previously complied with
this Section 2.2 shall be  entitled to receive only from the Buyer (subject
to abandoned  property, escheat and similar laws) payment (only as a
general  unsecured creditor) of its claim for Merger Consideration,  without
interest. 

  



  

  (e) __No Liability_._ To the extent  permitted by applicable law, none of
the Buyer, Merger Sub, the  Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall  be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock  delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable  abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. 

  



  

  (f) __Withholding Rights_._ Each of  the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation
and the Exchange Agent  shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration  otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of  shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to  deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment  under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  " _Code_ "), or any other applicable
state, local  or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld  by the Surviving Corporation, the Buyer or the Exchange Agent,  as
the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be  remitted by the Buyer,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange  Agent, as the case may be, to the
applicable Governmental  Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes
of this  Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of 
Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and  withholding was
made by the Surviving Corporation, the Buyer or  the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be. 

  



  

  (g) __Lost Certificates_._ If any  Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the  making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such  Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent  shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed 
Certificate, the Merger 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company  Common Stock
formerly represented thereby pursuant to this  Agreement; provided, however,
that the Exchange Agent may, in  its reasonable discretion and as a condition
precedent to the  issuance thereof, require the record holder of any such 
Certificate evidencing Merger Consideration to deliver a bond in  such sum as
the Exchange Agent may reasonably direct as  indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Buyer, the  Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent 
and/or any  of their respective representatives or agents with respect to 
such Certificate. 

  



  

  2.3 __Company Stock Plans_._ 

  



  

  (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to  purchase Company
Common Stock (" _Company Stock  Options_ "), whether vested or unvested,
issued under any  stock option plans or other equity-related plans or
agreements  of the Company or otherwise (the " _Company Stock  Plans_ "),
shall be assumed by the Buyer and shall become  an option to acquire, on the
same terms and conditions as were  applicable under the Company Stock Option
immediately prior to  the Effective Time, the number of shares of common
stock,  $.01 par value per share, of the Buyer (" _Buyer  Common Stock_ ")
determined as follows: 

  



  

  (i) the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to  each Company
Stock Option assumed by the Buyer shall be  determined by multiplying the
number of shares of Company Common  Stock that were subject to such Company
Stock Option immediately  prior to the Effective Time by the Conversion Ratio
(as defined  below), and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest 
whole number of shares of Buyer Common Stock; and 

  



  

  (ii) the per share exercise price for the Buyer Common  Stock issuable
upon exercise of each Company Stock Option  assumed by the Buyer shall be
determined by dividing the per  share exercise price of Company Common Stock
subject to such  Company Stock Option, as in effect immediately prior to
the  Effective Time, by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the  resulting
exercise price up to the nearest whole cent. 

  



  

  Any restriction on the exercise of any Company Stock Option  assumed by
the Buyer shall continue in full force and effect and  the term,
exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions  of such Company Stock
Option shall otherwise remain unchanged as  a result of the assumption of
such Company Stock Option, in each  case except to the extent otherwise
provided in any Company  Stock Plan or any stock option or other agreement
between the  holder of a Company Stock Option and the Company. The  "
_Conversion Ratio_ " means the quotient of  (x) the Merger Consideration,
divided by (y) the  average of the closing sale prices of a share of Buyer
Common  Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange for each of the 
five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the  Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if, between  the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the  outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Buyer
Common Stock  are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason  of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock 
dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,  reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction,  then the Conversion Ratio
shall be adjusted to the extent  appropriate to reflect such occurrence. 

  



  

  (iii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall  (A) obtain the
approval of the Company Board for the  transactions described in this Section
2.3 in compliance  with the applicable provisions of the Company Stock Plans
and  agreements and (B) provide Company Stock Option holders  with any
requisite advance notice of the transactions described  in Section 2.3. 

  



  

  (b) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time,  the Buyer shall
provide or make available to the participants in  the Company Stock Plans
information regarding such  participants rights pursuant to the Company
Stock Options,  as provided in this Section 2.3. 

  



  

  (c) The Buyer shall take all corporate action necessary to  reserve for
issuance under the Company Stock Plans a sufficient  number of shares of
Buyer Common Stock for delivery upon  exercise of the Company Stock Options
assumed in accordance with  this Section 2.3. Within two (2) Business Days 
following the Effective Time the Buyer shall file a registration  statement
on  Form S-8  (or any successor form) or another appropriate form with
respect  to the shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to such options and 
shall use its reasonable 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration  statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current  status of the prospectus
or prospectuses contained therein) for  so long as such options remain
outstanding. 

  



  

  (d) The Company shall terminate its 1994 Employee Stock  Purchase Plan, as
amended (the " _Company ESPP_ "),  in accordance with its terms effective as
of immediately prior  to the Effective Time, and there shall be no further
liability  or obligation of the Company (or any successor thereto) upon 
such termination (other than to return funds previously  contributed). 

  



  

  2.4 __Dissenting Shares_._  

  



  

  (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock issued and  outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time that are  held by a holder who has made a proper demand
for appraisal of  such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
DGCL  (any such shares being referred to as " _Dissenting  Shares_ " until
such time as such holder fails to perfect  or otherwise loses such holders
appraisal rights under the  DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be
converted into or  represent the right to receive Merger Consideration in 
accordance with Section 2.1, but shall be entitled only to  such rights as
are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting  Shares. 

  



  

  (b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as  such (through
failure to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the  later of the Effective
Time or the date of loss of such status,  such shares shall automatically be
converted into and shall  represent only the right to receive Merger
Consideration in  accordance with Section 2.1, without interest thereon,
upon  surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such shares. 

  



  

  (c) The Company shall give the Buyer: (i) prompt  notice of any written
demand for appraisal received by the  Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the DGCL, any  withdrawal of any such demand and any other
demand, notice or  instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective
Time  pursuant to the DGCL that relate to such demand; and  (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and  proceedings with respect
to any such demand, notice or  instrument. The Company shall not make any
payment or settlement  offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any
such  demand, notice or instrument unless the Buyer shall have given  its
written consent to such payment or settlement offer. 

  



  

   ARTICLE III   

  



  

  Representations and  Warranties of the Company   

  



  

  The Company represents and warrants to the Buyer and Merger Sub  that the
statements contained in this Article III are true  and correct, except (a) as
disclosed in the Company SEC  Reports filed prior to the date of this
Agreement or (b) as  set forth herein or as disclosed in the disclosure
schedule  delivered by the Company to the Buyer and Merger Sub and dated  as
of the date of this Agreement (the " _Company  Disclosure Schedule_ "). 

  



  

  3.1 __Organization, Standing and  Power_._ The Company is a corporation
duly  organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws  of
the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all requisite  corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its  properties and assets and to carry
on its business as now being  conducted and is duly qualified to do business
and, where  applicable as a legal concept, is in good standing as a foreign 
corporation in each jurisdiction in which the character of the  properties it
owns, operates or leases or the nature of its  activities makes such
qualification necessary, except for such  failures to be so organized,
qualified or in good standing,  individually or in the aggregate, that are
not reasonably likely  to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For
purposes of this  Agreement, the term " _Company Material Adverse  Effect_ "
means any change, event, circumstance,  violation or development that,
individually or taken together  with all other changes, events,
circumstances, violations or  developments, has a materially adverse effect
on (i) the  business, financial condition, operations or results of 
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a  whole, or (ii)
the ability of the Company to consummate the  transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that none of the following, or any
change,  event, circumstance or development 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  resulting or arising from the following, shall constitute, or  shall be
considered in determining whether there has occurred, a  Company Material
Adverse Effect: 

  



  

  (a) economic factors affecting the national, regional or  world economy or
acts of war or terrorism (provided that such  factors or acts do not affect
the Company in a substantially  disproportionate manner as compared to its
competitors); 

  



  

  (b) factors generally affecting the industries or markets  in which the
Company operates (provided that such factors do not  affect the Company in a
substantially disproportionate manner as  compared to its competitors); 

  



  

  (c) actions required to be taken by the parties under this  Agreement or
the pendency or announcement of the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement, including actions of customers  or any delays or cancellations of
orders for products or losses  of employees; 

  



  

  (d) any matters relating to or arising out of the inquiries  and claims
regarding the Companys option grant practices  described in Section 3.12 of
the Company Disclosure  Schedule, as well as any other matters relating to or
arising  out of the option grant practices that are the subject matter of 
such inquiries; 

  



  

  (e) changes in law, rules or regulations; 

  



  

  (f) changes in generally accepted accounting principles; 

  



  

  (g) any action which is specifically required by this  Agreement
(including Section 6.6) or at the written request  of the Buyer; 

  



  

  (h) any fees or expenses incurred in connection with the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; 

  



  

  (i) any failure by the Company to meet any projections,  guidance,
estimates, forecasts or milestones or published  financial or operating
predictions for or during any period  ending (or for which results are
released) on or after the date  hereof (provided that the underlying causes
of any such failures  may (subject to the other provisions of this Agreement)
be taken  into account in making a determination as to whether there has 
been a Company Material Adverse Effect); 

  



  

  (j) any stockholder litigation arising from or relating to  the Merger
based on allegations that either the Companys  entry into this Agreement or
the terms and conditions of this  Agreement constituted a breach of the
fiduciary duties of the  Company Board or that the disclosures in the Proxy
Statement  were inadequate; and 

  



  

  (k) a decline in the price of the Company Common Stock  (provided that the
underlying causes of any such decline may  (subject to the other provisions
of this Agreement) be taken  into account in making a determination as to
whether there has  been a Company Material Adverse Effect). 

  



  

  3.2 __Capitalization_._ 

  



  

  (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company as of the  date of this
Agreement consists of 300,000,000 shares of  Company Common Stock. The rights

properties and assets  and to carry on its business as now being conducted,
and is duly  qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign 
corporation (to the extent such concepts are applicable) in each 
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned,  operated or leased
or the nature of its activities makes such  qualification necessary, except
for such failures to be so  organized, qualified or in good standing,
individually or in the  aggregate, that are not reasonably likely to have a
Company  Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding shares of  capital
stock and other equity securities or interests of each  Subsidiary of the
Company are duly authorized, validly issued,  fully paid, nonassessable and
free of preemptive rights and all  such shares (other than directors
qualifying shares in the  case of  non-U.S. Subsidiaries,  all of which the
Company has the power to cause to be  transferred for no or nominal
consideration to the Company or  the Companys designee) are owned, of record
and  beneficially, by the Company or another of its Subsidiaries free  and
clear of all security interests, liens, claims, pledges,  agreements,
limitations in the Companys voting rights,  charges or other encumbrances.
There are no outstanding or  authorized options, warrants, rights, agreements
or commitments  to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
or  which are binding on any of them providing for the issuance, 
disposition or acquisition of any capital stock of any  Subsidiary of the
Company. There are no outstanding stock  appreciation, phantom stock or

other business association or  entity which is not a Subsidiary of the
Company, other than  securities in a publicly traded company held for
investment by  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and consisting of
less  than 5% of the outstanding capital stock of such company.

and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the  Company in

of,  any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of  the
Company or of the charter, bylaws, or other organizational  document of any
Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) conflict  with, or result in any violation or
breach of, or constitute  (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)

judgment, injunction,  order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or
regulation  applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of 
its or their respective properties or assets, except in the case  of clauses
(ii) and (iii) of this Section 3.4(b)  for any such conflicts, violations,
breaches, defaults,  terminations, cancellations, accelerations, losses,
penalties or  Liens, and for any consents or waivers not obtained, that, 
individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to  result in any
material liability of the Company and its  Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. 

  



  

  (c) No consent, approval, license, permit, order or  authorization of, or
registration, declaration, notice or filing  with, any court, arbitrational

Agreement. 

  



  

  3.8 __Taxes_._

Returns that it was required to file, and all such  Tax Returns were correct

material  liability of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. 
Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has paid on a  timely basis
all Taxes that are shown to be due on any such Tax  Returns. Neither the

successor, by contract or otherwise.  Section 3.8(c) of the Company

similar provision of state, local,  or foreign tax law); (iv) installment
sale or open  transaction disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date;
or  (v) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing  Date, except for

liability of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as  a whole. 

  



  

  (g) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has  participated in
any way (i) in any "tax shelter"  within the meaning of Section 6111 (as in

jurisdictions other than the United States) of the Code or  (ii) in any
"reportable transaction" within the  meaning of Treasury  Regulation Section

nor any of its Subsidiaries nor,  to the Companys Knowledge, any other party
to any Company  Lease is in default under any of the Company Leases, except

not reasonably likely to result in any material  liability of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.  Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries leases,  subleases or licenses any real property to any Person
other than  the Company and its Subsidiaries where such lease, sublease or

all Intellectual Property used  to conduct the business of the Company and

  (a) __No Solicitation or  Negotiation_._ Except as set forth in this 
Section 6.1, until the termination of this Agreement in  accordance with the
terms hereof (the " _Specified  Time_ "), neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries  shall, and the Company shall direct and use reasonable
efforts  to cause its directors, officers, employees, investment bankers,

thereunder to separate from  the shares of Company Common Stock to which they
are attached or  to be triggered or become exercisable or cease to be

applicable law; and _provided_ _further_ that in the  case of clauses (C),
(D) and (E) the Acquisition  Proposal shall be a Superior Proposal; and
_provided_   _further_ , in every case, that the Company complies with  each

  (iii) the Company Board shall not, except as set forth in  this Section

Section 6.1 and which the Company Board has determined in  good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and its  financial

inconsistent with its  fiduciary obligations under applicable law, if: (1)
the  Company Stockholder Approval has not yet been obtained,  (2) in the
case of clause (x), the Company shall have  promptly provided written notice
to the Buyer (a " _Notice  of Superior Proposal_ ") advising the Buyer that
it has  received a Superior Proposal and that it intends to withhold,

intends to do so), identifying the Person making  such Superior Proposal and
specifying all of the material terms  and conditions of such Superior
Proposal, and (3) in the  case of clause (x), Buyer shall not have within
three  (3) Business Days of receipt of the Notice of Superior  Proposal made

prior notice as is  provided to the members of the Company Board) of any
meeting of  the Company Board at which the Company Board could reasonably
be  expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal or any such  inquiry, or
to consider providing non-public information to any  such Person. The Company
shall promptly (and in no event later  than one (1) Business Day after
receipt) advise the Buyer  orally, with written confirmation to follow, of

Company from taking and disclosing  to its stockholders a position with
respect to a tender offer  contemplated by  Rule 14d-9  or  Rule 14e-2 
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure  to the

stockholders tender shares of Company capital stock in  connection with any
tender or exchange offer or withhold,  withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to the Buyer, the  recommendation by the Company Board with respect
to the Company  Voting Proposal unless permitted to do so by this  Section

accepted, take or commit to take such action  that limits its freedom of
action with respect to, or its  ability to retain, any of the businesses,
services or assets of  the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or their
respective  Subsidiaries, in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the 
dissolution of, any Antitrust Order, which would have the effect  of
preventing or delaying the Effective Time beyond the Outside  Date, provided
that no such action deprives the Buyer of the  material benefits bargained
for in this Agreement or otherwise  materially impacts any of the Buyers
other businesses. 

  



  

  (d) Each of the Company and the Buyer shall give (or shall  cause their
respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to  third parties, and use, and

hereby, (ii) disclosed or required to be  disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Buyer  Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, or (iii)
required  to prevent the occurrence of an event that is reasonably likely 
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect prior to or after the  Effective
Time, it being understood that neither the Company nor  the Buyer shall be
required to make any payments in connection  with the fulfillment of its
obligations under this  Section 6.6. 

  



  

  6.7 __Public  Disclosure_._ Except as may be required by law  or stock
market regulations, (a) the press release  announcing the execution of this
Agreement shall be issued only  in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon
by the Company and  the Buyer and (b) the Buyer and the Company shall each
use  its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other  party
before issuing any other press release or otherwise making  any public
statement with respect to the Merger or this  Agreement. 

  



  

  6.8 __Indemnification_._  

  



  

  (a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Buyer and  the Surviving
Corporation shall, jointly and severally,  indemnify and hold harmless each
person who is now, or has been  at any time prior to the date hereof, or who
becomes prior to  the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or
any  of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified  Parties_ "), against all
claims, losses, liabilities,  damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees,
costs and  expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements,  incurred
in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding  or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or  investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to the fact that the  Indemnified Party is or was an officer or
director of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether asserted or
claimed  prior to, at or after the Effective Time, according to the 
indemnification provisions of the Companys certificate of  incorporation and
bylaws as in effect on the date of this  Agreement. 

  



  

  (b) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary  of the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, the certificate  of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation shall  contain, and Buyer shall cause the
certificate of incorporation  and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so
contain,  provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, 
advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former  directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than  are presently set forth in
the certificate of incorporation and  bylaws of the Company. 

  



  

  (c) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation  shall either
(i) maintain, and the Buyer shall cause the  Surviving Corporation to
maintain, at no expense to the  beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years
from the  Effective Time the current policies of the directors and 
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company  (the " _Current D andO
Insurance_") with respect  to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement), so long as the annual premium therefor would not be  in excess of
150% of the last annual premium paid prior to the  Effective Time (such 150%,
the " _Maximum  Premium_ "), which premium the Company represents and 
warrants is no greater than $500,000, or (ii) purchase a  six (6) year
extended reporting period endorsement with  respect to the Current DandO
Insurance (a " _Reporting  Tail Endorsement_ ") and maintain such endorsement
in  full force and effect for its full term. If the Companys  existing
insurance expires, is terminated or canceled during  such six-year period or
exceeds the Maximum Premium, the  Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and
Buyer shall cause the  Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much directors
and  officers liability insurance as can be obtained for the  remainder of
such period for an annualized premium not in excess  of the Maximum Premium,
on terms and conditions no less  advantageous in the aggregate to the
Indemnified Parties than  the Companys existing directors and officers 
liability insurance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in  this
Agreement, the Company may, prior to the Effective Time,  purchase a
Reporting Tail Endorsement, provided that the Company  does not pay more than
six times the Maximum Premium for such  Reporting Tail Endorsement, in which
case, provided that the  Buyer causes the Surviving Corporation to maintain
such  Reporting Tail Endorsement in full force and effect for its full 
term, the Buyer shall be relieved from its obligations under the  preceding
two sentences of this Section 6.8(c). 

  



  

  (d) The Buyer shall pay all expenses, including reasonable  attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by the persons  referred to in this Section 6.8 in
connection with their  enforcement of their rights provided in this Section
6.8. 

  



  

  (e) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to  be in addition to
the rights otherwise available to the current  officers and directors of the
Company by law, charter, statute,  bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and  shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties, their  heirs and their representatives. 

  



  

  6.9 __Notification of Certain  Matters_._ During the Pre-Closing Period,
the  Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company  shall
give prompt notice to the Buyer, of (a) the  occurrence, or failure to occur,
of any event, which occurrence  or failure to occur is reasonably likely to
cause any  representation or warranty of such party contained in this 
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in  each case
at any time from and after the date of this Agreement  until the Effective
Time, (b) any material failure of the  Buyer and Merger Sub or the Company,
as the case may be, or of  any officer, director, employee or agent thereof,
to comply with  or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied  with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, (c) any  change,
occurrence or event which, individually or in the  aggregate with any other
changes, occurrences and events, is  reasonably likely to cause any of the
conditions to closing set  forth in Article VII not to be satisfied, (d)
any  material notice or other communication from any Governmental  Entity in
connection with the Merger, or (e) any material  action, suit, arbitration,
mediation, proceeding, claim or  investigation by or before any Governmental
Entity or arbitrator  initiated by or against it or any of its
Subsidiaries.  Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice
pursuant  to this Section will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies 
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the  conditions to
such partys obligation to consummate the  Merger. 

  



  

  6.10 __Exemption from Liability under  Section 16(b)_._ 

  



  

  (a) The Board of Directors of the Buyer, or a committee  thereof
consisting of non-employee directors (as such term is  defined for purposes
of  Rule 16b-3(d)  under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution in
advance of  the Effective Time providing that the receipt by the Company 
Insiders of options to purchase Buyer Common Stock upon  assumption and
conversion of Company Stock Options, in each case  pursuant to the

any Subsidiary following the  Effective Time) under any Buyer Employee Plans,
and  (y) determination of benefit levels under any Buyer  Employee Plan or
policy relating to vacation or severance, in  each case for which the
Continuing Employee is otherwise  eligible and in which the Continuing
Employee is offered  participation, but except where such credit would result
in a  duplication of benefits. In addition, the Buyer shall waive, or  cause
to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to  pre-existing
conditions to the same extent such limitations are  waived under any
comparable plan of the Buyer and recognize for  purposes of annual deductible

year in  which the Effective Time occurs. For purposes of this Agreement,

Effective  Time, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions 
that it is entitled to take and that are necessary or  appropriate to
terminate (including, without limitation,  adoption by the Company Board of
appropriate resolutions),  effective no later than the Effective Time, any
Company Employee  Plan that (i) contains a cash or deferred arrangement 
intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code or  (ii) any plan

with the provisions of the  applicable plans and applicable laws. 

  



  

  6.13 __Takeover Statutes_._ The  Company and the Company Board shall (a)

or  similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this

following receipt by the Company of written notice  of such breach or failure

in  clause (y) of Section 8.3(b)(iii) is consummated. 

  



  

  (c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained  in this Section
8.3 are an integral part of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without  these agreements, the parties would not enter into this 
Agreement. Payment of the fees and expenses described in this  Section 8.3
shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the  event of a breach of this
Agreement described in clause (a)  of Section 8.2, but otherwise shall
constitute the sole and  exclusive remedy of the parties in connection with
any  termination of this Agreement. 

  



  

  8.4 __Amendment_._ This  Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto,
by action taken  or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at
any  time before or after approval of the matters presented in  connection
with the Merger by the stockholders of any party,  but, after any such
approval, no amendment shall be made which  by law requires further approval
by such stockholders without  such further approval. This Agreement may not
be amended except  by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the  parties hereto. 

  



  

  8.5 __Extension; Waiver_._ At  any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto, by  action taken or authorized by their respective Boards
of  Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend  the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other  acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any  inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained  herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and  (iii)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or  conditions contained herein.
Any agreement on the part of a  party hereto to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only  if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of
such  party. Such extension or waiver shall not apply to any time for 
performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or  noncompliance
with any agreement or condition, as the case may  be, other than that which
is specified in the extension or  waiver. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any  of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise
shall not  constitute a waiver of such rights.

  Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other  communication
hereunder using any other means (including  personal delivery, messenger
service, telex, ordinary mail or  electronic mail), but no such notice or
other communication  shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until
it  actually is received by the party for whom it is intended. Any  party to
this Agreement may change the address to which notices  and other
communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving  the other parties to
this Agreement notice in the manner herein  set forth. 

  



  

  9.3 __Entire Agreement_._ This  Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits hereto and the  documents and instruments referred to herein that
are to be  delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire agreement among 
the parties to this Agreement and supersedes any prior  understandings,
agreements or representations by or among the  parties hereto, or any of
them, written or oral, with respect to  the subject matter hereof, and the
parties hereto specifically  disclaim reliance on any such prior
understandings, agreements  or representations to the extent not embodied in
this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Confidentiality
Agreement  shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms. 

  



  

  9.4 __No Third Party  Beneficiaries_._ Except as provided in  Sections
2.1 and 2.2 (with respect to which holders of  Company Common Stock shall be
third party beneficiaries from and  after the Effective Time) and 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  Section 6.8 (with respect to which the Indemnified Parties  shall be third
party beneficiaries), this Agreement is not  intended, and shall not be
deemed, to confer any rights or  remedies upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their  respective successors and permitted assigns, to
create any  agreement of employment with any Person or to otherwise create 
any third-party beneficiary hereto. 

  



  

  9.5 __Assignment_._ Neither this  Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under  this Agreement may be assigned or delegated,
in whole or in  part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the
parties  hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties,  and
any such assignment without such prior written consent shall  be null and
void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this  Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be  enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective  successors and permitted assigns. 

  



  

  9.6 __Severability_._ Any term  or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable  in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the  validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and
provisions  hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term 
or provision in any other situation or in any other  jurisdiction. If the
final judgment of a court of competent  jurisdiction declares that any term
or provision hereof is  invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree
that the  court making such determination shall have the power to limit  the
term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or  to replace any
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a  term or provision that is
valid and enforceable and that comes  closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or  unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall
be  enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not  exercise
the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the  parties hereto agree to
replace such invalid or unenforceable  term or provision with a valid and
enforceable term or provision  that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic,  business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable 
term. 

  



  

  9.7 __Counterparts and  Signature_._ This Agreement may be executed in 
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an  original but all
of which together shall be considered one and  the same agreement and shall
become effective when counterparts  have been signed by each of the parties
hereto and delivered to  the other parties, it being understood that all
parties need not  sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed
and  delivered by facsimile transmission. 

  



  

  9.8 __Interpretation_._ When  reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article or a Section,  such reference shall be to an Article or Section of
this  Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents,  table
of defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement  are for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect in  any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. The  language used in this Agreement shall
be deemed to be the  language chosen by the parties hereto to express their
mutual  intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied  against
any party. Whenever the context may require, any  pronouns used in this
Agreement shall include the corresponding  masculine, feminine or neuter
forms, and the singular form of  nouns and pronouns shall include the plural,
and vice versa. Any  reference to any federal, state, local or foreign
statute or law  shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations 
promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise.  Whenever the
words "include," "includes" or  "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be  deemed to be followed by the words "without  limitation." No
summary of this Agreement prepared by any  party shall affect the meaning or
interpretation of this  Agreement. 

  



  

  9.9 __Governing Law_._ This  Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with  the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect  to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of  the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would  cause the
application of laws of any jurisdictions other than  those of the State of
Delaware. 

  



  

  9.10 __Remedies_._ Except as  otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly  conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not  exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or 
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one  remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The  parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the  event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not  performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were  otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties  shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms  and
provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any  other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  



  

  9.11 __Submission to  Jurisdiction_._ Each of the parties to this 
Agreement (a) consents to submit itself to the personal  jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware  or of any federal court sitting
in Wilmington, Delaware in any  action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this  Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such  action or
proceeding shall be heard and determined in any such  court, (c) agrees that
it shall not attempt to deny or  defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion
or other request for  leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not to bring
any  action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this  Agreement or
any of the transaction contemplated by this  Agreement in any other court.
Each of the parties hereto waives  any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any  action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond,
surety or  other security that might be required of any other party with 
respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another  party by
sending or delivering a copy of the process to the  party to be served at the
address and in the manner provided for  the giving of notices in Section 9.2.
Nothing in this  Section 9.11, however, shall affect the right of any party 
to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. 

  



  

  9.12 __Disclosure  Schedules_._ The Company Disclosure Schedule  shall
each be arranged in Sections corresponding to the numbered  sections
contained in this Agreement, and the disclosure in any  section shall qualify
(a) the corresponding section of this  Agreement and (b) the other sections
of this Agreement, to  the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a
reading of the  actual text of such disclosure that it also qualifies or
applies  to such other sections. The inclusion of any information in the 
Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an  admission or
acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such  information is required by the
terms hereof to be disclosed, is  material, has resulted in or would result
in a Company Material  Adverse Effect or is outside the Ordinary Course of
Business. 

  



  

  9.13 __Company s  Knowledge_._ For purposes of this Agreement,  the term
" _Company s Knowledge_" means the  knowledge as of the date hereof of the
individuals identified in  Section 9.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

   Exhibit A 

  



  

   Form of  Certificate of Incorporation 
  _of the Surviving Corporation_  

  



  

  CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION 

  

  OF 

  

  RSA SECURITY INC. 

  



  

  __FIRST_ :_ The name of the Corporation is  RSA Security Inc. (hereinafter
the "Corporation"). 

  



  

  __SECOND_ :_ The address of the registered  office of the Corporation in
the State of Delaware is 1209  Orange Street, in the City of Wilmington,
County of New Castle.  The name of its registered agent at that address is
The  Corporation Trust Company. 

  



  

  __THIRD_ :_ The purpose of the Corporation  is to engage in any lawful act
or activity for which a  corporation may be organized under the General
Corporation Law  of the State of Delaware as set forth in Title 8 of the 
Delaware Code (the "GCL"). 

  



  

  __FOURTH_ :_ The total number of shares of  stock which the Corporation
shall have authority to issue is  100 shares of Common Stock, each having a
par value of  $0.01. 

  



  

  __FIFTH_ :_ The following provisions are  inserted for the management of
the business and the conduct of  the affairs of the Corporation, and for
further definition,  limitation and regulation of the powers of the
Corporation and  of its directors and stockholders: 

  



  

  (1) The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be  managed by or
under the direction of the Board of Directors. 

  



  

  (2) The directors shall have concurrent power with the  stockholders to
make, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the  By-Laws of the
Corporation. 

  



  

  (3) The number of directors of the Corporation shall be as  from time to
time fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the  By-Laws of the Corporation.
Election of directors need not be by  written ballot unless the By-Laws so
provide. 

  



  

  (4) __DIRECTOR LIABILITY_._ Except to  the extent that the GCL prohibits
the elimination or limitation  of liability of directors for breaches of
fiduciary duty, no  director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to
the  Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any  breach of
fiduciary duty as a director, notwithstanding any  provision of law imposing
such liability. No amendment to or  repeal of this provision shall apply to
or have any effect on  the liability or alleged liability of any director of
the  Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such 
director occurring prior to such amendment. 

  



  

  (5) __ACTION, SUITS AND PROCEEDINGS OTHER THAN BY OR IN  THE RIGHT OF THE
CORPORATION_._ The Corporation  shall indemnify each person who was or is a
party or is  threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or 
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, 
administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in  the right of
the Corporation), by reason of the fact that he is  or was, or has agreed to
become, a director or officer of the  Corporation, or is or was serving, or
has agreed to serve, at  the request of the Corporation, as a director,
officer or  trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, 
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including  any
employee benefit plan) (all such persons being referred to  hereinafter as an
"Indemnitee"), or by reason of any  action alleged to have been taken or
omitted in such capacity,  against all expenses (including attorneys fees)
judgment,  fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably 
incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such action,  suit or
proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he acted in good  faith and in a
manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not  opposed to, 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any  criminal
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to  believe his conduct was
unlawful. The termination of any action,  suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction or  upon a plea of NOLO CONTENDERE or its
equivalent, shall not, of  itself, create a presumption that the person did
not act in good  faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in,
or  not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with 
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable  cause to
believe that his conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary in this Article, except as set forth in  Section 10 below, the
Corporation shall not indemnify an  Indemnitee seeking indemnification in
connection with a  proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the Indemnitee
unless  the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of 
the Corporation. 

  



  

  (6) __ACTIONS OR SUITS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE  CORPORATION_._ The
Corporation shall indemnify  any Indemnitee who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made  a party to any threatened, pending or completed action
or suit  by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in  its
favor by reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed  to become, a
director or officer of the Corporation, or is or  was serving, or has agreed
to serve, at the request of the  Corporation, as a director, officer or
trustee of, or in a  similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership,
joint  venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee  benefit
plan), or by reason of any action alleged to have been  taken or omitted in
such capacity, against all expenses  (including attorneys fees) and amounts
paid in settlement  actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf
in  connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal 
therefrom, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he  reasonably believed
to be in, or not opposed to, the best  interests of the Corporation, except
that no indemnification  shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or
matter as to  which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to
the  Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of  Chancery
of Delaware shall determine upon application that,  despite the adjudication
of such liability but in view of all  the circumstances of the case, such
person is fairly and  reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses
(including  attorneys fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware  shall
deem proper. 

  



  

  (7) __INDEMNIFICATION FOR EXPENSES OF SUCCESSFUL  PARTY_._ Notwithstanding
the other provisions  of this Article, to the extent that an Indemnitee has
been  successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any  action,
suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 5 and 6  of this Article, or in
defense of any claim, issue or matter  therein, or on appeal from any such
action, suit or proceeding,  he shall be indemnified against all expenses
(including  attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or  on
his behalf in connection therewith. Without limiting the  foregoing, if any
action, suit or proceeding is disposed of, on  the merits or otherwise
(including a disposition without  prejudice), without (i) the disposition
being adverse to  the Indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that the Indemnitee 
was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or  NOLO CONTENDERE by
the Indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication  that the Indemnitee did not act in good
faith and in a manner he  reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best  interests of the Corporation, and (v) with respect to any  criminal
proceeding, an adjudication that the Indemnitee had  reasonable cause to
believe his conduct was unlawful, the  Indemnitee shall be considered for the
purposes hereof to have  been wholly successful with respect thereto. 

  



  

  (8) __NOTIFICATION AND DEFENSE OF  CLAIM_._ As a condition precedent to
his right  to be indemnified, the Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in 
writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding  or
investigation involving him for which indemnity will or could  be sought.
With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or  investigation of which the
Corporation is so notified, the  Corporation will be entitled to participate
therein at its own  expense  and/or to  assume the defense thereof at its
own expense, with legal  counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee.
After notice  from the Corporation to the Indemnitee of its election so to 
assume such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to the  Indemnitee
for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred  by the Indemnitee in
connection with such claim, other than as  provided below in this Section 8\.
The Indemnitee shall have  the right to employ his own counsel in connection
with such  claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after 
notice from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense  thereof shall
be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless  (i) the employment of counsel by
the Indemnitee has been  authorized by the 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  Corporation, (ii) counsel to the Indemnitee shall have  reasonably
concluded that there may be a conflict of interest or  position on any
significant issue between the Corporation and  the Indemnitee in the conduct
of the defense of such action or  (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact
have employed  counsel to assume the defense of such action, in each of
which  cases the fees and expenses of counsel for the Indemnitee shall  be
at the expense of the Corporation, except as otherwise  expressly provided by
this Article. The Corporation shall not be  entitled, without the consent of
the Indemnitee, to assume the  defense of any claim brought by or in the
right of the  Corporation or as to which counsel for the Indemnitee shall
have  reasonably made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii)  above. 

  



  

  (9) __ADVANCE OF EXPENSES_._ Subject  to the provisions of Section 10
below, in the event that  the Corporation does not assume the defense
pursuant to  Section 8 of this Article of any action, suit, proceeding  or
investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under  this Article,
any expenses(including attorneys fees)  incurred by an Indemnitee in
defending a civil or criminal  action, suit, proceeding or investigation or
any appeal  therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the 
final disposition of such matter; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the  payment of
such expense incurred by an Indemnitee in advance of  the final disposition
of such matter shall be made only upon  receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of the Indemnitee to  repay all amounts so advanced in the event that
it shall  ultimately be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to 
be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article.  Such
undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the  financial ability of
the Indemnitee to make such repayment. 

  



  

  (10) __PROCEDURE FOR  INDEMNIFICATION_._ In order to obtain 
indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to  Section 5, 6, 7 or 9
of this Article, the Indemnitee  shall submit to the Corporation a written
request, including in  such request such documentation and information as is
reasonably  available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to 
determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled  to
indemnification or advancement of expenses. Any such  indemnification or
advancement of expenses shall be made  promptly, and in any event within 60
days after receipt by  the Corporation of the written request of the
Indemnitee, unless  with respect to requests under Section 5, 6 or 9 the 
Corporation determines, by clear and convincing evidence, within  such
60-day  period that the Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard  of
conduct set forth in Section 5 or 6, as the case  may be. Such determination
shall be made in each instance by  (a) a majority vote of the directors of
the Corporation  consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to
the  action, suit or proceeding in question ("disinterested  directors"),
even though less than quorum, (b) a  majority vote of a quorum of the
outstanding shares of stock of  all classes entitled to vote for directors,
voting as a single  class, which quorum shall consist of stockholders who are
not at  that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question, 
(c) independent legal counsel (who may be regular legal  counsel to the
Corporation), or (d) a court of competent  jurisdiction. 

  



  

  (11) __REMEDIES_._ The right to  indemnification or advances as granted by
this Article shall be  enforceable by the Indemnitee in any court of
competent  jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or 
in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within the  60-day  period
referred to above in Section 6\. Unless otherwise  provided by law, the
burden of proving that the Indemnitee is  not entitled to indemnification or
advanced of expenses under  this Article shall be on the Corporation. Neither
the failure of  the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the 
commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in  the
circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable  standard of
conduct, nor an actual determination by the  Corporation pursuant to Section
10 that the Indemnitee has  not met such applicable standard of conduct,
shall be a defense  to the action or create a presumption that the Indemnitee
has  not met the applicable standard of conduct. The  Indemnitees expenses
(including attorneys fees)  incurred in connection with successfully
establishing his right  to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such
proceeding  shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. 

  



  

  (12) In addition to the powers and authority hereinbefore  or by statute
expressly conferred upon them, the directors are  hereby empowered to
exercise all such powers and do all such  acts and things as may be exercised
or done by the Corporation,  subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the
GCL, this 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  Certificate of Incorporation, and any By-Laws adopted by the 
stockholders; provided that no amendment, termination or repeal  of this
Article or of the relevant provisions of the GCL or any  other applicable
laws shall affect or diminish in any way the  rights of any Indemnitee to
indemnification under the provisions  hereof with respect to any action,
suit, proceeding or  investigation arising out of or relating to any
actions,  transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of 
such amendment, termination or repeal. 

  



  

  __SIXTH_ :_ Meetings of stockholders may be  held within or without the
State of Delaware, as the By-Laws may  provide. The books of the Corporation
may be kept (subject to  any provision contained in the GCL) outside the
State of  Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time 
to time by the Board of Directors or in the By-Laws of the  Corporation. 

  



  

  __SEVENTH_ :_ The Corporation reserves the  right to amend, alter, change
or repeal any provision contained  in this Certificate of Incorporation, in
the manner now or  hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred
upon  stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.
