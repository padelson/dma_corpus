vi AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of the 26th day of April, 2006, by and among Carlson Wagonlit B.V., a Dutch
B.V. ("CWT"), Horizon Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of CWT ("Merger Sub"), and Navigant International, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Navigant").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, CWT and Navigant desire that CWT combine its businesses with the
businesses operated by Navigant through the merger of Merger Sub with and
into Navigant, with Navigant as the surviving corporation (the "Merger"),
pursuant to which each share of common stock of Navigant, par value $0.001
per share ("Navigant Common Stock") issued and outstanding at the Effective
Time (as defined in Section 1.2), other than the shares of Navigant Common
Stock owned by CWT, Merger Sub or Navigant (or any of their respective direct
or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (as defined in Section 8.3)) and other
than the Appraisal Shares (as defined in Section 2.1(d)), will be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined in Section
2.1(b)), all as more fully provided in this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the board of directors (the "Board") of each of CWT, Merger Sub and
Navigant has determined that the Merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement is advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of their respective stockholders; and

WHEREAS, CWT, Merger Sub and Navigant desire to make those representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein in connection with
this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, CWT, Merger Sub and
Navigant agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
Navigant at the Effective Time. As a result of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Navigant shall
continue its existence as a wholly owned subsidiary of CWT under the laws of
the State of Delaware. Navigant, in its capacity as the corporation surviving
the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving
Corporation."

1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_. A closing (the "Closing") shall be held at the
offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, N.Y.
10019, or such other place as the parties hereto may agree, as soon as
practicable but no later than the second business day following the date upon
which all conditions set forth in Article VI (other than    those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions)
are satisfied or waived, or at such other date as CWT and Navigant may agree
(such date, the "Closing Date"). As promptly as possible on the Closing Date,
the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary of
State") a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as
is required by and executed in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective when the Certificate of Merger has been filed
with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such later time as shall be agreed
upon by CWT and Navigant and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the
"Effective Time").

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. From and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Certificate of Merger
shall provide that at the Effective Time, (a) the Surviving Corporations
Certificate of Incorporation as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be amended as of the Effective Time to read in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_, and (b) the Surviving Corporations Bylaws as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended as of the
Effective Time to read in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit B_; in each
case, until amended in accordance with the DGCL, this Agreement and such
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as the case may be.

1.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. From and after the
Effective Time, the officers of Navigant shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation and the directors of Merger Sub shall be the directors
of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified.

1.6  _Navigant Stockholders Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Navigant
shall, in accordance with all applicable laws, statutes, orders, rules,
regulations, policies or guidelines promulgated, or judgments, decisions or
orders entered by any Governmental Authority (as defined in Section 3.3(d)),
in each case, to the extent applicable (collectively, "Applicable Laws"), and
Navigants Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation as in effect on
the date of this Agreement (the "Navigant Certificate") and Navigants By-
laws, as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the "Navigant Bylaws"), duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the holders of shares of
Navigant Common Stock (the "Navigant Stockholders") to consider and vote upon
approval of this Agreement and the Merger (the "Navigant Stockholders
Meeting"). Subject to Section 5.3(b)(iii), Navigant shall ensure that the
Navigant Stockholders Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and
conducted, and that all proxies solicited in connection with the Navigant
Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance in all material respects with
Applicable Laws.

(b) Navigant shall promptly prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") a proxy statement (together with any amendments
thereof or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement") that meets the
requirements of Applicable Laws to seek the approval of this Agreement and
the Merger. CWT shall promptly furnish to Navigant  



 

2  all information concerning it and its business as Navigant may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement and
the solicitation of proxies. Navigant shall respond promptly to any comments
made by the Commission with respect to the Proxy Statement and any preliminary
version thereof filed by it and shall cause such Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the Navigant Stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable. Navigant
shall promptly notify CWT of the receipt of any comments of the Commission
with respect to the Proxy Statement and shall provide to CWT copies of any
comments received from the Commission in connection with the Proxy Statement.
CWT shall be provided an opportunity to review and comment on all filings with
the Commission, including the Proxy Statement, and all mailings to the
Navigant Stockholders in connection with the Merger, and Navigant shall give
reasonable consideration to all comments proposed by CWT.

(c) The Navigant Board shall make the Navigant Board Recommendation (as
defined in Section 4.22(c)). Subject to Section 5.3(b)(iii), the Navigant
Board Recommendation shall be included in the Proxy Statement and the Navigant
Board shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the approval of this
Agreement and the Merger by the Navigant Stockholders. In the event that
subsequent to the date of this Agreement, the Navigant Board determines after
consultation with outside counsel that a failure to withdraw, modify or
qualify the Navigant Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to CWT would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law, the Navigant Board may so withdraw, modify or qualify the
Navigant Board Recommendation;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Navigant
Board may not recommend any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section
5.3(b)(vii)(A)) (other than this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger), except as specifically contemplated by, and in
accordance with, Section 5.3(b)(iii); _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ ,
that unless this Agreement is theretofore terminated, Navigant shall
nevertheless submit this Agreement to the Navigant Stockholders for adoption
at the Navigant Stockholders Meeting.

1.7 _Additional Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further deeds,
assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of Navigant or (b) otherwise carry out the provisions of
this Agreement, Navigant and its officers and directors shall be deemed to
have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to
execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in law and to
take all acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title
to and possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation and otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, and
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the
name of Navigant or otherwise to take any and all such action.



 

3 ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of CWT, Merger Sub or Navigant or their
respective stockholders:

(a) Each share of common stock, $0.001 par value, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.001 par value, of
the Surviving Corporation. Such newly issued shares shall thereafter
constitute all of the issued and outstanding Surviving Corporation capital
stock.

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Article II, each share of
Navigant Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (excluding (i) any shares of Navigant Common Stock owned by
Navigant (which shares shall be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(c)),
(ii) any shares of Navigant Common Stock owned by CWT or any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Navigant or CWT (which shares shall remain
outstanding except that the number of such shares owned by CWT or any such
subsidiary shall be adjusted in the Merger to maintain the relative ownership
percentages) and (iii) any shares of Navigant Common Stock owned by
stockholders properly exercising appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL ("Section 262"), as provided in Section 2.1(d)) shall be converted
into and represent the right to receive $16.50 in cash, without interest (the
"Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all shares of Navigant Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and automatically shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented such shares of Navigant Common Stock (a
"Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(c) Each share of Navigant capital stock held in the treasury of Navigant
automatically shall be cancelled and retired and no payment shall be made
in respect thereof.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the shares of
Navigant Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any Navigant Stockholder that is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of shares of Navigant Common Stock
pursuant to, and complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262
(the "Appraisal Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(b), but, instead, such
Navigant Stockholder shall be entitled to such rights (but only such rights)
as are granted by Section 262\. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and automatically shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and, except as otherwise provided by Applicable Laws, each
holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to the
Appraisal Shares, other than such rights as are granted by Section 262\.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such Navigant Stockholder shall fail to
validly perfect or shall otherwise waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262 or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such Navigant Stockholder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262, then the rights of such Navigant Stockholder under
Section 262 shall cease, and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have
been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(b) without
interest. Navigant shall give prompt notice to CWT of any demands for
appraisal of any shares of Navigant Common Stock, and CWT shall have the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, Navigant shall not, without the
prior written consent of CWT, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.



 

4 2.2 _Surrender and Payment_.

(a) _Paying Agent; Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, for the
benefit of the Navigant Stockholders, CWT shall designate, or shall cause
to be designated (pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to CWT and Navigant), a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable
to CWT and Navigant to act as agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of Certificates upon surrender of such Certificates
in accordance with this Article II from time to time after the Effective Time
(the "Paying Agent"). At the Effective Time, CWT shall deposit, or cause
Merger Sub to deposit, with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient for
the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b)
upon surrender of such Certificates (such cash, the "Exchange Fund"). The
Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed
by CWT, on a daily basis; provided that such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or of any agency
thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or bankers acceptances of,
repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits
purchased from, commercial banks with capital, surplus and undivided profits
aggregating in excess of $500 million (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank which are then publicly available at the Commission or
otherwise). Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest and other
income resulting from investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
undistributed to the Navigant Stockholders six months after the date of the
mailing required by Section 2.2(b) shall be delivered to CWT, upon demand by
CWT, and holders of Certificates that have not theretofore complied with
this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to CWT for payment of any claim
to the Merger Consideration. If any Certificates shall not have been
surrendered prior to seven years after the Effective Time, any such cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Laws, become the property of CWT, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(b) _Exchange Procedure_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a
form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such Navigant
Stockholder shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other customary
provisions as CWT may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by CWT, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive promptly in exchange therefor
the amount of cash into which the shares of Navigant Common Stock formerly
represented by the Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section
2.1(b), and the Certificate so surrendered shall be cancelled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Navigant Common Stock that is not registered in the
stock transfer books of Navigant, the proper amount of cash may be paid
in exchange therefor to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person  



 

5  requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes (as defined in
Section 4.13(c)) required by reason of the payment to a person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of CWT
that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or
shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

(c) _Stock Transfer Books_. At the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of Navigant shall be closed,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Navigant Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(d) _No Liability_. None of CWT, Merger Sub, Navigant or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

(e) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
a Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by CWT or the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as CWT or the Surviving Corporation may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to the Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of the lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration.

(f) _No Further Ownership Rights in Navigant Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II in respect
of Certificates that have been surrendered in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Navigant Common Stock represented thereby.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and CWT shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any Navigant Stockholders or any holder of Navigant Options (as defined in
Section 2.3(a)) such amounts as it may be required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation,
CWT or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, the withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Navigant
Stockholders or holders of Navigant Options (as applicable) in respect of
which the deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, CWT
or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Navigant shall deliver to CWT a duly executed and acknowledged affidavit of
Navigant, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to CWT and in
accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3), 1.897-2(g) and
1.897-2(h), certifying that each "interest" in Navigant (within the meaning
of Section 897(c)(1) of the Code) is not a "United States real property
interest" within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the Code.



 

6 2.3 _Treatment of Stock Options_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase a share of Navigant Common
Stock (a "Navigant Option") granted under the Navigant equity compensation
plans in effect on the date of this Agreement (the "Navigant Stock Plans"), or
otherwise, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
(i) if unvested, become fully vested and (ii) be converted into the right to
receive (as soon as practicable following the Effective Time) an amount in
cash (less any applicable withholding Taxes and without interest) equal to the
product of (x) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B)
the per share exercise price of Navigant Common Stock subject to such Navigant
Option and (y) the number of shares of Navigant Common Stock subject to such
Navigant Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each outstanding
Navigant Option so converted shall, simultaneously with such conversion, be
terminated. For the avoidance of doubt, the holder of each Navigant Option so
terminated with an exercise price per share of Navigant Common Stock that is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall not be entitled to
receive any cash from the Surviving Corporation or CWT. Prior to the Effective
Time, Navigant shall take any and all actions necessary to effectuate
this Section 2.3(a).

(b) Navigant shall ensure that following the Effective Time no holder of a
Navigant Option or any participant in any Navigant Stock Plan or other
employee benefit arrangement of Navigant shall have any right thereunder to
acquire any capital stock (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation
rights) of Navigant or the Surviving Corporation. Prior to the Effective
Time, Navigant shall deliver to the holders of Navigant Options appropriate
notices, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to CWT, setting forth
such holders rights pursuant to this Agreement.

2.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that Navigant changes the
number of shares of Navigant Common Stock, or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Navigant Common Stock, issued
and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule that has been prepared by
Navigant and delivered by Navigant to CWT and dated the date of this

SEC Documents (as defined below) filed prior to the date of this Agreement if
the relevance of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face, in order
to induce Merger Sub and CWT to enter into this Agreement, Navigant hereby
represents and warrants to CWT and Merger Sub as follows:

4.1 _Organization and Standing_. Navigant is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware
with full corporate power and authority to own, lease, use and operate its
properties and to conduct its business as and where now owned, leased, used,
operated and conducted. Each of Navigants subsidiaries is

and authority to own, lease, use and operate its properties and to conduct
its business as and where now owned, leased, used, operated and conducted.
Each of Navigant and its subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the property it owns, leases or operates requires it to so
qualify, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing in
such jurisdiction would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Navigant. Navigant
is not in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any
provision of the Navigant Certificate or the Navigant Bylaws. No subsidiary
of Navigant is in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any
provision of such subsidiarys certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar
organizational documents. Navigant has heretofore furnished or made available

Schedule, Navigant owns, directly or indirectly, each of the outstanding
shares of capital stock (or other ownership interests having by their terms
ordinary voting power to elect a majority of directors or others performing
similar functions with respect to such subsidiary) of each of its
subsidiaries. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of
Navigants subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and is owned, directly or indirectly, by Navigant free and
clear of all liens, pledges, security interests, claims or other encumbrances.
The following information for each of Navigants subsidiaries is set forth in
Section 4.2 to the Navigant Disclosure Schedule, as applicable: (a) its name
and jurisdiction of incorporation or organization; (b) its authorized capital
stock or share capital; and (c) the number of issued and outstanding shares of

understandings, claims or other commitments or rights of any type relating to
the issuance, sale or transfer of any securities of any of Navigants
subsidiaries, nor are there outstanding any securities that are convertible
into or exchangeable for any shares of capital stock or other voting
securities or ownership interests of any of Navigants subsidiaries.

4.3 _Corporate Power and Authority_. Navigant has all requisite corporate

this Agreement by the Navigant Stockholders, (i) the execution, performance
and delivery of this Agreement by Navigant have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Navigant, and (ii) no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Navigant are necessary to  



 

12  authorize or approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Navigant, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by CWT and Merger Sub, constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of Navigant enforceable against it in accordance with its terms
except that such enforceability (a) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and (b) is subject to general principals of
equity.

4.4 _Capitalization of Navigant_.

(a) Navigants authorized capital stock consists solely of (i) 150,000,000
shares of Navigant Common Stock, of which as of March 31, 2006 (the
"Capitalization Date") (A) 15,515,000 shares are issued and outstanding, (B)
1,231,000 shares are issued and held in treasury (which does not include the

referred to in clause (D) below), (C) no shares are reserved for issuance
upon the exercise of all outstanding Navigant Options or other stock based
awards, and (D) a sufficient number of shares are reserved for issuance upon
the exercise of conversion rights pursuant to all outstanding convertible
debt instruments of Navigant and its subsidiaries; and (ii) 5,000,000 shares
of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which as of the
Capitalization Date (A) none are issued and outstanding and (B) 40,000 shares
are designated Series A Preferred Stock and are reserved for issuance upon
exercise of the rights issued pursuant to the Navigant Rights Plan (as defined
in Section 4.27). As of the Capitalization Date, there are outstanding
Navigant Options to purchase an aggregate of 2,565,838 shares of Navigant
Common Stock. Since the Capitalization Date through the date hereof, (x) no
capital stock of Navigant has been issued except pursuant to the exercise or
conversion of Navigant Options or convertible securities referred to in this
Section 4.4(a) and (y) no Navigant Options have been granted. As of the
Capitalization Date and based upon the Merger Consideration, Navigants 4.875%
convertible subordinated debentures due 2023 (the "Convertible Debentures")
would be convertible into an aggregate maximum of 5,315,124 shares of Navigant
Common Stock (after taking into account the adjustment to the conversion rate
of the Convertible Debentures contemplated by the First Supplemental
Indenture, dated as of July 22, 2005, between Navigant and Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as trustee thereunder, as a result of the Merger).

commitments or rights of any type relating to the issuance, sale, repurchase
or transfer of any securities of Navigant, or (iii) securities that are

Navigant voting securities, and neither Navigant nor any of its
subsidiaries has any obligation of any kind to issue any additional
securities or to pay for, repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
securities of Navigant or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors.

outstanding share of Navigant capital stock is, and each share of Navigant
capital stock that may be issued will be, when issued, duly authorized and
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and not subject to any
preemptive or similar rights. The issuance and sale of all of the shares of  



 

13  capital stock described in this Section 4.4 have been in compliance in all
material respects with United States federal and state securities
laws. Section 4.4 to the Navigant Disclosure Schedule states the number of
shares of Navigant Common Stock issuable to each holder of Navigant Options as
of the Capitalization Date, including the applicable vesting schedule,
exercise price and whether the Navigant Option is intended to qualify as an
"incentive stock option" (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code).
Except as set forth in Section 4.4 to the Navigant Disclosure Schedule,
neither Navigant nor any of its subsidiaries has agreed to register any
securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the
rules and regulations thereunder, the "Securities Act") or under any state
securities law or granted registration rights to any individual or entity;
complete and correct copies of any such agreements have previously been
provided or made available to CWT.

4.5 _Conflicts; Consents and Approvals_. Except as set forth in Section 4.5 of
the Navigant Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will:

(a) conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, the Navigant
Certificate or the Navigant Bylaws;

(b) violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or
constitute a default (or an event that, with the giving of notice, the
passage of time or otherwise, would constitute a default) under, or entitle
any person (with the giving of notice, the passage of time or otherwise) to
terminate, accelerate, modify or call a default under, or result in
the creation of any lien, security interest, charge or encumbrance upon any
of the properties or assets of Navigant or any of its subsidiaries under, any
of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
deed of trust, license, contract, undertaking, agreement, lease or other
instrument or obligation to which Navigant or any of its subsidiaries is a
party;

(c) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, or, subject to the matters
referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (d) below, any statute, rule
or regulation applicable to Navigant or any of its subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties or assets; or

(d) require any action or consent or approval of, or review by, or
registration or filing by Navigant or any of its affiliates with, any third
party or any Governmental Authority, other than (i) approval of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by Navigant Stockholders,

officer, employee or subsidiary of Navigant, has



 

14  incurred or will incur on behalf of Navigant or its subsidiaries, any

filing, collectively, the "Navigant SEC Documents") required to be filed by
them since January 1, 2003 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
"Exchange Act") or the Securities Act. The Navigant SEC Documents, including
any financial statements or schedules included in the Navigant SEC Documents,
at the time filed (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy
statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of mailing,
respectively) or, in the case of any Navigant SEC Document amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then solely on
the date of such amending or superseding filing, (i) did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and
(ii) complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be. The
financial statements of Navigant and its subsidiaries included in the
Navigant SEC Documents (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of Navigant and its subsidiaries, (ii) at the time
filed (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on
the dates of effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively) or, in the
case of any Navigant SEC Document amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date of this Agreement, then solely on the date of such amending or
superseding filing, complied as to form in all material respects with the
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the Commission with respect thereto, (iii) were prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as

statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the Commission), and (iv) fairly
present (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal, recurring
audit adjustments) the consolidated financial position of Navigant and its

results of their operations and cash flows (and changes in financial position,
if any) for the periods then ended. None of Navigants subsidiaries is subject
to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act or required to
file any form, report or other document with the Commission, The Nasdaq
National Market, any stock exchange or any other comparable Governmental
Authority.

(b) With respect to each Annual Report on Form 10-K and each Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q included in the Navigant SEC Documents filed since March 31,
2003, the financial statements and other financial information included in
each such Navigant SEC Document fairly present (within the meaning of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) in all material  



 

15  respects the financial condition and results of operations of Navigant as
of, and for, the periods presented in the Navigant SEC Documents. Since March
31, 2003, Navigants principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer have disclosed to Navigants auditors and the audit committee of the
Navigant Board (i) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect Navigants ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and have identified
for Navigants auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (ii)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Navigants internal controls over
financial reporting and Navigant has provided to CWT copies of any written
materials relating to the foregoing. Navigant has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to ensure that material information relating to Navigant, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to Navigants principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities,
particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required under
the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the knowledge of Navigant, such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that all material
information required to be included in Navigants periodic reports required
under the Exchange Act is made known on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for filing the Navigant SEC Documents. Except as set forth
in Section 4.7(b) to the Navigant Disclosure Schedule, there are no
outstanding loans made by Navigant or any of its subsidiaries to any executive
officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of
Navigant. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, neither
Navigant nor any of its subsidiaries has made any loans to any executive
officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of
Navigant or any of its subsidiaries.

reserved against on the balance sheet of Navigant as of December 25, 2005
included in the Navigant SEC Documents, (b) as incurred after the date thereof
in the ordinary course of business consistent with prior practice and not
prohibited by this Agreement or (c) as set forth in Section 4.8 to the
Navigant Disclosure Schedule, neither Navigant nor any of its subsidiaries has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due, that would
be required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of
Navigant and its subsidiaries (or disclosed in the notes thereto).

4.9  _Information Supplied_. At the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to the
Navigant Stockholders and at the time of the Navigant Stockholders Meeting,
the Proxy Statement will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary, in order to make the statements therein in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The representation
contained in the immediately preceding sentence will not apply to statements
or omissions included in the Proxy Statement based upon information furnished
to Navigant by CWT or Merger Sub specifically for use therein. The Proxy
Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions
of the Exchange Act.

4.10 _Compliance with Law_. Navigant and its subsidiaries hold all franchises,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exemptions,
consents, certificates,  



 

16  approvals and orders of all Governmental Authorities necessary for the
lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the "Navigant Permits"),
except for failures to hold such Navigant Permits that would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Navigant. Navigant and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the
terms of the Navigant Permits, except where the failure so to comply would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Navigant. The businesses of Navigant and its
subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of any Applicable Law,
except for violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Navigant.
Except as set forth in Section 4.10 to the Navigant Disclosure Schedule, no
investigation or review by any Governmental Authority with respect to Navigant
or any of its subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of Navigant,
threatened, nor has any Governmental Authority indicated in writing an
intention to conduct any such investigation or review, other than, in each
case, those the outcome of which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Navigant.

4.11 _Litigation_. There is no suit, claim, action, proceeding, hearing,
notice of violation, demand letter or, to the knowledge of Navigant,
investigation (each, an "Action") pending, or, to the knowledge of Navigant,
threatened, against Navigant or any of its subsidiaries or any executive
officer or director of Navigant or any of its subsidiaries that would,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Navigant. Neither Navigant nor any of its
subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order, writ, injunction or
decree that would, individually or in the aggregate, insofar as can be
reasonably foreseen, have or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Navigant.

4.12 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

(a) Since December 25, 2005, there has not been any Material Adverse Effect
on Navigant or any event, change, effect or development that would,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Navigant.

(b) There has not been any action taken by Navigant or any of its subsidiaries
from December 25, 2005 through the date of this Agreement that, if taken
during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time,
would constitute a breach of Section 5.3(a).

4.13 _Taxes_.

(a) Navigant and each of its subsidiaries has filed all material Tax Returns
(as defined in Section 4.13(b)) required to be filed by it. All such Tax
Returns were true, correct and complete in all material respects, and Navigant
and each of its subsidiaries has paid or caused to be paid all material Taxes
in respect of the periods covered by such Tax Returns other than Taxes for
which appropriate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP. Each
of Navigant and its subsidiaries has timely withheld and paid all material
Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid
or owing to any employee, creditor, independent contractor, shareholder or
other third party. Neither Navigant nor any of its subsidiaries is currently
the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any  



 

17  material Tax Return. There are no material security interests on any of the
assets of Navigant or any of its subsidiaries that arose in connection with
any failure to pay any Tax when due (taking into account relevant
extensions), except with respect to such Taxes that are being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which appropriate reserves have
been established in accordance with GAAP. There is no claim or dispute
concerning any material Tax liability of Navigant or its subsidiaries either
(i) claimed or raised by any Governmental Authority in writing or (ii) as to
which any of the directors and officers (and employees responsible for Tax
matters) of Navigant and its subsidiaries has knowledge based on personal
contact with any agent of such Governmental Authority. No issue has been
raised in writing in any examination by any Governmental Authority
with respect to Navigant or any subsidiary which, by application of similar
principles, reasonably could be expected to result in a proposed material
increase in Tax, in excess of that provided for in any reserve for Taxes, for
any other period not so examined. All material income Tax Returns required to
be filed by or with respect to Navigant or any of its subsidiaries through the
year 2002 have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service or other
appropriate taxing authority and the examination concluded, or are Tax
Returns with respect to which the period during which any assessments may be
made by the Internal Revenue Service or other appropriate taxing authority has
expired (taking into account any extension or waiver thereof). There are no
outstanding agreements or waivers extending the statutory period of limitation
applicable to any material Tax Return of Navigant or any of its subsidiaries.
Neither Navigant nor any of its subsidiaries (i) has been a member of a group
filing consolidated returns for federal income Tax purpose (except for the
group of which Navigant is the common parent), (ii) has any liability for the
Taxes of any person (other than Navigant and its subsidiaries) under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law), as a transferor or successor, by contract or otherwise, or (iii)
is a party to any Tax sharing or Tax indemnity agreement or any
other agreement of a similar nature involving a material amount of Taxes that
remains in effect. Navigant has not constituted either a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section
355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock intended to qualify for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two (2) years
prior to the date of this Agreement (or will constitute such a corporation in
two (2) years prior to this Agreement) or (ii) in a distribution that
otherwise constitutes part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions"
(within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the
Merger. Navigant has not been a United States real property holding
corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the
applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code. No
foreign subsidiary of Navigant is (i) engaged in a United States trade or
business for federal income tax purposes or (ii) a passive foreign investment
company or a shareholder, directly or indirectly, in a passive
foreign investment company, each within the meaning of the Code.

(b) "Tax Returns" means returns, reports and forms required to be filed with
any Governmental Authority of the United States or any other relevant
jurisdiction responsible for the imposition or collection of Taxes.

(c) "Taxes" means (i) all taxes (whether United States federal, state or local
or foreign) based upon or measured by income and any other tax whatsoever,
including gross receipts, profits, sales, use, occupation, value added, ad
valorem, transfer, franchise, withholding, payroll, employment, excise, or
property taxes, together with any interest or penalties imposed with respect
thereto, imposed upon Navigant or any of its subsidiaries and  



 

18  (ii) any obligations under any agreements or arrangements with respect to
any taxes described in clause (i) above.

4.14 _Intellectual Property_.

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Intellectual Property Right" means
any trademark, service mark, trade name, mask work, invention, patent, trade
secret, copyright, know how or proprietary information contained on any
website, processes, formulae, products, technologies, discoveries, apparatus,
Internet domain names, trade dress and general intangibles of like nature
(together with goodwill), customer lists, confidential information, licenses,
software, databases and compilations including any and all collections of
data and all documentation thereof (including any registrations or
applications for registration of any of the foregoing) or any other similar
type of proprietary intellectual property right, and (ii) "Navigant
Intellectual Property Right" means all Intellectual Property Rights owned by
Navigant or any of its subsidiaries that are used or held for use by Navigant
or any of its subsidiaries.

(b) Navigant and its subsidiaries own, or are validly licensed or otherwise
have the right to use, all Intellectual Property Rights used in the
conduct of their businesses, except where the failure to own or possess valid
rights to such Intellectual Property Rights would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Navigant. No Navigant Intellectual Property Right is subject to any
outstanding judgment, injunction, order, decree or agreement restricting the
use thereof by Navigant or any of its subsidiaries or restricting the
licensing thereof by Navigant or any of its subsidiaries to any Person (as
defined in Section 5.3(b)(i)(B)), except for any judgment, injunction, order,
decree or agreement which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Navigant. Neither
Navigant nor any of its subsidiaries is infringing on any other Persons
Intellectual Property Rights and to the knowledge of Navigant no Person is
infringing on any Navigant Intellectual Property Rights, except, in either
case, as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Navigant. Except for such
matters as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Navigant, (i) neither Navigant
nor any of its subsidiaries is a defendant in any action, suit, investigation
or proceeding relating to, or otherwise was notified of, any claim alleging
infringement by Navigant or any of its subsidiaries of any other Persons
Intellectual Property Right and (ii) Navigant and its subsidiaries have no
outstanding claim or suit for any continuing infringement by any other Person
of any Navigant Intellectual Property Rights.

Qualified Plan or the related trust or the qualified or registered status of
any Plan or trust maintained outside the United States.

(d) All contributions required to be made by Navigant or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates to any Plan by
Applicable Laws or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and

subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates under ERISA or the

Employer Plan"), nor has Navigant or any of its subsidiaries or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates, at any time within six years before the date of
this Agreement, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan.

(g) There does not now exist, and there are no existing circumstances that

material liability for life, health, medical or other welfare benefits to
former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof. There has been no

reasonably be expected or interpreted to promise or guarantee such employees
retiree health or life insurance benefits or other retiree death benefits on
a permanent basis.

(i) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15(i) to the Navigant
Disclosure Schedule or as provided in Section 2.3(a) of this Agreement,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will result in, cause the
accelerated vesting or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any
payment or benefit to any employee, officer, director or consultant of
Navigant or any of its subsidiaries (either alone or in conjunction with any
other event) under any Plan whether or not such payment would constitute a
parachute payment (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code). To the
knowledge of Navigant, (i) the data underlying the analysis provided by
Navigant to CWT of estimated exposure of nine Navigant employees to the tax
imposed by Section 4999 of the Code is complete and accurate, and (ii) no
other service provider of Navigant and its subsidiaries could reasonably be
expected to receive payments or benefits in connection with the

other event) that would result in the imposition of tax under such section.

(j) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15(j) to the Navigant Disclosure
Schedule, there are no pending, or, to the knowledge of Navigant, threatened,
Actions (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) that have been
asserted or instituted against any Plan, any fiduciaries thereof with respect
to their duties to any Plan or the assets of any of the trusts under any Plan
that could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of
Navigant or any of its subsidiaries to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, the United States Department of Treasury, the United States
Department of Labor or any Multiemployer Plan, or to comparable entities or
Plans under Applicable Laws of jurisdictions outside the United States.

(k) No disallowance of a deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code for
employee reimbursement or compensation of any amount paid or payable by
Navigant or any of its subsidiaries has occurred or is reasonably expected to
occur.

(l) The terms and conditions of the United Healthcare Insurance Company

nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to, and none of their respective
properties or assets are bound by, any "material contract" (as such term is

subsidiaries and, to Navigants knowledge, of the other party or
parties thereto, in accordance with its terms, and in full force and effect,

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Navigant and to
the extent as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium
or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or by
general principles of equity. As of the date hereof and, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Navigant, as of the Closing Date, neither Navigant
nor any subsidiary of Navigant has received any notice from any other party to
any such Material Contract, and otherwise has no knowledge that such third
party intends to terminate, or not renew any Material Contract, or is seeking
the renegotiation thereof in any material respect or substitute performance
thereunder in any material respect. As of the date hereof, all Material
Contracts are either publicly filed with the Commission and available via
EDGAR or Navigant has made available to CWT true and correct copies of all
such contracts. Neither Navigant nor any of its subsidiaries, and, to the
knowledge of Navigant, no other party thereto, is in violation of or in
default under any Material Contract (nor does there exist any condition which
upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would cause such a
violation of or default thereunder by Navigant or any of its subsidiaries or,
to Navigants knowledge, by any third party), except for violations or
defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Navigant.

to hire any individual or group of individuals or any similar obligation or
limitation (with such obligation or limitation described in Section 4.16(b) of
the Navigant Disclosure Schedule), (ii) any agreement that, after the
Effective Time, would have the effect of limiting in any material respect the
freedom of CWT or any of its subsidiaries or employees to compete in any line
of business or sell, supply or distribute any product or service, in each
case, in any geographic area or to hire any individual or group of individuals
or any similar obligation or limitation (with such obligation or limitation
described in Section 4.16(b) of the Navigant Disclosure Schedule), or (iii)
any acquisition agreement containing "earn-out" or other contingent payment
obligations.

(c) Section 4.16(c) of the Navigant Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) a list

the date of this Agreement, and (iii) a list of all agreements that relate to

of goods or services by Navigant during the 12 months ended December 31,
2005). Except as disclosed in Section 4.25(a) of the Navigant Disclosure

ARTICLE V

COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

The parties hereto agree that:

5.1  _Mutual Covenants_.

(a) _Reasonable Best Efforts._

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party hereto
will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, promptly
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, promptly all things necessary,
proper or advisable under this Agreement and Applicable Laws to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon
as practicable after the date hereof, including preparing and filing as
promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary
applications, notices, petitions, filings, and other documents, and to obtain
as promptly as practicable (A) all consents, waivers, licenses, novations,
orders, registrations, approvals, permits, rulings, authorizations and
clearances necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Governmental
Authority in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "Required Approvals"), and
(B) the consents and authorizations of the third parties identified in Section
5.1(a) of the Navigant Disclosure Schedule. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each of Navigant and CWT agrees to make (1) as
promptly as practicable, but in any event within ten business days, an  



 

29  appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and (2) as promptly as
practicable all other necessary filings with other Governmental Authorities
relating to the Merger, and to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information or documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to such laws or by such authorities and to use reasonable best efforts to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act and the receipt of Required Approvals under such other laws or
from such authorities as promptly as practicable. Each party shall have
responsibility for its respective filing fees associated with the filings
under the HSR Act and other Required Approvals. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, neither Navigant nor CWT nor any of their
respective subsidiaries shall be required (x) to hold separate (including by
trust or otherwise) or to divest any of their respective businesses or assets,
or (y) to accept any operational restriction, or take any other action that,
in the reasonable judgment of CWT, could be expected to limit the right of CWT
or Navigant to own or operate all or any portion of their respective
businesses or assets.

(ii) Each of CWT and Navigant shall, in connection with the efforts referenced
in Section 5.1(a)(i) to obtain all Required Approvals, use its reasonable
best efforts, but in any event subject to Applicable Laws, to (A) cooperate in
all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and
in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including
any proceeding initiated by a private party, (B) subject to Applicable Laws,
permit counsel for the other party to review in advance any proposed written
communication between it and any Governmental Authority; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the parties may redact any information (1) regarding the
Merger Consideration, (2) alternative mergers or acquisitions considered, (3)
that is privileged and the provision of which to the other party would waive
such privilege, or (4) that would violate a confidentiality agreement with a
third party, (C) promptly inform each other of (and, at the other partys
reasonable request, supply to such other partys counsel) any communication
(or other correspondence or memoranda) received by such party from, or given
by such party to, the Department of Justice ("DOJ"), the Federal Trade
Commission ("FTC") or any other Governmental Authority and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (D) consult with each other in advance to the extent practicable of
any meeting or conference with the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental
Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other Person, and to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or such other
applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences, and
(E) keep each other apprised of the status of any filings or any requests for
additional information and documentary material. 

(iii) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Sections 5.1(a)(i) and 5.1(a)(ii), if any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any regulatory law, or if any
statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or
administrative order is enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by a
Governmental Authority which would make the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby illegal or would otherwise prohibit or materially impair
or delay the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby, each of CWT and Navigant shall cooperate in all respects with  



 

30  each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts, to contest and
resist vigorously any such action or proceeding and to seek to avoid the entry
of, or seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned as promptly as
practicable, any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on or before the Termination Date and to seek
to have such statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or
administrative order repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable as promptly as
practicable so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on or before the Termination Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section
5.1(a) shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
Article VII so long as such party has up to then complied with its obligations
under this Section 5.1(a).

(iv) In the event a party hereto receives a request for additional information
or documentary material ("Second Request") issued by a Governmental Authority
pursuant to 16 C.F.R. § 803.20 in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, such party will comply with such request as
provided by Section 7A(e) of the HSR Act as quickly as practicable. In the
event that a party hereto receives a subpoena or civil investigative demand
requesting materials and information similar to that usually demanded in a
Second Request, such party shall comply with such subpoena or
civil investigative demand as quickly as practicable. In the event the
Governmental Authority disputes the adequacy of compliance by a party hereto
with respect to a Second Request, subpoena, or civil investigative demand,
such party shall endeavor to satisfy the Governmental Authority so as to
minimize any delay in the conduct or resolution of the investigation. Each of
the Parties agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, it will not
withdraw its filing under the HSR Act or any other applicable antitrust,
competition or trade regulation law without the written consent of the other
party. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not enter into any timing
agreement with any Governmental Authority without the written consent of
the other party.

(b) _Public Announcements._ CWT and Navigant will consult with each other
before issuing any press release or making any public statement with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except as may
be required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange, will not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation.

(c) _Conveyance Taxes._ Navigant and CWT shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains,
sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees, and any similar Taxes that
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the
Effective Time.



 

31 (d) _Notice of Certain Events._ Each of the Navigant and CWT shall promptly
notify the other of: 

(i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(ii) any material notice or other communication from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and

(iii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced
after the date hereof or, to its knowledge, threatened after the date hereof
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting Navigant, CWT or any
of their respective subsidiaries that relate to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger.

5.2 _Covenants of CWT_.

(a) _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(i) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporations Certificate of Incorporation and the Surviving Corporations
Bylaws shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification than are set forth in Article Eight of the Navigant
Certificate and Article IV of the Navigant Bylaws, in each case as in effect
on the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who,
at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors or officers of Navigant or
any of its subsidiaries, unless such modification shall be required by law and
then only to the minimum extent required by law.

(ii) After the Effective Time, for a period of six years after the date
thereof, CWT shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving
Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law,
indemnify and hold harmless, each present and former director or officer of
Navigant and each of its subsidiaries (individually, an "Indemnified Party"
and collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against all costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or
after the Effective Time), whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in their capacity as an officer
or director. If the Surviving Corporation acknowledges its indemnification
obligations under this Section 5.2, the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to assume the defense of any such action, suit, proceeding or
investigation and, if the Surviving Corporation assumes the defense thereof,
the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any
legal expenses of separate counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or
counsel to the Indemnified Party advises that there are issues that raise
conflicts of interest between the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable
 



 

32  fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Party promptly as
statements therefor are received; provided that the Surviving Corporation
shall not be liable for the fees of more than one counsel for all Indemnified
Parties, other than local counsel, unless a conflict of interest shall be
caused thereby, and provided further that the Surviving Corporation shall not
be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If the Surviving
Corporation does not assume the defense of any such action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, the Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with
the Indemnified Parties in the defense of any such matter and shall permit the
Indemnified Parties and their counsel and other authorized representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours to the offices, properties,
books and records (including, without limitation, pertinent and necessary
financial documents, internal correspondence, notes, memoranda, and electronic
mail) and personnel of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries for
the purposes of responding to, defending against or otherwise dealing with
any such matter.

(iii) CWT shall cause the Surviving Corporation or CWT to obtain and maintain
in effect, for a period of six years after the Effective Time, policies of
directors and officers liability insurance on behalf of the former officers
and directors of Navigant currently covered by Navigants directors and
officers liability insurance policy with respect to acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time with at least the same coverage and
containing terms and conditions that are not less favorable than those under
existing policies; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the aggregate annual
premiums for such insurance at any time during such period shall exceed 200%
of the per annum rate of premium paid by Navigant and its subsidiaries as of
the date hereof for such insurance, then CWT shall or shall cause its
subsidiaries to, provide only such coverage as shall then be available at an
annual premium equal to 200% of such rate.

(iv) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (B) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, or at CWTs
option, CWT, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.2(a).

(v) The provisions of this Section 5.2(a) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by contract or otherwise.

(vi) CWT shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.2(a).

(b) _Employees and Employee Benefits._

(i) CWT will cause the Surviving Corporation to honor the obligations of
Navigant and any of its subsidiaries as of the Effective Time under the
provisions of all Plans listed on Section 4.15(b) of the Navigant Disclosure
Schedule, _provided_ that this provision shall not prevent the Surviving
Corporation from amending, suspending or terminating  



 

33  any such Plans to the extent permitted by the applicable terms of such Plan.
Notwithstanding any such amendment, suspension or termination, CWT
shall, following the Effective Time and until December 31, 2006, cause the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to provide Navigant Employees with
a comprehensive employee benefits program (excluding equity incentives)
substantially similar in the aggregate to employee benefits currently
provided to Navigant Employees, it being understood that this Section
5.3(b)(i) shall not prevent CWT or the Surviving Corporation from changing any
specific employee benefits program or provision other than the United
Healthcare Insurance Company Personal Benefit Account Plan. Subject to the
accuracy of the representation in Section 4.15(l), CWT shall, following the
Effective Time and until December 31, 2006, cause the Surviving Corporation
and its subsidiaries either to maintain, or to provide a plan or program
substantially equivalent to, the United Healthcare Insurance Company Personal
Benefit Account Plan, for the benefit of participants in that plan as of the
date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that no termination or modification of
the United Healthcare Insurance Company Personal Benefit Account Plan prior to
December 31, 2006 will result in any financial or material detriment to a
plan participant.

(ii) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall restrict the ability of CWT and
its affiliates to terminate the employment of any Navigant Employee for any
reason at any time after the Effective Time.

(iii) For purposes of this Section 5.2(b), "Navigant Employees" means
individuals who are, as of the Effective Time, employees of Navigant and its
subsidiaries not subject to collective bargaining agreements and who following

respective subsidiaries.

(iv) With respect to benefit plans of CWT in which Navigant Employees (and
their dependents) participate after the Closing Date, CWT shall (and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to): (A) waive any limitations as to pre-
existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Navigant Employees
under any such plan in which such Navigant Employees may be eligible to
participate after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
waiver shall apply to (1) a pre-existing condition of any Navigant Employee
or any dependent thereof, who was, immediately prior to the Closing Date,
excluded from participation in a benefit plan maintained or contributed to for
the benefit of such Navigant Employee or dependent by nature of such pre-
existing condition or (2) any Navigant Employee or any dependent thereof, who
did not, immediately prior to the Closing Date participate in the applicable
Navigant plan, (B) provide each Navigant Employee with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date during the year in

recognize all service of Navigant Employees with Navigant or any affiliate
(including, without limitation, Navigant subsidiaries) or predecessor(s)
thereof for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting credit,
entitlement to benefits and benefit accrual (but not for purposes of benefit
accrual under any CWT plans other than vacation and severance benefits) in any
benefit plan in which such Navigant Employee may be eligible to participate
on or after the Closing Date, except to the extent such treatment would result
in duplicative benefits, benefit accrual under a defined benefit  



 

34  plan or past credited service that is not provided for other participants in
such benefit plan generally.

(c) _Supplemental Indenture._ As of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and CWT shall (i) execute and deliver to Wells Fargo

notices to security holders, certificates, opinions, agreements and other
instruments as the trustee under the Indenture may reasonably request in
connection with the Merger and the Indenture and (ii) comply with all
obligations of Navigant under the Indenture.

efforts to obtain the funding contemplated by each of the Financing Letters

not or have not been made available pursuant to any of the Financing Letters,
each of CWT and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
alternative funding in an amount at least equal to the amount necessary to

contained in the Debt Commitment Letters. Following the date hereof, (i) CWT
and Merger Sub shall not agree to any amendment or modification of any term or
condition of any of the Financings without the prior written consent of
Navigant (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) if such
amendment or modification would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any of the Financings and (ii) CWT shall disclose promptly to
Navigant any termination or cancellation of any of the Financings and any
information that becomes known to CWT or Merger Sub regarding any facts or
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay any of the Financings or consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

all actions reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by the Accor Transaction Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions
set forth therein. Following the date hereof, (i) CWT shall not agree to any
amendment or modification of the Accor Transaction Agreement without the prior
written consent of Navigant (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) if such amendment or modification would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Accor Transaction Agreement and (ii) CWT shall disclose
promptly to Navigant any termination of the Accor Transaction Agreement and

38 (b) _Acquisition Proposals_.

(i) Navigant agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries shall, and
that it shall cause its and its subsidiaries respective officers, directors,
employees, agents and representatives (including any investment banker,
attorney or accountant ("Representatives") retained by it or any of its
subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, (A) initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries with respect to, or the making
of, an Acquisition Proposal, (B) engage in any negotiations concerning, or
provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions
with, any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or
limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Authority or other entity of any kind
or nature (each, a "Person") relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or
otherwise knowingly encourage or facilitate any effort or attempt to make or
implement an Acquisition Proposal, (C) approve or recommend or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (D) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement relating to any
Acquisition Proposal or propose publicly or agree to do any of the foregoing
relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent Navigant or the Navigant Board from
complying with its disclosure obligations under Sections 14d-9 and 14e-2 of
the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such disclosure has the effect of withdrawing, modifying
or qualifying the approval of this Agreement by the Navigant Board or the
Navigant Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to CWT, CWT shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement to the extent set forth in Section 7.4(a) of
this Agreement.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent Navigant or the Navigant Board from
at any time prior to, but not after, the time this Agreement and the Merger
are approved by the Navigant Stockholders at the Navigant Stockholders
Meeting, (A) providing information in response to a request therefor by,
or engaging in any negotiations or discussions with, a Person who has made a
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal to the Navigant Board after the date
hereof which was not solicited by Navigant, directly or indirectly, after the
date hereof in violation of Section 5.3(b)(i) if the Navigant Board receives
from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement on customary terms no
less favorable to Navigant than the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of
March 31, 2005, between Navigant and CWT (the "Confidentiality Agreement");
or (B) recommending such an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
to the Navigant Stockholders, if and only to the extent that, (1) in each
such case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, the Navigant Board
determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that a
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach
by its directors of their respective fiduciary duties under Applicable Law,
(2) in the case of clause (A) above, the Navigant Board determines in good
faith after consultation with outside legal counsel and outside financial
advisors that there is a reasonable likelihood that such Acquisition Proposal
will result in a Superior Proposal; and (3) in the case of clause (B) above,
the Navigant Board determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal (in
the form, other than immaterial changes, that was the subject of the Superior
Proposal Notice, as defined below) constitutes a  



 

39  Superior Proposal and CWT shall have received written notice (the "Superior
Proposal Notice") of Navigants intention to take the action referred to in
clause (B) at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to the taking of such action
by Navigant (the "Waiting Period"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Navigant
Board continues to believe, after taking into account any modifications to
the terms of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement that are proposed
by CWT after its receipt of the Superior Proposal Notice (with respect to
which modifications Navigant and CWT shall endeavor to negotiate in good
faith), that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. If the
Navigant Board recommends an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to clause (B) above, then CWT shall be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(a) of the Agreement.

(iv) Navigant agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Person (other than the parties hereto) conducted heretofore with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal. Navigant agrees that it will take the necessary
steps to promptly inform the officers, directors, employees and
Representatives of Navigant and its subsidiaries of the obligations undertaken
in this Section 5.3(b). Navigant also agrees promptly, but, in any event,
within five days after the date of this Agreement, to request the return or
destruction of all confidential information and materials provided prior to
the date of this Agreement by it, its subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives to any Person (other than the parties hereto) that has
executed a confidentiality agreement within the last twelve (12) months prior
to the date hereof in connection with its consideration or making of any
Acquisition Proposal.

(v) From and after the execution of this Agreement, Navigant shall promptly,
orally notify CWT of any request for information or any inquiries, proposals
or offers relating to an Acquisition Proposal indicating, in connection with
such notice, the name of such Person making such request, inquiry, proposal or
offer and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and
Navigant shall provide to CWT written notice of any such inquiry, proposal or
offer within 24 hours of such event. Navigant shall keep CWT informed orally
on a reasonably current basis of the status of any Acquisition Proposal,
including with respect to the status and material terms of any such proposal
or offer and whether any such proposal or offer has been definitively
withdrawn or rejected. Navigant also agrees to provide to CWT any material
non-public information regarding Navigant (not theretofore provided or made
available to CWT) that it is providing to another Person pursuant to this
Section 5.3(b)(v) promptly after it provides such information to such other
Person.

(vi) Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.3(b) by any officer, director or
employee of Navigant or any of its subsidiaries or any Representative of
Navigant or any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 5.3(b) by Navigant.

(vii) For purposes of this Agreement:

(A) "Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal or offer with respect to (1) a
merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving
Navigant, (2) any purchase of an equity interest (including by means of  



 

40  a tender or exchange offer) representing an amount equal to or greater than
a 15% voting or economic interest in Navigant, or (3) any purchase of assets,
securities or ownership interests representing an amount equal to or greater
than 15% of the consolidated assets of Navigant and its subsidiaries taken as
a whole (including stock of the subsidiaries of Navigant).

(B) "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (except
that references in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" to "15%" shall be
replaced by "50%") made by a Person other than a party hereto that is on terms
that the Navigant Board (after consultation with its outside financial advisor
and outside counsel) in good faith concludes, taking into account, among
other relevant considerations, all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the proposal, the likelihood of obtaining financing and satisfying
other conditions, and the Person making the proposal, are more favorable to
the Navigant Stockholders than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
taking into account any change in the transaction proposed by CWT.

(c) _Third Party Standstill Agreements._ During the period from the date of
this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and termination of
this Agreement: (i) Navigant shall not (and shall not agree to, and shall not
permit any of its subsidiaries to or to agree to) terminate, amend, modify or
waive any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it
or any of its subsidiaries is a party (other than any involving CWT or its
subsidiaries); and (ii) Navigant shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law, the
provisions of any such agreements, including, if so requested by CWT and at
CWTs expense, seeking injunctions to prevent any breaches of such
confidentiality or standstill agreements and enforcing specifically the terms
and provisions thereof in any court of the United States or any state thereof
having jurisdiction.

(d) _Access._ From the date hereof until the Effective Time and subject
to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, Navigant shall (i) give
CWT, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the offices,
properties, books and records of Navigant and its subsidiaries, (ii) furnish
to CWT, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives such financial and operating data and other information as
such Persons may reasonably request (including furnishing to CWT Navigants
financial results in advance of filing any Navigant SEC Documents containing
such financial results), and (iii) instruct the employees, counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives of Navigant and its
subsidiaries to cooperate with CWT in its investigation of Navigant and its
subsidiaries. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.3(d) shall be
conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of
the business of Navigant and its subsidiaries. No information or knowledge
obtained by CWT in any investigation pursuant to this Section shall affect or
be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by
Navigant hereunder.

(e) _Convertible Debentures._ Navigant shall provide the notice required
pursuant to Section 15.01(b)(ii) of the Indenture.



 

41 (f) _Financing Matters._ Navigant will provide CWT and Merger Sub and its

audited accounts of Navigant (which shall be provided within 90 days of the
financial year end), (ii) the unaudited consolidated quarterly financial
statements of Navigant (which shall be provided within 45 days of the end of

through the Closing.

(c) CWT shall have delivered to Navigant a certificate executed by CWTs
chief executive officer and chief financial officer on behalf of CWT to the

foregoing;

(b) if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by Navigant in this Agreement (other than such
covenants contained in Section 5.3(b)), or any such representation and
warranty shall have become untrue or incorrect after the execution of this
Agreement, in each case set forth in this Section 7.4(b) such that the
conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a), 6.2(b), 6.2(c) or 6.2(d) would not be
satisfied and such breach or failure to be true and correct is not cured
within 30 calendar days following receipt of written notice from CWT of such
breach or failure (or such longer period during which Navigant exercises
reasonable best efforts to cure);

(c) if there has been a material breach by Navigant of any of its material
covenants contained in Section 5.3(b) to the material detriment of CWT;

(d) if the Accor Transaction Agreement has been terminated without
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Accor Transaction
Agreement;

(e) If a Governmental Authority (through the Head of the Governmental
Authority or a division thereof) (i) has informed the parties hereto that such
Governmental Authority intends to oppose the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and if the board of directors of CWT shall have determined in good
faith after consultation with outside counsel that the condition in Section
6.1(b) is not likely to be satisfied in accordance with the principles set
forth in Section 5.1(a) prior to the Termination Date or (ii) commences any
action seeking to permanently enjoin, restrain or otherwise prohibit the
transaction as violative of the antitrust laws; or



 

46 (f) if the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or in Section 6.2(c) shall
have become incapable of satisfaction but for the provisions of clause (iv)
of the definition of Material Adverse Effect with respect to Navigant.

7.5 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment._ In the event of a termination of
this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article VII,
this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the
part of any party hereto (or of any of its directors, officers, employees,
agents, legal and financial advisors or other Representatives), other than the
provisions of this Section 7.5 and Section 7.6; _provided_ , _however_
, that, except as otherwise provided herein, no such termination shall
relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from any
willful or intentional breach of this Agreement.

7.6 _Fees and Expenses._

(a) In the event that:

(i) (A)(1) CWT shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(b)
by reason of Navigants intentional or reckless breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant under this Agreement, (2) CWT shall have terminated this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(c) or (3) CWT or Navigant shall have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b), (B)
on or prior to such time (or in connection with a termination pursuant to
Section 7.2(b), on or prior to the Navigant Stockholders Meeting) any Person
(other than CWT) shall have made (or publicly disclosed its intention to
make) and not withdrawn an Acquisition Proposal (substituting 50% for the 15%
threshold set forth in the definition of Acquisition Proposal, a "Covered
Proposal"), (C) within twelve (12) months of termination of this Agreement,
Navigant enters into an agreement with respect to a Covered Proposal, and (D)
such Covered Proposal is thereafter consummated at any time;

(ii) CWT shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(a); or

(iii) Navigant shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.3(b),

then, in any such event, Navigant shall pay to CWT a termination fee in cash
of $15.0 million (the "CWT Termination Fee"). Any CWT Termination Fee that
becomes payable shall be paid (x) in the case of clause (i) above, not later
than the date on which Navigant consummates a Covered Proposal, (y) in the
case of clause (ii) above, not later than the second business day after the
date that the Agreement is terminated, and (z) in the case of clause (iii)
above, immediately prior to or concurrently with the termination of the
Agreement, in each case payable by wire transfer of same day funds.

(b) In the event that (i) CWT shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.4(e) or Section 7.4(f), (ii) Navigant shall have terminated this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3(c)(i) or (iii) either CWT or Navigant shall
have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.2(c) as a result of an
order, decree or ruling or other action taken by a Governmental Authority
related to the HSR Act or applicable foreign antitrust laws, then, in any such
event, CWT shall pay to Navigant by wire transfer of same day funds a
termination fee in  



 

47  cash of $15.0 million, such payment to be made not later than the second
business day after the date that the Agreement is terminated.

(c) In the event that (i) CWT shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.4(d) or (ii) Navigant shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.3(c)(ii) or Section 7.3(d), then, in such event, CWT shall pay to
Navigant by wire transfer of same day funds a termination fee in cash of $15
million, such payment to be made not later than the second business day after
the date that the Agreement is terminated.

(d) Each of CWT and Navigant acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 7.6 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither CWT nor Navigant
would enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if a party (the "Paying Party")
fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.6, and, in
order to obtain such payment, the party entitled to payment (the "Recipient
Party") commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Paying Party
for the fees set forth in this Section 7.6 or any portion of such fees, the
Paying Party shall pay to the Recipient Party its reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount of the fees at the prime rate of
Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made from
the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

(e) Except as specifically provided in this Section 7.6, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party hereto
incurring such expenses, except filing fees incurred in connection with
Commission filings relating to the Merger and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and printing and mailing costs related thereto, all of which
shall be shared equally by CWT and Navigant.

8.3 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The headings, the table of contents and
the index of defined terms contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes," or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." Information disclosed in one section of the Navigant
Disclosure Schedule shall be integrated into  



 

49  another section of the Navigant Disclosure Schedule without the necessity of
a cross-reference to the extent its applicability thereto is
readily apparent. For the purposes of this Agreement:

(a) "Material Adverse Effect" with respect to Navigant means any
event, change, circumstance or effect (any such item, an "Effect") that is or
is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the business,
results of operations or financial condition of Navigant and its subsidiaries
taken as a whole or on its ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement on a timely basis or to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on a timely basis; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall any of the following be deemed, either alone or in combination, to
constitute, nor shall any of the following be taken into account in
determining whether there has been, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
Navigant: (i) any Effect related to the actions of CWT or Merger Sub or the
public announcement or pendency of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) any Effect that results from (x) any action taken pursuant to
or in accordance with this Agreement or (y) any action taken, or any failure
to take action, to which CWT has consented in writing, (iii) any change, in
and of itself, in the market price or trading volume of shares of Navigant, or
(iv) any Effect that results from changes in general economic conditions or
general changes in the travel industry (including economic, legal or
regulatory changes or circumstances that affect or are generally perceived to
affect traveler health or safety, or any material worsening of
terrorist activities or war or armed hostilities occurring after the date
hereof), except to the extent those Effects adversely affect Navigant and its
subsidiaries to a materially greater extent than they affect other entities in
the corporate travel management industry;

(b) "Material Adverse Effect" with respect to CWT means any Effect that is or
is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the ability of CWT
to perform its obligations under this Agreement on a timely basis or to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on a timely basis;

(c) "subsidiary," when used with respect to any party hereto, means any entity
of which such party (i) owns 50% or more of the outstanding securities or
other ownership interests, or (ii) through contract or otherwise possesses
power to appoint at least 50% of the directors of such entity (or persons
performing similar functions); and

(d) "knowledge of Navigant" means the actual knowledge of the following
persons: Edward S. Adams; Robert C. Griffith; Eugene A. Over, Jr.; John S.
Coffman; Lyell Farquharson; Kelly Kuhn; Steve Some; David Buskirk; Mike Premo;
Gary Pearce; Gina Keating; Keith Taylor and Sam DeFranco.

8.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, which
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. The parties hereto may
execute more than one copy of this Agreement, each of which shall constitute
an original.

8.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the
instruments referred to in this Agreement) and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto and thereto and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, agreements or
representations by or among the parties hereto and thereto, written and oral,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.



 

50 8.6 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the agreements set forth in
Section 5.2(a), nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended or
shall be construed to create any third-party beneficiaries. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, for purposes of Section 6.2(g) only, Accor shall be a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement and no waiver of the condition set forth
in Section 6.2(g) shall be effective unless such waiver is in writing executed
by each of CWT and Accor.

8.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts
executed in and to be performed in that State. All Actions arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement shall be heard
and determined in any state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware.

8.8 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue._

(a) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the state courts of Delaware and to the jurisdiction of the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware for the purpose of
any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement, and each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees
that all claims in respect to such Action may be heard and determined
exclusively in any Delaware state or federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the service of any
summons and complaint and any other process in any other Action relating to
the Merger, on behalf of itself or its property, by the personal delivery of
copies of such process to such party. Nothing in this Section 8.8 shall
affect the right of any party hereto to serve legal process in any other
manner permitted by law.

8.9 _Specific Performance_. The transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are unique. Accordingly, each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees
that, in addition to all other remedies to which it may be entitled, each of
the parties hereto is entitled to a decree of specific performance; provided,
that such party hereto was not in material default hereunder at the time of
the other partys material breach of the Agreement. The parties hereto agree
that if CWT, Merger Sub or Navigant shall have failed to perform its
obligations under this Agreement, then the party hereto seeking to enforce
this Agreement against such nonperforming party under this Agreement shall be
entitled to specific performance and injunctive and other equitable relief,
and the parties hereto further agree to waive any requirement for the securing
or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive
or other equitable relief. This provision is without prejudice to any other
rights that any party hereto may have against another party hereto for any
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

8.10 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CWT may
without such consent assign or delegate its rights and  



 

51  obligations hereunder or under any instrument executed or delivered in
connection herewith as collateral security to any lender or any other debt
financing source providing financing in connection herewith, which assignment
shall not relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.

8.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time before or after approval of the Merger by the Navigant Stockholders;
_provided, however_ , that after any such approval, no amendment shall be made
that by law requires further approval by the Navigant Stockholders without
such approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be amended except
by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

8.12 _Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
or (c) subject to the proviso of Section 8.11, waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights and the single or
partial exercise of any rights hereof shall not preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

8.13 _Severability._ Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only
so broad as is enforceable.



 

52 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, CWT, Merger Sub and Navigant have signed this Agreement as
of the date first written above.
