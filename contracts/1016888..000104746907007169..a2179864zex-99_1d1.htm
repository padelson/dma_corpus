respect to the Meridian Equity Entitlements that are stock options that have not been exercised at or before the Expiry Time, the parties agree to cooperate to ensure that all
such outstanding Meridian Equity Entitlements become options to acquire Yamana Common Shares (on&nbsp;a tax-deferred basis for purposes of the Income Tax&nbsp;Act (Canada) if
reasonably practicable) whereby, effective as of the Expiry Time, subject to applicable Laws, each such Meridian Equity Entitlement shall automatically be converted into an option to acquire a number
of Yamana Common Shares equal the sum of (i)&nbsp;2.235 and (ii)&nbsp;the quotient of C$7.00 divided by the average of the closing prices of the Shares on the TSX for the five trading days ending
on the trading day immediately prior to the Expiry Time (such sum, the "Conversion Number") (with the aggregate number of all such Yamana Common Shares per grant being rounded down to the nearest
whole number) at an exercise price per Yamana Common Share equal to the exercise price per Share of that Meridian Equity Entitlement immediately prior to the Expiry Time divided by the Conversion
Number, rounded up to the nearest whole cent and otherwise exercisable in accordance with its terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms and conditions of this conversion and all other provisions
of this Section&nbsp;2.3 shall be determined and effected in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Section&nbsp;409A of the U.S.&nbsp;Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. </FONT></DD></DL>
