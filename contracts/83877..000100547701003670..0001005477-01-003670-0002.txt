ARTICLE II   THE MERGER   Section 2.1 The Merger.   (a) Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions hereof, and in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), at the Effective Time, the Company
shall be merged with and into Acquisition Sub, whereupon the separate
existence of the Company shall cease, and Acquisition Sub shall continue as
the surviving corporation (sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving
Corporation") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State of
Delaware and shall continue under the name "John Deere Landscapes
II, Inc."   (b) The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place
(i) at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP ("Skadden,
Arps"), Four Times Square, New York, New York, as soon as practicable, but in
any event within three business days, after the day on which the last to be
fulfilled or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be fulfilled at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of such condi tions) shall be fulfilled
or waived in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or (ii) at such
other time, date or place as the Company and Parent may agree to in writing
(such date, the "Closing Date").   8    (c) Concurrently with the
Closing, the Company, Parent and Acquisi tion Sub shall cause a certificate
of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with respect to the Merger to be
executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the
"Secretary of State") as provided in the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective on the date and at the time at which the Certificate of Merger has
been duly filed with the Secretary of State or at such other date and time as
is agreed between the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger, and
such date and time is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time."  
(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises and
be subject to all of the obligations, restrictions, disabilities,
liabilities, debts and duties of the Company and Acquisition Sub.   Section
2.2 Effect on Securities.   (a) At the Effective Time, subject to the
provisions of this Agreement (including, but not limited to Sections 2.4, 2.5
and 2.10), each share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share of the
Company ("Common Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares cancelled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and
Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.10)) shall be converted into the
following (the "Merger Consideration"):   (i) for each share of Common
Stock with respect to which an election to receive cash has been effectively
made and not revoked or lost, pursuant to Section 2.3 (a "Cash Election"),
the right to receive in cash from Parent an amount equal to $36.1299 (the
"Merger Price") (collectively, "Cash Election Shares");   (ii) for each
share of Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive common
stock, $1.00 par value, of Parent (the "Parent Shares") has been effectively
made and not revoked or lost, pursuant to Section 2.3 (a "Stock Election"),
the right to receive from Parent, that fraction of a Parent Share equal to
the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) (collectively, "Stock Election
Shares"). For purposes of this Agreement, the "Exchange Ratio" shall be equal
to the result ob tained by dividing the Merger Price by the average closing
sales price (the "Closing Sales Price"), rounded to four decimal points, of
the Parent Shares, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the
"NYSE") Composite Tape, for the period of the ten consecutive trading days
ending on the second full trading day prior to the Effective Time; provided,
however, it is expressly    9   acknowledged and agreed that if the
Parent Shares have a Closing Sales Price equal to or more than $42.9375, then
the Exchange Ratio will be fixed at 0.8415. By way of example, at the
Exchange Ratio of 0.8415, if all shares of Common Stock were exchanged for
Parent Shares, the approximately 3,459,742 shares of Common Stock would be
exchanged for approximately 2,911,373 Parent Shares. If the Closing Sales
Price is below $42.9375, then the Exchange Ratio will increase and the Common
Stock would be exchanged for more Parent Shares to maintain (based on the
Closing Sales Price) the value of the aggregate consideration received if the
Closing Sales Price were $42.9375. By way of example, if the Closing Sales
Price is $40.00, then the Exchange Ratio would be 0.9032 and, if all of the
approximately 3,459,742 shares of Common Stock were exchanged for Parent
Shares, then approximately 3,124,839 Parent Shares would be received.
For purposes of calculating the Exchange Ratio, in the event that Parent
declares a stock split, stock dividend or other reclassification or exchange
with respect to the Parent Shares with a record date with respect thereto
occurring prior to the Effective Time, there will be an appropriate
adjustment made to the Exchange Ratio to provide to the holders of the Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event; and   (iii) for each share of Common Stock other than shares as
to which a Cash Election or a Stock Election has been effectively made and
not revoked or lost, pursuant to Section 2.3 (a "Non-Election"): (A) if the
total number of Cash Election Shares and Dissenting Shares exceeds the Cash
Number (as defined in Section 2.4(a)), the right to receive from Parent, that
fraction of a Parent Share equal to the Exchange Ratio, or (B) if the total
number of Cash Election Shares and Dissenting Shares is less than or equal to
the Cash Number, the right to receive cash and Parent Shares pursuant to
Section 2.2(b) (collectively, "Non-Electing Shares").   (b) In the event
that Non-Electing Shares are converted pursuant to Section 2.2(a)(iii)(B),
the Non-Electing Shares shall be converted into the right to receive cash and
Parent Shares in the following manner:   (i) a proration factor (the "Non-
Election Proration Factor") shall be a fraction, (A) the numerator of which
shall be the lesser of (x) the total number of Non-Electing Shares and (y)
the Cash Number minus the total number of Cash Election Shares and Dissenting
Shares and (B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of Non-
Electing Shares; and   (ii) each Non-Electing Share shall be converted into
(A) the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the
Merger Price and (y) the Non-    10   Election Proration Factor and (B)
a fraction of a Parent Share equal to the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio
and (y) a fraction equal to one minus the Non- Election Proration Factor.  
(c) At the Effective Time, all shares of Common Stock (together with the
associated Company Rights (as defined in Section 4.3(a), if any) to
be converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.2
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders of shares of Common Stock, (w) cease to be outstanding, (x) be
cancelled, (y) be retired and (z) cease to exist; and each holder of a
certificate evidencing any such shares of Common Stock (the "Certificates")
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter cease to have any
rights with respect to such securities, except the right to receive (i) the
Merger Consideration, (ii) any dividends and other distributions in
accordance with Section 2.5(c) and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any
fractional Parent Share in accordance with Section 2.5(d).   (d) No shares
of Acquisition Sub stock will be issued directly or indirectly in the Merger.
Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Acquisition Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding following the Effective Time.   (e) At the Effective Time, each
share of Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall automati cally be cancelled and retired and cease
to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered therefor or in
respect thereto.   (f) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration or transfers of Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Article II.   Section 2.3 Share Election.  
(a) Each Person who, on or prior to the Election Date (as defined in Section
2.3(c)) is a record holder of shares of Common Stock shall have the right,
subject to Section 2.4, to submit a Form of Election (as defined in Section
2.3(c)) specifying (i) the number of shares of Common Stock that such Person
desires to be converted into cash pursuant to the Cash Election and/or (ii)
the number of shares of Common Stock that such Person desires to be converted
into Parent Shares pursuant to the Stock Election.    11    (b) Prior to
the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as defined in Section 7.2(a))
to the record holders of shares of Common Stock of the Company, The Bank of
New York, or such other bank, trust company, Person or Persons, shall be
designated by Parent to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for
payment of the Merger Consideration.   (c) Parent or its authorized agent or
representative shall prepare, subject to the reasonable approval of the
Company, a form of election (the "Form of Election") for mailing with the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The Form of Election shall be (i) mailed to the
record holders of shares of Common Stock as of the record date for the
Stockholders\' Meeting (as defined in Section 7.2(a)), and (ii) used by each
record holder of shares of Common Stock to make either the Cash Election or
the Stock Election, subject to the provisions of Section 2.4. The Company
shall also use its reasonable efforts to make the Form of Election and the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus available to all Persons who become holders of
shares of Common Stock during the period between such record date and
the Election Date. Any such holder\'s election to receive cash shall have
been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have received at its
designated office, by 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the business day next
preceding the Closing Date (the "Election Date"), a Form of Election properly
completed and signed and accompanied by Certificate(s) for the share(s) of
Common Stock to which such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank
or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company (or
by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificate(s) as set forth
in such Form of Election from a firm which is a member of a registered
national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company having an
office or correspondent in the United States, provided that such
Certificate(s) are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent within three NYSE
trading days after the date of execution of such guarantee of delivery).  
(d) Any Form of Election may be revoked by a holder of Common
Stock submitting such Form of Election to the Exchange Agent only by written
notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time
on the Election Date. In addition, all Forms of Election shall automatically
be revoked if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Parent and the
Company that the Merger has been abandoned or if the Company\'s stockholders
fail to approve the Merger. If a Form of Election is revoked, the
Certificate(s) (or guarantee(s) of delivery, if applica ble) for the share(s)
of Common Stock, if any, to which such Form of Election relates shall
promptly be returned to the stockholder submitting the same to the Exchange
Agent.   (e) For purposes of this Agreement, a holder of Common Stock
who does not submit a Form of Election which is received by the Exchange
Agent prior to the    12   Election Date shall be deemed to have made a
Non-Election. If Parent or the Exchange Agent shall determine that any
purported Cash Election or Stock Election was not properly made, such
purported Cash Election or Stock Election shall be deemed to be of no force
and effect and the holder making such purported Cash Election or Stock
Election shall for purposes of this Agreement, be deemed to have made a Non-
Election.   (f) Parent shall have the sole discretion, which it may delegate
in whole or in part to the Exchange Agent, to determine whether Forms of
Election have been properly completed, signed and submitted or revoked and to
disregard immate rial defects in Forms of Election. The decision of Parent
(or the Exchange Agent, if applicable) in such matters shall be conclusive
and binding. Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent will be under any
obligation to notify any Person of any defect in a Form of Election submitted
to the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall make all computations
contemplated by Section 2.4 and all such computations shall be conclusive and
binding on the holders of Common Stock.   Section 2.4 Proration.   (a)
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the maximum number
of shares of Common Stock which shall be converted into the right to receive
cash in the Merger, pursuant to Cash Elections, shall be equal to that number
which corresponds to 49% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Cash Number"); provided,
however, that if either (i) the tax opinion delivered to the Company referred
to in Section 8.3(c) cannot be rendered (as reasonably determined by Sills
Cummis Radin Tischman Epstein and Gross ("Sills Cummis"), counsel to
the Company) or (ii) the tax opinion delivered to Parent referred to in
Section 8.2(c) cannot be rendered (as reasonably determined by Skadden, Arps,
counsel to Parent), then the Cash Number shall be reduced to the minimum
extent necessary to enable the relevant tax opinion or opinions, as the case
may be, to be rendered.   (b) If the total number of Cash Election Shares
and Dissenting Shares exceeds the Cash Number, then the Cash Election Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive cash and Parent Shares in the
following manner:   (i) a proration factor (the "Cash Proration Factor")
shall be a fraction, (A) the numerator of which shall be the Cash Number
minus the total number of Dissenting Shares and (B) the denominator of which
shall be the total number of Cash Election Shares; and    13    (ii)
each Cash Election Share shall be converted into (A) the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the Merger Price and (y) the Cash
Proration Factor and (B) a fraction of a Parent Share equal to the product of
(x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) a fraction equal to one minus the Cash
Proration Factor.    14    Section 2.5 Exchange of Certificates.   (a)
Following the Effective Time in a timely manner so that the Exchange Agent
can promptly honor the Cash Elections and Stock Elections made and delivered
to the Exchange Agent, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent: (i)
cash to fund payment to holders who made a Cash Election and
(ii) certificates representing Parent Shares to be exchanged for
certificates representing shares of Common Stock held by holders who made a
Stock Election, with the aggregate thereof constituting the Merger
Consideration.   (b) As of or promptly following the Effective Time and the
final determination of the Cash Proration Factor, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and to make available for collection
by hand) to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in the
form and have such other provisions as Parent may specify) and (ii) instruc
tions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
(A) a certificate or certificates representing that number of whole Parent
Shares if any, into which the number of shares of Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted
pursuant to Section 2.2 and (B) the amount of cash, if any, into which all or
a portion of the number of shares of Common Stock previously represented by
such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to
Section 2.2 (which instructions shall provide that at the election of the
surrendering holder, Certificates may be surrendered, and the Merger
Consideration in exchange therefor collected, by hand delivery). Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with a letter of transmittal properly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
reasonably required pursuant to such instruc tions, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration for each share of Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall be forthwith
cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall promptly accept such Certificates upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary
exchange practices. No interest shall accrue on the Merger Consideration (or
the cash payable as described in Section 2.5(c) and (d) below) payable upon
the surrender of the Certificates for the benefit of, or be paid to, the
holders of the Certificates.    15    (c) No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Shares with a record date on or after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the Parent Shares represented thereby by reason
of the conversion of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Sections 2.2, 2.3 and
2.4 and no cash payment in lieu of fractional Parent Shares shall be paid to
any such holder pursuant to Section 2.5(d) until such Certificate is
surrendered in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of
applicable Laws (as defined in Section 4.5(a)), following surrender of any
such Certificate, there shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in
whose name the Parent Shares representing such securities are registered (i)
at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of
fractional Parent Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.5(d) and the proportionate amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect
to Parent Shares issued upon conversion of Common Stock, and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date or as promptly as practicable thereafter,
the proportionate amount of dividends or other distributions, with (x) a
record date with respect thereto after the Effective Time, but prior to such
surrender, and (y) a payment date subsequent to such surrender, payable with
respect to such Parent Shares.   (d) Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, no fraction of a Parent Share will be issued and no dividend or other
distribution, stock split or interest with respect to Parent Shares shall
relate to any fractional Parent Share, and such fractional interest shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a security holder of
the Parent Shares. In lieu of any such fractional security, each holder of
shares of Common Stock otherwise entitled to a fraction of a Parent Share in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.5 will be entitled to
receive from the Exchange Agent a cash payment in an amount equal to the
product of (i) such fractional part of a Parent Share multiplied by (ii) the
closing price for a Parent Share on the NYSE Composite Tape on the date of
the Effective Time or, if such date is not a business day, the business day
immediately following the date on which the Effective Time occurs.   (e)
Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent
pursuant to this Section 2.5 (the "Exchange Fund") which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or its designee, upon demand,
and any holders of shares of Common Stock prior to the Merger who have
not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look for
payment of their claim, as general creditors thereof, only to Parent for
their claim for (i) cash, if any, (ii) Parent Shares, if any, (iii) any cash
without interest, to be paid, in lieu of any fractional Parent Shares and
(iv) any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent   
16   Shares to which such holders may be entitled in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.5.   (f) None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the
Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any
Parent Shares or cash held in the Exchange Fund (and any cash, dividends and
other distributions payable in respect thereof) delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.   (g) At Parent\'s sole discretion, the Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent or its designee.
Nothing contained in this Section 2.5(g) shall relieve Parent or the Exchange
Agent from making the payments required by this Article II to be made to the
holders of shares of Common Stock.   Section 2.6 Transfer Taxes;
Withholding. If any certificate for a Parent Share is to be issued to, or
cash is to be remitted to, a Person (other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered), it shall be a
condition of such exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration
to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
so surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Parent or the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Common Stock such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent are
required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of shares of Common Stock in respect of whom
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.
Parent shall pay any transfer taxes other than those specifically set forth
in this Section 2.6 associated with the transfer of assets or control, or
otherwise due, as a result of the Merger.   Section 2.7 Stock Options.  
(a) At the Effective Time, the obligation to honor each outstanding employee
or director option to purchase shares of Common Stock (a "Company Option")

Term   17   Incentive Plan pursuant to which Company Options or other
stock-based awards of the Company have been or may be granted (each as may be
amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Incentive Plans"), whether
vested or not vested, shall be deemed assumed by Parent. At and after the
Effective Time, (i) each Company Option then outstanding shall entitle the
holder thereof to acquire the number (rounded up to the nearest whole number)
of Parent Shares determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Common
Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
by (y) the Exchange Ratio, and (ii) the exercise price per share of Parent
Shares subject to any such Company Option at and after the Effective Time
shall be an amount (rounded up to the nearest one- hundredth of a cent) equal
to (x) the exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to such Company
Option prior to the Effective Time, divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio (the
"Substitute Options"). Other than as provided above, as of and after the
Effective Time, each Substitute Option shall be subject to the same terms and
conditions of the Company Option as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustment to a Company
Option which is an "incentive stock option" shall be made in a manner
consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.   (b) Parent shall take such
corporate action as may be necessary or appropriate to, at or promptly
following the Effective Time, file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor
or other appropriate form) (the "Form S-8") with respect to the Parent Shares
subject to any Substitute Options to the extent such registration is required
under applicable Law in order for such Parent Shares to be sold without
restriction in the United States.   (c) The Board of the Directors of the
Company shall take all corpo rate action necessary to cause the Company
Options outstanding at the Effective Time to be treated in accordance with
Section 2.7(a) and be assumed by Parent at the Effective Time. Following the
Effective Time, no holder of a Company Option shall have any rights to
acquire Common Stock.   (d) Parent and the Company shall take all such steps
as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.7
and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) or acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including
derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual
who (i) is a director or officer of the Com pany or (ii), at the Effective
Time, will become a director or officer of Parent, to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, such steps taken in accordance with
the No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden,
Arps.   18    Section 2.8 Warrants.   (a) At the Effective Time, the
obligation to honor each outstanding Series B Warrant of Common Stock (a
"Company Warrant") shall be deemed assumed by Parent. At and after the
Effective Time: (i) each Company Warrant then outstanding shall entitle the
holder thereof to acquire the number (rounded up to the nearest whole number)
of Parent Shares determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Common
Stock subject to such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time
by (y) the Exchange Ratio; and (ii) the exercise price per share of Parent
Shares subject to any such Company Warrant at and after the Effective Time
shall be an amount (rounded up to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent) equal
to (x) the exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to such Company
Warrant prior to the Effective Time, divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio (the
"Substitute Warrants"). Other than as provided above, as of and after the
Effective Time, each Substitute Warrant shall be subject to the same terms
and conditions of the Company Warrants as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time.   (b) The Board of the Directors of the Company shall take
all corpo rate action necessary to cause the Company Warrants outstanding at
the Effective Time to be treated in accordance with Section 2.8(a) and be
assumed by Parent at the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, no
holder of a Company Warrant shall have any rights to acquire Common
Stock.   (c) If the Company Warrant remains unexercised, the Company
shall cause an amendment to the Company Warrant, dated as of March 29, 1995,
issued to Fred R. Sullivan ("Sullivan") and now held by FRS Capital Company,
LLC, to be effected prior to the Closing, which would amend paragraph (j)
thereof to provide that, following the Effective Time, Parent\'s obligations
under such paragraph shall be subject to the Parent\'s including the shares
related to the Warrant in a registration statement for shares to be sold by
other selling shareholders of Parent. If the Com pany Warrant is exercised
prior to the Effective Time and Parent is notified of such exercise and that
a Stock Election is being made by the holder thereof, then the shares related
to the Company Warrant shall be exchanged for registered Parent Shares at or
promptly after the Effective Time as a part of the Merger.   Section 2.9
Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such   19   Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consider ation to which
the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article II.   Section 2.10
Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.2, to the extent (if at all)
that holders of Common Stock are entitled to appraisal rights under Section

prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised
and perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, but the holders of Dissenting Shares
shall be entitled to receive from the Company such consideration as shall be
determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if
any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall effectively withdraw or
lose his or her right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holder\'s
shares of Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Price, without any
interest thereon, or Parent Shares or a combination thereof, as determined by
Parent in its sole discretion, and such shares shall not be deemed to be
Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
notices or demands for appraisal or payment for shares of Common Stock
received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or notices.
The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate
any demands.   ARTICLE III   THE SURVIVING CORPORATION   Section 3.1

its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted.
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a
foreign corpora tion to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing

Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 4.1(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of the names, capitalization, and
jurisdictions of incorpora tion or other formations of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries. The term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any fact,

individually or in the aggregate, to the financial condition, business or
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole;

aggregate, to constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect: (i) a decrease in
revenues of the Company; (ii) a decrease in customer orders; or (iii) any
cancellations of customer orders to the extent that the Company can in good
faith establish that cancellations were directly    21   attributable
to the public announcement that the Company will be acquired by Parent
pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) All the outstanding
shares of capital stock or other equity or voting interests of each
Subsidiary of the Company are owned by the Company, by another wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company or by the Company and another wholly-owned

other improvements located thereon (collectively, the "Owned Real Property")
free and clear of all Liens, except for (i) the Liens described in said

material respect with, or materially increase the cost of, the use, occupancy
or operation of the applicable parcel of Owned Real Property as currently
used, occupied and operated (col-    38   lectively, the "Permitted

being herein called the "Leased Real Property"). Except as Schedule 4.18(b)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies upcoming lease expiration dates
which may occur prior to the Effective Date, each Real Property Lease is

Company, no termination event or uncured default (or notice thereof) of a

investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder\'s or other fee
or commission in connection with the Merger based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of the Company.   Section 4.25 State Take-over Statutes and
Article Eighth. In reliance upon the representations by Parent and
Acquisition Sub contained in Section 5.5(c) of this Agreement, the Company
represents that the action of the Board of Directors of the Company in
approving the Merger and this Agreement is sufficient to render inapplicable
to the Merger the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL and the provisions of
Article Eighth of the Company Certificate of Incorporation are inapplicable
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. To the Knowledge
of the Company, no other state take-over statute or similar statute or
regulation applies, or purports to apply, to the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Board of Directors of the Company has approved the execution of
the Voting Agreement by Parent in accordance with Section 203(a)(1) of the
DGCL.   Section 4.26 Rights Agreement. The Board of Directors of the
Company has resolved to, and the Company promptly after the execution hereof
will, take all action reasonably necessary to confirm that the Company Rights
Agreement has expired by its terms and has not been extended and that no
agreement similar thereto has been created or put into effect; and,
consequently, the rights found in the terms of the Company Rights   
41   Agreement are inapplicable to the Merger, this Agreement, the Voting
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any further rights or liabilities
thereunder.   ARTICLE VII   ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   Section 7.1 No
Solicitation.   (a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
not to, and will use its reasonable best efforts to see that its officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, consultants, attorneys,
accountants, agents and other representatives (collectively,
"Representatives") do not, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, or
knowingly encourage, or take any action to facilitate the making of any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 7.1(d)) or any inquiry with
respect thereto; (ii) enter into any agreement with respect to any   
51   Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations
with, or afford access to or provide any nonpublic information or data
relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries to any Person relating to any
Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise cooperate with, or assist or participate
in, facilitate or knowingly encourage an effort or attempt by any Person to
do or seek any of the foregoing; provided, however, that in the event an
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is received by the Company not in violation of this Section
7.1(a), the Company may (X) furnish confidential information with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal and the Person\'s Affiliates and representatives pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement and (Y) participate in discussions and
engage in negotiations with the Person and the Person\'s Affiliates and
representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal, in response to an
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal if, but only if, the Board of
Directors of the Company, or the Special Committee, concludes in good faith
and on the basis of (1) advice from financial advisors that such Acquisition
Proposal involves consideration to the holders of the Company\'s Common Stock
which is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal (as defined in
Section 7.1(d) to the Merger set forth in this Agreement and (2) consultation
with independent outside counsel that the failure to discuss, negotiate and
consider such Acquisition Proposal could constitute a violation of the
fiduciary duties of the Company\'s Board of Directors, or its
Special Committee, under applicable Law; and provided, further, that the
Company shall notify Parent promptly in writing of any inquiries, expressions
of interest, proposals or offers received by the Company or any of the
Company\'s representatives relating to any Acquisition Proposal or
possibility or consideration of making an Acquisition Proposal indicating, in
connection with such notice, the terms and conditions of any such Acquisition
Proposal and, if the Acquisition Proposal is formally made, the name of the
Person making the Acquisition Proposal. The Company hereby agrees to furnish
promptly to Parent copies of any confidential information provided to the
Person making any such Acquisition Proposal, or itemize such confidential
information to the extent same has previously been given or made available to
Parent. In addition, the Company hereby agrees that it will take the
necessary steps promptly to inform each Person making an Acquisition Proposal
of the obligations undertaken in this Section 7.1.   (b) Nothing contained
herein shall prohibit the Company (i) from taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) from making any disclosure to its stockholders
if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, or
its Special Committee, after consultation with independent outside counsel,
failure to so disclose could constitute a violation of the fiduciary duties
of the Board of Directors, or its Special Committee, under applicable
Law.    52    (c) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor its
Special Committee thereof shall, except as expressly permitted by Section
7.1(a) and this Section 7.1(c), (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or
Acquisition Sub, the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or
its Special Committee of the Merger or this Agreement, (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal, or (iii) cause the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement
related to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of the
Company\'s Common Stock, the Board of Directors of the Company, or its
Special Committee, determines in good faith, after it has received a Superior
Proposal (as defined below) and after consultation with independent outside
counsel that the failure to do so could constitute a violation of fiduciary
duties of the Company\'s Board of Directors, or its Special Committee, under
applicable Law, the Board of Directors of the Company, or its Special
Committee, may (subject to this and the following sentences) inform Company
stockholders that it no longer believes that the Merger or this Agreement is
advisable and no longer recommends approval (a "Subsequent Determination"),
but only at a time that is after the fifth business day following Parent\'s
receipt of written notice advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the
Company, or its Special Committee, has received a Superior Proposal
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal, identifying the person making such Superior Proposal, and stating
that it intends to make a Subsequent Determination. After providing such
notice, the Company shall provide a reasonable opportunity to Parent to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
enable the Company to proceed with its recommendation to stockholders without
making a Subsequent Determination; provided however, that any such
adjustments shall be at the discretion of the parties at such time.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall
submit this Agreement to its stockholders whether or not the Board of
Directors of the Company, or its Special Committee, makes a Subsequent
Determination, unless Parent has terminated this Agreement pursuant to an
applicable provision of Section 9.1.   (d) The Company agrees that it will
take the necessary steps promptly to inform its Representatives of the
obligations undertaken in this Section 7.1. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated, all discussions and negotiations, if any,
that have taken place prior to the date hereof with any Persons with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal and shall request the return or destruction of
all confidential information provided to any such Person. For   
53   purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any written
offer or proposal for, or any indication of interest in, any (i) direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of a business or asset of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net
income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (ii)
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of any class of
equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business
constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii) tender offer or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially
owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, or any
of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 20% or more the net revenues,
net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
or (iv) merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 20% or more of the net
revenue, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, other than the transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal obtained not in breach of this Section 7.1 made by a Person the
terms of which Acquisition Proposal the Board of Directors of the Company, or
its Special Committee, determines in its good faith judgment
(after consultation with the Company Financial Advisor, or another financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable (other than
in immaterial respects) to the Company\'s stockholders than the Merger taking
into account all relevant factors (including (x) whether, in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, or its Special Committee,
after obtaining advice from the Company Financial Advisor, or another
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, the Person is
reasonably able to finance the transaction, (y) the likelihood that such
Acquisition Proposal will be consummated and (z) any proposed changes to this
Agreement that may be proposed by Parent in response to the Acquisition
Proposal).   Section 7.2 Form S-4; Proxy Materials.   (a) As promptly as

the    54   Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall use all
reasonable efforts to cause the Form S-4 to become effective at such time as

applicable federal or state securities Laws in connection with the issuance
of Parent Shares pursuant to the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall

Form S-4 shall have become effective, the Company shall mail the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to its stockholders. Each of Parent and the Company
shall also promptly file, use all of their respective reasonable efforts to
cause to become effective as promptly as practicable and, if required, mail
to the Company\'s stockholders, any amendment to the Form S-4 or Proxy
Statement/Prospectus which may become necessary after the date
the Registration Statement is declared effective.   (b) No amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 will be made by
Parent or the Company without the approval of the other party, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each of Parent and the Company will
advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when
the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been
filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of
the Parent Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale

Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information.

with respect to this Agreement.   Section 7.5 Access to Information;
Confidentiality.   (a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and Contracts to which the Company is
party thereto, the Company and its Subsidiaries will (i) provide to Parent

omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated hereby), unless such modification is required by
law.   (b) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect for six

Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide
each Company Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-

employment, incentive and severance agreements and arrangements), that are
applicable with respect to any Company Employee or any director of
