of Closing, and (iii) the Aggregate Redemption Amount and the AE Estimate are
duly paid to the Vendors on Closing in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (c)  |   | At the Time of Closing, subject to section
4.2(f), the Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to each of the Persons to
whom the EDS Debt is owed such amounts as required to be paid to each of them
on the Closing Date pursuant to the payout statements delivered on Closing in
order to repay in full and terminate the Credit Facilities or any other EDS
Debt provided to the Partnership and any other EDS Group entity by such
lender.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (d)  |   | Following the Closing Date, the Purchaser covenants and
agrees to take, or cause to be taken by each EDS Group entity on the date
hereof, at no charge or consideration for overhead or otherwise, all
reasonable actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable, in each case as reasonably requested by the
Fund, in order to: (i) provide the Fund with any information, documentation
and administrative assistance it requires in order to prepare and file all
Tax Returns; (ii) assist the Fund and any subsidiaries of the Fund in
connection with (A) providing notices and information (in respect of Tax
matters) to its Unitholders, (B) ceasing to have its Units listed on the TSX
and (C) ceasing to be a reporting issuer of each of the applicable provinces
and territories of Canada; and (iii) assist the Fund in connection with
completing all administrative matters necessary or advisable to properly
effect the redemption of the Units in accordance with the terms of the Fund
Declaration of Trust, as the case may be (each as may be amended in
accordance with this Agreement) and the winding up of the Fund, the Trust and
the Partnership and any subsidiaries of the Fund other than the EDS Group
entities following the end of its taxation year in which such redemption
occurs or such other time as the Purchaser determines is appropriate. For
greater clarity, nothing in this section 6.1(b) shall require the Purchaser
or the subsidiaries of the Fund to assist or otherwise take any actions in
connection with the payment of any redemption proceeds or distribution to the
Unitholders or make any of them or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, affiliates, agents or assigns liable or
responsible therefor.  
   

  

6.3 _D andO Insurance; Indemnification; Resignations_ 

   

       | (a)  |   | From and after the Time of Closing, the Purchaser
shall indemnify the individuals who at or prior to the Time of Closing were
trustees, directors or officers (or equivalent) of the Fund, the Vendors or
the EDS Group, as applicable, with respect to all acts or omissions to act by
them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the Time of Closing
(and in the case of the Trustees, at any time prior to and including the
completion of the winding-up of the Partnership, the Trust and the Fund) to
the fullest extent permitted by their respective certificates of
incorporation, by-laws or other constating documents.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       | (b)  |   | At the option of the Vendors and expense of the
Purchaser, at or prior to Closing, the Purchaser will provide, or cause to be
provided, for a period of six years following the Time of Closing, the
trustees, directors and officers (or equivalent) of the Fund, the Vendors or
the EDS Group entities, as applicable, with an insurance and indemnification
policy (the "DandO Insurance") that provides coverage for events occurring at
or prior to the Time of Closing (and in the case of the Trustees, at any time
prior to and including the completion of the winding-up of the Partnership,
the Trust and the Fund) that is comparable in all material respects and no
more favourable than their existing policy.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (c)  |   | The individuals who at or prior to the Time of Closing
were trustees, directors or officers (or equivalent) of the Vendors and the
Fund, or the EDS Group entities and its subsidiaries, as applicable, to whom
this section 6.3 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this section
6.3. The provisions of this section 6.3 are intended to be for the benefit of
each such individual, his or her heirs and assigns and his or
her representatives.  
      
    | (d)  |   | In the event that the Purchaser, any EDS Group entity
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
mergers into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then,
and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of such corporation or entity shall succeed to the obligations of
this section 6.3.  
      
    | (e)  |   | The Vendors shall assist the Purchaser in obtaining and
delivering to the Purchaser at the Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory
to the Purchaser of the resignation effective as of Closing, of the directors
and officers of each EDS Group entity.  
   

  

6.4 _Assistance with the Wind-Up of the Partnership, the Trust and the Fund_
 

   

 Following the Closing, the Purchaser covenants and agrees to take all reasonable actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable, in each case as reasonably requested by the Partnership, the Trust and the Fund to properly wind-up the Partnership, the Trust and the Fund in accordance with the terms of their respective constating documents, including, providing the Fund and the Vendors with any information, documentation and administrative assistance it requires in order to give effect to the provisions of this section 6.4. 

  

6.5 _No Solicitation_  

   

 Subject to section 6.6, the Fund agrees, until the Time of Closing: 

  

       | (a)  |   | not to, directly or indirectly, through any
officer, trustee, director, employee, representative (including any
financial, legal or other advisor) or agent of the Fund or any of its
subsidiaries, (i) make, solicit, assist, initiate, encourage or otherwise
facilitate (including by way of furnishing information regarding the Fund
or any of its subsidiaries, permitting any visit to any facilities or
properties of the Fund or any of its subsidiaries, or entering into any form
of written or oral agreement, arrangement or understanding) the initiation of
any inquiries, proposals or offers regarding, or that may reasonably be
expected to lead to, an actual or potential  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, engage, continue
or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations in furtherance of
or regarding any inquiries or proposals or that would reasonably be expected
to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or provide any information with respect to
any actual or potential Acquisition Proposal provided that, for greater
certainty, the Fund may advise any Person making an unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal that such Acquisition Proposal does not constitute a Superior
Proposal when the Board has so determined, provided, that in doing so,
no other information is communicated to such Person, (iii) withdraw, modify
or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner
adverse to the Purchaser, the approval or recommendation of the Fund Board or
any committee thereof of the Transaction (including the recommendation of the
Fund Board to the Unitholders to vote for the Unitholder Resolution), (iv)
accept, approve or recommend or remain neutral with respect to, or propose
publicly to approve or recommend or remain neutral for a period exceeding
five (5) Business Days with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal or (v)
accept or enter into, or publicly propose to accept or enter into, any letter
of intent, agreement in principle, agreement, arrangement, understanding or
undertaking related to any Acquisition Proposal or that would require the
Fund to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Transaction or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement;  
---|---|---|--- 
   
       | (b)  |   | to, and shall cause its subsidiaries and the
trustees, officers, directors, employees, representatives, advisors and
agents of the Fund and its subsidiaries to, immediately cease and terminate
any existing solicitations, facilitations, encouragements, activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than the Purchaser and
its affiliates) with respect to any potential Acquisition Proposal whether or
not initiated by the Fund or any of its subsidiaries;  
      
    | (c)  |   | to enforce, or shall cause to be enforced, all
confidentiality and standstill agreements entered into by the Fund or any of
its subsidiaries, agents or trustees with other parties relating to a
potential Acquisition Proposal unless such actions would otherwise be
permitted by section 6.6;  
      
    | (d)  |   | to immediately cease to provide any other Person with
access to any information concerning the Fund and its subsidiaries in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal and, to the extent it is permitted to
do so, promptly request the return or destruction of all information provided
to any Person that has entered into a confidentiality agreement relating to a
potential Acquisition Proposal to the extent that such information has not
been returned or destroyed, and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts
to ensure that such requests are honoured in accordance with the terms of
such agreements;  
      
    | (e)  |   | to cause the Data Room or any other electronic or
physical data room to no longer be accessible to or by any Person other than
the Purchaser and its affiliates; and  
      
    | (f)  |   | to ensure that its officers, trustees, directors,
representatives (including for greater certainty any financial, legal or
other advisors) and agents, and each of its subsidiaries and their respective
officers, trustees, directors, representatives (including for greater
certainty any financial, legal or other advisors) and agents,  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | are aware of the provisions of this section 6.5 and
the Fund shall be responsible for any breach of this section 6.5 by any such
Person.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

 For greater certainty, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude (i) an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal from a Person, or the affiliates of a Person, party to a standstill agreement with the Fund to be considered a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal for the purposes hereof (whether or not such standstill agreement operates to permit such proposal with or without the approval or authorization of the Fund or of the Fund Board (or a committee thereof)) or (ii) the Fund or the Fund Board from approving or authorizing a Person, or the affiliates of a Person, party to a standstill agreement with the Fund to make an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal (in circumstances not involving any breach of Section 6.6); provided, that any such Person shall keep such Acquisition Proposal confidential and shall not make, require, permit or otherwise cause any announcement or other disclosure of such Acquisition Proposal until a Proposed Agreement is entered into, other than in respect of any public announcement or disclosure required by applicable Laws prior to that time and then only to the extent so required. The Fund shall notify the Purchaser in writing of any waiver or termination of a standstill agreement with the Fund following June 14, 2007. 

  

6.6 _Acquisition Proposals, Changes in Recommendation, Etc._  

   

       | (a)  |   | The Fund will immediately notify the Purchaser
orally (and then in writing within 24 hours) after it (or any of its
subsidiaries) has received any proposal, inquiry, offer or request (or any
amendment thereto) relating to or constituting an Acquisition Proposal, any
request for discussions or negotiations, or any request for information
relating to the Fund or any of its subsidiaries in connection with
an Acquisition Proposal or a potential Acquisition Proposal or for access to
the properties or books and records thereof of which the Fund or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective trustees, directors, officers,
employees, representatives (including for greater certainty any financial,
legal or other advisors) or agents is or became aware, or any amendments to
the foregoing. Such notice shall include description of the terms and
conditions of, and the identity of the Person making, any Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, offer or request (including any amendment thereto).
The Fund shall also immediately provide the Purchaser with (i) a copy of any
written notice or other written communication from any Person informing the
Fund or any of its subsidiaries that it is considering making, or has made,
an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) a copy of any Acquisition Proposal (or any
amendment thereof) received by the Fund or any of its subsidiaries, and (iii)
such other details of any such Acquisition Proposal that the Purchaser may
reasonably request. The Vendors shall keep the Purchaser fully informed of
the status and general progress (including amendments or proposed amendments)
of any such request or Acquisition Proposal and keep the Purchaser
fully informed as to the details of any information requested of or provided
by the Vendors and as to the details of all discussions or negotiations.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the
Fund Board from engaging in any discussions or negotiations with, or
furnishing or providing access to information to, any Person in response to
an unsolicited written _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the
extent that:  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       | (i)  |   | the Fund has received an unsolicited _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal from such Person prior to the Fund Meeting
(in circumstances not involving any breach of section 6.5);  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | the Fund Board, after consultation with and after
receiving the advice of its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, has
determined in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal: (i) is reasonably
likely to satisfy, when required to do so, the condition with respect to the
required financing set out in paragraph (e) of the definition of Superior
Proposal; and (ii) if agreed to in accordance with its terms, would be a
Superior Proposal;  
      
    | (iii)  |   | the Fund Board, after consultation with and after
receiving the advice of outside legal counsel, has determined in good faith
that taking such action is necessary for the Fund Board not to breach its
fiduciary duties under applicable Laws;  
      
    | (iv)  |   | the Fund has provided to the Purchaser the information
required to be provided under section 6.6(a) in respect of such Acquisition
Proposal and has promptly notified the Purchaser in writing of the
determinations in section 6.6(b)(ii) and section 6.6(b)(iii); and  
      
    | (v)  |   | such Person executes and delivers to the Fund of
a confidentiality and standstill agreement containing confidentiality
and standstill provisions that are no less restrictive than the
confidentiality provisions and standstill provisions set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement; provided that (a) the Fund sends a copy of any
such confidentiality and standstill agreement to the Purchaser promptly upon
its execution, (b) the Purchaser is provided with a complete list or copies
of any and all information provided to such Person on a timely basis (unless
previously provided to the Purchaser), and (c) the Purchaser is provided on a
timely basis with similar access to information and personnel to that which
such Person was provided.  
   

  

       | (c)  |   | Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent
the Fund Board from (i) withdrawing, amending, modifying or qualifying (or
proposing publicly to withdraw, amend, modify or qualify), in any manner
adverse to the Purchaser, the approval or the recommendation of the Fund
Board (including any committee thereof) of this Agreement or the Transaction
in favour of a Superior Proposal; or (ii) accepting, approving, endorsing or
recommending or proposing publicly to approve, accept, endorse or recommend a
Superior Proposal, in each case, if and only to the extent that:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | the Fund has received an unsolicited _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal from such Person (in circumstances not involving
any breach of section 6.5);  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | the Fund Meeting shall not have occurred;  
      
    | (iii)  |   | the Fund Board, after consultation with and after
receiving the advice of its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, has
determined in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal;  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | (iv)  |   | the Fund Board, after consultation with and
after receiving the advice of outside legal counsel, has determined in good
faith that taking such action is necessary for the Fund Board not to breach
its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (v)  |   | the Fund has provided to the Purchaser the information
required to be provided under section 6.6(a) in respect of such Acquisition
Proposal and has promptly notified the Purchaser in writing of the
determinations in section 6.6(c)(iii) and section 6.6(c)(iv);  
      
    | (vi)  |   | the Fund and the Vendors have provided notice to the
Purchaser under section 6.6(d), the Response Period has elapsed and, if the
Purchaser has proposed to revise the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Transaction in accordance with section 6.6(d) within such Response
Period, the Fund Board has again made the determinations in section
6.6(c)(iii) and section 6.6(c)(iv) taking into account such proposed
revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Transaction;
and  
      
    | (vii)  |   | the Termination Fee shall have been paid.  
   

  

       | (d)  |   | The Fund covenants that it will not enter, and
will cause the Vendors not to enter, into any agreement, understanding or
arrangement providing for a Superior Proposal (a "Proposed Agreement") and
the Fund Board will not withdraw, amend, modify or qualify its
recommendations of the Transaction in a manner adverse to the
Purchaser unless (i) it has provided the Purchaser with a copy of the
Superior Proposal document and written evidence of the determination of the
Fund Board that the proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal promptly upon
the Fund Board making such determination, and (ii) providing the Purchaser
with an opportunity, for a period of five Business Days from the date of
delivery to the Purchaser the notice of its intention to enter into the
Proposed Agreement (the "Response Period"), to amend the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Transaction, including by varying the
structure of the Transaction to contemplate an offer to acquire the Units,
such that the Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal as
determined by the Fund Board, acting in good faith and in accordance with its
fiduciary duties (the "Right to Match"). If the Purchaser exercises its Right
to Match, then the Fund Board shall review in good faith, in consultation
with its financial and outside legal advisors, any such proposal by the
Purchaser to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Transaction, including an increase in, or modification of, the consideration
to be received by the Unitholders, to determine whether the Superior Proposal
to which the Purchaser is responding would be a Superior Proposal when
assessed against the Transaction as it is proposed by the Purchaser to be
amended. If the Fund Board determines that the amended terms and conditions
of the Transaction proposed by the Purchaser would result in the Superior
Proposal no longer constituting a Superior Proposal, the Fund, the Vendors
and the Purchaser shall enter into an amended agreement reflecting the
Purchasers proposed amendments to the terms and conditions of
the Transaction and the Fund Board will promptly reaffirm its recommendation
of the Transaction, as so amended. In the event the Purchaser does not
exercise the Right to Match or the Fund Board acting in good faith and in
accordance with its fiduciary duties determines that the  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | amendments to the terms and conditions of the
Transaction proposed by the Purchaser under the Right to Match do not result
in the Superior Proposal no longer constituting a Superior Proposal, the Fund
and the Vendors may (i) enter into the Proposed Agreement, (ii) withdraw,
amend, modify, or qualify its recommendation and (iii) terminate this
Agreement pursuant to section 8.2(e)(iii).  
---|---|---|--- 
   
       |   |   | The Fund covenants to provide the Purchaser with a
copy of any Proposed Agreement not less than five (5) Business Days prior to
its proposed execution by the Fund or any of its subsidiaries.  
      
    |   |   | Each successive amendment to any Superior Proposal that
results in an increase in, or modification of, the consideration (or value of
such consideration) to be received by the Unitholders shall constitute a new
Superior Proposal for the purposes of this section 6.6 and the Purchaser
shall be afforded a new Response Period in respect of each such Superior
Proposal which shall, however, be three calendar days.  
   

  

       | (e)  |   | Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent
the Fund Board from complying with Section 99 of the Securities Act with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal; provided that the Fund and the Vendors
have complied with the remaining provisions of this section 6.6.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

6.7 _Fund Meeting_  

   

       | (a)  |   | The Fund hereby represents that (i) it has
obtained the Fairness Opinion, and (ii) the Fund Board (A) has approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; (B) has, following
consultation with its financial and outside advisors, determined that the
consideration per Unit to be received by the Unitholders upon redemption of
their Units is fair to the Unitholders; (C) has, following consultation with
its financial and outside advisors, determined that the Transaction is in the
best interest of Unitholders; and (D) has resolved to recommend that
Unitholders vote for the Unitholder Resolution at the Fund Meeting.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Fund shall establish and
announce a record date (which shall be on or before July 6, 2007) for notice
and voting at the Fund Meeting. As promptly as practicable after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, and in any event by no later than
August 30, 2007 (except to the extent that any delay beyond such date is
due primarily to the Purchasers failure to comply on a timely basis with its
obligations under section 6.8(f)), the Fund shall convene and hold the Fund
Meeting for the purpose of approving the Unitholder Resolution and for any
other proper purpose as may be set out in the Circular with the prior consent
of the Purchaser, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, and shall
do all such acts and things necessary to comply with the applicable Laws,
including National Instrument 54-101 of the Securities Regulatory Authorities
in relation thereto.  
      
    | (c)  |   | The Fund covenants that it shall not adjourn, postpone,
cancel or fail to call or hold the Fund Meeting (or propose or announce any
intention to do so), except (i) if a quorum is not present at the Fund
Meeting, (ii) if required by applicable Laws, (iii) if otherwise agreed with
the Purchaser, or (iv) if this Agreement is terminated  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | in accordance with its terms prior to the time for
holding the Fund Meeting as such time may be extended, adjourned or postponed
in accordance with this Agreement.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (d)  |   | The Fund shall take all lawful action to solicit
proxies in favour of the Unitholder Resolution, including, at the Purchasers
expense, through the appointment and use of a proxy solicitation agent in
consultation with the Purchaser, and shall take all such other action that is
necessary or desirable to secure the approval of the Unitholder Resolution by
the Unitholders, provided that the Fund Board may withdraw, modify, change or
qualify its recommendation to Unitholders and refrain from complying with
such obligations in compliance with section 6.6(c). The Fund agrees that
the Purchaser or its affiliates may at any time in accordance with applicable
Laws and in consultation with the Fund actively solicit proxies in favour of
the Unitholder Resolution and shall disclose in the Circular that such
solicitations may be made.  
   

  

6.8 _Circular_  

   

       | (a)  |   | The Fund shall, as promptly as practicable after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and in consultation with the
Purchaser and the Purchasers Counsel, and in any event within 25 days of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Fund shall complete the
Circular together with any other documents required by the Fund Declaration
of Trust, applicable Securities Laws or other applicable Laws in
connection with the Fund Meeting, in each case in form and substance
satisfactory to the Purchaser and its advisors, acting reasonably; provided,
however, that if the failure to complete the Circular within such period is
as a result of the failure of the Purchaser to provide any information
required by the Fund to complete the Circular, the period within which the
Circular must be completed shall be extended for an additional five (5)
Business Days from the date that all such information has been received by
the Fund.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Subject to section 6.6, the Circular shall include a
copy of the Fairness Opinion and shall include the Fund Boards unanimous
recommendation that the Unitholders vote in favour of the Unitholder
Resolution, provided, however, that references herein to the unanimous
recommendation of the Fund Board shall not include Trustees who have declared
a conflict of interest and have not participated in such recommendation.  
      
    | (c)  |   | The Purchaser and the Purchasers Counsel shall be
entitled to review the Circular and such other documents and amendments
thereto and the Fund shall consider (acting reasonably) all comments provided
by the Purchaser or the Purchasers Counsel, provided that any statements in
the Circular and such other documents and amendments thereto relating to the
Purchaser and its affiliates and the Unitholder Resolution shall be in form
and substance satisfactory to the Purchaser, acting reasonably.  
      
    | (d)  |   | The Fund will file the Circular and any other
documentation required to be filed under applicable Laws in all jurisdictions
where the Circular is required to be filed by the Fund and mail or cause to
be mailed the Circular and any other documentation required to be mailed
under applicable Laws to the Unitholders as of the record date established
for the Fund Meeting, the Trustee and the auditors  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | of the Fund. The Purchaser will provide such
assistance as the Fund may reasonably request in such regard.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (e)  |   | If at any time prior to the Time of Closing any event
shall occur, or fact or information shall be discovered, that should be set
forth in an amendment of or a supplement to the Circular, the Fund shall, to
the extent required by applicable Law, prepare such amendment or supplement
as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable and cause such amendment or
supplement to be distributed to each Unitholder, the Trustees and the
auditors of the Fund and filed as required under the Fund Declaration of
Trust and applicable Securities Laws.  
      
    | (f)  |   | The Purchaser and the Fund shall proceed diligently, in
a coordinated fashion and use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in
the preparation of the Circular and any amendment or supplement thereto, and
of any exemptive relief applications or orders and any other documents deemed
reasonably necessary by any of them to discharge their respective obligations
under applicable Laws. The Purchaser and the Fund shall furnish to each
other, on a timely basis, all information as may be reasonably required to
effectuate the actions in section 6.7 and section 6.8, and each covenants that
no information so furnished by it in writing in connection with those actions
will contain any Misrepresentation.  
      
    | (g)  |   | The Fund and the Purchaser shall each promptly notify
the other if, at any time before the Closing, it becomes aware that the
Circular or any application for an order hereunder contains any
Misrepresentation, or that otherwise requires an amendment or supplement to
the Circular or such application. In any such event, the Fund and each of the
Purchasers shall cooperate in the preparation of a supplement or amendment to
the Circular or such application, as required and as the case may be, that
corrects that Misrepresentation and, if required, shall cause the same to be
distributed to the Unitholders as of the record date established for the Fund
Meeting, the Trustee and the auditors of the Fund and filed as required under
applicable Law in all jurisdictions where the Circular is required to be
filed by the Fund.  
      
    | (h)  |   | The Fund shall ensure that the Circular complies with
all applicable Laws and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
that the Circular does not contain a Misrepresentation (except that this
covenant shall not apply with respect to any information relating to or
provided in writing by the Purchaser to the Fund for inclusion in the
Circular). The Purchaser shall ensure that no information regarding itself,
its subsidiaries or each of their respective directors, officers
and shareholders delivered to the Fund for inclusion in the Circular contains
a Misrepresentation. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Fund shall ensure that the Circular provides the Unitholders with information
in sufficient detail to permit them to form a reasoned judgment concerning
the matters to be placed before them at the Fund Meeting.  
      
    | (i)  |   | The Fund represents that the Trustees have been advised
and believe that each of the Trustees and senior officers of EDS Group
intends to vote, or cause to be voted, all Units of which he or she is the
beneficial owner in favour of the Unitholder Resolution.  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_  

   

 Each party shall give prompt notice to the other parties of: (a) the occurrence or failure to occur of any event, which occurrence or failure would cause or may cause any representation or warranty on its part contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date hereof to the Closing Date; and (b) any failure of such party, or any officer, trustee, director, employee, representative or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder.

6.13 _Escrow Agreement_

    | (b)  |   | by either the Fund, the Vendors or the Purchaser if the
sale of the Purchased Securities shall not have been completed by Outside

       | (i)  |   | if the Fund or the Vendors shall have breached
any of their covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement (for
covenants or other agreements qualified as to materiality, in any respect,
and for all other  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | covenants or agreements, in any material respect),
provided, however, that if such breach is curable by the Fund and the Vendors
by the day prior to the Outside Date through the exercise of reasonable best
efforts and for so long as the Fund and the Vendors continue to exercise such
reasonable best efforts, the Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement under
this section 8.2(d)(i) until the day prior to the Outside Date;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | if the Fund or the Vendors shall have breached any of
their representations and warranties contained in this Agreement as of the

representations qualified by reference to a Material Adverse Effect, in any
respect, and for all other representations and warranties, in any respect
except where the failure of such representations and warranties in the
aggregate to be true and correct in all respects would not have a Material
Adverse Effect and, provided that representations and warranties which speak
as to an earlier date will not be deemed to have been breached provided that
they were true and correct as of such earlier date), provided, however, that
if such breach is curable by the Fund and the Vendors by the day prior to the
Outside Date through the exercise of reasonable best efforts and for so long
as the Fund and the Vendors continue to exercise such reasonable best
efforts, the Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement under this section

9.1(a), 9.1(b), 9.1(c), or 9.1(d) shall have occurred; or  
      
    | (v)  |   | if the Fund Meeting shall have been held and
Unitholder Approval shall not have been obtained or  
   

  

       | (e)  |   | by the Vendors or the Fund:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | if the Purchaser shall have breached or failed to
perform any of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement (for representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements qualified as to materiality, in any respect, and for all other
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements, in any material
respect), or if any representation or warranty of the Purchaser shall have
become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in section
4.2 would not be satisfied; provided however, that if such breach is curable
by the Purchaser by the day prior to the Outside Date through the exercise of
reasonable best efforts and for so long as the Purchaser continue to exercise
such reasonable best efforts, the Vendors or the Fund may not terminate this
Agreement under this section 8.2(d)(i) until the day prior to the Outside
Date;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | if any of the conditions in section 4.2 are not
satisfied or waived by the Outside Date;

       | (iii)  |   | in connection with the Fund Board entering into
a Proposed Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal and/or withdrawing,
modifying or qualifying its recommendation in accordance with section 6.6(d),
provided that no termination under this section 8.2(e)(iii) shall be
effective until the Vendors shall have paid the Termination Fee to the
Purchaser in accordance with section 9.2; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (iv)  |   | if the Fund Meeting shall have been held and
Unitholder Approval shall not have been obtained.  
   

  

8.3 _Effect of Termination_  

   

 In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in section 8.2, written notice thereof shall be given to the other parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and no party shall have any further obligations to perform obligations under this Agreement (other than the provisions of sections 9.2, 11.1 and 11.6, each of which shall survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of the Purchaser, the Vendors or their respective directors, trustees, officers, shareholders, unitholders, annuitants and affiliates, as the case may be; provided, however, that this limitation shall not apply in the event of fraud or a material breach that is wilful or intentional by the applicable party of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement. In the event of any such termination of this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement shall hereby be amended to permit Acquisition Proposals by the Fund or the Purchaser. 

  

ARTICLE 9 

  

TERMINATION FEE EVENT

    

9.1 _Termination Fee Event_  

   

 The Purchaser shall be entitled to the Termination Fee upon the occurrence of any of the following events (each a "Termination Fee Event") which shall be paid by the Fund in accordance with section 9.2: 

  

       | (a)  |   | the Fund Board or any committee thereof fails to
recommend, or withdraws, amends, modifies or qualifies its approval or
recommendation of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
its recommendation that the Unitholders vote for the Unitholder Resolution)
in any manner adverse to the Purchaser or makes a public announcement to that
effect;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | the Fund Board (or any committee thereof) recommends or
approves, an Acquisition Proposal or makes a public announcement to that
effect;  
      
    | (c)  |   | the Fund Board (or any committee thereof) proposes to
accept, approve or recommend, or enter into any letter of intent, agreement
in principle, agreement, understanding, arrangement or undertaking, or
publicly proposes to do any of the foregoing, relating to a Superior Proposal
in compliance with the provisions of section 6.6(c);  
      
    | (d)  |   | on or after the date hereof and prior to the Fund
Meeting, an Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced by any Person and the
Fund Board fails to reaffirm its  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | recommendation in favour of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by press release (i) within five Business Days
after the public announcement or commencement of any Acquisition Proposal, or
(ii) by the time of the holding of the Fund Meeting where an Acquisition
Proposal is publicly announced less than five Business Days prior to the time
for holding the Fund Meeting, provided in the case of (ii) the Fund shall be
permitted to adjourn the Fund Meeting for a period not exceeding
five Business Days;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (e)  |   | this Agreement is terminated by the Purchaser pursuant
to section 8.2(d)(i) as a result of the Fund being in default of any of its
obligations or covenants contained in section 6.5; or  
      
    | (f)  |   | the Unitholder Resolution is not approved by
Unitholders at the Fund Meeting where an Acquisition Proposal is made or
announced (whether privately or otherwise) prior to the Fund Meeting and an
Acquisition Proposal is completed on or prior to the date that is 12 months
from the date of termination of this Agreement by the Purchaser pursuant to
section 8.2(d)(v) or the Fund or the Vendors pursuant to
section 8.2(e)(iv).  
   

  

9.2 _Payment of Termination Fee_  

   

       | (a)  |   | Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement relating to payment of fees and expenses, if the Agreement is
terminated by the Purchaser pursuant to section 8.2(d)(iv) or by the Fund or
the Vendors pursuant to section 8.2(e)(iii), then the Vendors or its designee
shall pay to the Purchaser (or as it may direct) an amount equal to
$8,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer of same day
immediately available funds to an account specified by the Purchaser.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | If the Agreement is terminated by the Purchaser
pursuant to section 8.2(d)(iv) the Vendors shall pay the Termination Fee to
the Purchaser no later than the third Business Day following the termination
of this Agreement. If this Agreement is proposed to be terminated by the Fund
or the Vendors pursuant to section 8.2(e)(iii), the Vendors shall pay the
Termination Fee to the Purchaser prior to or contemporaneously with the
termination of this Agreement.  
      
    | (c)  |   | If this Agreement is terminated by the Purchaser
pursuant to section 8.2(d)(v) or by the Fund pursuant to section 8.2(e)(iv)
and subsequent to such termination, a Termination Fee Event described in
section 9.1(e) occurs, the Fund shall, notwithstanding the earlier
termination of this Agreement, pay the Termination Fee to the Purchaser on
the date that the Acquisition Proposal is completed.  
      
    | (d)  |   | Any obligation to make a payment as a result of section
9.2 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.  
      
    | (e)  |   | In no event shall the Vendors be obligated to pay under
this section, in the aggregate, an amount in excess of the Termination Fee.  
   

  

9.3 _Liquidated Damages_  

   

 In the event the Termination Fee is paid to the Purchaser, no other amounts will be due and payable as damages or otherwise by the Vendors and the Purchaser hereby accepts that the Termination Fee is in lieu of any damages or any other payment or remedy which it may be 

   ##### 

  

 

entitled to. The Purchaser agree that the Termination Fee constitutes payment
of liquidated damages which are a genuine anticipated assessment or estimate
of the damages which it will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving
rise to such damages and resulting in the termination of this Agreement and
does not and will not constitute payment of a penalty. 

   

9.4 _Remedies_  

   

 Subject to 9.3, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that an award of money damages would be inadequate for any breach of this Agreement by any party or its representatives and any such breach would cause the non-breaching party irreparable harm. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by one of the parties, the non-breaching party will also be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to such equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance. Such remedies will not be the exclusive remedies for any breach of this Agreement but will be in addition to all other remedies available at Law or equity to each of the parties.

11.6 _Limitation of Liability in Respect of the Trust and the Fund_  

   

       | (a)  |   | The trustees of the Trust and the Trustees, in
incurring any debts, liabilities or obligations, or in taking or omitting any
other actions for or in connection with the affairs of the Trust and the Fund
are, and will be conclusively deemed to be, acting for and on behalf of the
Trust and the Fund, and not in their own personal capacities. None of the
trustees of the Trust and none of the Trustees will be subject to any
personal liability for any debts, liabilities, obligations, claims,
demands, judgments, costs, charges or expenses (including legal expenses)
against or with respect to the Trust and the Fund or in respect of the
affairs of the Trust and the Fund. No property or assets of the trustees of
the Trust and the Trustees, owned in their personal capacity or otherwise,
will be subject to any levy, execution or other enforcement procedure with
regard to any obligations under this Agreement. No recourse may be had or
taken, directly or indirectly, against any of the trustees of the Trust or
any of the Trustees in their personal capacity including if the Trust and the
Fund is wound up or dissolved and its residual property is distributed to the
holders of its Units. The Trust and the Fund will be solely liable therefor
and resort will be had solely to the property and assets of the Trust for
payment or performance thereof.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | No Unitholder or any annuitant under a registered
retirement savings plan, registered retirement income Trust or deferred
profit sharing plan of which a Unitholder acts as a trustee (an "annuitant"),
as such, will be subject to any personal liability whatsoever, in tort,
contract or otherwise, to any party to this Agreement in connection with the
obligations or the affairs of the Trust and the Fund or the acts or omissions
of the trustees of the Trust and the Trustees, whether under this
Agreement or otherwise, and the parties to this Agreement will look solely to
the property and assets of the Trust and the Fund for satisfaction of claims
of any nature arising out of or in connection therewith and the property and
assets of the Trust and the Fund only will be subject to levy or execution.  
      
    | (c)  |   | The Purchaser hereby releases and forever discharges
each of the trustees of the Trust from time to time, the Trustees from time
to time and their respective agents, advisors and employees (collectively the
"Released Parties") from any action, cause of action, claims, damages and
costs of any nature whatsoever, and agrees to execute and deliver further
assurances of the foregoing release as any such trustee of the Trust or
Trustee may from time to time reasonably request in writing. The
foregoing acknowledgement, release and discharge shall survive Closing and
shall be enforceable by each of the Trust, the trustees of the Trust, the
Trustees and the Fund against the Purchaser, its affiliates and any Person
claiming by or through the Purchaser.  
      
    | (d)  |   | For greater clarity, as a result of this section 11.6,
the Purchaser acknowledges that after Closing, it will not have any recourse
to any Released Party for any breach or default under this Agreement.  
      
    | (e)  |   | The trustees of the Trust, the Unitholders, the
Trustees and annuitants shall be third party beneficiaries of this section
11.6. The provisions of this section 11.6 are intended to be for the benefit
of each such Person, their respective heirs, successors, and assigns and
their representatives.  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | (f)  |   | For greater certainty, the parties hereto agree
that upon the wind-up of the Trust and/or the Fund, the trustees of the Trust
and the Trustees shall have the right to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement related to obligations of the Purchaser to the trustees of the
Trust and the Trustees to be performed following Closing, including those set
for in sections 6.1(b) and 11.3.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

11.7 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_  

   

 The representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement but shall terminate on the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and the Closing Date (other than those that explicitly state they shall, or that otherwise by their terms, continue following the Closing, including sections 6.5, 6.6, and 11.3). No investigations made by or on behalf of any of the parties or any of their respective authorized agents at any time shall have the effect of waiving, diminishing the scope of or otherwise affecting any representation, warranty or covenant made by either of the Vendors or the Purchaser herein or pursuant hereto. No waiver by any party shall be effective unless it is in writing. 

  

11.8 _Withholding Tax_  

   

 The parties agree to use good faith efforts prior to the Closing Date to determine whether any Taxes are required to be withheld from the payment of the Purchase Price net of the Expenses pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with applicable Laws. If the parties determine that any Taxes are required to be so withheld, the parties agree to use best efforts to implement reasonable procedures or arrangements for the collection and remittance of any such Taxes to the applicable Taxing Authority which procedures may include the use of a qualified intermediary within the meaning of Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 1441 of the Code, in order to withhold in accordance with applicable Law. 

  

11.9 _Time of Essence_  

   

 Time is of the essence of this Agreement. 

  

11.10 _Further Assurances_  

   

 Each of the parties shall promptly do, make, execute, deliver, or cause to be done, made, executed or delivered, all such further acts, documents and things as the other party hereto may reasonably require from time to time for the purpose of giving effect to this Agreement and shall use reasonable efforts and take all such steps as may be reasonably within its power to implement to their full extent the provisions of this Agreement. 

  

11.11 _Counterparts_  

   

 This Agreement may be signed in counterparts and delivery of the counterparts may be effected by means of a telecopier transmission or pdf email transmission and each such counterpart shall constitute an original document and such counterparts, taken together, shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

  

11.12 _No Waiver of Set-Off_  

   

 Nothing in this Agreement constitutes a waiver by any party hereto of any right of set-off that it may have by Contract, at Law or in equity.
