Section 2.07 Determination of Net Asset Value Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Affinity shall
deliver to Buyer a written statement (as revised in accordance with this
Section 2.07, the "Estimated Closing Statement") setting forth Affinity's good
faith estimate of the Net Asset Value of Affinity (the "Estimated Net Asset
Value") along with reasonable supporting detail to evidence the calculation
thereof. The Estimated Closing Statement shall be accompanied by a written
certification by Affinity's chief actuary attesting that the Estimated Net
Asset Value (including the Medical Claims Reserve and the Premiums Receivable
Accrual included therein) were determined in accordance with the Applicable
Accounting Principles. The Estimated Net Asset Value shall be prepared in
accordance with the Applicable Accounting Principles; provided, however, that
the Estimated Net Asset Value (1) shall not include any changes in assets or Liabilities of Affinity as a result of purchase accounting adjustments
arising from or resulting as a consequence of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (2) shall be based solely on facts and circumstances as
they are reasonably expected to exist as of the Measurement Time and shall
exclude the effect of any event, change, circumstance, development,
occurrence, condition, effect or state of facts occurring after the
Measurement Time, except as specifically set forth in the Applicable
Accounting Principles or otherwise in accordance with this Agreement.

(b) In connection with Buyer's review of the Estimated Closing Statement,
Affinity shall, prior to the Closing, cooperate with Buyer in good faith to
resolve any disagreements between the Parties over the amount of any items set
forth in the Estimated Closing Statement, and the items set forth in the
Estimated Closing Statement shall for all purposes in this Agreement be equal
to the amounts initially proposed by Affinity together with any revisions
thereto that are mutually agreed by Affinity and Buyer, each acting
reasonably, prior to the Closing. To facilitate Buyer's review of the
Estimated Closing Statement, and upon Buyer's reasonable written request,
Affinity will use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) provide Buyer with
supporting data reasonably necessary to allow Buyer to verify the amounts set
forth in the Estimated Closing Statement, and (ii) subject to applicable Law
and other obligations to which Affinity may be bound, provide to Buyer
reasonable access (that shall be during normal business hours and shall not
interfere with Affinity's normal business operations) to all relevant books
and records of Affinity and make appropriate personnel reasonably available to
discuss Buyer's reasonable inquiries regarding the Estimated Closing
Statement.

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable but in no event later than the ten (10)
month anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to
Affinity a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth Buyer's
calculation of the Net Asset Value of Affinity (the "Updated Net Asset
Value"), along with reasonable supporting detail as part of the Closing
Statement to evidence the calculation thereof. The Updated Net Asset Value
shall be prepared in accordance with the Applicable Accounting Principles;
provided, however, that the Updated Net Asset Value (1) shall not include any
changes in assets or Liabilities of Affinity as a result of purchase
accounting adjustments arising from or resulting as a consequence of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (2) shall be based solely on
facts and circumstances as they existed as of the Measurement Time and shall
exclude the effect of any event, change, circumstance, development,
occurrence, condition, effect or state of facts occurring after the
Measurement Time, except as specifically set forth in the Applicable
Accounting Principles.

(d) Affinity shall have thirty (30) days following Buyer's delivery of the
Closing Statement (the "Review Period") to review the same. If Affinity
objects to any portion of the Closing Statement on or before the expiration of
the Review Period, Affinity shall deliver to Buyer a written statement setting
forth in reasonable detail and accompanied by reasonable supporting
information, its objection to the Closing Statement (the "Closing Statement
Objection Notice"), which shall include Affinity's proposed revised amounts
and calculations. During the Review Period, Buyer shall upon reasonable
advance notice and during normal business hours permit Affinity and its
Representatives to have reasonable access, subject to their execution of
standard hold harmless letters, to the books, records and other documents work papers, schedules, financial statements, memoranda, etc.) and shall
reasonably cooperate with Affinity in obtaining work papers from Buyer's
accountants pertaining to or used in connection with the preparation of the
Closing Statement and calculation of the Updated Net Asset Value, and provide
Affinity with copies thereof (as reasonably requested by Affinity). If
Affinity does not deliver a Closing Statement Objection Notice to Buyer on or
before the expiration of the Review Period, Affinity shall be deemed to have
accepted the Closing Statement and the calculations therein in full. Any
determination set forth on the Closing Statement which is not specifically
objected to in the Closing Statement Objection Notice shall be deemed accepted
by Affinity and shall be final and binding upon Affinity upon delivery of the
Closing Statement Objection Notice.

(e) In the event that Affinity delivers a Closing Statement Objection Notice
objecting to all or any portion of the Closing Statement within the Review
Period, Buyer and Affinity shall promptly meet and in good faith attempt to
resolve such objections. Any such objections set forth in the Closing
Statement Objection Notice which cannot be resolved between Buyer and Affinity
within thirty (30) days following Buyer's receipt of the Closing Statement
Objection Notice (the "Closing Statement Disputed Items") shall be resolved in
accordance with this Section 2.07(e). Should Affinity and Buyer not be able to
resolve such Closing Statement Disputed Items within the thirty (30) day
period described above, either party may submit the matter to the Independent
Accountants for review and resolution, with instructions to complete the same
as promptly as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days of its
engagement, and to resolve any objections consistent with the terms of this
Agreement, including making the calculations in accordance with the definition
of "Net Asset Value" as set forth in this Agreement. The Independent
Accountants shall only have authority to make determinations in respect of
Closing Statement Disputed Items, and all determinations shall be based solely
on the written presentations of Buyer and Affinity and their respective
representatives, and not by independent review. Buyer and Affinity each shall
provide the Independent Accountants with their respective determinations of
the Closing Statement Disputed Items. In resolving any Closing Statement
Disputed Item, the Independent Accountants: (i) shall be bound by the
principles set forth in this Section 2.07 and the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, (ii) shall not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either Party, and (iii) shall act as an expert and
not an arbitrator. The Parties shall instruct the Independent Accountants to
deliver to each of Buyer and Affinity a written statement setting forth its
resolution of the dispute within thirty (30) days of the submission of the
dispute to such firm, which resolution, absent manifest error, shall be
binding and conclusive on the Parties and not subject to appeal or further
review. The Closing Statement shall be modified if necessary to reflect such
determination by the Independent Accountants, as well as the resolution by or
on behalf of the Parties of any Closing Statement Disputed Item. All Closing
Statement Disputed Items that are resolved between Affinity and Buyer and all
Closing Statement Disputed Items that are determined by the Independent
Accountants will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties hereto and
may be entered in any Court of competent jurisdiction, and each of the Parties
hereto agrees that it shall not have any right to, and shall not, institute
any Action of any kind challenging such determination or with respect to the
matters that are the subject of this Section 2.07. The other Party's only
defense to such a request for enforcement shall be fraud by or upon the
Independent Accountant or manifest error. Absent such fraud or manifest error, such other
party shall reimburse the Party seeking enforcement for all of its expenses
related to the enforcement of the Independent Accountant's determination. The
fees and costs of the Independent Accountants, if one is required, shall be
borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and Affinity, on the other hand, in inverse
proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by the Independent
Accountants, which proportionate allocation will also be determined by the
Independent Accountants. For example, if Affinity claims that the appropriate
adjustments are One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) greater than the amount
determined by Buyer and if the Independent Accountants ultimately resolve such
items by awarding to Affinity Three Hundred Dollars ($300) of the One Thousand
Dollars ($1,000) contested, then the fees, costs and expenses of the
Independent Accountants will be allocated 30% (i.e., 300 ÷ 1,000) to Buyer and
70% (i.e., 700 ÷ 1,000) to Affinity. Affinity and Buyer shall enter into an
engagement letter with the Independent Accountants, including customary
indemnity, confidentiality and other provisions.

(f) Determinations; Adjustments. If the Final Net Asset Value as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.07 is greater than the Estimated Net
Asset Value, Buyer shall pay to Affinity the full amount by which the Final
Net Asset Value exceeds the Estimated Net Asset Value in accordance with
Section 2.07(g). If the Final Net Asset Value as finally determined pursuant
to this Section 2.07 is less than the Estimated Net Asset Value, Affinity
shall pay to Buyer the full amount by which Estimated Net Asset Value exceeds
the Final Net Asset Value in accordance with Section 2.07(g).

(g) Final Payments. The amount (if any) owed to Affinity, on the one hand, or
to Buyer, on the other hand, pursuant to Section 2.07(f) shall be referred to
as the "Final Closing Adjustment." If Buyer is obligated to pay the Final
Closing Adjustment, it shall make the payment in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Escrow Agent for deposit into the Escrow
Fund. If Affinity is obligated to pay the Final Closing Adjustment, Buyer
shall proceed against the Escrow Amount in order to recover such amounts, and
Affinity shall, at Buyer's request, execute and deliver a joint written
direction to the Escrow Agent to authorize such disbursement. Any payment
required under this Section 2.07(g) shall be made within five (5) Business
Days of the final determination of the Final Closing Adjustment.

Section 2.08 Third Party Consents. To the extent that Affinity's rights under
any Contract constituting a Purchased Asset, or any other Purchased Asset, may
not be assigned to Buyer without the consent of another Person which has not
been obtained prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign the same if an attempted assignment would constitute a
breach thereof or be unlawful, and Affinity and Buyer shall cooperate in good
faith and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any
such required consent(s) as promptly as possible. If any such consent shall
not be obtained or if any attempted assignment would be ineffective or would
impair Buyer's rights under the Purchased Asset in question so that Buyer
would not in effect acquire the benefit of all such rights, Affinity shall
cooperate with Buyer in order to obtain for Buyer the benefits thereunder and
in any other reasonable arrangement designed to provide such benefits to
Buyer. Notwithstanding any provision in this Section 2.08 to the contrary, (a)
Buyer shall not be deemed to have waived its rights under Section 7.02(b)
hereof unless and until Buyer either provides written waivers thereof or proceed to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the
Closing, and (b) any Provider Contract requiring consent of the Provider to
transfer or assign it shall be addressed in and governed by Section 6.09
below.

impact on such Material Contract. Affinity has delivered or made available to
Buyer accurate and complete copies of all Material Contracts and other

or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors' rights generally, and (ii) the
remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable

default under) the observance or the performance of any term or obligation to
be performed by it under any Material Contract if such breach would result in
a Material Adverse Effect. To Affinity's Knowledge, no event or circumstance
has occurred that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would result in a
breach of or constitute an event of default under any Material Contract or

to Affinity and the Business.

Schedules, Affinity has in place a written Provider Contract with each
Provider that is currently in effect. Except as set forth on Section
4.07(c)(i)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedules, there are no renegotiations,

Property.

(a) Affinity has good and marketable title to, a valid leasehold interest in,

Property rights of any third party), or (ii) contesting or seeking to deny or
restrict or otherwise concerning the validity, use, ownership, registrability

Affinity and the Business, and (C) to the Knowledge of Affinity, no service
provider (in the course of providing services for or on behalf of Affinity)
has suffered any privacy or data security breach that resulted in the
unauthorized access, acquisition, exfiltration, manipulation, erasure, use, or
disclosure of Affinity's sensitive data, except, in each case, as would not
reasonably be expected to be material to Affinity and the Business. Affinity

and procedures that are in compliance with any applicable Law, applicable
industry requirements, and Affinity's obligations under any Contracts,
including reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical

Transaction Documents to the contrary shall in any manner restrict the ability
of Buyer, from and after the date of this Agreement, to discuss the business
and affairs of Affinity with any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction
over Affinity or the fiscal intermediaries administering Affinity's payor
programs. From the date hereof until the earlier of (i) the Closing Date or

contemplated by this Agreement in the manner and for the time period specified in the Confidentiality Agreement,
dated September 25, 2019.

Section 6.03 No Solicitation of Other Bids.

(a) Affinity shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its
Representatives (collectively, the "Affinity Parties") to, directly or
indirectly, (i) knowingly encourage, solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate,
or respond to (other than solely to decline) inquiries regarding an
Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into discussions or negotiations with, or
provide any information to, any Person concerning a possible Acquisition
Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreements or other instruments (whether or
not binding) regarding an Acquisition Proposal. Affinity shall immediately
cease and or cause to be terminated, and shall cause the other Affinity
Parties to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore
with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal and shall notify each such party that it, or any
Representative retained by it, no longer seeks or requires the making of any
Acquisition Proposal, and withdraws any consent theretofore given to the
making of an Acquisition Proposal and shall promptly instruct (to the extent
it has contractual authority to do so and has not already done so prior to the
date of this Agreement) or otherwise request, any Person that has executed a
confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement within the 48-month period prior
to the date of this Agreement in connection with any actual or potential
Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all such information or documents or
material incorporating confidential information in the possession of such
Person or its Representatives. None of the Affinity Parties shall, directly or
indirectly, and each of the Affinity Parties shall cause their Affiliates and
their respective Representatives not to, solicit, initiate or conduct any
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to or otherwise
cooperate in any other way with, or facilitate or encourage any effort to
attempt to, or enter into any agreement or understanding with, any Person or
group of Persons regarding any Acquisition Proposal. For purposes hereof,
"Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person
(other than Buyer or any of its Affiliates) relating to the direct or indirect
disposition, whether by sale, merger or otherwise, of all or any portion of
the Business or the Purchased Assets or any public announcement of a proposal,
plan or intention to do the foregoing or any agreement to engage in the
foregoing.

(b) In addition to the other obligations under this Section 6.03, Affinity
shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days after receipt
thereof by any Affinity Party) advise Buyer orally and in writing of any
Acquisition Proposal or any request for information with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, and the identity of the Person making the same and shall
provide Buyer with a copy of all written materials relating to such
Acquisition Proposal.

(c) Affinity agrees that the rights and remedies for noncompliance with this
Section 6.03(c) shall include having such provision specifically enforced by
any Court having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that
any such breach or threatened breach shall cause irreparable injury to Buyer
and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer. Section 6.04 Notice of Certain Events.

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of termination of this Agreement in
accordance with ARTICLE IX or the Closing, Affinity shall promptly notify
Buyer in writing of:

(i) any fact, circumstance, event or action the existence, occurrence or
taking of which (A) has had or could reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (B) has resulted
in any representation or warranty made by Affinity hereunder not being true
and correct (to the extent occurring or arising after the date hereof, a
"Disclosure Update"), or (C) has resulted in, or could reasonably be expected
to result in, the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.02
to be satisfied;

(ii) any written notice or other written communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(iii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority, other
than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and
other than that which does not relate to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents; and

(iv) any Actions commenced or, to Affinity's Knowledge, threatened against,
relating to, involving or otherwise affecting the Business, the Purchased
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities that, if pending on the date hereof, would
have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 4.10 or that
relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) No Disclosure Update shall be deemed to modify, or cure any breach of
Affinity's representations and warranties in this Agreement or have any effect
for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.02 (other than Section 7.02(c)) or the obligations of Affinity under
ARTICLE VII.

Section 6.05 Employees.

(a) Sixty (60) days prior to the Closing Date, Affinity shall deliver to Buyer
an updated version of the file containing the information referenced in
Section 4.13(a) (the "Employee Information"), accurate as of such date.
Thereafter and until the Closing Date, Affinity shall deliver to Buyer a
further updated version of the Employee Information as soon as practicable
after change in the information contained therein. Affinity shall provide
Buyer with reasonable access during normal business hours to the employees of
the Business not less than forty-five (45) days prior to the Closing Date and
with information reasonably requested by Buyer with respect to employment,
compensation and benefits of the employees of the Business. No less than ten
(10) days prior to the Closing Date, to be effective as of the Closing but
contingent on the Closing, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall offer
employment to all individuals who are employed by Affinity in good standing in
the operation of the Business; provided however, that Buyer shall not be required to make offers of
employment to or hire (i) any employee of Affinity who does not satisfy
Buyer's employment policies regarding employee documentation, drug testing,
background screening, and other similar matters or (ii) any Inactive Employee,
except as set forth in this Section 6.05. Each such offer of employment shall
provide for the payments and benefits required to be provided by Section
6.05(c). Each employee of Affinity who accepts Buyer's offer of employment and
commences employment with Buyer as of immediately following the Closing shall
be considered a "Hired Employee." Any Inactive Employee who returns to active
employment on or prior to the later of (i) the date that is six (6) months
after the Closing Date or (ii) the latest date on which the Buyer would be
required to rehire such Inactive Employee pursuant to applicable Law and who
satisfies Buyer's employment policies regarding employee documentation, drug
testing, background screening, and other similar matters shall be considered a
"Hired Employee" upon such Inactive Employee's commencement of employment with
Buyer. From the Closing Date through the date six (6) months following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall not terminate any Hired Employee other than (i) for
Cause or (ii) due to the occurrence of any material adverse change to the
Business, and if any Hired Employee is terminated during the one (1) year
period following the Closing Date other than for Cause or due to the
occurrence of any material adverse change to the Business, Buyer will pay that
Hired Employee an amount equal to the base salary that such Hired Employee
would have earned during the remainder of the one (1) year period following
the Closing Date (the "Severance Payment") in lieu of any other severance
payments, unless such Hired Employee has a contractual right (whether in such
Hired Employee's employment agreement with Affinity or in a change in control
agreement between such Hired Employee and Affinity) as set forth on Section
6.05(a) of the Disclosure Schedules that provides for a greater benefit upon
termination, in which case Buyer will pay the Hired Employee solely the
benefits provided in accordance with such agreement as set forth on Section
6.05(a) of the Disclosure Schedules. For the avoidance of doubt, any
termination payments described in the immediately preceding sentence that are
made will be considered to be inclusive of any amounts due under the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988.

(b) Effective as of the Closing Date, Affinity shall terminate the employment
of all of the Hired Employees as of immediately prior to the Closing. Except
as otherwise specified herein, effective as of immediately prior to the
Closing, all Hired Employees will cease to be active participants in the
Affinity Employee Plans. All Hired Employees shall be eligible to become
participants in the corresponding new or existing plans of Buyer and its
Affiliates, including group health and other welfare benefit plans in each
case subject to the terms thereof. Buyer also understands and agrees that (i)
certain Affinity employees have contractual rights that are triggered upon a
change in control of Affinity as set forth on Section 6.05(a) of the
Disclosure Schedules; and (ii) Buyer assumes and will perform the obligations
pursuant to the contracts under which such rights are granted.

(c) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
provide or cause to be provided to each Hired Employee who remains employed
with Buyer during such period (i) base salary or base wages and annual or
other periodic cash incentive opportunities (excluding any retention or
similar bonuses and other special or non-recurring bonuses or cash awards)
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to such Hired Employee by Affinity immediately before the Closing, and (ii) retirement
(excluding pension and retiree medical or welfare benefits), welfare, fringe
and other employee benefits which are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to the Hired Employee by Affinity immediately
prior to the Closing Date under the Affinity Employee Plans or, in Buyer's
discretion, which are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those made
available to similarly situated employees of Buyer.

(d) Buyer shall assume Affinity's Liability for and shall be solely
responsible for the payment or satisfaction of (i) the Affinity Employee
Payables payable following the Closing Date, but only to the extent set forth
on the AEP Schedule; and (ii) any and all Liabilities to or with respect to
any Hired Employee arising after the Closing Date. Buyer shall have no
Liabilities with respect to any current or former employee of the Business who
is not a Hired Employee except for any requirements under COBRA for all
individuals who are "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as such term is defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B 9 with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth in the AEP
Schedule, Buyer shall have no Liabilities with respect to any Hired Employee
relating to the period prior to and including the Closing; provided however,
that Buyer understands and agrees, as provided in Section 6.05(a), that Buyer
is obligated to make a Severance Payment to any Hired Employees who are
terminated during the one (1) year period following the Closing Date or who
have contractual rights that are triggered upon a change in control of
Affinity as set forth on Section 6.05(a) of the Disclosure Schedules.

(e) Buyer shall ensure that (i) all Hired Employees receive credit for prior
service with Affinity (or any predecessor entities) for purposes of
eligibility, participation, vesting and benefit accrual (but not for benefit
accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) under any employee benefit or
compensatory plan, program or arrangement of Buyer or any of Buyer's
Affiliates in which Hired Employees are eligible to participate, except for
any employee benefits that are frozen or grandfathered as of the Closing Date,
for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits (including
retirement treatment under Buyer equity incentive plans) or to the extent it
would result in a duplication of benefits, and (ii) except as otherwise
required by Law, all Hired Employees shall receive seven (7) days of paid time
off (i.e., personal or sick leave) upon commencement of employment with Buyer,
after which the Hired Employees will accrue benefits and paid time off as
provided under Buyer's policy. Buyer shall make reasonable best efforts to
cause (A) any pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting
periods or required physical examinations under any group health benefit plans
of Buyer or any of Buyer's Affiliates to be waived with respect to Hired
Employees and their eligible spouses and dependents, to the extent waived or
satisfied under a corresponding Affinity Employee Plan in which the applicable
Hired Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing; and (B) subject
to Affinity providing adequate data to Buyer, in a format reasonably requested
by Buyer in writing, that the Hired Employees and their eligible spouses,
dependents and beneficiaries will receive credit for the plan year in which
the Closing Date occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-
pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date that were
credited for the same purpose to such individual under the corresponding
Affinity Employee Plan as of the Closing Date. The aggregate amount of
expenses subject to the immediately-preceding clause (B) shall be added to (and shall increase) the
total value of all items listed on the AEP Schedule.

(f) Pursuant to the "Standard Procedure" provided in Section 4 of Revenue
Procedure 2004-53, (i) Affinity and Buyer shall report on a
predecessor/successor basis as set forth therein, (ii) Affinity will not be
relieved from timely filing a Form W-2 with respect to any Hired Employees
with respect to the portion of the calendar year in with the Closing occurs
during which such employees are employed by Affinity and (iii) Buyer will
undertake to file (or cause to be filed) a Form W-2 for each such Hired
Employee with respect to the portion of the calendar year in which the Closing
occurs during which the Hired Employee is employed by Buyer.

(g) This Section 6.05 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the Parties. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to confer upon
any Hired Employee or any other Person (or any spouse, dependent, beneficiary
of or other Person claiming through such Hired Employee or other Person) any
third party beneficiary rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Section 6.05. Except as expressly set forth in this Section
6.05, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to hire or maintain the employment of any Person for any length of
time, or to provide any element or level of compensation or benefits for any
length of time. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create or amend
any compensation or employee benefit plan, program, policy, practice,
agreement or arrangement.

Section 6.06 Confidentiality. From and after the Closing, the Affinity shall,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates to, hold,
and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to hold, in confidence any and all information, whether
written or oral, concerning the Business and Purchased Assets, except to the
extent that (a) such information relates to Excluded Assets or Excluded
Liabilities, except to the extent such information relates to the Business,
(b) such information is generally available to and known by the public through
no fault of Affinity or their Representatives, or (c) is lawfully acquired by
Affinity or any of their Affiliates or Representatives from and after the
Closing from sources (other than Buyer or its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives) which, to the Knowledge of Affinity, are not prohibited from
disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation.
If Affinity or any of its Representatives are compelled to disclose any
information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of
Law, Affinity shall promptly notify Buyer in writing, if and to the extent
Affinity is permitted by applicable Law to do so, and shall disclose only that
portion of such information which Affinity is advised by its counsel is
legally required to be disclosed, provided that Affinity shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, at Buyer's expense, to obtain an appropriate
protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded such information.

Section 6.07 Non-competition; Non-solicitation.

(a) During the Restricted Period, Affinity shall not, directly or indirectly,
either for Affinity's own benefit or for the benefit of any other Person,
without the prior consent of Buyer, which consent may be withheld in Buyer's
sole discretion, (i) engage in, make any regulatory application to engage in, enter into any Contract (including any
Provider Contract) in anticipation of engaging in, or assist others in
engaging in the Restricted Business in the Territory; (ii) have an interest in
any Person that engages directly or indirectly in the Restricted Business in
the Territory in any capacity, including as a partner, shareholder, member,
employee, principal, joint venturer, agent, trustee, volunteer, lender or
consultant; or (iii) induce or persuade, or seek or attempt to induce or
persuade, any Provider, Enrollee, supplier or licensor of the Business
(including any existing or former Provider, Enrollee, supplier or licensor of
Affinity and any Person known to Affinity to have become a Provider, Enrollee,
supplier or licensor of the Business during the Restricted Period) to
terminate or modify its business relationship with the Business in a manner
adverse to the Business.

(b) During the Restricted Period, Affinity shall not, directly or indirectly,
solicit for employment, hire or retain the employment of any Hired Employee,
or encourage any employee of Buyer or its Affiliates to leave such employment
or hire any Person who has left such employment, except pursuant to a general
solicitation which is not directed specifically to any Hired Employees or any
employees of Buyer or its Affiliates; provided, however, that nothing in this
Section 6.07(b) shall prevent Affinity from hiring any employee of Buyer whose
employment has been terminated by Buyer and such termination was not directly
or indirectly attributable to or influenced by actions of Affinity.

(c) Affinity acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section 6.07
are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Buyer and
constitute a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that
any covenant contained in this Section 6.07 should ever be adjudicated to
exceed the time, geographic, product or service or other limitations permitted
by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any Court is expressly empowered
to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed reformed, in such
jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product or service or other
limitations permitted by applicable Law. The covenants contained in this
Section 6.07 and each provision hereof are severable and distinct covenants
and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or
provision as written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the
remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

Section 6.08 Governmental Approvals and Consents.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including
Section 6.08(c), each Party shall (i) as promptly as possible, use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals from all Governmental Authorities set
forth on Schedule 6.08(a) (collectively, the "Required Governmental
Approvals"), (ii) cooperate fully with the other Party and its Affiliates in
promptly seeking to obtain all such Required Governmental Approvals, and (iii)
not willfully take any action for the purpose of delaying, impairing or
impeding the receipt of any such Required Governmental Approvals. If required
by the HSR Act and if the appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act has not
been filed prior to the date hereof, each Party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof, with the exact timing of such filings to be mutually agreed
upon by the Parties, and to supply as promptly as practicable to the
appropriate Governmental Authority any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. In addition, each
Party shall provide or cause to be provided as promptly as practicable any
information and documentary material that may be requested by the U.S.
Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission under the HSR Act or by any
Governmental Authority with regulatory jurisdiction over enforcement of any
Antitrust Laws. Affinity, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall
be responsible for the payment of fifty percent (50%) of any filing fees under
the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Affinity's and Buyer's undertakings
pursuant to this Section 6.08, and subject to Section 6.08(c), each Party
mutually agrees to use its reasonable best efforts and to take any and all
steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other
party so as to enable the Parties to close the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as possible, including proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any of its assets,
properties or businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses to be
acquired by it pursuant to this Agreement as are required to be divested in
order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which
would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition,
each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation
on the merits any claim asserted in Court by any party in order to avoid entry
of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the consummation of the Closing.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including this
Section 6.08, nothing in this Agreement shall require Buyer or its Affiliates
to take or refrain from taking any action, or to agree to any requirement,
restriction, limitation, requirement, or condition (including any conditions
that may be required by any Governmental Authority to obtain any Required
Governmental Approval) that (i) would reasonably be expected to apply to or
affect the businesses, assets or properties of Buyer or its Affiliates or the
Business or the Purchased Assets and would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in Losses to Buyer, its Affiliates, the
Business and/or the Purchased Assets, collectively, that exceed One Million
Dollars ($1,000,000); and/or (ii) would reasonably be expected to materially
and adversely affect the ability of Buyer and its Affiliates to provide health
care coverage under the New York State Medicaid Managed Care, Health and
Recovery Plan, Child Health Plus, or Essential Plan programs that make up the
Business to the extent such health care coverage is provided by Affinity
immediately prior to the Closing (such occurrence, a "Regulatory Material
Adverse Effect"). (d) The Parties agree that, with respect to the Required Governmental
Approvals, Buyer and Affinity shall mutually determine in good faith (i) the
scheduling of, and strategic planning for, any meeting with or filing with any
Governmental Authority, (ii) the process for receipt of any Required
Governmental Approvals and (iii) subject to Section 6.08(c), the resolution of
any investigation or other inquiry of any Governmental Authority; provided,
that each Party shall keep the other Party reasonably apprised of the status
of the matters relating to the Required Governmental Approvals, and each Party
will work cooperatively with the other Party in connection with obtaining all
such Required Governmental Approvals. Without limiting the foregoing, (x) all
analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of either Party
before any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any
Governmental Authority, in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions
between Affinity or Buyer with Governmental Authorities in the ordinary course
of business, any disclosure which is not permitted by Law or any disclosure
containing confidential information) shall be disclosed to the other Party in
advance of any filing, submission or attendance, it being the intent that the
Parties will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good
faith the views of one another, in connection with any such analyses,
appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings,
arguments, and proposals and (y) each Party shall give notice to the other
Party with respect to any meeting, discussion, appearance or contact with any
Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any Governmental
Authority, with such notice being sufficient to provide the other party with
the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, discussion,
appearance or contact; provided, however, Affinity shall not be obligated to
consult Buyer or provide notice to Buyer pursuant to the immediately preceding
clauses (x) and (y) with respect to matters that that would not create any
obligation on Buyer or otherwise impact the operation of the Business by Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (including but not limited to discussions with the
New York State Office of the Attorney General concerning the use of the
proceeds from the sale of the Business under this Agreement by Affinity and
the FQHC Members).

(e) Affinity shall give any notices to third parties in connection with the
Required Third Party Consents, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Required Third Party Consents. Affinity shall regularly consult
with Buyer in connection with the foregoing and shall keep Buyer reasonably
apprised of the status of the matters relating to the Required Third Party
Consents. Affinity shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause
to be obtained, approval from all FQHC Members of the execution and delivery
by Affinity of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the
performance and consummation by Affinity of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Affinity in
connection with Affinity's efforts related thereto.

Section 6.09 New Material Contracts.

(a) Without limitation to Section 6.01(h), Affinity shall promptly notify
Buyer of any new Material Contract (based on anticipated payments during the
twelve (12) months following its execution) proposed to be executed after the
date hereof on behalf of Affinity. (b) Affinity acknowledges that any Provider Contract that provides that it may
be assigned by Affinity without the applicable Provider's consent shall be
deemed to be assigned to Buyer at and subject to the Closing. Affinity
acknowledges and agrees to promptly supply to Buyer, when reasonably
requested, such information and materials (including specific answers or
responses) required in connection with receipt of any required consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals which relate to the provider network, the
Provider Contracts and the continuity of services (such information and
materials to be in such form as may reasonably be requested for purposes of
filings with the applicable regulatory authorities). Without limiting the
generality of Section 2.08, with respect to any Provider Contract requiring
consent of the Provider to transfer or assign it: (A) this Agreement shall not
constitute an agreement to assign or transfer any right, benefit or obligation
arising thereunder if an assignment or transfer without the consent of the
Provider would constitute a breach or violation thereof or adversely affect
the rights of Affinity or Buyer thereunder (however, the foregoing shall not
excuse or waive any breach of any representation or warranty contained herein)
and (B) before the Closing, Affinity shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such Provider Contract to be assigned with any required
consent, and if such consent cannot be obtained, Affinity shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer to obtain its own direct
contract on terms acceptable to Buyer. In addition, Affinity shall, to the
extent reasonably requested by Buyer, use its commercially reasonable efforts
to facilitate introductions to, and meetings with, Providers. Affinity shall
provide reasonable access to all information necessary for Buyer to evaluate
the extent to which the provider networks of Buyer and Affinity overlap.

Section 6.10 Closing Conditions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth
herein, each Party hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take
such actions as are necessary to expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions
relating to the Closing set forth in ARTICLE VII hereof.

Section 6.11 Public Announcements. Neither Affinity nor Buyer shall make, nor
shall they permit any of their Representatives to make, any public
announcements in respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or otherwise communicate with any news media without the prior written
consent of the other or in accordance with a communications plan mutually
agreed to by the Parties, unless required by applicable Law or any listing
agreement with or rules of the New York Stock Exchange or other stock exchange
on which securities of Buyer are listed or as may be requested by a
Governmental Authority, in which case the issuing party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any
such release or making any such public statement, and the issuing party shall
allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or public
statement in advance of such issuance and shall consider in good faith any
reasonable comments of such party. Upon execution of this Agreement and upon
the Closing, Affinity and Buyer (or their respective Affiliates) may each
issue press releases announcing the transaction, in each case in accordance
with a communications plan mutually agreed to by the Parties.

Section 6.12 Reconciliation. If Buyer collects or receives any Excluded Asset
from any third party after the Closing, then Buyer shall deliver such Excluded
Asset to Affinity as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof. If
Affinity collects or receives any Purchased Asset from any third party after the Closing, then Affinity shall
deliver to Buyer such Purchased Asset(s) as soon as reasonably practicable
after receipt thereof. Likewise, Buyer shall forward any claim for an Excluded
Liability to Affinity after the Closing and Affinity shall forward any claim
for an Assumed Liability to Buyer after the Closing. Without limitation to
this Section 6.12, Affinity shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in Buyer's
collection of the receivables that are Purchased Assets.

Section 6.13 Transition Planning. Affinity shall cooperate with Buyer as may
be reasonably requested by Buyer from time to time to develop and implement an
integration and transition plan for the Business for purposes of regulatory
reporting and any other services mutually agreed to by the Parties, and the
Parties shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts to enter into a
transition services agreement on terms and conditions to be mutually agreed
upon by the Parties. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer
and Affinity shall cooperate to develop and implement a mutually agreeable
communications plan with respect to the Enrollees and Providers.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Affinity make a general
announcement to its non-executive employees regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement before any press releases have been issued by
Buyer or Affinity in accordance with Section 6.11.

Section 6.14 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, each of the Parties
shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver such
additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances and take such
further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions
hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents. Without limiting the generality of the
preceding sentence, Affinity shall, on and after the Closing Date, transfer
(or cause to be transferred) to Buyer such records and data (including
electronic data files) that, prior to the Closing, are used by Affinity in
providing services related to the operation of the Business, as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer (and, in the case of electronic data files, in
such format or formats as may be reasonably requested by Buyer).

Section 6.15 Post-Closing Access to Information.

(a) After the Closing, each Party shall afford the other Party and its
counsel, accountants, consultants and other Representatives, during normal
business hours, reasonable access to the books, records and other information
in such Party's possession relating to the Business, and the right to make
copies and extracts therefrom at its expense, or shall provide copies of such
information to the other Party, in each case to the extent such access is
reasonably required by the requesting Party (i) to comply with reporting,
disclosure, filing or other requirements imposed by a Governmental Authority,
(ii) for use in any Tax audits or litigation in which such requesting Party is
a party, (iii) to comply with such requesting Party's obligations under this
Agreement, or (iv) with respect to Buyer, relates to the operation, ownership
and management of the Business and which Affinity is permitted by applicable
Law to provide provided, that, Buyer agrees to treat such information as
confidential, if applicable.

(b) In addition, after the Closing Affinity shall provide to Buyer such
written certifications, sub-certifications or the like as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer to support any attestation or representation required to be provided by Buyer in
connection with any audit, accreditation review or similar proceeding relating
to the operation of the Business prior to the Closing. For a period of six (6)
years after the Closing Date, neither Affinity nor Buyer shall, or permit its
Affiliates to, destroy or otherwise dispose of any of the books, records or
other information described in this Section 6.15 without first offering in
writing to surrender such books, records and other information to the other
Party, and the other Party shall have ten (10) days after such offer to agree
in writing to take possession thereof.

Section 6.16 Non-disparagement. (a) Affinity shall not publicly talk about or
otherwise publicly communicate to any third parties (including Providers and
Enrollees) in a disparaging or defamatory manner regarding Buyer, or otherwise
make or authorize to be made any written or oral statement that may disparage
or damage the reputation of Buyer; and (b) Buyer shall not, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates not to, publicly talk about or otherwise publicly
communicate to any third parties (including Providers and Enrollees) in a
disparaging or defamatory manner regarding Affinity, or otherwise make or
authorize to be made any written or oral statement that may disparage or
damage the reputation of Affinity; provided, however, that such restriction
shall not prohibit (i) truthful statements compelled by legal process, as part
of a response to a request for information from any Governmental Authority or
as testimony in any legal or regulatory process or proceeding, (ii) any
statements in connection with any legal dispute, (iii) filing any necessary
documents in accordance with Law or applicable stock exchange requirements or
(iv) factual statements by such Party regarding the business, condition,
results or prospects of the Business in connection with any public earnings
call or otherwise, so long as such statements are not reasonably foreseen by
such Party as likely to defame, disparage, or slander any other Party.

Section 6.17 Post-Closing Buyer Covenants.

(a) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable good
faith efforts to:

(i) promote Enrollee health through (A) quality, accessible care and services,
(B) partnering with health professionals to assist in providing health care
services, (C) facilitating building linkages and systems for the coordination
of care and services among health care, behavioral and social services, as
well as educators, to address the spiritual, emotional, and physical needs of
Enrollees, and (D) advocating for a health policy that accords true dignity
and respect for all human persons, especially the poor and underserved;

(ii) maintain in all material respects to the extent commercially viable the
scope and type of services currently provided to Enrollees by the Business as
conducted immediately prior to the Closing;

(iii) subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.17(a)(ii), maintain a
corporate presence in the State of New York no less significant than the
operations of the Business in the State of New York immediately prior to the
Closing (including maintaining a regional chief executive officer for the
Business that reports directly to Buyer's national chief executive officer of
community and state programs) and continue to provide a similar or greater level of employment opportunities to residents of the State of New York as
compared to those provided by the Business immediately prior to the Closing;

(iv) promote growth and expansion of the Business through (A) partnering with
health professionals with aligned mission and vision and (B) leveraging
Affinity's existing capabilities for scale and efficiency, for accelerating
care and process innovation, and for developing predictive health capabilities
to foster healthier communities; and

(v) enhance population health capability of the Business by (A) maintaining
existing high standards of quality that endeavor to be cost effective across
all populations; (B) focusing on coordination of care and services among
health care, behavioral, and social service needs of Enrollee populations, (C)
developing systems to attain greater standards of clinical excellence and
improving Enrollee health status, (D) focusing on a "person-centered"
coordination of services and customer service; and (E) facilitating linkages
and systems for coordination of care and services.

(b) With respect to the covenants contained in this Section 6.17(a), (i) the
covenants will survive for a period of eighteen (18) months from Closing, (ii)
nothing herein is intended to or shall confer upon any Enrollee or Person
(including any Governmental Authority) any legal or equitable enforcement or
other right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement and (iii) the covenants are subject to any changes in
applicable Laws or economic conditions to the extent such changes alter the
commercially reasonable expectations of the Parties at the time they entered
into this Agreement or the commercial viability of complying with such
covenants.

(c) From and after the Closing until final payment of the Net Asset Value
adjustment contemplated by Section 2.07(g), Buyer shall pay or cause to be
paid all claims payable and claims payable incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with industry standard claims procedures.

(d) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and continuing through the
five-year anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the headquarters
of the Business to remain located in the Bronx, New York.

(e) For the period commencing on the one-month anniversary of the Closing Date
and continuing through the five-year anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer
shall cause Molina Healthcare of New York, Inc. ("MHNY") to appoint to its
board of directors a representative designated by the board of directors of
Affinity (the "Affinity Representative") and approved by Buyer, such approval
not to be unreasonably conditioned or withheld. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, (A) the Affinity Representative shall not be an
employee, officer or director of any competitor of Buyer, and (B) Buyer shall
have the right to withhold any information, including any written materials,
from the Affinity Representative, and to exclude the Affinity Representative
from any board meeting or committee meeting or portion thereof if, in the
reasonable good faith judgment of either Buyer or the board of directors of
MHNY (other than the Affinity Representative), an issue is addressed in such
written materials, or is to be discussed, which is not appropriate to be
disclosed to or discussed in the presence of the Affinity Representative in order to avoid a conflict of interest as
established by Buyer or MHNY policy on the part of the Affinity Representative
or otherwise would require a similarly situated director to recuse himself
under New York law.

Section 6.18 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, excise,
stamp, registration, value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) (collectively, the "Transfer Taxes") incurred in
connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets pursuant to this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents (including any real property transfer Tax
and any other similar Tax) shall be borne and paid by Affinity when due.
Affinity shall duly prepare any Tax Return or other document with respect to
such Taxes or fees (and Buyer shall cooperate with respect thereto as
necessary), and shall give Buyer a copy of each such Tax Return for its review
and comment at least fifteen (15) days prior to filing. Following such review
and comment period, Affinity shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all Transfer Taxes and, if required by
applicable Law, Buyer shall join Affinity in the execution of any such Tax
Returns and other documentation.

Section 6.19 Minimum Network Requirements. In the event that, prior to the
Closing, one (1) or more Providers provide notice of the termination (each, a
"Terminating Provider") of any Provider Contract in accordance with its terms
(each, a "Provider Contract Termination") and, individually or in the
aggregate, such Provider Contract Terminations would reasonably be expected to
result in Buyer's failure to satisfy the Minimum Network Requirements (a
"Network Failure"), then, prior to the Closing, Affinity shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in obtaining a direct contract
on terms reasonably satisfactory to Buyer with such Terminating Providers that
Buyer requests. If a contract is unattainable with a Terminating Provider,
then upon the request of Buyer, Affinity shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to identify and contract with (either directly or through its
Affiliates) or assist Buyer to contract with alternate Provider(s) as soon as
reasonably practicable as necessary to avoid a Network Failure.

Section 6.20 No Sale or Dissolution; Post-Closing Cooperation. Affinity hereby
covenants and agrees that (i) for a period of six (6) years from the Closing
Date (the "Wind-Up Period"), Affinity shall not dissolve, liquidate or wind up
its affairs and (ii) during the Wind-Up Period, Affinity shall employ or
retain one or more other representatives reasonably acceptable to Buyer whom
Affinity shall direct and cause to consult with Buyer and its representatives
on an as-needed basis regarding the Business in order to facilitate the
transition of the Purchased Assets to Buyer following the Closing, including
by responding to questions from Buyer and its representatives from time to
time and providing reasonable cooperation with Buyer in any pending or future
litigation or investigation or other dispute regarding the Business.

Section 6.21 Insurance Coverage. Prior to Closing, Affinity shall tender all
actual and potential claims timely and completely to any insurance policies
that may provide coverage to such claims in the format prescribed by the

Section 8.02 Indemnification by Affinity. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this ARTICLE VIII, Affinity shall indemnify and defend each of
Buyer, its Affiliates and its Representatives (collectively, the "Buyer
Indemnitees") against, and shall hold each of them harmless from and against,
and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any and all Losses incurred or
sustained by, or imposed upon, the Buyer Indemnitees based upon, arising out
of, with respect to or by reason of:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of

Section 8.03 Indemnification by Buyer. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this ARTICLE VIII, Buyer shall indemnify and defend Affinity,
its Affiliates and its Representatives (collectively, the "Affinity
Indemnitees") against, and shall hold each of them harmless from and against,
and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any and all Losses incurred or
sustained by, or imposed upon, the Affinity Indemnitees based upon, arising
out of, with respect to or by reason of:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Buyer contained in this Agreement (other than the Buyer Fundamental

(b) any inaccuracy in or breach of any Buyer Fundamental Representation;

(c) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement;

(d) any knowing and intentional common law fraud by Buyer in the making of the
representations and warranties set forth in ARTICLE V; or

(e) the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities.

Section 8.04 Certain Limitations. The Parties' indemnification obligations
under Section 8.02 and Section 8.03 shall be subject to the following
limitations: (a) Neither Affinity nor Buyer shall have any liability for monetary Losses
arising under Section 8.02(a) or Section 8.03(a), until the aggregate amount
of Losses related thereto for which the Affinity or Buyer, as applicable,
would otherwise be required to provide indemnification, exceeds an amount
equal to Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) (the "Basket Amount"). The
aggregate Liability of Affinity, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, for any Losses with respect to matters set forth in this ARTICLE VIII
shall not exceed an amount equal to the Escrow Amount (the "Cap"); provided,
that the Cap shall not apply with respect to (i) claims for any knowing and
intentional common law fraud or willful breach, or (ii) Losses resulting from,
arising out of or relating to breaches of the Affinity Fundamental
Representations.

(b) Neither Affinity nor Buyer shall have any liability for monetary Losses
under Section 8.02(a) or Section 8.03(a) unless and until the aggregate amount
of all monetary Losses under Section 8.02(a) or Section 8.03(a) as applicable,
for which Affinity or Buyer, as applicable, would otherwise be required to
provide indemnification exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to the
Basket Amount, at which point Affinity or Buyer, as applicable, subject to the
other provisions of this Section 8.04, shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees
or the Affinity Indemnitees, as applicable, for the full amount of all such
Losses in excess of such Basket Amount, subject in all respects to the Cap.

(c) From the Closing Date until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing
Date, the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover any Losses under
a claim pursuant to Section 8.02(d) unless and until the aggregate amount of
all Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees with respect to the Special DOH
Indemnity exceed the amounts accrued related to the Special DOH Indemnity in
the Closing Statement (as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.07(d)).

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any and all
indemnification payments required to be made by Affinity pursuant to Section
8.02 shall be paid solely from the Escrow Fund to the extent available in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement. Affinity shall not be required to pay
any Buyer Indemnitee for any indemnifiable Losses under Section 8.02 once the
Escrow Fund has been exhausted; provided, however, that the foregoing
limitation shall not apply to (i) any claims for any knowing and intentional
common law fraud or willful breach by Affinity, or (ii) any Losses resulting
from, arising out of or relating to breaches of the Affinity Fundamental
Representations. The Escrow Agent shall distribute to Affinity, subject to the
terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, immediately following the
Survival Period, the then remaining Escrow Amount in excess of the sum of any
amounts with respect to (x) which Buyer is entitled to, but has not yet
received, indemnification, pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII (plus the amount of
any interest or income earned on such amount), (y) any unresolved claims for
indemnification as of such date (plus the amount of any interest or income
earned on such amount) and (z) any amounts disputed but not yet resolved
pursuant to Section 2.07. Once all indemnification claims are resolved between
the Parties in accordance with this ARTICLE VIII, and all disputes (if any)
are resolved between the Parties in accordance with Section 2.07, as
applicable, all remaining amounts in the Escrow Fund, if any, shall be paid to (e) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided to an
Indemnified Party under this ARTICLE VIII shall be net of any amounts actually
recovered by such Indemnified Party under policies of insurance (less any
costs and expenses of recovery thereof), with respect to such Losses. If and
to the extent any insurance proceeds are actually received by any Indemnified
Party after such Indemnified Party has recovered any Losses pursuant to this
ARTICLE VIII such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the Indemnifying
Party an amount equal to such insurance proceeds to which the Indemnifying
Party is entitled pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph.

(f) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be compensated more than once
for the same Loss.

(g) Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate Losses for which indemnification may be claimed by such Indemnified
Party under this Agreement to the extent required by applicable Law.

(h) The right of an Indemnified Party to indemnification or to assert or
recover on any claim shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with
respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any
time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy of, or compliance with, any of
the representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements set forth in this
Agreement. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or agreement, shall not affect the right to indemnification or other
remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants or agreements.

Section 8.05 Indemnification Procedures. The party making a claim under this
ARTICLE VIII is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the party against
which such claim is asserted under this ARTICLE VIII is referred to as the
"Indemnifying Party".

(a) Third Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is
not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or
a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third Party Claim") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to
provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give
the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any
event not later than thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of such notice of
such Third Party Claim (a "Claim Notice"). The failure to give a Claim Notice
shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that such failure has a materially
prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available to the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim or the
indemnification obligations are materially increased as a result of such
failure. A Claim Notice shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable
detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and
shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably determinable, of the Loss
that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving written notice to
the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of the Claim Notice, to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at the
Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying Party's own counsel
(which choice of counsel shall be subject to the Indemnified Party's prior
written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense; provided,
that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have acknowledged in writing to the
Indemnified Party its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party as
provided hereunder in respect thereof, (ii) the Indemnifying Party must
conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently in order
to preserve its rights in this regard and (iii) notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to elect to defend the
Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim (and the Indemnified Party shall
have the sole power to direct and control such defense) if the Third Party
Claim (A) could result in any Adverse Claim Consequences or (B) seeks non-
monetary relief, relates to a criminal action or involves claims by a Provider
or Governmental Authority. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to Section 8.05(b), it shall
have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute,
defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third Party Claim
in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party
shall have the right to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim
with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Party's right to
control the defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall
be at the expense of the Indemnified Party, provided, that (A) if the
Indemnifying Party requests that the Indemnified Party participates in the
defense of such Third Party Claim or (B) if, in the reasonable written opinion
of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (x) there are legal defenses available to
an Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available
to the Indemnifying Party or (y) there exists a conflict of interest between
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable documented fees and
expenses of one counsel to the Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction for
which the Indemnified Party determines counsel is required. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim
or fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election
to defend as provided in this Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, subject to
Section 8.05(b), pay, compromise, defend such Third Party Claim and seek
indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to
such Third Party Claim. Affinity and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in
all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third Party
Claim, including making available (subject to the provisions of Section
6.05(a)) records relating to such Third Party Claim and using commercially
reasonably efforts to furnish, without expense to the defending party,
management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably necessary
for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
avoid production of confidential information (consistent with applicable Law),
and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and others
representing any party to a Third Party Claim to be made so as to preserve any
applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

(b) Settlement of Third Party Claims. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or offer to
settle or compromise any Third Party Claim if the terms of such settlement do
not contain a release of the Indemnified Parties or (i) would result in the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree
that would restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party,
(ii) would result in a finding or admission of wrongdoing or violation of Law
by the Indemnified Party, (iii) would result in any monetary Liability of the
Indemnified Party that will not be paid or reimbursed by the Indemnifying
Party, or (iv) has an adverse effect on any ongoing business of the
Indemnified Party (any of the foregoing, "Adverse Claim Consequences"). If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall not admit any Liability with respect to, settle, compromise or
discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(c) Direct Claims. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than thirty (30)
calendar days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim.
The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that such failure has a materially prejudicial effect on the defenses
or other rights available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such
Direct Claim. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct
Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written
evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) calendar days after its
receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and
its professional advisors to allow the Indemnified Party to investigate the
matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether
and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and
the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Party's investigation by
providing reasonable access (including access to the Indemnified Party's
premises and personnel, documents or records during normal business hours on a
mutually convenient basis) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its
professional advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party
notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not dispute the claim described in
such notice, or fails to so respond within such thirty (30) calendar day
period that the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim described in such
notice, the Losses in the amount specified in the Indemnified Party's notice
will be conclusively deemed a Liability of the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover the amount of such Losses from
the Indemnifying Party in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
ARTICLE VIII. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its Liability with
respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party will
proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and if no such
resolution is reached, to litigate such dispute.

Section 8.06 Payments. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or
finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII, the
Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within ten (10) Business Days
of such final, non-appealable adjudication by wire transfer of immediately
available funds (or, if the Indemnifying Party is Affinity, in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement). Section 8.07 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law.

Section 8.08 Exclusive Remedy. Except in the case of Section 8.02(f) or
Section 8.02(d), claims for equitable relief (including the enforcement of any
covenant requiring performance following the Closing) or Liabilities or Claims
based on any knowing and intentional common law fraud or willful breach, from
and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy for all Losses relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be the
indemnification provisions set forth in this ARTICLE VIII.

Section 8.09 Materiality. For purposes of Section 8.02(a), Section 8.02(b),
Section 8.03(a), and Section 8.03(b), any qualifications as to materiality,
Material Adverse Effect, material adverse effect or similar qualification
contained in the representations or warranties in this Agreement (other than
with respect to the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.05,
as to which this Section 8.09 shall not apply), shall be disregarded and have
no effect.

restraining or enjoining the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
such Prohibitive Order shall have become final and non-appealable; provided
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01(d)(i)
shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation
under this Agreement shall have been a material cause of, or resulted in, the
occurrence of such Prohibitive Order, or who has initiated or taken any action
in support of such Prohibitive Order; or

(ii) the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to December 31, 2021 (the

and Section 7.01(b)) or Section 7.01(c) have not been satisfied (or waived)

their terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing) have been satisfied or
waived by the Initial Termination Date, the Initial Termination Date may be
extended by either Affinity or Buyer for up to three (3) months from the
Initial Termination Date (the Initial Termination Date, as it may be extended

"Termination Date"); provided, further, that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01(d)(ii) shall not be available to any
party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been
the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior
to such date.

Section 9.02 Effect of Termination.

Section 10.05 Severability. The unenforceability or invalidity of any

any other provision. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of

court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable
in any respect, all other provisions of this Agreement, or the application of

Buyer Disclosure Schedules shall: (i) represent a determination that such item
or other matter is material (or otherwise establish a standard of materiality)
or that such item or matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the
Disclosure Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure Schedules; and (ii) represent a
determination that such item or other matter did not arise in the ordinary
course of business. The information contained in the Disclosure Schedules and
the Buyer Disclosure Schedules is provided solely for purposes of making
disclosures to each Party under this Agreement. In disclosing such
information, each Party does not waive any attorney-client privilege
associated with such information or any protection afforded by the work-
product doctrine with respect to any of the matters disclosed or discussed in
the Disclosure Schedules and the Buyer Disclosure Schedules.

Section 10.08 Successors and Assigns. The rights and obligations of this
Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as expressly provided
herein, the rights and obligations of this Agreement may not be assigned (by
operation of law or otherwise) by any Party without the prior written consent
of the other Party; provided, however, that Buyer may, without the prior
written consent of Affinity, assign any of its rights and interests hereunder
to any of its Affiliates; provided, further, that no such assignment shall
relieve Buyer of any of its obligations or liabilities hereunder.

Section 10.09 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the Parties and each of their permitted successors and assigns, and
nothing herein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give any
Person, other than the Parties and such permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable rights hereunder; provided, that the Buyer Indemnitees and
the Affinity Indemnitees are intended third party beneficiaries of ARTICLE
VIII.

Section 10.10 Amendment and Modification; Waiver. This Agreement may not be
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except in a written instrument
executed by each Party. No waiver by either Party of any default,
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent
default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or
affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such
occurrence. No waiver by either Party of any of the provisions hereof shall be
effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and executed by the Party
sought to be charged with such waiver. No failure by either Party to exercise,
or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from
this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall
any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power
or privilege.

Section 10.11 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) All matters relating to the interpretation, construction, validity and
enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the domestic Laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any
choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York
or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

(b) ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING (WHETHER AT LAW, IN EQUITY, IN
CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT,
THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY MAY ONLY BE INSTITUTED IN THE FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS LOCATED IN THE
BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN (AND ANY FEDERAL OR STATE APPELLATE COURT THEREFROM), AND
EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS IN
ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICE OR
OTHER DOCUMENT BY MAIL TO SUCH PARTY'S ADDRESS SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL BE
EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF PROCESS FOR ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT
IN ANY SUCH COURT. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
Party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING
OF VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR ANY PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY
WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH SUIT,
ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN
INCONVENIENT FORUM.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH
PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL
ACTION, (ii) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii)
SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
10.11(C).

Section 10.12 Specific Performance. Without intending to limit the remedies
available to the Parties hereunder, the Parties agree that irreparable damage
may occur if any provision of this Agreement are not performed in accordance
with the terms hereof, for which damages, even if available, will not be an
adequate remedy. Accordingly, the Parties shall be entitled to seek an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms hereof, without, in any such case, the requirement to
post any bond or other undertaking, in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. Each Party agrees not to oppose the
granting of such injunctive relief on the basis that monetary damages are an
adequate remedy.

Section 10.13 No Recourse Against Non-Recourse Parties. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, this Agreement may be enforced only
against, and any Claim based upon, arising out of or related to this
Agreement, any Transaction Documents or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, any Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, may be brought only against the Persons that
are expressly named as parties hereto or thereto and then only with respect to
the specific obligations set forth herein or therein with respect to such
party. With respect to each named party to this Agreement or any Transaction
Document, no Non-Recourse Party of such named party shall have any liability
(whether in contract, tort or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of such named party or for any Claim based on, arising out of or
related to this Agreement, any Transaction Documents or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement, any Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Without limiting the rights of
(a) a Party against another Party in the case of this Agreement, in no event
shall such Party or any of its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement
against, make any Claims for any breach of this Agreement against, or seek to
recover any Losses from, any Non-Recourse Party of such other Party and (b) a
party to a Transaction Document against another party to such Transaction
Document in the case of a Transaction Document, in no event shall such party
or any of its Affiliates seek to enforce such Transaction Document against,
make any Claims for any breach of such Transaction Document against, or seek
to recover any Losses from, any Non-Recourse Party of such other party
thereto. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party, on behalf of itself and
each of its Affiliates, hereby (i) waives and releases any and all Claims that
may otherwise be available to such Party or any of its Affiliates at Law or in
equity, granted by statute or otherwise, to avoid or disregard the entity form
of any other Party or otherwise impose liability of any other Party on any
Non-Recourse Party of such other Party (whether granted by statute or based on
theories of equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination,
sham, single business enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness,
undercapitalization or otherwise) and (ii) covenants that neither such Party
nor any of such Party's Non-Recourse Parties will (and that such Party will
cause all other Persons who may seek to claim as, by, through or in relation
to such Party or any of such Party's Non-Recourse Parties not to) sue, or
bring or otherwise pursue any Claim against, any Non-Recourse Party of any
other Party on the basis of or in any way relating to this Agreement, any of
the Transaction Documents or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby (regardless of whether this Section 10.13 is
enforceable under, or prohibited by, applicable Law or otherwise).

Section 10.14 Acknowledgements; Disclaimers.

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that Buyer is an informed and
sophisticated Person, and has engaged expert advisors experienced in the
evaluation and acquisition of the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities as
contemplated hereunder. Buyer has had an opportunity to conduct its own
independent investigation and due diligence review of Affinity, the Business
and Affinity's assets and condition, financial and otherwise. Buyer
acknowledges that: (1) in making its decision to enter into this Agreement and
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer has relied solely
upon its own investigation and the express representations and warranties of
Affinity set forth in ARTICLE IV of this Agreement (including the related
portions of the Disclosure Schedules); and (2) neither Affinity nor any other
Person has made any representation or warranty as to Affinity, the Business,
the assets or this Agreement except as expressly set forth in ARTICLE IV of
this Agreement (including related portions of the Disclosure Schedules).

(b) NEITHER AFFINITY NOR ITS REPRESENTATIVES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES
OR MEMBERS HAS MADE, AND SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE, ANY REPRESENTATIONS
OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER RELATING TO ANY
ONE OR MORE OF AFFINITY, THE BUSINESS, THE PURCHASED ASSETS OR THE ASSUMED
LIABILITIES OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, OTHER THAN THOSE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN
ARTICLE IV.

(c) NEITHER BUYER NOR ITS SUBSIDIARIES, THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES,
DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR MEMBERS HAS MADE, AND SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO
HAVE MADE, ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF ANY
NATURE WHATSOEVER RELATING TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF BUYER OR ANY OF ITS
SUBSIDIARIES, THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OTHER THAN THOSE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE V (INCLUDING RELATED PORTIONS OF THE
BUYER DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES).

(d) With respect to all materials that are described as having been made
available or delivered to Buyer, such materials shall be deemed to have been
delivered or made available to Buyer if Buyer or any of its representatives or
agents have been granted access to a dataroom, electronic dataroom or website
in which such materials were available or by transmitting such materials to
Buyer or its representatives or agents by any other electronic means. Buyer
further agrees that neither Affinity nor any other Person (including the Non-
Recourse Parties of Affinity) shall have or be subject to any liability to
Buyer or any other Person resulting from the distribution to Buyer, or Buyer's
use of, any information, documents or materials made available to Buyer or
Buyer's representatives in certain "data rooms," management presentations or any other form in expectation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 10.15 Prevailing Party. If any Party seeks to enforce its rights under
this Agreement by any judicial action, legal proceeding, case or the like
against the other Party, the applicable adjudicating body shall award to the
prevailing party or parties (as the case may be), if any, the costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs of investigation and
preparation) reasonably incurred by the prevailing party or parties (as the
case may be) in connection with such judicial action, legal proceeding, case
or the like, and, if the adjudicating body determines a party or parties to be
the prevailing party or parties under circumstances where the prevailing party
or parties won on some but not all of the claims and counterclaims, the
adjudicating body may award the prevailing party or parties an appropriate
percentage of the costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs of
investigation and preparation) reasonably incurred by the prevailing party or
parties in connection with such judicial action, legal proceeding, case or the
like.

Section 10.16 Release. Effective as of the Closing, Buyer, on behalf of itself
and its past, present and future Affiliates and each of its and their
respective past, present and future equity holders, directors, officers,
employees, members, managers, counsel, agents and representatives and each of
its and their respective successors and assigns (collectively, the "Releasing
Parties"), hereby voluntarily, unconditionally and irrevocably and forever
releases and discharges (i) Affinity, (ii) each of Affinity's Affiliates,
(iii) all past, present and future, directors, officers, employees, members,
managers, counsel, agents and representatives of Affinity or any of its
Affiliates and (iv) all of the successors and/or assigns of any of the
foregoing Persons in the immediately preceding clauses (i) through (iii) (all
of the foregoing Persons in the immediately preceding clauses (i) through (iv)
are collectively referred to herein as the "Released Parties") of and from,
and hereby voluntarily, unconditionally and irrevocably waive, any and all
claims, counterclaims, debts, demands, Losses, costs, fees, expenses,
penalties, proceedings, covenants, suits, judgments, damages, Actions and
causes of Action, obligations, accounts and Liabilities of any kind or
character whatsoever, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, in contract,
contingent or absolute, matured or unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated,
direct or indirect, at Law or in equity (collectively, "Claims") that any of
the Releasing Parties ever had, now has or ever may have or claim to have
against any of the Released Parties for or by reason of any matter,
circumstance, event, action, inaction, omission, error, negligence, breach of
contract, tort, violation of Law, cause or thing whatsoever arising prior to
the Closing to the extent arising out of or relating to the Business or the
Purchased Assets (including with respect to the management or operation of
Affinity or the Business) (collectively, the "Released Claims"). Buyer, on
behalf of itself and each of the other Releasing Parties, covenants that none
of the Releasing Parties will (and that Buyer will cause all other Persons who
may seek to claim as, by, through or in relation to any of the Releasing
Parties or any of the matters released by or on behalf of the Releasing
Parties in this Section 10.16 not to) sue, or bring or otherwise pursue any
Claim against, any of the Released Parties on the basis of or in any way
relating to any of the Released Claims (regardless of whether the release of
any such Released Claim is enforceable under, or prohibited by, applicable Law
or otherwise). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this
Section 10.16 shall (A) constitute a release or waiver of any rights of Buyer or (B) release or relieve any
obligations of Affinity, in either case of clauses (A) and (B), that are
expressly set forth in this Agreement or any Transaction Document. The
foregoing release and waiver of Released Claims (X) was made with the advice
of counsel and fully, finally and forever settles and releases the Released
Claims and (Y) shall be and remain in effect notwithstanding the discovery of
any additional Claims or facts relating to any of the Released Claims.

Section 10.17 Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be
executed and delivered in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same
agreement. This Agreement and any amendments hereto, to the extent signed and
delivered by means of a facsimile machine or electronic transmission in
portable document format (pdf), shall be treated in all manner and respects as
an original thereof and shall be considered to have the same binding legal
effects as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
Minor variations in the form of the signature page, including footers from
earlier versions of this Agreement or any such other document, shall be
disregarded in determining the party's intent or the effectiveness of such
signature. No Party hereto shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or
electronic transmission in pdf to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or document was transmitted or communicated electronically as a
defense to the formation of a contract, and each such Party forever waives any
such defense.

Section 10.18 No Strict Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.
