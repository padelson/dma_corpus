INVESTMENTS, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&#147;<B>Purchaser</B>&#148;), and LSREF LODGING MERGER CO.,
INC., a Delaware corporation and an affiliate of Purchaser (&#147;<B>Merger Sub</B>&#148;).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;The respective boards of directors or other governing body of Merger Sub, Purchaser and the
Company deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders and/or
interest holders that Purchaser acquire the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions
provided for in this Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;The board of directors of the Company (the &#147;<B>Board</B>&#148;) has unanimously approved this Agreement
and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company with the Company surviving (the &#147;<B>Merger</B>&#148;),
and the Board has determined that such approval is sufficient to render inapplicable to this
Agreement and the Merger the restrictions against the parties hereto engaging in any business
combination as set forth in Section&nbsp;203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (&#147;<B>DGCL</B>&#148;), has
determined that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders, and has resolved to recommend that the holders of the Company&#146;s
issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the &#147;<B>Common Stock</B>&#148;, with
all of the outstanding shares of Common Stock being hereinafter referred to as the &#147;<B>Shares</B>&#148;), adopt
this Agreement and approve the Merger.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;The board of directors or other governing body of each of Purchaser and Merger Sub have
each approved this Agreement and the Merger, all in accordance with the DGCL and, in each such
case, upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

inducement to Purchaser&#146;s and Merger Sub&#146;s willingness to enter into this Agreement, Purchaser,
Merger Sub, the Company and certain stockholders of the Company have entered into Voting Agreements
(each a &#147;<B>Voting Agreement</B>&#148; and, collectively, the &#147;<B>Voting Agreements</B>&#148;).

contained in this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as

Shares shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation nor
the Exchange Agent nor any of their respective directors, managers, officers, employees or agents
shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar

claiming such Certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of an indemnity or bond in such sum as Purchaser

award of specific performance to remedy a breach of this Agreement by Purchaser or Merger Sub, then
the Company may be awarded any other remedy available to it at law or in equity, including monetary
damages (which the parties agree may not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket
costs and, to the extent proven, may be determined by reference to the amount, if any, that would
have been recoverable by the Company Stockholders if such Company Stockholders were entitled to
bring an action against Purchaser). Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall the collective damages payable by Purchaser, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates,
for breaches under this Agreement or any guarantee entered into in connection herewith exceed
$20,000,000 in the aggregate for all such breaches. If a court of competent jurisdiction enters a
judgment awarding the Company damages for such alleged breach, the parties hereto agree that (i)&nbsp;if
such judgment is entered within 60&nbsp;days of the Company filing suit, then within five days following
such determination Purchaser and Merger Sub may elect to and may consummate the Merger (in
accordance with Article&nbsp;II of this Agreement) and the parties shall promptly jointly request such
judgment be set aside, provided that if Purchaser and Merger Sub do not so elect to consummate the
Merger or do not consummate the Merger with such five days, then the Company may enforce such
judgment, and (ii)&nbsp;if such judgment is entered later than 60&nbsp;days after the Company files suit,
then (A)&nbsp;the Company may enforce such judgment, or, (B)&nbsp;if Purchaser and Merger Sub desire to
consummate the Merger in accordance with Article&nbsp;II of this Agreement and the Company consents
(such consent to be in the sole and absolute discretion of the Company) to such consummation at
such time, the parties may consummate the Merger and the parties shall promptly jointly request
such judgment be set aside.
