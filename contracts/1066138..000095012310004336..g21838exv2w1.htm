AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of January 22, 2010, by and among LODGIAN, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), LSREF LODGING INVESTMENTS, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Purchaser"), and LSREF LODGING MERGER CO., INC., a Delaware corporation and an affiliate of Purchaser ("Merger Sub"). 

  

WITNESSETH: 

   

 A. The respective boards of directors or other governing body of Merger Sub, Purchaser and the Company deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders and/or interest holders that Purchaser acquire the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement. 

  

 B. The board of directors of the Company (the "Board") has unanimously approved this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company with the Company surviving (the "Merger"), and the Board has determined that such approval is sufficient to render inapplicable to this Agreement and the Merger the restrictions against the parties hereto engaging in any business combination as set forth in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), has determined that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and has resolved to recommend that the holders of the Companys issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock", with all of the outstanding shares of Common Stock being hereinafter referred to as the "Shares"), adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger. 

  

 C. The board of directors or other governing body of each of Purchaser and Merger Sub have each approved this Agreement and the Merger, all in accordance with the DGCL and, in each such case, upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 D. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and material inducement to Purchasers and Merger Subs willingness to enter into this Agreement, Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company and certain stockholders of the Company have entered into Voting Agreements (each a "Voting Agreement" and, collectively, the "Voting Agreements"). 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE I

 Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Merger shall be consummated in accordance with the DGCL. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease and the Company, as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"), shall continue its existence as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware. 

  

1.2. The Closing; Effective Time. 

   

 (a) The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Hunton and Williams LLP, 1445 Ross Avenue, Suite 3700, Dallas, Texas 75202, at 10:00 a.m. local time on a date to be specified by the parties, which date shall be no later than the second (2nd) Business Day after the date that all of the conditions to each partys obligations to effect the Merger have been satisfied or waived (if waivable) (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), unless another time, date or place is agreed upon in writing by the parties hereto. 

  

 (b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, on the Closing Date the parties shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger in accordance with the DGCL (the "Certificate of Merger") executed and acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in order to effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such other time as is agreed by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger. The time when the Merger shall become effective is herein referred to as the "Effective Time" and the date on which the Effective Time occurs is herein referred to as the "Closing Date". 

  

1.3. Effect of the Merger. 

   

 At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

1.4. Charter and Bylaws. 

   

 (a) _Charter_. At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of _Section 5.4_, the certificate of incorporation of the Company (the "Charter"), by virtue of the Merger, shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read substantially identically to the charter of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such amended and restated charter shall become the Charter of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the 

   ##### 

  

 

applicable provisions of the DGCL and such Charter; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that at the Effective Time the Charter of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended so that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Lodgian,
Inc." 

   

 (b) _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub (the "Bylaws"), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, the Charter of Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws. 

  

1.5. Directors and Officers. 

   

 (a) _Directors_. At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Charter and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until their death, resignation or removal. 

  

 (b) _Officers_. At the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Charter and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly appointed, or until their death, resignation or removal. 

  

1.6. Conversion of Securities. 

   

 At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any securities of Merger Sub or the Company: 

  

 (a) Each Share that is owned by Purchaser or Merger Sub, or that is owned by the Company as treasury stock, shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (b) Each issued and outstanding Share (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with  _Section 1.6(a)_ hereof and Dissenting Shares (as defined herein)) shall automatically be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the amount obtained by dividing (i) the product of $2.50 multiplied by the lesser of (A) 21,675,040 and (B) the total number of issued and outstanding Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 1.6(c)_ ) immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (ii) the total number of issued and outstanding Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 1.6(c)_) immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Merger Consideration") payable, without interest, to the holder of such Share upon surrender, in the manner provided in _Section 1.7_ hereof, of the certificate that formerly evidenced such Share. All such Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with _Section 1.7_ hereof. Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or 

   ##### 

  

 

other like change with respect to the Common Stock occurring after the date
hereof and prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (c) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

1.7. Payment for Certificates. 

   

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC (the "Exchange Agent") shall act as agent for the holders of the Shares (other than Shares held by Purchaser, the Company and any of their respective subsidiaries and Dissenting Shares) in connection with the Merger to receive in trust the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_ hereof. Purchaser shall deposit or cause to be deposited the aggregate Merger Consideration with the Exchange Agent on the Closing Date and such amounts shall not be used for any other purpose. The aggregate Merger Consideration shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Purchaser and all interest and other income resulting from such investment shall be paid to Purchaser. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record, as of the Effective Time, of a certificate or certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the "Certificates"), or non-certificated Shares represented by book entry ("Book-Entry Shares"), whose Shares were converted pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_ hereof into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon actual and proper delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Purchaser or the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration to be received by each stockholder. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Purchaser, together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash in respect of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other Taxes (as defined herein) required by reason of the issuance to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax (as defined herein) either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ 1.7, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to 

   ##### 

  

 

represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share
in cash upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share as
contemplated by _Section 1.6(b)_ hereof. 

   

 (c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares evidencing ownership of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article I_. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration or any dividends or other distributions payable to the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority), any such Merger Consideration, dividends or other distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Purchaser, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following the six-month anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, at its option, shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest or other income received with respect thereto) which had been made available to the Exchange Agent, and holders of Shares shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange Agent nor any of their respective directors, managers, officers, employees or agents shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate(s) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of an indemnity or bond in such sum as Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against any party hereto or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate(s), the Exchange Agent will disburse the Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section 1.7(b)_ payable in respect of the Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate(s). 

  

 (f) _Withholding Taxes_. Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Merger Consideration payable to a holder of Shares pursuant to the Merger any such amounts as are required under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so 

   ##### 

  

 

withheld by Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Company, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Company. 

   

1.8. Options. 

   

 (a) With respect to all outstanding options to purchase Shares (the "Company Options") granted under the Company Amended and Restated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan or otherwise (collectively, the "Company Option Plan"), whether or not then vested, at the Effective Time, each such Company Option shall be cancelled and be of no further force or effect, without payment of any form of consideration, and all of such holders rights under such Company Options shall terminate at the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) As of the Effective Time, except as provided in this _Section 1.8_ , all rights under any Company Option and any provision of the Company Option Plan and any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the securities of the Company shall be cancelled. The Company shall ensure that, as of and after the Effective Time, except as provided in this _Section 1.8_ , no person shall have any right (including, without limitation, any right to acquire any securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries) under the Company Option Plan or any other plan, program or arrangement with respect to securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary thereof. 

  

 (c) At or before the Effective Time, the Company shall cause to be effected any necessary amendments to the Company Option Plan and any other resolutions, consents or notices, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, required under the Company Option Plan or any Company Options to give effect to the foregoing provisions of this _Section 1.8_. 

  

1.9. Dissenting Shares. 

   

 Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time whose holder has not voted or consented in favor of the Merger and who has demanded and perfected such holders right to appraisal of such Shares in accordance with the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights ("Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration into which Shares are converted pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_ hereof, but the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if any holder of Shares who demands appraisal rights with respect to its Shares under the DGCL effectively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) its appraisal rights, then as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever later occurs, such holders Shares will automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in  _Section 1.6(b)_ hereof, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing such Shares, in the manner provided in  _Section 1.7_ hereof. The Company shall give Purchaser (i) prompt written notice of any demand or notice of intent to demand appraisal for any Shares, withdrawals of such notices, and any other instruments received by the Company in respect of Dissenting Shares, and (ii) the opportunity to 

   ##### 

  

 

participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal for Shares. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Purchaser, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal for Shares or offer to settle or settle any such
demands. 

   

1.10. Additional Actions. 

   

 If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of Merger Sub or the Company or otherwise to carry out this Agreement and the Merger, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Purchaser or Surviving Corporation, as applicable, or otherwise to carry out this Agreement and the Merger. Any such transfers or actions that occur pursuant to this _Section 1.10_ shall be deemed to have occurred immediately prior to or on the Closing Date. 

  

ARTICLE II

 The Company hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser and Merger Sub that, except (a) as set forth in the disclosure schedule, which sets forth certain disclosures concerning the Company, its subsidiaries and its and their business (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), and (b) as disclosed in the reports, statements and other documents filed by the Company with the SEC, in each case pursuant to the Exchange Act (other than any disclosures contained or referenced therein under the captions "Risk Factors", "Forward-Looking Statements", and "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk") in each case on or after December 31, 2007 and prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Recent SEC Reports") (it being understood that any matter disclosed in any Recent SEC Report shall be deemed to be disclosed in a section of the Company Disclosure Schedule only to the extent that it is readily apparent from the language of the disclosure itself in such Recent SEC Report that such disclosure is applicable to such section of the Company Disclosure Schedule, other than, in each case, any matters required to be disclosed for the purposes of  _Section 2.2_ (Capitalization), _Section 2.7_ (SEC Filings; Company Financial Statements), and _Section 2.8_ (Absence of Certain Changes), of this Agreement, which matters shall be specifically disclosed in _Sections_ _2.2_ , _2.7_ and _2.8_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, respectively, and not disclosed by reference to a Recent SEC Report), the statements contained in this _Article II_ are true and correct. 

  

2.1. Due Organization and Good Standing. 

   

 Each of the Company and its subsidiaries that own or lease real property is a corporation or other form of entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and 

   ##### 

  

 

operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted.
Each of the Companys subsidiaries that is not referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence is a corporation or other form of entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization and has all requisite power and authority to carry on its
business as now being conducted, except where the failure to be so existing
and in good standing or to have such power and authority could not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company
and its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the character of the property owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall mean any
fact, event, change, development, circumstance, effect or any combination of
the foregoing that, individually or in the aggregate, has or would reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial
condition, or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or the ability of the Company to consummate the Merger,
except for any such fact, event, change, development, circumstance, or effect
resulting from, arising out of or relating to (a) any change in or
interpretations of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"),
(b) any change in interest rates, or general market, political or
economic conditions, including financial, credit and securities markets
generally (which changes do not affect the Company and its subsidiaries to a
materially disproportionate degree compared to other businesses operating in
the same or similar industries), (c) any action taken by Purchaser,
Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates other than as contemplated
by this Agreement, (d) any weather-related or other force majeure event or
conditions arising out of acts of terrorism or war, including the escalation
thereof, (e) changes in accounting rules and regulations of the SEC or
any United States federal, state or local or any foreign Law, judgment or
decree (which changes do not affect the Company and its subsidiaries to a
materially disproportionate degree compared to other businesses operating in
the same or similar industries), (f) the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the announcement thereof, the performance of the Company of
its obligations hereunder or the pendency or consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (g) any loss of customers or employees by the Company or
any Company subsidiary, (h) the failure of the Company to meet any internal
or published projection, forecasts or estimates of revenues or earnings or
published industry analyst expectations of financial performance (it being
understood that this exception, as it relates to this _clause (h)_ , shall
not exclude any underlying fact, event, change, development, circumstance,
effect of any combination of the foregoing which resulted in the failure of
the Company to meet any internal or published projection, forecasts or
estimates of revenues or earnings or published industry analyst expectations
of financial performance), or (i) any taking of action at the written request
of Purchaser or Merger Sub; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding
anything else contained in this Agreement, the occurrence of any fact, event,
act, omission, change, development, circumstance, effect or any combination
of the foregoing that results, or would reasonably be expected to result, in
any of the Goldman Sachs loan, the IXIS Portfolio loan, the IXIS  Holiday Inn
Hilton Head, the Merrill Lynch Fixed Rate #1 loan, the Merrill Lynch Fixed
Rate #3 loan, the Merrill Lynch Fixed Rate #4 loan, the Wachovia Bank
- Worcester loan, the Wachovia Bank  Palm Desert loan, the Wachovia Bank 

   ##### 

  

   

full recourse liability of the Company pursuant to that certain Full Recourse
Guaranty dated July 1, 2009, executed by the Company in favor of Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A., as Trustee for the Registered Holders of Merrill Lynch Mortgage
Trust 2005-CKI1, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series
2005-CKI1 relating to the Merrill Lynch Fixed Rate #4 loan), or to any of its
subsidiaries that are currently not obligated with respect to such
Indebtedness shall be deemed to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect. 

   

2.2. Capitalization. 

   

 (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 60,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Preferred Stock" and, together with the Common Stock, the "Company Capital Stock"). As of the date hereof, (i) 21,675,040 shares of Common Stock are issued and outstanding, (ii) no shares of Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, (iii) 141,083 shares of Common Stock are subject to outstanding Company Options (which are not reflected in clause (a)(i)) and (iv) 353,790 shares of Restricted Stock (which are reflected in clause (a)(i)) are issued and outstanding. All of the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock are, and all shares of Company Capital Stock which may be issued pursuant to the exercise of outstanding Company Options will be, when issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. None of the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock have been issued in violation of any applicable Laws or in violation of any purchase option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right. Except as set forth above or in _Section_ 2.3 below, as of the date hereof, no shares of voting or non-voting capital stock, other equity interests, or other voting securities of the Company or its subsidiaries are issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. All outstanding Company Options were granted under the Company Option Plan. The exercise price of each outstanding Company Option is greater than $2.50. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has issued any Company Option where, as of the date the Company Option was granted, the exercise price of the Company Option was less than the fair market value of the stock subject to such Company Option on the date of the grant, as determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Option Plan and Code Section 409A. There are no stock-appreciation rights, stock-based performance units, "phantom" stock rights, restricted stock awards or agreements, or other agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character (contingent or otherwise), (i) pursuant to which any person is or may be entitled to receive any payment or other value based on the revenues, earnings or performance (financial or otherwise), stock price performance or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or calculated in accordance therewith or (ii) which would cause the Company or any of its subsidiaries to file a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") or would otherwise require the registration of any securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 

  

 (b) There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having voting rights or debt convertible into securities having such rights ("Voting Debt"). Except for the Company Options, there are no options, warrants, calls, subscriptions or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character, relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the Company or any of its subsidiaries obligating the Company or any of its subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell or cause to be issued, transferred, sold or 

   ##### 

  

 

repurchased any options or shares of capital stock or Voting Debt of, or
other equity interest in, the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or
equity interests, or obligating the Company or any of its subsidiaries to
grant, extend or enter into any option, warrant, call, subscription or other
right, agreement, arrangement or commitment and (ii) there are no outstanding
contractual obligations or other commitments of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company Capital
Stock, or other capital stock of, or equity interests in, the Company or any
of its subsidiaries or to provide funds to make any investment (in the form
of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any other entity. 

   

 (c) There are no voting trusts, voting agreements or other agreements or understandings to which the Company is a party with respect to the voting of the Company Capital Stock. 

  

2.3. Subsidiaries. 

   

 _Section 2.3_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains an organizational chart of the Company and all subsidiaries of the Company, which is materially true and correct. Other than as set forth on such organizational chart, each subsidiary is wholly-owned by the Company or one or more of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All of the capital stock and other equity interests of the subsidiaries so held are owned (directly or indirectly) by the Company free and clear of any liens, claims, pledges, mortgages, security interests, charges, restrictions or encumbrances of any kind or nature whatsoever. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock, or other equity interests, in each of the subsidiaries held by the Company or one or more of its wholly-owned subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and were issued free of preemptive rights and in compliance with applicable Laws. No equity securities or other interests of any of the subsidiaries are or may become required to be issued or purchased by reason of any options, warrants, rights to subscribe to, puts, calls or commitments of any character whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights convertible into or exchangeable for, shares of any capital stock of, or other equity interests in, any subsidiary, and there are no contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which any subsidiary is bound to issue additional shares of its capital stock or other equity interests, or options, warrants or rights to purchase or acquire any additional shares of its capital stock or other equity interests or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or interests. 

  

2.4. Authorization; Binding Agreement. 

   

 (a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and, subject to the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company and the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL, to consummate the Merger. No other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of, and performance of its obligations under, this Agreement or to consummate the Merger, other than the Company Stockholder Approval (as defined herein) and the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its 

   ##### 

  

 

terms, except to the extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and by principles of
equity regarding the availability of remedies ("Enforceability
Exceptions"). 

   

 (b) The Board, at a duly held special meeting, has by unanimous vote of those directors present (who constitute 100% of the directors then in office duly elected) (i) determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated herein are fair to, and in the best interests, of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved, authorized and declared advisable this Agreement and approved and authorized the Merger, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement 

  

 (c) Assuming the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in  _Section 3.10_ are accurate, the Board has taken all actions necessary and advisable so that the restrictions contained in Section 203 of the DGCL are inapplicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreements and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated herein and therein. The Company has taken all necessary action so that no stockholder rights plan applicable to the Company and, to the knowledge of the Company, no other anti-takeover, "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or similar Law or similar provision in the Charter or the Bylaws is applicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreements, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated herein or therein.

approvals required under, the rules and regulations of the NYSE Amex Equities
("AMEX"), and (h) those Consents that, if they were not obtained or made,
could not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect. 

   

2.6. No Violations. 

   

 The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger and the compliance by the Company and its subsidiaries with any of the provisions hereof will not (a) conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of the Charter or Bylaws or other governing instruments of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (b) require any Consent under or result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration) under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Company Material Contract (as defined herein) or Company Material Permit, to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their assets are bound, (c) result in the creation or imposition of any liens, charges, security interests, options, claims, mortgages, pledges, assessments, adverse claims, or restrictions (whether on voting, sale, transfer, disposition or otherwise) or other encumbrances or restrictions of any nature whatsoever, whether imposed by agreement, understanding, Law or equity, or any conditional sale contract, title retention contract or other contract to give or refrain from giving any of the foregoing (collectively, "Encumbrances") upon any of the assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (d) subject to obtaining the Consents from Governmental Authorities referred to in _Section 2.5_ hereof and, solely with respect to the consummation of the Merger, subject to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL, contravene any applicable provision of any Law to which the Company, any of its subsidiaries, or any of their respective assets or properties is subject; except, with respect to _clauses (b)_ ,  _(c)_ and _(d)_ , for any such conflicts, Consents, violations, breaches, defaults, Encumbrances or other occurrences which have not had, and could not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 (a) The Company has timely filed all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents required to be filed by the Company with the SEC since January 1, 2007 under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. All such required forms, reports and documents filed by the Company with the SEC (including those that the Company may file subsequent to the date hereof), as have been, or will be, amended since the time of their filing, are referred to herein as the "Company SEC Reports". As of their respective filing dates (or if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date hereof, then on the date of such later filing), the Company SEC Reports (i) complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Reports and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

No such notice to Purchaser shall have any effect on the determination of whether any of the conditions to the Merger have been satisfied or in determining whether any of the representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement have been breached. 

   ##### 

  

  

4.3. Access and Information. 

   

 (a) Between the date of this Agreement and the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ and the Effective Time, upon reasonable prior notice, the Company will give, and shall direct its and its subsidiaries officers, employees, agents, consultants, investment bankers, auditors, accountants, legal counsel and other representatives to give, Purchaser and its authorized representatives (including, without limitation, its financial advisors, accountants, environmental consultants, and legal counsel) (collectively, "Representatives"), at all reasonable times, access as reasonably requested to all personnel, offices, properties and other facilities, and to all data, information, documents, contracts, agreements, commitments, books and records (including work papers) of or pertaining to the Company and any of its subsidiaries, will permit the foregoing to make such reasonable inspections as they may require and, without limiting the foregoing, will furnish Purchaser, as soon as reasonably practicable, with (i) monthly unaudited consolidated statements of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries as of each month then ended and related balance sheet, in the Companys standard format, excluding footnotes thereto (other than footnotes that address the areas addressed in footnotes 5, 7, 8 and 11 to the financial statements contained in the Companys Form 10-Q filed for the period ended September 30, 2009, which footnotes may be in summary form), (ii) any monthly Hotelligence or STR reports received by the Company or any of its subsidiaries and (iii) such other financial and operating data and other information with respect to the business and properties of the Company and any of its subsidiaries as Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request. No such access, inspections or furnishing of information shall have any effect on Purchaser or Merger Subs ability to assert that conditions to Closing or to the consummation of the Merger have not been satisfied. Other than as set forth on _Section 4.3(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Purchaser, Merger Sub or any of their counsel, environmental consultants, investment bankers, financial sources, lenders or other representatives will, prior to Closing Date, conduct any on-site environmental site activities of any type, including the conduct of Phase I or Phase II environmental site assessments, monitoring or invasive sampling of soil, groundwater, air, any other environmental media, or building materials or equipment, pertaining to Environmental Laws or Hazardous Materials and relating to the Company Real Property, or contact any relevant environmental agency. Without the prior consent of the Companys Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), none of Purchaser, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives will contact any employee of the Company or its subsidiaries. 

  

 (b) Between the date of this Agreement and the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ and the Effective Time, subject to any limitations set forth in _Section 4.3(a)_, the Company shall provide such information as is reasonably requested by Purchaser, and shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser, to enable Purchaser to determine the current and accumulated earnings and profits of the Company and each of its subsidiaries for federal income tax purposes. 

  

 (c) The Company shall in good faith cooperate with Purchaser (including, without limitation, by attending meetings, providing information, making personnel available and taking such other commercially reasonable actions as Purchaser may request) in connection with obtaining such assignments, consents to change of control, licenses, franchises, or 

   ##### 

  

 

terminations from the Franchisors as Purchaser may reasonably request in
connection with Purchasers actions contemplated by _Section 5.7_. 

   

 (d) All information obtained by Purchaser or its Representatives pursuant to this _Section 4.3_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the terms of the letter agreement dated as of July 31, 2009 (as amended) between the Company and Purchaser (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). 

  

4.4. Proxy Statement; Company Recommendation. 

   

 (a) The Company and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement. As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (and, in any event, within 30 calendar days), the Company shall prepare and file the preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC. The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide Purchaser with copies of any written comments, and shall inform Purchaser in detail of any oral comments, received from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall provide Purchaser and its counsel the reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the preliminary and final Proxy Statement and all amendments and supplements thereto, and on any proposed response to any comments of the SEC staff, and the Company shall take into good faith consideration all of Purchasers reasonable changes, additions or deletions to each version of or amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement and to any such response to a comment of the SEC staff. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable. As promptly as practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement (which, subject to _Section 4.4(b)_ and _Section 4.8_, shall include the Company Recommendation) to be filed with the SEC and mailed to the Companys stockholders of record as of the record date established by the Board. The Company will advise Purchaser, promptly after being advised thereof, of any request by the SEC for any amendment of or supplement to the Proxy Statement. The Company, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Company shall cause the Proxy Statement, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and, if any such correction is made following the mailing of the Proxy Statement as provided in this _Section 4.4(a)_, mailed to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act or the SEC (or its staff). 

  

 (b) The Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and its Charter and Bylaws, as promptly as reasonably practicable, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Special Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders. Subject to the duties of the Board under applicable Law, the Company shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger and will use commercially reasonable efforts to take all other actions necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its stockholders in compliance with the rules of the AMEX, the DGCL and all other applicable Laws, and (ii) subject to the provisions of this _Section 4.4(b)_ and _Section 4.8_, include in the Proxy Statement the unanimous recommendation of the Board that the stockholders of the 

   ##### 

  

 

Company adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger (the "Company
Recommendation"). At any time before the Company Stockholder Approval has
been obtained, the Company Recommendation may be withdrawn or modified (other
than in connection with a Company Takeover Proposal, which the parties agree
shall be governed exclusively by _Section 4.8_) only if the Board determines
in good faith, after taking into account the advice of the Companys outside
legal counsel, that the failure to withdraw or modify the Company
Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law, but only after (A) providing
written notice to Purchaser that the Board is prepared to make such
withdrawal or modification of the Company Recommendation permitted by this
_Section 4.4(b)_ and setting forth in reasonable detail the reasons therefor
and (B) for a period of five Business Days after providing such notice (or
such shorter period (but not less than 48 hours) as set forth in such notice
that the Board determines in good faith is required under applicable Law in
light of the circumstances surrounding such proposed withdrawal or
modification), the Company negotiates in good faith with Purchaser
(if Purchaser so desires) to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Merger as would enable the Board to
proceed with the Company Recommendation, and at the end of such period the
Board maintains its determination permitted by this _Section 4.4(b)_
(after taking into account any proposed adjustments made by Purchaser) that
the failure to withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation is still
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law. The Company may, after consultation with Purchaser, postpone
or adjourn the Special Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement required by Law is provided to
the Companys stockholders or, if as of the time for which the Special
Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of
Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute
a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Special Meeting. The
obligations of the Company to file and mail the Proxy Statement and hold the
Special Meeting pursuant to this _Section 4.4_ shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or other communication to the
Company or any other person of any Company Takeover Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be required to hold the Special
Meeting or file or mail the Proxy Statement if this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with _Section 7.1_ before that meeting is held or before the
Proxy Statement is filed or mailed. 

   

4.5. Commercially Reasonable Efforts. 

   

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, including _Section 4.8_ of this Agreement, the Company agrees to, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the Merger, including, but not limited to: (a) as promptly as practicable, obtaining all Consents from Governmental Authorities for which the Company or any of its subsidiaries would need to obtain consent required for the consummation of the Merger (provided that the Company shall not make any payment or amend the terms of any agreement in connection with obtaining any such Consent without the prior written approval of Purchaser), and (b) obtaining all Consents and delivering all notifications required by the terms of any Company Material Contract or Company Material Permit in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger so as to maintain and preserve the benefits under all such agreements and permits as of the Effective Time. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions 

   ##### 

  

 

hereof, the Company agrees to, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to satisfy the
conditions to the consummation of the Merger to be satisfied by
the Company. 

   

 (b) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have any Law or injunction (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by any court or other Governmental Authority, which makes illegal, prohibits or prevents the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and which has not been vacated, dismissed or withdrawn prior to the Closing Date of the foregoing, vacated, dismissed or withdrawn by the Closing Date. 

  

4.6. Public Announcements. 

   

 The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a joint press release approved by Purchaser and the Company. Between the date of this Agreement and the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ and the Effective Time, the Company shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to, (a) issue or cause the publication of any press release or any other announcement or communication with respect to this Agreement or the Merger without the prior written consent of Purchaser, or (b) discuss with the press or the media this Agreement or the Merger (and will refer any and all questions and inquiries concerning Purchaser or its affiliates to Purchaser), except in any case under (a) or (b) above to the extent that such release, announcement, communication or discussion is required by applicable Law or Governmental Authority and in such cases only after consultation with Purchaser and considering in good faith any modifications to such release, announcement, communication or discussion reasonably requested by Purchaser. 

  

4.7. Compliance. 

   

 In consummating the Merger, the Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, comply with the provisions of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, the DGCL and all other material applicable Laws. 

  

4.8. No Solicitation. 

   

 (a) For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Takeover Proposal" means (other than the Merger) any inquiry, proposal or offer, whether in one transaction or a series of transactions, relating to (1) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of assets of the Company representing 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, including by way of the purchase of stock or other equity interests of subsidiaries of the Company, (2) any issuance, sale or other disposition of (including by way of merger, consolidation, business combination, share exchange, recapitalization, joint venture, partnership or any similar transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or more of the voting power or economic interests of the Company, (3) any tender offer, exchange offer, stock purchase or other transaction in which, if consummated, any person or "group" (as such term is defined under the Exchange Act) shall acquire beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in 

   ##### 

  

 

Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), or the right to acquire beneficial
ownership, of 20% or more of the voting power or economic interests of the
Company, or (4) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation or
dissolution involving the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Company
Superior Offer" means a Company Takeover Proposal (but replacing references
to "20% or more" with "50% or more") on terms that the Board determines, in
good faith, based upon consultations with its outside legal counsel and
its financial advisors, are more favorable from a financial point of view to
the Companys stockholders than this Agreement and the Merger, taken as a
whole, after giving effect to any proposed adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement by Purchaser in response to such
Company Takeover Proposal, and which is reasonably likely to be consummated,
taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects and the
estimated timing, risks and probability of the consummation of, and the
conditions to, such Company Superior Offer and the person making the Company
Superior Offer, and for which financing, if a cash transaction (whether in
whole or in part), is then fully committed or reasonably determined by the
Board to be readily available. 

   

 (b) Except as set forth in this _Section 4.8_, the Company shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries to not, directly or indirectly, and the Company shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries to not, directly or indirectly, authorize or permit any of its or their officers, directors, employees, agents, consultants, investment bankers, lawyers, accountants, agents and other representatives of the Company to, (i) solicit, knowingly encourage, initiate or knowingly facilitate the making, submission or announcement of any Company Takeover Proposal, (ii) furnish any non-public information regarding the Company or its subsidiaries to any person (other than Purchaser, Merger Sub or their representatives) in connection with or in response to a Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that reasonably could be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that reasonably could be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal, (iv) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation, except other than in connection with a Company Takeover Proposal or to the extent permitted by _Section 4.4_, (v) endorse, approve or recommend, or propose publicly to endorse, approve or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal, or (vi) cause the Company to discuss, negotiate or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (whether binding or not) related to any Company Takeover Proposal or requiring the Company to abandon or terminate this Agreement or to fail to consummate the Merger. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 4.8(b)_, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or limit the Company, or the Board, prior to the date of the Special Meeting, from furnishing non-public information regarding the Company to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any person in response to an unsolicited, bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal, that did not result from a breach of _Section 4.8_, that the Board believes in good faith (after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors) is, or could reasonably be expected to be, a Company Superior Offer if (i) the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such action with respect to such Company Takeover Proposal is necessary for the Board to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, (ii) the Company receives from such person an executed confidentiality agreement with provisions no less favorable, in the aggregate, to the 

   ##### 

  

 

Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and (iii)
contemporaneously with furnishing any such information to such person, the
Company furnishes such information to Purchaser to the extent such
information has not been previously furnished to Purchaser. 

   

 (d) The Company shall notify Purchaser as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt) of the receipt by the Company, or any of its representatives, of any bona fide inquiries, proposals or offers, requests for information or requests for discussions or negotiations regarding any Company Takeover Proposal or that could reasonably be expected to result in a Company Takeover Proposal, specifying the terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the person or group making such inquiry, proposal, offer or request. The Company shall promptly keep Purchaser informed on a current basis of the status of any discussions or negotiations and of any modifications to such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiries, proposals, offers or requests for information. Except to the extent the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such action is necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, the Company agrees that it shall not terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any standstill, confidentiality or non-solicitation agreement to which it is a party and that relates to a Company Takeover Proposal, and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the provisions of any such agreement (provided that if the Company waives, amends or otherwise does not enforce any standstill provisions in any such agreement, then Purchaser shall be relieved of compliance with the Confidentiality Agreements standstill provisions). The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any third parties that may be ongoing with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal as of the date hereof and shall inform its representatives of the obligations undertaken in this _Section 4.8_. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including _Section 4.8(b)_ , the Board may, at any time prior to the date of the Special Meeting: (i) withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation or (ii) terminate this Agreement and approve or recommend a Company Superior Offer if, in the case of both _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ above: (x) the Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal not in breach of this  _Section 4.8_; (y) the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, that such offer constitutes a Company Superior Offer; and (z) following consultation with outside legal counsel, the Board determines in good faith that the failure to withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; but only, in the case of both _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ above, (A) after providing written notice to Purchaser (a "Notice of Superior Offer") that shall (1) specify the material terms and conditions of the Company Superior Offer and the identity of the person or group making the Company Superior Offer, (2) state that the Board intends to withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation and that the Company intends to terminate this Agreement to enter into such Company Superior Offer and (3) be accompanied by a copy of the draft of the definitive agreement proposed to be entered into with respect to the Company Superior Offer; (B) during the five-day period following delivery of the Notice of Superior Offer, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate in good faith with Purchaser (if Purchaser so desires) and provide Purchaser with a reasonable opportunity to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that the Company Takeover Proposal would no longer 

   ##### 

  

 

constitute a Company Superior Offer and/or the Board could proceed with the
Company Recommendation (it being agreed that any subsequent material
amendment or material revision (including any change in price or form of
consideration or in financing, which, in each case, shall be deemed to be
material) to such Company Superior Offer shall require the Company to deliver
to Purchaser a new Notice of Superior Offer and result in an additional
three-Business Day period from the date of receipt of any such material
amendment or material revision during which the Company shall negotiate in
good faith with Purchaser); and (C) following such period, the Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and after
taking into account any such adjustments proposed by Purchaser, that the
Company Takeover Proposal remains a Company Superior Offer and that the
failure to withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board to the stockholders of

8.10. Entire Agreement. 

   

 This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the documents or instruments referred to herein, including, but not limited to, the Company Disclosure Schedule referred to herein, which Company Disclosure Schedule is incorporated herein by reference, embody the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, understandings or undertakings among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof other than those expressly set forth or referred to herein. This Agreement supersedes all prior restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, understandings or undertakings between the parties with respect to such subject matter. 

  

8.11. Severability. 

   

 In case any provision in this Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in a jurisdiction, such provision shall be modified or deleted, as to the jurisdiction involved, only to the extent necessary to render the same valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby nor shall the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision be affected thereby in any other jurisdiction. 

  

8.12. Specific Performance; Remedies. 

   

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 7.3_, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon Purchaser or Merger Sub will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity, upon Purchaser or Merger Sub, and the exercise by Purchaser or Merger Sub of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Companys exclusive remedy is as provided in _Section 8.12(c)_ and _Section 8.12(d)_ below, and the Company shall have no other remedies hereunder, or at law or in equity, except as provided in _Section 8.12(c)_ and _Section 8.12(d)_ below. 

  

 (b) The parties hereto agree that an award of money damages would be inadequate for any breach of this Agreement and that any such breach would cause the non-breaching party irreparable harm. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by one of the parties, the non-breaching party will be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, and the parties hereto shall not object to the granting of injunctive or other equitable relief on the basis that there exists an adequate remedy at law. 

  

 (c) Except as provided in _Section 8.12(d)_ below, the Company agrees that specific performance shall be its exclusive remedy for breach by Purchaser or Merger Sub of this Agreement or any guarantee entered into in connection herewith. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Company is not entitled to an award of specific performance to remedy a breach of this Agreement by Purchaser or Merger Sub, then the Company may be awarded any other remedy available to it at law or in equity, including monetary damages (which the parties agree may not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs and, to the extent proven, may be determined by reference to the amount, if any, that would have been recoverable by the Company Stockholders if such Company Stockholders were entitled to bring an action against Purchaser). Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the collective damages payable by Purchaser, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates, for breaches under this Agreement or any guarantee entered into in connection herewith exceed $20,000,000 in the aggregate for all such breaches. If a court of competent jurisdiction enters a judgment awarding the Company damages for such alleged breach, the parties hereto agree that (i) if such judgment is entered within 60 days of the Company filing suit, then within five days following such determination Purchaser and Merger Sub may elect to and may consummate the Merger (in accordance with Article II of this Agreement) and the parties shall promptly jointly request such judgment be set aside, provided that if Purchaser and Merger Sub do not so elect to consummate the Merger or do not consummate the Merger with such five days, then the Company may enforce such judgment, and (ii) if such judgment is entered later than 60 days after the Company files suit, then (A) the Company may enforce such judgment, or, (B) if Purchaser and Merger Sub desire to consummate the Merger in accordance with Article II of this Agreement and the Company consents (such consent to be in the sole and absolute discretion of the Company) to such consummation at such time, the parties may consummate the Merger and the parties shall promptly jointly request such judgment be set aside. 

  

8.13. Attorneys Fees. 

   

 If any legal action or any arbitration is brought for the enforcement of this Agreement or because of an alleged dispute, controversy, breach or default in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs and expenses incurred in that action or proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled. 

  

8.14. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. 

   

 Nothing contained in this Agreement or in any instrument or document executed by any party in connection with the Merger shall create any rights in, or be deemed to have been executed for the benefit of, any person or entity that is not a party hereto or thereto or a successor or permitted assign of such a party, and any third-party beneficiary is hereby disclaimed, except, following the Effective Time, to the extent provided in _Section 5.4_. 

  

8.15. Company Disclosure Schedule References. 

   

 The parties hereto agree that the disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in the corresponding section or subsection of this Agreement, and (b) any other representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the 

   ##### 

  

 

Company that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this _clause
(b)_ only if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) is readily apparent from the language of the
Disclosure Schedule itself. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an
exception to a representation or warranty will not be deemed an admission
that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect.
