to Section 4.2(i) in the Liko North American Transaction Agreement do not

Owners, or  
      
    | (iv)  |   | to the extent a misrepresentation or breach of
representation or warranty disclosed in the Closing Disclosure Letter has
resulted from or arisen out of (i) the announcement of the transactions
contemplated hereby or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby being pending, (ii) changes in economic, regulatory or political
conditions generally, (iii) changes in applicable Legal Requirements (other

     8.2.2  |   | Notwithstanding Section 8.2.1, none of the

  8.3.1  |   | Save as provided for in Section 8.3.2 below, but absent
fraud (including the provisions 30 and 33 set forth in the Swedish Contract
Act ( _Sw: Lag (1915:218) om avtal och andra r attshandlingar pa

42      

     8.4  |   | _Notice of Breach_   
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Without prejudice to Subsection 8.5 (i) below, the Purchaser
shall provide the Seller with a notice in writing within thirty (30) days
after the date when the Purchaser became aware of any misrepresentation or
breach of representation or warranty, even though the full scope of such
misrepresentation or breach of representation or warranty or a quantification
of the amount of damages suffered cannot be determined at such date. The
written notice shall be accompanied by reasonable particulars
thereof specifying the nature of the misrepresentation or breach giving rise
to the claim and, so far as practicable, the amount claimed in respect
thereof. Any failure by the Purchaser to comply with the foregoing provisions
shall not relieve the Seller or the Founders of their obligations hereunder
or pursuant to the Founder Undertaking, except to the extent a failure to
provide timely or adequate notice pursuant to this Section shall have
adversely prejudiced the Seller or if such failure is wilful (provided
that if Purchaser is aware of only some, but not all, of the information it
would need to reasonably become aware of any misrepresentation or breach of
representation or warranty, the failure to provide notice hereunder shall not
be deemed to be wilful).  
      
  8.5  |   | _Third Party Claims_   
      
    |   | Upon the Purchaser becoming aware of any third party claim
(including Tax claims), action or demand, or any matter likely to give rise
to a third party claim, for which the Seller, or the Founders may have
liability hereunder or pursuant to the Founder Undertaking, the Purchaser
shall:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no
event no later than thirty (30) days the Purchaser so becoming aware, give
written notice thereof to the Seller;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | not make any admission of liability, agreement,
settlement or compromise with any third party in relation to any such claim
or adjudication, without obtaining the prior written consent of the Seller;  
      
    | (iii)  |   | take such action as the Seller may reasonably request
to avoid dispute, or resist, appeal, compromise or defend a claim, provided,
however, that the Purchaser shall not, and shall procure that the Companies
shall not, accept or pay or compromise or make any submission in respect of
such claims, without the Sellers prior consent thereto;  
      
    | (iv)  |   | give the Seller or its duly authorised representatives
reasonable access to the personnel of the Purchaser and the Companies and to
any relevant premises, accounts, documents and records within their
respective power and allow the Seller and its duly authorised representatives
to take copies thereof, all to enable the Seller or its duly authorised
representatives to examine the grounds for and merits  ##### 

 

 

43  

       |   |   | of such claim; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (v)  |   | at the Sellers request allow the Seller to handle any
negotiation, dispute or litigation relating thereto with any third party and
grant the Seller all authorisations and all assistance as the Seller may
reasonably require to enable the Seller to defend any claim and to properly
conduct any litigation resulting therefrom.  
   

   

The Sellers prior consent as a condition to any settlement or compromise of a
third party claim and the Sellers right to handle, dispute and defend a
third party claim shall be subject to the Seller and the Founders
acknowledging in writing their liability to the Purchaser in respect thereof.
Further, the Seller shall not have the right to dispute and defend a third
party claim that relates to matters involving Taxes or regulatory affairs or
quality systems; provided, however, that the Seller shall be entitled to all
material information regarding such claim and shall be entitled, at its own
cost and expense, to participate in the defence of such matters and to
employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose. The fees and expenses
of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Seller. When disputing and
defending a third party claim, the Seller shall not make any admission of
liability and not settle or compromise such third party claim without
obtaining the Purchasers prior written consent. 

   

Any failure by the Purchaser to comply with the foregoing provisions shall not
relieve the Seller or the Founders of their obligations hereunder or pursuant
to the Founder Undertaking, except to the extent a failure to provide timely
or adequate notice pursuant to this Section shall have adversely prejudiced
the Seller or if such failure is wilful (provided that if Purchaser is aware
of only some, but not all, of the information it would need to reasonably
become aware of any misrepresentation or breach of representation or
warranty, the failure to provide notice hereunder shall not be deemed to be
wilful). 

   

Further, the Seller shall be entitled to defend and dispute the claims being
the subject matter of Specific Matters I and Specific Matters II, and in so
doing shall be granted all authorisations and all assistance as the Seller
may reasonably require to enable the Seller to defend and dispute and conduct
any litigation resulting therefrom. When defending and disputing such claims,
the Seller shall not settle or compromise any such claim without obtaining
the Purchasers prior written consent if the settlement or compromise does
not release the Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Companies) from
all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim or if the
settlement or compromise imposes injunctive or other equitable relief or can
reasonably be expected to result in allegations of criminal violations or
proceedings against the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the
Companies). The Purchaser shall be entitled, at its own cost and expense, to
participate in the defence of such claims and to employ separate counsel of
its choice for such purpose. The fees and expenses of such separate counsel
shall be paid by the Purchaser. 

  

     8.6  |   | _Mitigation, Double Recovery, Insurance Proceeds, etc._
  
---|---|--- ##### 

 

 

44  

     

  

     8.6.1  |   | The Purchaser shall take commercially reasonable
actions to mitigate any damage suffered by it or any of the Companies in
respect of which a claim could be made under this Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
      
  8.6.2  |   | The Purchaser shall refund to the Seller the net amount of
any payment which the Seller has made to the Purchaser pursuant to any claim
under this Agreement and which the Purchaser or any of the Companies recovers
from any third party, net of any costs of recovery incurred by the
Purchaser.  
      
  8.6.3  |   | If, in respect of any matter which would give rise to a
claim under this Agreement, the Purchaser or the Liko North American
Purchaser has previously recovered an amount of damages related to such claim
from a Founder under any of the Founder Undertakings, then the
Purchaser shall be precluded from recovering the same amount of damages for
the same matter from the Seller; provided, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Purchaser shall not be precluded from seeking an amount of
damages related to any separate matter which they have not previously
recovered hereunder or any other amount of damages with respect to such
matter.  
      
  8.6.4  |   | The Seller shall not be liable for any claim under this
Agreement to the extent that the subject of the claim has been or is made
good or is otherwise compensated (net of any costs of recovery incurred by
the Purchaser).  
      
  8.6.5  |   | The amount of any damages payable under this Section 8
shall be reduced by any amount actually received (net of any costs of
recovery) by the Purchaser with respect thereto under any policy of insurance
protection (or that would have been so received had the Purchaser or any of
the Companies maintained in force insurance protection corresponding to the
insurance protection held by the Company at Closing). Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under such
insurance coverage and from such other party (other than any Founder or other
member of their respective Families) alleged to have responsibility. If the
Purchaser receives an amount under insurance coverage or from the Seller or
the Founders pursuant to this Section 8, then the Purchaser shall promptly
reimburse the Seller or the Founders up to such amount received by the
Purchaser, but net of any expenses incurred by the Purchaser in collecting
such amount.  
      
  8.6.6  |   | The Seller and the Founders shall have no liability
hereunder or pursuant to the Founder Undertaking in respect of any damage (or
any amount thereof) if and to the extent that such damage would not have
arisen but for an act, omission or transaction carried out by Purchaser, or
persons deriving title from the Purchaser, after the Closing and after the
Purchaser having become aware of the misrepresentation or breach of
representation or warranty.  
      
  8.7  |   | _Changes in Law_   
      
    |   | In addition to what is otherwise expressed in this Agreement,
no claim under  ##### 

 

 

45  

     |   | this Agreement shall be brought by the Purchaser against the
Seller or any Founder, if and to the extent that such claim occurs as a
result of any Legal Requirement not in force or any practice of any
authorities not being established practice at the Closing Date or which takes
effect retroactively after the Closing Date, or occurs as a result of any
increase in the rate of tax in force at the Closing Date or any change in the
practice of the relevant Tax authorities.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     8.8  |   | _Other Remedies_   
---|---|--- 
      
  8.8.1  |   | Save for fraud (including the provisions 30 and 33 set
forth in the Swedish Contract Act ( _Sw: Lag (1915:218) om avtal och andra r
attshandlingar pa formogenhetsrattens omrade_)), the Seller or the Founders
shall not be liable hereunder or pursuant to the Founder Undertaking
in respect of any implied warranty or representation under any statute
(including but not limited to the Swedish Sale of Goods Act ( _Sw: k oplagen
1990:931_) as amended) or legal principle or otherwise arising out of, or in
connection with, the transactions hereunder, except where the same is
expressly contained in this Agreement and the Purchaser confirms that it has
not relied on any warranty or representation under any statute (including but
not limited to the Swedish Sale of Goods Act as amended) or legal principle
which is not expressly contained in this Agreement.  
      
  8.8.2  |   | Save for fraud (including the provisions 30 and 33 set
forth in the Swedish Contract Act ( _Sw: Lag (1915:218) om avtal och andra r
attshandlingar pa formogenhetsrattens omrade_)), the remedies provided to the
Purchaser in this Agreement shall be exclusive and hence it is specifically
agreed that no remedy whatsoever under the Swedish Sale of Goods Act (as
amended) or under any other statute or legal principle, including (but not
limited to) any cancellation, termination or rescission of this Agreement,
shall be available to the Purchaser.  
      
  9.  |   | REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASER  
      
    |   | The Purchaser represents and warrants to the Seller and the
Founders that the following statements are true and correct on the Closing
Date.

  9.2  |   | The Purchaser has full power and authority to purchase and
own the Shares and to perform its other obligations under this Agreement.  
      
  9.3  |   | The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not conflict with any agreement to which the Purchaser is a
party or applicable law or the articles of association of the Purchaser and
is enforceable against the Purchaser in accordance with its terms.  ##### 

 

 

46  

     

  

     9.4  |   | The consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not result in the breach of any term or provision of or
constitute a default under any judgement, decree, mortgage or other agreement
or instrument to which the Purchaser is a party or by which it is bound. The
Purchaser is not in default with respect to any agreement or instrument
evidencing indebtedness or in the performance, observance or fulfilment of
any covenant or conditions in relation hereto which default has a material
adverse effect on the Purchasers ability to fulfil its obligations under
this Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
      
  9.5  |   | There is no pending or, to the Purchasers actual knowledge,
threatened Proceeding:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | that challenges, or that may have the effect or
preventing, delaying, making illegal or otherwise interfering with any of the
transactions contemplated herein; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | to the Purchasers knowledge, no event has occurred or
circumstance exists that is reasonably likely to give rise to or serve as a
basis for the commencement of any such Proceeding.  
   

  

     9.6  |   | The Purchaser is not aware of any misrepresentation or
breach of representation or warranty under Section 7 or any other breach by
the Seller of this Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
      
  9.7  |   | If one or more of the representations or warranties provided
by the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 9, is/are incorrect, or if the
Purchaser commits another breach of contract, the Purchaser shall in its sole
discretion, either (i) cure or restore, within a reasonable period but at the
latest within (6) weeks after the receipt of a notification, the situation or
(ii) pay damage compensation to the Founders and the Seller, provided,
however, that (x) the option to cure or restore shall only be available in
respect of a breach of representation or warranty and only to the extent the
breach and the consequences thereof can reasonably be expected to be cured or
restored with no subsisting effect to the Founders, the Seller or any of
their Affiliates, and (y) an attempt by the Purchaser to cure and restore
(whether or not successful) a misrepresentation or breach of representation
or warranty shall not exclude the Founders or the Sellers right to claim
compensation for any damage (or amount thereof) not avoided by such
attempt.  
      
  10.  |   | ESCROW  
      
  10.1  |   | The Purchaser shall on the Closing Date pay the Deposits
into specified accounts, one for the General Deposits (the "General Escrow

from the Escrow Accounts shall only be possible after a joint written
instruction to the Bank  ##### 

 

 

47  

     |   | signed by the Seller and the Purchaser. All interest on
balances on the Swedish Deposits in the Escrow Account shall belong to the
Seller.

     10.2  |   | Eighteen (18) months after Closing Date, twenty five
(25) per cent of the General Deposits, less the aggregate of (x) the amount
of any General Deposit paid and transferred out of the General Escrow Account
to the Purchaser or the Liko North American Purchaser prior thereto and (y)
the amount of any claim(s) against the Seller or the Liko North American
Seller that are then in dispute or pending, shall be released to the Seller
through joint written instructions by the Purchaser and the Seller. The
remaining amount of the General Deposits, less the amount of any claim(s)
against the Seller or the Liko North American Seller that are then in
dispute or pending, shall be released on the twenty fourth (24th) month
anniversary of the Closing Date, to the Seller through joint written
instructions by the Purchaser and the Seller.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
an amount of SEK 6,628,000 shall be withheld from such release if the
Dismissal Claim is still pending at such time and such withheld amount shall
be retained in the General Escrow Account until such claim shall have time-
barred pursuant to Section 8.3.2 hereof.  
---|---|--- 
      
  10.3  |   | The Swedish Special Deposit shall be released to the Seller
through joint written instructions by the Purchaser and the Seller on the
date when claims for Special Indemnity II have been time-barred pursuant to
Section 8.3.2 hereof, provided that the Purchaser has not made any then
pending claim under this Agreement against such deposit, in which case only
the claimed amount shall be withheld. If the Parties are in dispute involving
the Swedish Special Deposit at the time of such deposits release pursuant
this Section 10.3, the Parties shall be considered to have settled the claim
for purposes of the Special Escrow Account if arbitral proceedings to address
such claim have not been initiated within four (4) months of the date of
release for such deposit.  
      
  10.4  |   | After twenty four (24) months from the Closing Date if the
Parties (or the parties to the Liko North American Transaction Agreement) are
in dispute involving the General Deposits they shall be considered to have
settled the claim for purposes of the General Escrow Account if arbitral
proceedings to address such claim have not been initiated within twenty eight
(28) months of the Closing Date.  
      
  10.5  |   | In case an arbitral tribunal has made a final award
regarding a claim for which an amount corresponding thereto is kept in the
relevant Deposit but the Parties cannot agree jointly to instruct the Bank to
release such deposit or parts thereof, either Party may forward
the arbitration award to the Bank, which shall release such deposit or parts
thereof, as the case may be, to the party so entitled according to the
arbitration award. Any remaining parts of the Deposit shall thereafter be
released to the Seller upon expiry of the respective times set out in Section
8.3, provided that neither the Purchaser nor the Liko North American
Purchaser has notified the Seller of any pending claim relating to the
relevant Deposit.  ##### 

 

 

48  

     

  

     10.6  |   | The Seller shall pledge the General Deposits and the
General Escrow Account to the Purchaser and the Liko North American Purchaser
as a security for the performance of the Sellers, the Liko North American
Sellers and the Founders obligations under Section 7 of this Agreement, the

the Non-Compete, Non-solicitation and Confidentiality Agreements executed and
delivered by the Founders contemporaneously with Closing pursuant to Sections

Founders obligations in their respective Consulting Agreements to use best
efforts in good faith to strive to achieve the objectives identified in
Section 1 of each such Consulting Agreement ("Founders Covenant"). The
Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy against any breach by any of the
Founders of the Founders Covenant shall be to recover and retain as
liquidated damages the sum of SEK 6,628,000 from the Escrow Account if any of
the Founders should breach the Founders Covenant. No Founder shall be in
breach of its Founder Covenant if he or she shall be incapable of performing
the consulting services under the Consulting Agreement by reason of ill health
or other incapacity or by reason of death.  
      
  10.8  |   | The Seller, the Purchaser and the Bank shall enter into an
escrow agreement regarding the Escrow Accounts substantially in the form set
forth in _Schedule 10.8_.  #####

  11.1  |   | Seller acknowledges that Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc ("Parent")

disclosure responsibilities, and that the Purchaser will determine, with the
advice of its outside legal counsel, whether it will file this Agreement with
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") or otherwise
describe this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in any
filing with the SEC. Purchaser shall provide the Seller notice of Parents
intent to file this Agreement, or otherwise describe it and the transactions
contemplated hereby in any filing, with the SEC. Purchaser will cause parent
to consider information timely provided by the Seller prior to such filing in
order to identify the provisions of this Agreement for which Parent and
Seller wish to seek confidentiality protection; provided, however, that
Parent shall have sole discretion over whether to file this Agreement, or
otherwise describe it and the transactions contemplated hereby in any filing,
with the SEC, over the substance and form of the filing, whether to
seek confidentiality protection and the scope of any confidentiality
protection sought, and provided further, that any obligation of Parent to

SEC filing deadlines or otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws, rules
or regulations as interpreted by legal counsel for parent.

     12.4  |   | _Amendments and waivers_   
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Changes and additions to this Agreement must be in writing and
duly executed by the Parties. This shall also apply for this Section 12.3.
Any provision or condition of this Agreement may be waived only in writing by
the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective.  
      
  12.5  |   | _Partial Invalidity_   
      
    |   | If any provision of this Agreement shall be fully or partly
invalid or unenforceable, the validity and enforceability of all other
provisions shall not be affected. The invalid or unenforceable provision
shall be substituted by a valid and enforceable provision, which most closely
reflects the economic intention of the Parties.  
      
  12.6  |   | _No waiver_   
      
    |   | The failure by any Party to exercise or delay in exercising any
right or remedy under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of the
right or remedy or a waiver of any other rights or remedies such Party may
otherwise have and no single or partial exercise of any right or remedy under
this Agreement shall prevent any further exercise of the right or remedy
under this Agreement.  
      
  12.7  |   | _Entire agreement_   
      
    |   | This Agreement (together with all documents referencing to or

its subject matter and replaces and extinguishes all prior agreements between
the Parties with respect to such subject matter.  
      
  12.8  |   | _Notices_

  13.1  |   | Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration in
accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of
Commerce. The arbitration proceedings shall take place in London, the United
Kingdom in the English language. The arbitration tribunal shall be composed of
three (3) arbitrators. If there is more than one party on a side in the
dispute, and they cannot agree on an arbitrator, then the Arbitration
Institute shall appoint such upon request from either party on that side in
the dispute.  
      
  13.2  |   | Any arbitral tribunal appointed under this Section shall
have the power to order that arbitral proceedings under this Agreement may be
consolidated with any   #####

     |   | arbitral proceedings under the Founder Undertakings, and/or
that concurrent hearings may be held in respect of any such arbitral
proceedings.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     13.3  |   | In particular, in the event that arbitration is
commenced by the Purchaser at the same time both against the Seller under
this Agreement and against one or both of the Founders under the Founder
Undertakings relating to the same subject matter, it is hereby irrevocably
agreed that (a) such arbitration shall be taken to be a single consolidated
set of proceedings, and (b) the Seller and the Founders shall be taken to be
on the same side of the dispute in such circumstances, and the last sentence
of Section 13.1 shall apply accordingly.  
---|---|--- 
      
  13.4  |   | [***].  
      
  13.5  |   | The Parties undertake and agree that all arbitral
proceedings conducted with reference to this arbitration clause will be kept
strictly confidential. This confidentiality undertaking shall cover all
information disclosed in the course of such arbitral proceedings, as well
as any decision or award that is made or declared during the proceedings,
except as is necessary to obtain execution of the decision or award.
Information covered by this confidentiality undertaking may not, in any form,
be disclosed to a third party without the prior written consent of both
Parties.  
      
  13.6  |   | In case this Agreement, or any part of it, is assigned or
transferred to a third party, such third party shall automatically be bound
by the provisions of this arbitration clause.
