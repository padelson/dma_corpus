ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

SECTION 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holders of any shares of Company Common Stock or Merger Sub Common
Stock:

 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Company
Share_ ") (other than Company Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other
direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent and Company Shares owned
by the Company or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries as treasury stock or
otherwise, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties (collectively,
the " _Cancelled Shares_ "), which shall be treated in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_, and the Dissenting Shares, which shall be treated in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.3_), shall be automatically converted, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement, into the right to
receive an amount equal to $50.30 per Company Share in cash, without interest
(the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all of the
Company Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly
representing any of the Company Shares (other than Cancelled Shares and
Dissenting Shares) and each non-certificated Company Share represented by
book-entry (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") (other than Cancelled Shares and
Dissenting Shares) shall, in each case, thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, in each case without interest and
subject to compliance with the procedures for surrender as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_.

(b) _Cancellation of Cancelled Shares_. Each Cancelled Share shall
automatically, and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

 



7

    

(c) _Surviving Corporation Shares_. Each share of common stock, no par value,
of Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of
common stock, no par value, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

SECTION 2.2 Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Rights, Performance Shares,
Direct Plan, and Directors Deferred Plan.

(a) _Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Rights_. As of the Effective Time,
each outstanding award of restricted stock rights (" _Company Restricted
Stock Rights_ ") granted to a member of the board of directors of the Company
under the Company Stock Plan or otherwise, other than any Company Restricted
Stock Rights granted to a director of the Company with respect to which the
director has made a deferral election under the Directors Deferred Plan (as
defined below) which are subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(d)_ below, shall,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, cease to relate to or represent any right to receive Company Common
Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into a right to receive
an amount of cash per share equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration. Such
cash amounts (the " _Restricted Stock Cash Payouts_ ") shall be payable to the
holder of such cancelled Company Restricted Stock Rights on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to the corresponding cancelled Company
Restricted Stock Rights, including any applicable vesting acceleration
provisions and payment timing provisions, in each case through the Companys
regular payroll processes applicable to such holder. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Restricted Stock Cash Payouts will be paid only if and to the
extent (and at the same time as) the corresponding cancelled Company
Restricted Stock Rights would have vested and been paid in accordance with the
terms thereof. As of the Effective Time, all other outstanding Company
Restricted Stock Rights under the Company Stock Plan or otherwise, other than
any Company Restricted Stock Rights granted to a member of the board of
directors of the Company, shall, automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to relate to or represent any
right to receive Company Common Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective
Time, into an equivalent award of cash-settled restricted stock rights
relating to Parent Common Stock (" _Parent Restricted Stock Rights_ ") on the
same terms and conditions as were applicable to the corresponding Company
Restricted Stock Rights, including any applicable vesting acceleration
provisions and payment timing provisions, except as expressly adjusted hereby.
The number of shares of Parent Common Stock covered by each such Parent
Restricted Stock Right shall be equal in number to the mathematical result
(rounded up to the nearest whole number) of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the corresponding Company Restricted Stock Right
multiplied by the Equity Conversion Factor. The cash amount to be paid on
settlement of the Parent Restricted Stock Rights shall be determined based on
the average of the volume weighted averages of the trading prices of Parent
Common Stock on the NYSE (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported
therein, in another authoritative source selected by the Parent in good faith
following consultation with officers of the Company) on each of the ten (10)
consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the trading day that
immediately precedes the date the Parent Restricted Stock Rights become
vested and payable.

 



8

    

(b) _Treatment of Performance Shares_. With respect to each outstanding award
of performance shares (" _Performance Shares_ ") under the Company Stock Plan
or otherwise, prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board of Directors (or
its applicable committee) will determine in good faith the number of shares
of Company Common Stock that are deemed to be earned under each award of
Performance Shares, which number shall, with respect to each award of
Performance Shares, be based on the higher of (1) the target level of
performance and (2) the actual level of performance determined on a goal-by-
goal basis as of the last day of the last month ending before the Effective
Time (the " _Earned Performance Shares_ "). As of the Effective Time, the
Earned Performance Shares shall, automatically and without any required action
on the part of the holder thereof, cease to relate to or represent a right to
receive Company Common Stock and shall be converted into a right to receive a
cash-settled time-vesting Parent Restricted Stock Right, which shall, provided
the applicable service-based vesting conditions are satisfied, vest at the
same time as the service-based vesting conditions of the corresponding Earned
Performance Shares would have been satisfied, and subject to the same vesting
acceleration and payment timing provisions and other terms and conditions as
applied to the corresponding Earned Performance Shares, as applicable. The
number of shares of Parent Common Stock covered by each such Parent Restricted
Stock Right shall be equal in number to the mathematical result (rounded up to
the nearest whole number) of the number of Earned Performance Shares to which
such Company Restricted Stock Right corresponds multiplied by the Equity
Conversion Factor. The cash amount to be paid on settlement of the Parent
Restricted Stock Rights shall be determined based on the average of the volume
weighted averages of the trading prices of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE
(as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported therein, in another
authoritative source selected by the Parent in good faith following
consultation with officers of the Company) on each of the ten (10)
consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the trading day that
immediately precedes the date the Parent Restricted Stock Rights become vested
and payable.

 

(c) _Direct Plan_. In accordance with the terms of the Third Amended and
Restated PNM Resources, Inc. Direct Plan (as amended, the " _Direct Plan_ "),
the Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to ensure that (i) the
right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the Direct Plan will be
terminated no later than thirty (30) days after the date hereof (the " _Final
Exercise Date_ "); (ii) cash dividends and investments received prior to the
Final Exercise Date will be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the terms of the Direct Plan as directed by the Plan
Administrator (as defined in the Direct Plan); (iii) no shareholders or
interested new investors will be eligible to participate in the Direct Plan or
purchase shares of Company Common Stock thereunder after the Final Exercise
Date; (iv) any remaining cash not used to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock or pay requisite expenses shall be returned to the applicable
shareholders or new investors as soon as administratively practicable; (v)
each participant in the Direct Plan will be eligible to direct how the shares
of Company Common Stock credited to his or her account shall be voted with
respect to the Merger; (vi) each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding under the Direct Plan shall be automatically converted, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement, into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration (with any Dissenting Shares to be
treated in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.3_); and (vii) the related
shares of Company Common Stock shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The Direct Plan shall terminate
immediately following the Effective Time, and the Plan Administrator shall
direct the Company to distribute to each participant the Per Share

 



9

    

 Merger Consideration held in his or her account as soon as administratively
practicable; _provided_ that such termination and all of the related foregoing
actions shall be contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time. The
Company shall provide timely notice of the setting of the Final Exercise Date
and termination of the Direct Plan in accordance with the Direct Plan.

 

(d) _Director Deferred Restricted Stock Rights Program_. As of the Effective
Time, in accordance with the terms of the Director Deferred Restricted Stock
Rights Program (the " _Directors Deferred Plan_ "), the Company shall take all
actions reasonably necessary to ensure that (i) the Directors Deferred Plan is
terminated as of the Effective Time, (ii) no director will be eligible to
participate in the Directors Deferred Plan after the Effective Time, except
with respect to any outstanding Company Restricted Stock Rights granted to an
eligible director of the Company with respect to which the director, prior to
the Effective Time, has made a deferral election under the Directors Deferred
Plan, which Company Restricted Stock Rights shall be deferred into the
Directors Deferred Plan in accordance with the applicable deferral
election, (iii) each share of Company Common Stock distributable under the
Directors Deferred Plan shall be automatically converted, in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this Agreement, into the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration, and (iv) the Plan Administrator (as defined in
the Directors Deferred Plan) shall direct the Company to distribute to each
participant the amounts credited to his or her account in the Directors
Deferred Plan as soon as administratively practicable (and no later than
thirty (30) days) after the Effective Time to the extent permitted by Section
409A of the Code (any amounts credited to the directors account in the
Directors Deferred Plan after the Effective Time shall be distributed to the
participant as soon as administratively practicable (and no later than thirty
(30) days) after the amounts are credited to the directors account in the
Directors Deferred Plan and in no event later than one (1) year after the
Effective Time); _provided_ , that such termination and all of the related
foregoing actions shall be contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective
Time, and _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing herein shall preclude a
director whose account in the Directors Deferred Plan is not paid as soon as
administratively practicable (and no later than thirty (30) days) after the
Effective Time from directing the deemed investment in such account to other
investments pursuant to the terms of the Directors Deferred Plan.

(e) _Treatment of Company Stock Plan_. As of the Effective Time, unless
otherwise determined and agreed to in writing by Parent, no further Company
Restricted Stock Rights, Performance Shares, or other rights with respect to
shares of Company Common Stock shall be granted under the Company Stock Plan
and the Company Stock Plan shall terminate automatically once there are no
further Company Restricted Stock Rights, Performance Shares, or other rights
with respect to shares of Company Common Stock outstanding thereunder.
Additionally, all Parent Restricted Stock Rights that correspond to Company
Restricted Stock Rights and Performance Shares shall become vested and non-
forfeitable and all Restricted Stock Cash Payouts that correspond to
Company Restricted Stock Rights granted to a member of the board of directors
of the Company shall become vested, payable and non-forfeitable, in each case
in connection with a termination of the employment or other service of the
Person eligible to receive such Parent Restricted Stock Rights and Restricted
Stock Cash Payouts, as applicable, with Parent or any subsidiary thereof
(including the Surviving Corporation) to the same extent as provided under
the Company Stock Plan and award agreement governing the corresponding
Company Restricted Stock Right and Performance Share award; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent Restricted Stock Rights that correspond to Earned
Performance Shares in respect of awards

 



10

    

 granted prior to the date of this Agreement shall, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, become vested in full (rather than on a pro-rata
basis) if the holders employment or other service with Parent or any
subsidiary thereof (including the Surviving Corporation) is terminated without
"cause" or by the holder for "good reason" (as such terms are defined under
the Company Stock Plan and award agreement).

(f) _No Right to Acquire Shares_. The Company shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver
shares of Company Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company to any
Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Restricted Stock Rights or
Performance Shares, subject to the provisions set forth in this _Section_ __ _
2.2_.

(g)  _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board of Directors or the compensation committee of the Company Board
of Directors, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions
which are reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 2.2_; _provided_ that such actions shall expressly be conditioned upon
the consummation of the Merger and shall be of no effect if this Agreement
is terminated without consummation of the Merger. The Company shall not take
any action to apply the provisions of Section 11.5 of the Company Stock Plan
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

SECTION 2.3 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, Company
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing who is entitled to, and who has demanded, payment for fair value of
such Company Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") in accordance with Section
53-15-4 of the NMBCA (" _Section_ __ _ 53-15-4_") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for each such
Dissenting Share, unless and until such holder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or otherwise loses the right to receive payment of fair
value for such holders Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 53-15-4.
Any such holder shall instead be entitled only to receive payment of the fair
value of such holders Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 53-15-4 less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.4(e)_ with respect to such payment. At
the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, and
each holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 53-15-4. If,
after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or otherwise loses the right to receive payment of the fair value of
such holders Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
53-15-4 (or had not properly demanded payment under Section 53-15-4), then
each such Dissenting Share shall be treated as if such Dissenting Share had
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration, without interest thereon. The Company will give
Parent (a) prompt written notice of any demand for payment of fair value of
any Company Shares in accordance with Section 53-15-4, any withdrawals of such
demands, and any other communications received by the Company or its
Representatives in respect of the demand, withdrawal, or perfection of any
rights under Section 53-15-4 and (b) the opportunity to conduct jointly with
the Company all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands
related to any Company Shares under Section 53-15-4. The Company will
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any Dissenting Shares or settle or offer to settle any
such demands.

 



11

    

SECTION 2.4 Surrender of Company Shares.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent
shall enter into an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
the Company and Parent with an exchange agent selected by Parent with the
Companys prior approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed, (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the
purpose of delivering or causing to be delivered to each holder of Company
Shares (other than Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) the aggregate Per
Share Merger Consideration to which the shareholders of the Company shall
become entitled in respect of their Company Shares pursuant to this _Article
II_. Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent,
(i) at or prior to the Effective Time, a cash amount in immediately available
funds sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the
Exchange Agent to make payments of the Per Share Merger Consideration under
_Section_ __ _ 2.1_, and (ii) from time to time, to the extent and when
needed, additional cash sufficient to pay any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.15_ (such cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") in
trust for the benefit of the holders of the Company Shares. The Exchange
Agent shall invest any cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;
_provided_ that such investments shall be in short-term ( _i.e._ , maturities
of thirty (30) days or less) obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States
of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Group, a
division of McGraw Hill, Inc., respectively. To the extent that there are
losses with respect to such investments, or any cash in the Exchange
Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt
cash payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated
by _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash
in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events so as to
ensure that the cash in the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a
level sufficient to make such cash payments. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and
any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_
shall be promptly returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
requested by Parent. The funds deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)_ shall not be used for any purpose other than as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)_.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Transmittal Materials_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or otherwise provide to each holder of
record of Company Shares (other than holders of Cancelled Shares and
Dissenting Shares) (A) transmittal materials, including a letter
of transmittal in customary form as Parent shall reasonably specify after
consultation with the Company, specifying that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, (x) with respect to Book-Entry Shares, only
upon delivery of an "agents message", regarding the book-entry transfer of
Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the

 



12

    

 Exchange Agent may reasonably request), and (y) with respect to
Certificates, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or satisfaction of the
replacement requirements in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section_
__ _ 2.4(f))_ and delivery of a duly completed and validly executed letter of
transmittal to the Exchange Agent, such transmittal materials to be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent shall reasonably determine
after consultation with the Company, and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Book-Entry Shares or Certificates (or satisfaction of the
replacement requirements in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section_
__ _ 2.4(f)_), as applicable, to the Exchange Agent.

(ii) _Certificates_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or satisfaction of the
replacement requirements in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section_
__ _ 2.4(f)_) to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of such
transmittal materials and instructions and delivery with the letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_
__ _ 2.4(e)_) equal to (y) the product obtained by _multiplying_ (1) the
number of Company Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.4(f)_) by (2)
the Per Share Merger Consideration, _plus_ (z) any dividends and other
distributions such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.15_. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates.

 

(iii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry
Shares (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall upon receipt
by the Exchange Agent of an "agents message" in customary form and such other
evidence of surrender, if any, as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request
(it being understood that the holders of Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to
have surrendered such Company Shares upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of
such "agents message" or such other evidence of surrender, if any, as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) be entitled to receive, and Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, a cash amount in immediately available
funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in 
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(e)_) equal to (y) the product obtained by _multiplying_
(1) the number of Company Shares represented by such Book-Entry Shares by (2)
the Per Share Merger Consideration, _plus_  (z) any dividends and other
distributions such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.15_. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash amount payable upon due

(iv) _Unrecorded Transfers; Other Payments_. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company or if payment of the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration is
to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, a check for any cash to
be exchanged upon due surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share may
be delivered to such transferee or other Person only if the Certificate or
Book-Entry Share formerly representing such Company Shares is properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and is presented
to the Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable transfer or other
similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. 

 



13

    

(v) _Related Charges and Expenses_. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_, each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share
shall represent at any time from and after the Effective Time only the right
to receive upon such surrender (together with a letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
or an "agents message," and such other documents as may reasonably be
required pursuant to such instructions or by the Exchange Agent (as
applicable)) the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration and any dividends
or other distributions with respect to Company Shares payable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.15_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses of the Exchange Agent in connection with the exchange of Company
Shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration and any dividends or other

(c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the former shareholders of the Company for twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall, upon the written demand of Parent, be delivered to
Parent. Any former holder of Company Shares (other than a holder of Cancelled
Shares or Dissenting Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this
_Article II_ shall thereafter be entitled to solely look to Parent, as a
general unsecured creditor thereof, for payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.4(e)_) and any dividends or other distributions
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 6.15_ upon due
surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates) or acceptable evidence of the surrender and cancellation of
Book-Entry Shares, without any interest thereon in accordance with the
provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_, and Parent shall remain
liable for (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) payment of their claim for the Per Share Merger Consideration and any
dividends or other distributions such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.15_ payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Exchange Agent or
any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Company Shares for
any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by Persons entitled to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ as of a date that is immediately
prior to such time as such unclaimed funds would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person entitled thereto.

 

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Company Shares
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificate or acceptable evidence of a Book-Entry Share
is presented (together with the properly delivered and validly executed
transmittal materials required by this _Section_ __ _ 2.4)_ to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the consideration provided for in, and in accordance with
the procedures set forth in, this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_. The Per Share Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates together with the letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto (or upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of an
"agents message, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, or such other evidence, if
any, as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), in accordance with the
terms of this  _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Shares formerly
represented by such Certificates or such Book-Entry Shares.

 



14

    

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and their
respective agents (including the Exchange Agent) shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Shares, Company Restricted Stock Rights
and Performance Shares, or any other Person who is entitled to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration, any amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
other applicable state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective agents (including the Exchange Agent), such deducted and
withheld amounts (i) shall be promptly remitted by Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or their respective agents, as applicable, to the
applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) to the extent so remitted to the
applicable Governmental Entity, shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person(s) in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. The Parties and their respective agents
(including the Exchange Agent) shall reasonably cooperate in good faith (i) to
establish or obtain any exemption from or reduction in the amount of any
withholding that otherwise would be required and (ii) to coordinate the
deduction and withholding of any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld
under any applicable Tax Law.

(f) _Lost Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by
Parent or the Exchange Agent as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will (i) issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to
any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.4(e)_) equal to
the product obtained by _multiplying_  (A) the number of Company Shares
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate by (B) the Per Share
Merger Consideration, _plus_ any dividends and other distributions such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.15_. Delivery of such
affidavit and the posting of such bond shall be deemed delivery of a
Certificate with respect to the relevant Company Shares for purposes of this
_Article II_.

 

SECTION 2.5 Adjustments. In the event that the number of Company Shares issued
and outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time or the
number of securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
Company Shares shall have been changed into a different number of Company
Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for Company Shares, as applicable, or securities of a different class as a
result, in either case, of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender
or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, then, in each case, the Per
Share Merger Consideration and any other number or amount contained herein
which is based upon the number of Company Shares shall be equitably adjusted
to provide to Parent and the holders of Company Shares the same economic
effect as

 



15

    

 contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ that nothing
in this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ shall be construed to permit the Company, any
subsidiary of the Company or any other Person to take any action that is
otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement (including _Section_ __ _
5.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.2_).

the Company SEC Reports so filed contained (taking into account all amendments
and supplements thereto filed prior to the date hereof) any untrue statement

principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions) as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on
the most recent evaluation of its chief executive officer and its chief
financial officer prior to the date hereof, the Company has disclosed to its

satisfied in full nor, to the knowledge of the Company, do any circumstances
exist that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Controlled Group

Corporation not yet due). For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Controlled
Group Liability_ " means any and all liabilities (i) under Title IV of ERISA,

to such Acquisition Proposal), (E) fail to include the Company Recommendation
in the Proxy Statement, (F) fail to announce publicly, within five (5)
Business Days after a tender offer or exchange offer relating to any

any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, (i) the Company Board
of Directors may effect a Company Change of Recommendation in response to an
Intervening Event or (ii) if the Company Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal

not withdrawn, the Company or the Company Board of Directors may (A) make a
Company Change of Recommendation and/or (B) terminate this Agreement pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)(ii)_ to enter into a definitive agreement with

outside legal counsel, the Company Board of Directors determines that the
failure to make a Company Change of Recommendation, or to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)(ii)_, would be reasonably
expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company or the Company Board of Directors,
as applicable, may only take the actions described in _clauses_

 



49

    

  _(i)_ and _(ii)_ if prior to taking any such action (x) the Company
delivers to Parent written notice (a " _Company Notice_ "), at least five (5)
Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), advising Parent that the
Company Board of Directors proposes to take such action and containing (1) the
material details of such Intervening Event or the material terms
and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed
action by the Company Board of Directors and (2) a copy of the most current
draft of any written communication (including any agreement) relating to the
Superior Proposal and (y) during the Notice Period (as extended pursuant to
the following sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(d)_), (i) the Company
complies with the following sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(d)_ and (ii)
if Parent shall have delivered to the Company a written, binding, irrevocable
offer, capable of being accepted by the Company, to alter the terms of this
Agreement, the Company Board of Directors thereafter reaffirms in good faith
(after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor) that the
Acquisition Proposal giving rise to the Company Notice continues to constitute
a Superior Proposal. If requested by Parent, the Company will, and will cause
its Representatives to, during the Notice Period, engage in good faith
negotiations with Parent and its Representatives (including by making the
Companys officers and Representatives reasonably available to negotiate) to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
(i) in the case of an Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal would
cease to constitute a Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that
if Parent has committed to any changes to the terms of this Agreement, each
time thereafter that there has been any subsequent amendment to any material
term of such Superior Proposal, the Company Board of Directors shall provide a
new Company Notice and an additional two (2) Business Day period from the
date of such notice and the obligations of the Company during the Notice
Period shall continue in effect during such additional period) or (ii) in the
case of an Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board of Directors to
make a Company Change of Recommendation could not be reasonably expected to
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws. Any such
Company Change of Recommendation shall not change the approval of this
Agreement or any other approval of the Company Board of Directors in any
respect that would have the effect of causing any corporate takeover statute
or other similar statute or any provision of the Company Articles of
Incorporation to be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board of Directors
(or any committee thereof), directly or indirectly through its
Representatives, from disclosing to the Companys shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act
or making any disclosure to the Companys shareholders if the Company Board of
Directors has determined, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to do so could reasonably be expected to result in a breach
of its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any such disclosure that constitutes a Company Change of Recommendation shall
be subject to the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ with respect thereto
(it being understood and agreed that any disclosure of a position in
connection with a tender offer or exchange offer, other than a "stop, look
and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or a recommendation on Schedule 14D-9
against such tender offer or exchange offer made within ten (10) Business Days
after the commencement thereof and in any event at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting, shall be deemed a Company Change of
Recommendation, unless the Company Board of Directors expressly and
concurrently reaffirms the Company Recommendation).

or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis), (C)

determines, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more
favorable to the shareholders of the Company from a financial point of view
than the transactions contemplated hereby after taking into account all such
factors and matters considered appropriate in good faith by the Company Board
of Directors (including, to the extent considered appropriate by the Company
Board of Directors, (A) financial provisions and the payment of the Company
Termination Fee, (B) the identity of the Person(s) making such Acquisition

terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (c) enter into, initiate, continue, engage in
or otherwise participate in any way in any discussions or negotiations
regarding any Parent Business Combination, or (d) agree or propose to do any
of the foregoing. As used herein, " _Parent Business Combination_ " means
(other than the Merger) (i) any acquisition or purchase, in a single
transaction or a series of transactions of all or any material part of Parent
or its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (regardless of whether such acquisition
or purchase is by means of a sale of assets or a sale of equity securities of
one or more of Parent or any subsidiary thereof) or (ii) any acquisition,
purchase or corporate reorganization by Parent or its subsidiaries, in each of
clauses (i) and (ii), that would be reasonably expected to constitute a
Material Business Transaction. Any act or omission by an Affiliate of
Parent that would be a violation of this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ if taken by
Parent shall be a breach by Parent of this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_.

 

SECTION 6.3 Proxy Statement.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement and in any
event within forty-five (45) days after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare and provide to Parent and its advisors the Proxy
Statement in preliminary form, and within sixty (60) days after the date of
this Agreement, shall file with the SEC, the Proxy Statement in
preliminary form. Parent shall promptly supply to the Company in writing, for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement, all information concerning Parent required
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations
thereunder, to be included in the Proxy Statement; _provided_ that the
Company shall not use any such information for any other purpose if doing so
would violate or cause the violation of applicable securities Laws. Each of
Parent and the Company shall notify the other promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information related to the Proxy Statement and will promptly supply the other
Party with copies of all correspondence between it and its Affiliates or their
respective officers, employees, legal advisors or agents, on the one hand, and
the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement
or the Merger. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, each of Parent and the Company shall liaise and cooperate
with the other Party and provide it with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such document or proposed response or compliance with any such
request. If at any time prior to the Company

 



52

    

 Shareholders Meeting, any information relating to Parent or the Company or
any of its respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered
by such Party which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement, so that such document would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be prepared, filed with the SEC and disseminated to
the shareholders of the Company to the extent required by Law. After all the
comments received from the SEC have been cleared by the SEC staff and all
information required to be contained in the Proxy Statement has been included
therein by the Company, the Company shall promptly file the definitive Proxy
Statement with the SEC and cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed (including
by electronic delivery if permitted), as promptly as practicable, to its
shareholders of record, as of the record date established by the Company
Board of Directors and set forth in the Proxy Statement.

(b) The Company covenants that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the proxy statement to be sent to the shareholders of the Company
in connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting (such proxy statement, as
amended or supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") will, at the time such
document is first filed with the SEC, at any time such document is amended or
supplemented, at the time such document is declared effective by the SEC or
at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement
will, at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, comply as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder.

(c) Parent covenants that none of the information supplied by or on behalf of
Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will, at the time
such document is filed with the SEC, at any time such document is amended or
supplemented, at the time such document is declared effective by the SEC or at
the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent makes no representation or warranty with respect to any
information supplied in writing for inclusion in the Proxy Statement by or on
behalf of the Company which is contained or incorporated by reference in the
Proxy Statement.

 

SECTION 6.4 Company Shareholders Meeting.

 

Notwithstanding any Company Change of Recommendation, the Company, acting
through the Company Board of Directors (or a committee thereof), shall
promptly following receipt of confirmation from the SEC that the SEC has no
further comments on, or will not review, the Proxy Statement, take all
reasonable action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its shareholders for the purpose of approving and adopting this
Agreement (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Company
Shareholders_

 



53

    

  _Meeting_ "); _provided_ that the Company may postpone, recess or adjourn
such meeting for up to thirty (30) days in the aggregate (excluding any
adjournment or postponements required by applicable Law) (a) to allow
reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent the
Company reasonably believes necessary in order to obtain the Company Requisite
Vote, (b) if as of the time for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) and voting to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the Company Shareholders Meeting or (c) to allow reasonable additional time
for the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure
which the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith
after consultation with outside counsel is necessary under applicable Law or
to prevent a breach of fiduciary duty and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Companys shareholders prior
to the Company Shareholders Meeting. The Company, acting through its Company
Board of Directors (or a committee thereof), shall subject to _Section_ __ _
6.1(d)_, (i) include in the Proxy Statement the Company Recommendation and,
subject to the consent of the Company Financial Advisor, the written opinion
of the Company Financial Advisor, dated as of the date of this Agreement,
that, as of such date, the Per Share Merger Consideration is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of the Company Common Stock and (ii)
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Requisite Vote.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be required to hold the Company Shareholders Meeting if
this Agreement is terminated.

SECTION 6.5 Regulatory Approvals; Reasonable Best Efforts.

 

(a) During the Interim Period, each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate
and promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation to effect all
necessary applications, notices, petitions and filings, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things in order to, (i) make and obtain the Consents and
Filings listed in _Section_ __ _ 3.5(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
and _Section_ __ _ 4.4(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, (ii) make all

registrations, filings or submissions, and pay any fees due in connection
therewith, with any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) take, or cause to be taken,
all reasonable and appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, all
reasonable things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or
otherwise to satisfy the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ as promptly as
practicable, (iv) cooperate in good faith with the applicable Governmental
Entities or other Persons and provide promptly such other information and
communications to such Governmental Entities or other Persons as such
Governmental Entities or other Persons may reasonably request in connection
therewith, and (v) execute and deliver any additional agreements or
instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

(b) During the Interim Period, the Parties will provide prompt notification to
each other when any Consent or Filing referred to in  _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_
is obtained, taken, made, given or denied, as applicable, and will advise each
other of any material communications with any Governmental Entity or other
Person regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including (i) giving the other Parties prompt notice of the making or
commencement

 



54

    

 of any material, written request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal
proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (ii)
keeping the other Parties informed as to the status of any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding. Subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, and unless prohibited by the
reasonable request of any Governmental Entity, (x) Parent shall have the right
to review and approve (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned) in advance and the Company shall have the right to review
in advance, and (y) to the extent practicable, each Party will consult with
the other Party on, and consider in good faith the views of the other in
connection with any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum,
brief, argument, opinion or proposal (including all of the information
relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their
respective subsidiaries, that appears in any filing) made with or written
materials submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, except
as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection
with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding,
each Party will permit authorized representatives of the other Parties to be
present at each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding and to have access to and be
consulted in connection with any material, written document, opinion or
proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, commercially and/or competitively sensitive information and
materials of a Party may be provided to the other Party on an outside counsel-
only basis.

(c) In furtherance of the foregoing covenants:

(i) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts
to make any premerger notification filing required under the HSR Act with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as reasonably
practicable following the execution of this Agreement. Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company shall supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional
information or documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act and shall take all other actions, proper or advisable consistent with this
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_, to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall comply substantially with any additional
requests for information, including requests for production of documents and
production of witnesses for interviews or depositions, made by the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice, the United States Federal
Trade Commission or the antitrust or competition law authorities of any
other jurisdiction (the " _Antitrust Authorities_ ") and use reasonable best
efforts to take all other actions to obtain clearance from the Antitrust
Authorities. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall exercise its reasonable best
efforts, and the Company shall cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub, to
promptly prevent the entry in any claim brought by an Antitrust Authority of
any order that would prohibit, make unlawful or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby in any material respect.

(ii) Other than with respect to filings under the HSR Act, the Parties will,
as soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of this Agreement,
prepare and file, and pay any fees due in connection therewith in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, with each applicable Governmental Entity (including
CFIUS) requests for such Consents (including the

 



55

    

 CFIUS Approval) as may be necessary for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and as set
forth on  _Section_ __ _ 3.5(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and
_Section_ __ _ 4.4(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule. Without limiting
the generality of this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ and subject thereto, for purposes
of obtaining the CFIUS Approval, the Parties shall file, as promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, a joint voluntary notice in
respect of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
under Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, and 31
C.F.R. Part 800(the " _DPA_ "). The Parties will diligently pursue and use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain such Consents and will cooperate with
each other in seeking such Consents. To such end, the Parties agree to make
reasonably available the personnel and other resources of their respective
organizations in order to obtain all such Consents. Each Party will promptly
inform the other Parties of any material communication received by such Party
from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Entity from which any such
Consent is required, unless prohibited by the reasonable request of any
Governmental Entity, and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any claim by a private party, in each case regarding any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and will permit the other party to
review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in
advance of any meeting or conference with, any such Governmental Entity or, in
connection with any claim by a private party, with such other Person, and to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity or other Person, give the
other party the opportunity to attend and to participate in such meetings and
conferences.

(d) In furtherance of the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_,
each of Parent and the Company agrees that it will use its reasonable best
efforts to take (and to cause its subsidiaries to take) promptly any and all
steps reasonably necessary, proper or advisable (taking into consideration
the post-Closing ownership structure of each of Parent and the Company and
relevant (including in respect of post-Closing ownership and control)
precedent transactions involving the combination of two publicly-
traded companies in the applicable industries and jurisdictions) to make and
obtain all Filings and Consents, including the Filings and Consents listed in
_Section_ __ _ 3.5(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and  _Section_ __
_ 4.4(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, so as to enable the Parties to
close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
reasonably practicable, including, if necessary, by proposing, negotiating,
committing to and implementing, by way of operational restriction, consent
decree, hold separate order, divestiture, undertaking or otherwise, all terms,
conditions, liabilities, obligations, commitments or undertakings in respect
of the Company, Parent and their respective Affiliates; _provided_ that
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall agree to, or accept, any
undertakings, agreements, commitments or conditions pursuant to any
settlement, negotiation, litigated proceeding or otherwise with any person
with respect to obtaining any Consents or Filings without the prior written
consent of Parent. Notwithstanding the obligations set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 6.5_ or otherwise, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates shall be required to agree or consent to or accept
any terms, conditions, liabilities, obligations, commitments or undertakings
as a condition to any such Filings or Consents (including any Required
Regulatory Approvals or CFIUS Approval) that, either (i) impose any
independent or disinterested director obligations that would negatively impact
or limit Parents control over the Company or its subsidiaries in any
material respect or (ii) individually or in the aggregate, and taking into
account any positive effects expected to be realized in the Merger, could
reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the 

 



56

    

 business, assets, liabilities, properties, condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of a hypothetical company that is fifty
percent (50%) of the size of PNM and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as
of the date of this Agreement (a " _Burdensome Effect_ "); _provided_ that for
the purposes of determining whether a Burdensome Effect under clause (ii) of
the definition of Burdensome Effect exists (or could reasonably be expected
to exist), in respect of a Specified Required Regulatory Approval only those
terms, conditions, liabilities, obligations, commitments, or undertakings
related to or arising out of rate concessions (including rate reductions and
rate credits) to customers required to obtain such Specified Required
Regulatory Approval will be taken into account and considered in such
determination.

 

(e) Subject to the obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, in the event that
any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party
challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, (i) each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each
other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest, resist,
prevent, oppose and remove any such action or proceeding and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prevents, restrains, restricts or otherwise prohibits consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall defend, at its own cost and expense, any action or
actions brought against or involving such Party, whether judicial or
administrative, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger. Without limiting anything contained in
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_, Parent and its subsidiaries and the Company and its
subsidiaries shall only be required to agree to any terms,
conditions, liabilities, obligations, commitments or undertakings on or with
respect to its business conduct in connection with its obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_, if such terms, conditions, liabilities, obligations,
commitments or undertakings are binding on such Party or its subsidiaries
only in the event the Closing occurs.

SECTION 6.6 Notification of Certain Matters. During the Interim Period, the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company, of (a) any notice or other communication received by
such Party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger, if
the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such Party to
obtain such consent would reasonably be expected to be material to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (b) any facts or circumstances,
or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the
obligations of any Party hereto to effect the Merger or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied, and (c) any
actions, suits, claims or proceedings commenced or, to such Partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such Party
or any of its subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that neither the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ nor the access to any
information pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall limit the rights or
remedies available to the Party receiving such notice.

 



57

    

SECTION 6.7 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

 

(a) During the Interim Period, upon reasonable prior written notice from
Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, (i) afford Parent
and its Representatives reasonable access, consistent with applicable Law,
during normal business hours to its and their respective officers, employees
and Representatives and properties, offices, and other facilities and to all
books and records, and shall furnish Parent and its Representatives promptly
with all financial, operating and other data and information as Parent and its
Representatives from time to time reasonably request in writing, (ii) to the
extent permitted by Law, furnish promptly each report, schedule and other
document filed or received by the Company or any of the Companys subsidiaries
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities or regulatory
Laws or filed with or sent to the SEC, FERC, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, the New Mexico Public Regulations Commission (" _NMPRC_ "), the
Public Utility Commission of Texas (" _PUCT_ "), CFIUS, the U.S. Department
of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission or any other Governmental Entity, and
(iii) upon written request, as soon as reasonably practicable provide Parent
with information relating to any material developments in any audit or
similar proceeding related to any material Tax matters of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or
consultation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its
subsidiaries, and shall not include any environmental sampling or invasive
environmental testing without the Companys consent. Neither the Company nor
any of its subsidiaries shall be required to provide access or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice its
rights or the rights of any of its officers, directors or employees, give rise
to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, or contravene any Law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment or decree of any Governmental Entity, or Contract; _provided_ ,
_however_ that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) allow
for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of
attorney-client privilege (including negotiating in good faith with Parent to
seek alternative means to disclose such information as nearly as possible
without affecting such attorney-client privilege, including entry into a joint
defense agreement), (B) obtain the required consent of any third party to
provide access to or disclosure of such information with respect to
any confidential Contract to which the Company or its subsidiaries is party,
or (C) develop an alternative to providing such information so as to address
such matters that is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company; it being
understood and agreed that (i) the Company shall advise Parent in such
circumstances that it is unable to comply with Parents reasonable requests
for information as a result of attorney-client privilege, Contract obligation
or applicable Law, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
generally describe the types of information being withheld and (ii) Parent
shall reimburse the Company for its reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with the Companys actions described above in
clauses (A)  (C). All requests for information made pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.7(a)_ shall be directed to the executive officer or other
Person designated by the Company and all access granted to Parent and its
Representatives shall be under the supervision of such executive officer or
other Person, and Parent and its Representatives seeking access shall use
their reasonable best efforts not to directly contact any other officer,
director, employee, agent or representative of the Company without the prior
approval of such Persons designated by the Company. No access, review or
notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall have any effect for the
purpose of determining the accuracy of any representation or warranty given by
any of the Parties to any of the other Parties.

 



58

    

(b) Each Party will comply with terms and conditions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated January 31, 2020, between the Company and Parent (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and will hold and treat, and will cause their
respective officers, employees, auditors and other Representatives to hold and
treat, in confidence all documents and information concerning, on the one
hand, the Company and its subsidiaries furnished to Parent or Merger Sub, and
on the other hand, Parent or Merger Sub and their respective subsidiaries
furnished to the Company, in each case in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, which Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms.

 

SECTION 6.8 Stock Exchange Delisting. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent and use commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws
and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the Surviving
Corporation of the Company Shares from the NYSE and the deregistration of the
Company Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time.

 

SECTION 6.9 Publicity. The initial press releases regarding the Merger are
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ and (except in connection with (a) a Company
Change of Recommendation or an Acquisition Proposal, (b) any good faith
dispute between or among the Parties regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or (c) a press release or other public
statement that is consistent in all material respects with previous press
releases, public disclosures or public statements made by a Party in
accordance with this Agreement, including in investor conference calls, the
Proxy Statement, the Company SEC Reports, Parents SEC filings, QandAs or other
publicly disclosed documents, in each case, to the extent such disclosure is
still accurate) thereafter the Company and Parent shall (i) consult with each
other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
announcements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) provide to each other for
review a copy of any such press release or public statement, (iii) not issue
any such press release or public statement prior to providing each other with
reasonable period of time to review and comment on such press release or
public statement, and (iv) not issue any such press release or public
statement or make any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity (including any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation
service) with respect thereto without the prior written consent of the
other Parties (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except as may be required, on the advice of counsel, by Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national
securities exchange or interdealer quotation service (or, in the case of the
Company, in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)(ii)_); _provided_ that in
each such case, the Party required to make such disclosure will, to the extent
practicable and not prohibited by applicable Law, promptly inform the other
Parties in writing in advance of such compelled disclosure and provide such
other Party with a copy of the proposed disclosure and consult with such other
Party and consider such other Partys comments in good faith prior to making
such disclosure.

SECTION 6.10 Employee Benefits. 

(a) For a period of at least twenty-four (24) months following the Effective
Time (the " _Protection Period_ "), Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, to each Company Employee who continues to be employed
by the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary or Affiliate
thereof (each a " _Continuing Employee_ " and collectively, the " _Continuing
Employees_ ") (i) a salary or wage, that is no less favorable than the salary
or wage that was provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) target annual cash bonus opportunity and long-term
incentive opportunity (it being understood that long-term incentive
opportunities provided by Parent to each Continuing Employee need not be
provided in the form or equity or equity-based grants) that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than the target annual cash bonus opportunity
and long-term incentive opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) employee retirement benefits
(including defined contribution retirement, pension and nonqualified deferred
compensation) (including matching and other employer contributions), in each
case, that is no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee retirement
benefits (including defined contribution retirement, pension and nonqualified
deferred compensation) (including matching and other employer contributions)
that were provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (iv) welfare and other benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the welfare and other benefits that were
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and (v) severance benefits that are no less favorable than those provided as
of the Effective Time, subject to such severed employees execution and non-
revocation of a standard release of claims and counting any service accrued
after the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _however,_ that the requirements of
the foregoing shall not apply to Continuing Employees who are covered by a
Company Collective Bargaining Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_ shall not prohibit
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from reducing
the salary, wages or other compensation of any Continuing Employee if such
reduction is contemporaneous with and proportionate to any salary, wage or
compensation reduction programs affecting Parents and its subsidiaries
other similarly situated employees.

(c) Subject to applicable Law and any obligations under any Company
Collective Bargaining Agreement, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor, in accordance with their terms, the Company Plans,
including, without limitation, subject to the amendment and termination
provisions thereof applied on a prospective basis; _provided_ , _however_ ,
for the avoidance of doubt, that no such amendments or termination shall
reduce or otherwise impact the Parents obligations pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.10(a)_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event
shall Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, without limitation, the
Surviving Corporation) terminate and liquidate the Company Plan listed on 
_Section_ __ _ 6.10(c)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule pursuant to IRS
Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B) in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise during the

extent required under the terms (as in effect on the date of this Agreement)
of the Company Plans listed on  _Section_ __ _ 6.10(c)(ii)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company, the Company Board of Directors and the
compensation committee of the Company Board of Directors, as applicable, shall
adopt resolutions and take actions that are reasonably necessary to establish
an irrevocable rabbi trust into which the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or Parent

 



60

    

 (on behalf of the Surviving Corporation) will pay, or cause to be paid, at
the Effective Time, such amounts as are required to be funded to such
irrevocable rabbi trust; _provided_ ,  _however_ , to the extent any such
irrevocable rabbi trust has been established previously, in lieu of
establishing another such rabbi trust, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or Parent (on behalf of the Surviving Corporation) will pay, or cause to be
paid, at the Effective Time, such amounts as are required to be funded to such
previously-established irrevocable rabbi trust. Any documents associated with
such rabbi trust arrangement will be provided to Parent for advance review
and comment.

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause (i) any
pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under
any group health plans of Parent or its Affiliates to be waived with respect
to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, (ii) each Continuing
Employee to receive credit for the plan year in which the Continuing Employee
commences participation under any group health plans of Parent or its
Affiliates towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for
medical expenses incurred prior to such time in the applicable plan year for
which payment has been made and (iii) to the extent that such service was
recognized under a similar Company Plan, each Continuing Employee to receive
service credit for such Continuing Employees employment with the Company and
its subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting
credit and benefits accruals (but excluding benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension plan or retiree health plan,) under each applicable Parent
Plan as if such service had been performed with Parent or one of its
Affiliates; _provided_ that such recognition of service shall not apply (x)
for purposes of any Parent Plan under which similarly situated employees of
Parent and its subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service, (y) to
the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits or (z) for purposes
of any plan or arrangement that is grandfathered or frozen, either with
respect to the level of benefits or participation.

 

(e) The Company may establish a cash-based retention program to promote
retention and to incentivize efforts to consummate the Closing (the "
_Retention Program_ ") in accordance with the terms and subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.10(e)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor,
in accordance with its terms, any such cash-based retention program that the
Company establishes. In addition, from the date hereof and through the
Effective Time, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude or prohibit the
Company from granting awards under the Company Stock Plan in the ordinary

limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.10(e)(ii)_ of the Company

(f) Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall pay or cause
the applicable subsidiary to pay, if not paid previously, to each current or

after the Effective Time, any accrued but unpaid annual bonus (or other cash
incentive award) relating to any completed year (or other completed
performance period, as applicable) ending prior to the year (or performance
period) in which the Effective Time occurs that has been accrued on the
audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries
as of the Effective Time. The Company may

 



61

    

 establish an annual cash bonus plan (or other cash incentive awards)
relating to the 2021 calendar year in the ordinary course, consistent with
past practice. If the Closing occurs in 2021, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, shall pay or cause the applicable subsidiary to
pay (i) to each employee of the Company and its subsidiaries who remains
continuously employed with the Company and its subsidiaries until
the Effective Time, a pro-rated annual cash bonus award for the 2021 calendar
year (or other applicable performance period) (pro-rated based on the number
of days elapsed in the 2021 calendar year (or other applicable performance
period) prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) to each employee of the Company
and its subsidiaries who terminates employment prior to the Effective Time
under circumstances that would ordinarily entitle such employee to remain
eligible for a pro-rated annual bonus for the year of termination, a pro-rated
annual bonus (pro-rated based on the number of days employed during the 2021
calendar year (or other applicable performance period) prior to the Effective
Time), consistent with past practices, in each case in an amount determined
based on the Companys level of achievement of the applicable performance
targets for the 2021 calendar year (or other applicable performance period)
through the Effective Time, with the level of achievement annualized
and appropriately adjusted to reflect the partial performance period through
the Effective Time and determined in good faith by the Companys board of
directors as constituted prior to the Effective Time. After the close of the
2021 calendar year (or other applicable performance period) which includes
the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall
pay or cause the applicable subsidiary to pay to each employee who was
entitled to receive a pro-rated annual cash bonus for the period through the
Effective Time and who remains employed with the Company through the end of
the 2021 calendar year, a pro-rated annual bonus for the remainder of the
2021 calendar year (or other applicable performance period) after the
Effective Time, consistent with past practices, in each case in an amount
determined based on the Companys level of achievement of the applicable
performance targets for the entire 2021 calendar year (or other applicable
performance period) which included the Effective Time, as determined in good
faith by Parent, following consultation with officers of the Company, reduced
by the payment made to the employee as of the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , in no event will any employee be required to return the pro-rated
annual cash bonus payable in connection with the Effective Time if the
employee receives a pro-rated annual cash bonus at the Effective Time in
excess of what would have been payable based on the Companys level of
achievement of the applicable performance targets for the entire 2021
calendar year (or other applicable performance period) which included the
Effective Time.

(g) Parent shall be responsible for any obligations under the Worker

(h) At the Effective Time, participants in the Companys cash or deferred
savings plan or the non-qualified deferred compensation plan who are invested
in Company stock through the Companys cash or deferred savings plan or non-

other shareholders of the Company. After such date, participants in the
Companys cash or deferred savings plan or non-qualified deferred
compensation plan may not direct any further investments into Company stock
through the Companys cash or deferred savings plan or non-qualified deferred
compensation plan. The Company, the Company Board of Directors, the
compensation committee of the Company Board of Directors or other committee of
the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions
which are reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 6.10(h)_.

 



62

    

(i) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in
any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of
Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate
the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason with or
without cause. Additionally, the Company, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
agree that the employment with the Company and its Affiliates of the
individuals listed on _Section_ __ _ 6.10(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall end as of the Effective Time, and such individuals will be
entitled to receive severance and other benefits as if their employment were
terminated by the Company without cause as of the Effective Time in connection
with a "change in control" of the Company, in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company Plans.

 

(j) From and after the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
or its subsidiaries, as applicable, to honor the terms of each Company
Collective Bargaining Agreement until such Company Collective Bargaining
Agreement otherwise expires pursuant to its terms or is modified by the
parties thereto.

 

(k) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an
amendment or other modification of any Company Plan, (ii) prevent Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent from amending or terminating
any Company Plans in accordance with their terms, (iii) create any third-
party rights in any current or former Company Employee or service provider of
the Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof) or
any collective bargaining representative of the Company or any Affiliate
thereof or (iv) prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of
Parent from terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee for any
reason.

 

SECTION 6.11 Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance.

 

Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving
Corporation hereby agrees, to do the following:

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and
directors of, and individuals performing equivalent functions for, the Company
and its subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time or related to
this Agreement to the fullest extent permitted by the NMBCA or any other
applicable Law or provided under the Company Articles of Incorporation and the
Company Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement. From and after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing, no Company Party shall enter
into or amend any indemnification or similar agreement with or for the benefit
of any Indemnified Party without Parents prior written consent. Subject to
the prior sentences, in the event of any threatened or pending claim, action,
suit, proceeding or

 



63

    

 investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and
whether formal or informal (each, a " _Proceeding_ ") to which an Indemnified
Party is a party or with respect to which an Indemnified Party is otherwise
involved (including as a witness), arising in whole or in part out of or
pertaining in whole or in part to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or
was an officer or director of, or an individual performing an equivalent
function for, the Company or any of its subsidiaries (including any Proceeding
arising out of or pertaining to matters occurring or existing or alleged to
have occurred or existed, or acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred, at or prior to the Effective Time, or arising out of or pertaining
to this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby), (i)
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, advance fees, costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred by each
Indemnified Party in connection with and prior to the final disposition of
such Proceedings, such fees, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees
and disbursements) to be advanced within thirty (30) Business Days of receipt
by Parent from the Indemnified Party of a written request therefor; _provided_
that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if
not prohibited by the NMBCA, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification, and (ii)
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any civil Proceeding in which
indemnification could reasonably be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all civil liability arising out of
such Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents (for the
avoidance of doubt, this clause (ii) does not apply to criminal or quasi-
criminal liabilities from or arising out of any Proceedings), and (iii) the
Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such
matter. In the event any claim for indemnification is asserted or made by any
Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_, any determination
required to be made with respect to whether such Indemnified Partys conduct
complies with the standards under the NMBCA, the Surviving Corporation Charter
or other applicable Law shall be made by independent legal counsel selected
by the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under  _Section_
__ _ 6.11(a)_, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall promptly notify
Parent thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the
Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party
except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying
Party.

(c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation Charter and
Surviving Corporation Bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors and officers and advancement of expenses that, solely to the extent
affecting the Indemnified Persons (in their capacity as such) are no less
advantageous to the Indemnified Persons than the corresponding provisions in
the Companys Charter Documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pay the
premium for the non-cancellable "tail" insurance policies with respect to the
Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies and the
Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, " _D
andO Insurance_"), in each case for a claims reporting or

 



64

    

 discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time
with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance with benefits and levels of coverage that are no less favorable than
the benefits and levels of coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading
statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed
against a director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries by
reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Company or
the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such "tail"
insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in
effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time,
the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the Companys current
insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance with benefits and levels of coverage that are no less favorable than
the benefits and levels of coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase
from the Companys current insurance carrier, or from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance
carrier with respect to DandO Insurance, comparable DandO Insurance for such six-
year period with benefits and levels of coverage that are no less favorable
than as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof; 
_provided_ that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual
premium amount in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in
its last full fiscal year, which amount is set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.11(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if an Indemnified Party
is a party to or is otherwise involved (including as a witness) in any
Proceeding with respect to which such Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ (whether arising before, at
or after the Effective Time) on or prior to the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall
continue in effect until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

 

(f) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_.

 

(g) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_
shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the Company
Articles of Incorporation or

 



65

    

 Company Bylaws or any the articles of incorporation, bylaws or other similar
constitutional documents of any subsidiary of the Company, under the NMBCA or
any other applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Party with
the Company or any of its subsidiaries. These rights shall survive
consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party.

 

SECTION 6.12 Transaction Litigation. In the event that any shareholder
litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is brought, or to the Companys knowledge,
threatened in writing against the Company or any members of the Company Board
of Directors after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time
(the " _Transaction Litigation_ "), the Company shall promptly notify Parent
of any such Transaction Litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably informed
with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate, at Parents expense, in the defense and
settlement of any Transaction Litigation and give due consideration to
Parents views with respect thereto, and the Company shall not settle or agree
to settle any Transaction Litigation without Parents prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 

SECTION 6.13 Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent shall take all action necessary
to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

SECTION 6.14 Rule 16b-3. The Company Board of Directors and the Parent Board
of Directors shall, prior to the Effective Time, each take such reasonable
steps, consistent with the interpretive guidelines of the SEC, to cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the conversion of the
Company Stock Awards set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.2_) to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Each of Parent and the Company
shall provide to counsel for the other Party for its review copies of such
resolutions to be adopted by its board of directors prior to such adoption and
each Party shall provide the other Party with such information as shall be
reasonably necessary for the board of directors of such Party to set forth
the information required in the resolutions of such board of directors.

SECTION 6.15 Dividend. If the Closing Date occurs after the record date for a
regular quarterly cash dividend payable to holders of the Company Shares and
prior to the payment date of such dividend (the " _Final Quarterly Dividend_
"), then the Surviving Corporation will cause to be paid, out of the Exchange
Fund, the Final Quarterly Dividend following the Closing on the scheduled
payment date for such dividend.

 

SECTION 6.16 Further Assistance.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing, subject to
the conditions and limitations and upon the terms of this Agreement, each
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts (subject to, and in accordance
with, applicable Law and the terms of this Agreement) to take promptly, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to carry out the intent
and purposes of this Agreement, to fulfill and satisfy each condition within
the control of such Party and to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the

 



66

    

 Merger. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to the
conditions and limitations and upon the terms of this Agreement, each Party
shall reasonably cooperate with the other Parties, shall execute and deliver
such further documents, certificates, agreements and instruments and shall
take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by the other Parties to
evidence or reflect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the execution and delivery of all documents, certificates,
agreements and instruments reasonably necessary for all filings hereunder).

 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement and to the
extent not prohibited by applicable Law, the Company and Parent shall
establish a transition committee (the " _Transition Committee_ ") consisting
of two (2) representatives designated by each of the Company and Parent. The
activities of the Transition Committee shall include, to the extent
not prohibited by applicable Law, the development of regulatory plans and
proposals, the facilitation of the transfer of information between the Parties
and other matters as the Transition Committee deems appropriate. At all times
after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time (or the earlier
termination of this Agreement as provided in _Article VIII_ ), there shall be
two (2) representatives of Parent on the Transition Committee that shall be
designated by Parent as the primary contact person for the Company at Parent
(the " _Parent Contacts_ ") and two (2) representatives of the Company on the
Transition Committee that shall be designated by the Company as the primary
contact person for Parent at the Company (the " _Company Contacts_ "). In the
event that either the Company or Parent elects to request that the other
consent to any action or matter involving such Party or any of its
subsidiaries or Joint Ventures as is contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ or
_Section_ __ _ 5.2_, as applicable, the Parties shall make all such requests
to the Parent Contacts or the Company Contacts, as applicable, and each Party
agrees that it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
respective contact to respond as promptly as practicable to any such request,
taking into account the nature of the request, the circumstances under which
the request is made and the timing indicated in the request. The Parent
Contacts shall initially be the individuals set forth on _Section_ __ _
6.16(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (and may be changed by Parent from
time to time by written notice from Parent to the Company) and the Company
Contacts shall initially be the individuals set forth on _Section_ __ _
6.16(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (and may be changed by the Company
from time to time by written notice from the Company to Parent after
consultation between Parent and the Company).

SECTION 6.17 State Anti-Takeover Statutes. Without limiting anything
contained in this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall (a) take all
action within its power to ensure that no state anti-takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement,
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and (b) if any state anti-takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all action within its power
to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

SECTION 6.18 Platinum Indebtedness. The Company shall, and shall cause each of
its subsidiaries to, execute and deliver to each of the lenders (either
directly or through

 



67

    

 the applicable administrative or other agent for the lenders) with respect
to the indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries set forth on _Schedule
6.18_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Existing Lenders_ ") one or
more notices (each, an " _Existing Loan Notice_ ") prepared by the Company in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, notifying each of the
Existing Lenders of this Agreement and the contemplated Merger. The Existing
Loan Notice with respect to one or more of the Existing Lenders shall include
a request for a consent or waiver, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Parent (an " _Existing Loan Consent_ "), to (i) in the case of the initial
Existing Loan Notice to be provided to an Existing Lender immediately
following the date hereof, the execution of this Agreement, and in the case of
any additional Existing Loan Notice provided to an Existing Lender prior to
Closing, the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) certain modifications of (or waivers
under or other changes to) any agreement or documentation relating to the
Companys or its subsidiaries, as applicable, relationship with such Existing
Lender; _provided, however,_ that no such modifications, waivers or changes
pursuant to this clause (ii) shall be effective prior to the Effective Time.
Subject to and without limiting anything contained in the definition of
"Material Adverse Effect" and the related condition in respect of the Company
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and
agree that the obtaining of any Existing Loan Consent is not a condition to
the Closing. Each party shall be responsible for its own fees and other
Liabilities (including any consent fees or any other fees, costs, expenses or
other amounts payable to or on behalf of the Existing Lenders, which shall all
be payable by the Company) incurred in connection with this _Section_ __ _
6.18_ and the Existing Loan Consents.

 

SECTION 6.19 Four Corners Divestiture. The Company acknowledges that Parent,
Iridium and the Company each have stated goals relating to decarbonization
and, in this regard, the Company has previously announced its intention to
exit from the Four Corners Power Plant earlier than the date on which its
ownership agreement currently provides. Accordingly, the Company agrees that,
as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, PNM,
shall (a) enter into definitive agreements providing for exit from all
ownership interests in the Four Corners Power Plant, substantially in the form
made available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement or in such other
form as is reasonably acceptable to Parent (collectively, the " _Four Corners
Divestiture Agreements_ ") and (b) make all applicable regulatory filings
and take all commercially reasonable actions in order to obtain required
approvals from applicable Governmental Entities, all with the objective of
having the closing date for such exit to occur as promptly as practicable but
in any event no later than December 31, 2024.

SECTION 6.20 Commitment Letter; Financing Cooperation.

 

(a) _Commitment Letter_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain in full force and effect the Commitment Letter and to take all
actions and do all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter on or prior to the Closing
Date to the extent necessary to pay the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration at the Closing. Parent shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Company (which consent shall be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), enter into any amendment, replacement, supplement or
modification to the Commitment Letter if such amendment or modification would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the payment of the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration to the Exchange Agent pursuant to
this Agreement).

 



68

    

(b) _Financing Cooperation_. The Company shall, and shall cause each of
its subsidiaries to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its and their respective Representatives to, provide to Parent such
customary cooperation, at Parents expense, as may reasonably be requested by
Parent to assist Parent in obtaining the financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Financing_ "),
including making management of the Company and its subsidiaries reasonably
available to participate in a reasonable number of meetings and
presentations, requesting the Companys independent auditors to cooperate with
Parent, furnishing to Parent information reasonably requested by Parent to
permit the consummation of the Financing (including any financial and other
information concerning the Company and its subsidiaries required for the
preparation and filing with the SEC any required offering documents relating
to the Financing, and otherwise comply with SEC and other applicable
Laws requirements related thereto). In furtherance of the foregoing, the
Company agrees to correct promptly any information provided by it for use in
connection with the Financing if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and
agree that their obligations hereunder are not conditioned in any manner upon
Parent or Merger Sub obtaining the Financing or any other financing. The
failure to pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with
_Article II_ at the Closing shall constitute a breach of this Agreement by
Parent.

__ _ 7.2(b)_;

 

(ii) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, in accordance with, and
subject to, and in compliance with, all of the terms and conditions of,

satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the

the Company through the exercise of its reasonable best efforts, then, until

failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _
7.3(b)_;

connection with the Required Regulatory Approvals) or pursuant to _Section_ __

satisfied at the Closing, but which condition would be satisfied or would be
capable of being satisfied if the Closing Date were then to occur), (4) one or

assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, any claim that it is not

reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 9.13_, that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that the
