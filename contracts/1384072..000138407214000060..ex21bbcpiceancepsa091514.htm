ARTICLE 2 
PURCHASE PRICE

Section 2.01 Purchase Price. The total consideration for the purchase, sale,
and conveyance of the Assets to Buyer and Buyer's assumption of the Assumed
Obligations and all other liabilities provided for in this Agreement, is
Buyer's payment to Seller of the sum of Five Hundred Twenty-Five Million
Dollars ($525,000,000.00) (the "Purchase Price"), as adjusted in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 2.02 Deposit.

(a) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement by Buyer and Seller,
Buyer shall deliver to Seller in immediately available funds a performance
guarantee deposit in an amount equal to Fifty-Two Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($52,500,000.00) (the "Deposit") in accordance with wire
transfer instructions provided by Seller to Buyer.

(b) Subject to the proviso set forth in Section 11.01, if this Agreement is
terminated by Seller pursuant to Section 11.01(b) and Seller does not waive
the non-satisfaction of any conditions to Closing set forth in ARTICLE 8,
Seller shall retain the Deposit as liquidated damages, which remedy shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy available to Seller for Buyer's failure to
perform its obligations under this Agreement, and Seller expressly waives any
and all other remedies, legal or equitable, that it otherwise may have for
Buyer's breach of this Agreement or failure or refusal to close and Buyer
shall have no further liability or obligation hereunder. Buyer and Seller
acknowledge and agree that (i) Seller's actual damages upon the event of such
a termination are difficult to ascertain with any certainty, (ii) the Deposit
is a reasonable estimate of such actual damages, and (iii) such liquidated
damages do not constitute a penalty.

(c) Subject to the proviso set forth in Section 11.01, if this Agreement is
terminated (i) by Buyer pursuant to Section 11.01(c) and Buyer does not waive
the non‑satisfaction of any conditions to Closing set forth in ARTICLE 9 or
(ii) by Buyer or Seller pursuant to Section 11.01(a), Section 11.01(d),
Section 11.01(e), Section 11.01(f), Section 11.01(g), Section 11.01(h) or
Section 13.03(c), then Seller shall promptly return the Deposit to Buyer in
immediately available funds pursuant to wire transfer instructions to be
provided timely by Buyer to Seller within three (3) business days after the
event giving rise to such return obligation. Buyer and Seller shall thereupon
have the rights and obligations set forth elsewhere herein.

 (d) If all conditions precedent to the obligations of Seller set forth in
ARTICLE 8 have been met, then notwithstanding any provision in this Section
2.02 to the contrary, if Closing does not occur because Seller wrongfully
fails to tender performance at Closing or otherwise Breaches this Agreement in
any respect prior to Closing, and Buyer is ready and otherwise able to close,
at Buyer's sole election, either (i) Seller shall return the Deposit to Buyer
within three (3) business days after its receipt of Buyer's written demand for
the return of the Deposit in accordance with this Agreement, or (ii) Buyer
shall have the right to pursue specific performance of this Agreement,
provided that Buyer must file an action for specific performance within
twenty-one (21) days of Seller's Breach. If Buyer elects to pursue specific
performance, Buyer must pursue specific performance as its sole and exclusive
remedy in lieu of all other legal and equitable remedies. If such action for
specific performance is not filed within twenty-one (21) days of Seller's
Breach or if Buyer is unsuccessful for any reason other than a Breach of this
Agreement by Buyer, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived all legal and
equitable remedies and its sole remedy for Seller's Breach of this Agreement
shall be limited to the prompt return of the Deposit.

Section 2.03 Allocated Values. The Purchase Price is allocated among the
Assets on a well-by-well basis, including for each Well, PUD Location and
PDNP, all as set forth in Exhibit C (the "Allocated Values"). In no event
shall the aggregate of the Allocated Values exceed the unadjusted Purchase
Price. The term "PUD Locations" means those Proved Undeveloped potential well
locations specifically identified in Exhibit C. The term "PDNP" means Proved
Developed Not Producing intervals as specifically identified on Exhibit C.
Seller and Buyer agree that the Allocated Values shall be used to compute any
adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to the provisions of ARTICLE 4. Any
adjustment to the Purchase Price hereunder shall be reflected in the
allocation set forth in Exhibit C consistent with Treasury Regulation Section
1.1060-IT(f). For tax purposes, the Parties agree to report the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the terms of this
Agreement, including the allocations set forth above as of the Closing Date,
and that neither Party will take any position inconsistent therewith,
including in any tax return, refund claim, litigation, arbitration, or
otherwise.

Section 2.04 Section 1031 Like-Kind Exchange. Seller and Buyer hereby agree
that Seller shall have the right at any time prior to completion of all the
transactions that are to occur at Closing to assign all or a portion of its
rights under this Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary (as that term is
defined in Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(v) of the Treasury Regulations) in order
to accomplish the transaction in a manner that will comply, either in whole or
in part, with the requirements of a like-kind exchange pursuant to Section
1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Likewise, Buyer shall
have the right at any time prior to completion of all the transactions that
are to occur at Closing to assign all or a portion of its rights under this
Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary for the same purpose. If Seller assigns
all or any of its rights under this Agreement for this purpose, Buyer agrees
to (a) consent to Seller's assignment of its rights in this Agreement, which
assignment shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer, and (b) pay the
Purchase Price (or a designated portion thereof as specified by Seller) into a
qualified escrow or qualified trust account at Closing as directed in writing.
If Buyer assigns all or any of its rights under this Agreement for this
purpose, Seller agrees to (i) consent to Buyer's assignment of its rights in
this Agreement, which assignment shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to
Seller, (ii) accept the Purchase Price from the qualified escrow or qualified
trust account at Closing, and (iii) at Closing,

 convey and assign directly to Buyer the Assets (or any portion thereof) as
directed by Buyer. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that any assignment
of this Agreement (or any rights hereunder) to a Qualified Intermediary shall
not release any Party from any of its respective liabilities and obligations
hereunder, and that neither Party represents to the other Party that any
particular tax treatment will be given to any Party as a result thereof. The
Party electing to assign all or any of its rights under this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the
other Party and its affiliates from all Claims relating to such election.

ARTICLE 3 
EFFECTIVE TIME

Section 3.01 Ownership of Assets. If the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof, the ownership
of the Assets shall be transferred from Seller to Buyer on the Closing Date,
but effective for all purposes as of 7:00 a.m. Mountain Time on July 1, 2014
(the "Effective Time");

Section 3.02 Production Imbalances. Upon Closing, subject to the adjustments
described in Section 10.02(b), Buyer shall assume the positions of Seller with
respect to all gas imbalances and make-up obligations related to the Assets
regardless of whether such imbalances or make-up obligations arise before or
after the Effective Time, at the wellhead, pipeline, gathering system, or
other location, and regardless of whether the same arise under contract or
otherwise ("Production Imbalances"). As a result of such assumption, Buyer
shall (a) be entitled to receive any and all benefits which Seller would have
been entitled to receive by virtue of its position, including rights to
produce and receive volumes of production in excess of volumes which it would
otherwise have been entitled to produce and to receive cash gas balancing by
virtue of ownership of the Assets, (b) be obligated to suffer any detriments
or losses which Seller would have been obligated to suffer by virtue of such
position, including the obligation to deliver to others production volumes
which would have otherwise been attributable to its ownership of the Assets,
to deliver production to purchasers thereof without Buyer receiving full
payment therefor, or to make cash balancing payments or to repay any take or
pay payments, and (c) be responsible for any and all royalty obligations and
other burdens with respect to such Production Imbalances; provided however,
nothing in this Section 3.02 shall relieve Seller from any royalty obligation
affecting production Seller has actually received for production occurring
prior to the Effective Time.

ARTICLE 4 
TITLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Section 4.01 Examination Period. From the date of this Agreement through 11:59
p.m. Central Time on September 26, 2014 (the "Notification Date"), Seller
shall permit Buyer and/or its representatives to examine during normal
business days and hours at a location designated by Seller, all abstracts of
title, title opinions, title files, ownership maps, lease, Well, and division
order files, assignments, operating, and accounting records and all Leases,
Surface Agreements, Permits, Contracts, and other agreements, data, analyses,
and information pertaining to the Assets insofar as the same may now be in
existence and in the possession of Seller (or agent or Representative of
Seller), subject to such restrictions upon disclosure as may exist under
confidentiality or other agreements binding upon Seller and relating to the
data. If there are any documents that Seller

 cannot provide Buyer due to a confidentiality requirement, Seller shall
describe to Buyer the withheld document and cooperate with Buyer to obtain
access thereto from the third party if Buyer so requests.

Section 4.02 Title Defects. The term "Title Defect" means any encumbrance on,
encroachment on, irregularity in, defect in, or objection to Seller's
ownership of the Assets (excluding Permitted Encumbrances) that causes Seller
not to have Marketable Title to a particular Lease, including any Well, PUD
Location, and PDNP, all as described in Exhibit C. The term "Marketable Title"
means such ownership by Seller in the Assets that, subject to and except for
the Permitted Encumbrances, is free of restrictions that would prevent the
development of Hydrocarbons from the Subject Interests consistent with current
practices and:

(a) entitles Seller to receive not less than the percentage set forth in
Exhibit C as Seller's Net Revenue Interest of all Hydrocarbons produced,
saved, and marketed from such Lease, including any Well, PUD Location, and
PDNP, all without reduction, suspension, or termination of such interest
throughout the productive life of such Well, except as specifically set forth
in such Exhibit;

(b) obligates Seller to bear not greater than the percentage set forth in
Exhibit C as Seller's Working Interest of the costs and expenses relating to
the maintenance, development, and operation of such Lease, including any Well,
PUD Location, and PDNP, all without increase throughout the productive life of
such Well, except as specifically set forth in such exhibit;

(c) is free and clear of all liens and encumbrances; and

(d) entitles Buyer to use, without subjecting Buyer to a Claim of trespass,
all roads, power lines, pits, reservoirs, and pipelines (water and
Hydrocarbon) necessary for the operations of the Assets as they are currently
being used by Seller.

Section 4.03 Notice of Title Defects. Buyer shall provide Seller notice of all
purported Title Defects no later than 11:59 p.m. Central Time on the
Notification Date; provided, however, that (1) Buyer agrees that it will use
reasonable efforts to furnish Seller, at the end of each week until the
Notification Date, written notice of any Title Defect that Buyer discovers or
learns about during that week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and
supplemented prior to the Notification Date, and (2) the failure of Buyer to
give Seller such preliminary notice will not waive any Title Defects or
constitute a breach of this Agreement. To be effective, such notice must (a)
be in writing, (b) be received by Seller on or prior to the Notification Date,
(c) describe the Title Defect in reasonable detail (including any alleged
variance in the Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest), (d) identify the
specific Asset or Assets affected by such Title Defect, (e) include the Title
Defect Value and supporting calculations prepared by Buyer in good faith, (f)
Buyer's suggested means to address the Title Defect, including any suggested
curative work, and (g) comply with the limitations and Title Defect Value
qualifications set forth in Section 4.14. Any matters identified by Buyer
prior to or on the Notification Date that constitute Title Defects, but of
which Seller has not been specifically notified by Buyer in accordance with
the foregoing, shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all purposes
and shall constitute Permitted Encumbrances and Assumed Obligations. On
September 29, 2014, the Parties shall meet and determine upon which of the
Title Defects, Title Defect Values, and methods of cure the Parties have
reached agreement. "Net Revenue

 Interest" means with respect to any Asset as of the Effective Time, the
interest in and to all Hydrocarbons produced, saved, and sold from or
allocated to such Asset, after giving effect all royalties, overriding
royalties, production payments, carried interests, net profits interests,
reversionary interests, and other burdens upon, measured by, or payable out
of, production therefrom. "Working Interest" means with respect to any Asset
as of the Effective Time the interest in and to such Asset that is burdened
with the obligation to bear and pay costs and expenses of maintenance,
development, or operations on or in connection with such Asset. Upon the
receipt of such notice from Buyer, Seller shall have the option, but not the
obligation, for a period ending ninety (90) days after the Closing to cure
such Title Defect. If Seller should not elect to cure a Title Defect, and no
aspect of such Title Defect is reasonably in dispute, the Purchase Price shall
be adjusted for such Title Defect by the amount of the Title Defect Value.

(a) The value attributable to each Title Defect (the "Title Defect Value")
that is asserted by Buyer in the Title Defect notices shall be determined
based upon the criteria set forth below:

(i) If the Title Defect is a lien upon any Asset, the Title Defect Value is
the amount necessary to be paid to remove the lien from the affected Asset;

(ii) If the Title Defect asserted is that the Net Revenue Interest
attributable to any Lease, including any Well, PUD Location and PDNP, is less
than that stated in Exhibit C, then the Title Defect Value shall be the
absolute value of the number determined by the following formula:

Title Defect Value = A x (1 - [B/C])

| 
---|--- 

A

|

= Allocated Value for the affected Asset 

| 
---|--- 

B

|

= Correct Net Revenue Interest for the affected Asset 

| 
---|--- 

C

|

= Net Revenue Interest for the affected Asset as set forth on Exhibit C. 

(iii) If the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden, or
charge upon the affected Asset (including any increase in Working Interest for
which there is not a proportionate increase in Net Revenue Interest) for which
the economic detriment to Buyer is unliquidated, the amount of the Title
Defect Value shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of
the affected Asset, the portion of the Asset affected by the Title Defect, the
legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential discounted economic effect of
the Title Defect over the life of the affected Asset, and the Title Defect
Values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller;

(iv) If a Title Defect is not in effect or does not adversely affect an Asset
throughout the entire post Effective Time productive life of such Asset, such
fact shall be taken into account in determining the Title Defect Value;

 (v) The Title Defect Value of a Title Defect shall be determined without
duplication of any costs or losses included in another Title Defect Value
hereunder;

(vi) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall a
Title Defect Value exceed the Allocated Value of the Leases, Wells, PUD
Locations, and PDNPs or other Assets affected thereby;

(vii) If the Title Defect Value of an Asset is equal to the Allocated Value of
such Asset, the affected Asset shall remain in the purchase and sale
contemplated by this Agreement, but the Purchase Price shall be adjusted
accordingly;

(viii) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4.03 to the contrary,
the Title Defect Value of any Title Defect comprising a required consent not
obtained (other than consents customarily obtained after Closing) shall be
determined pursuant to Section 4.07 and Section 7.05; and

(ix) Such other factors as are reasonably necessary to make a proper
evaluation.

(b) The term Title Defect shall not include (i) those matters deemed not to
impair marketability in accordance with the applicable Colorado title
standards, or (ii) any assertion, claim or contention of any kind that any
Lease has terminated due to a lack of production in paying quantities.

Section 4.04 Remedies for Title Defects.

(a) For any Title Defect noticed pursuant to Section 4.03 that has not been
cured at or prior to Closing, the Purchase Price shall, subject to the
provisions of Section 4.14, be decreased at Closing by either (i) the amount
the Parties acting reasonably and in good faith agree in lieu of a cure of the
asserted Title Defect, or (ii) with respect to any Title Defect for which the
Parties have not yet agreed as to the validity of the Title Defect, the Title
Defect Value, or the manner of cure, then by the amount of the Title Defect
Value asserted by Buyer for such uncured or unadjusted Title Defect.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.04, if any
Title Defect is in the nature of a consent to assignment that is not obtained
or other restriction on assignment, the provisions of Section 4.07 and Section
7.05 shall apply.

(c) If at the expiration of thirty (30) days after Closing, the Parties have
not agreed upon the validity of any asserted Title Defect, the appropriate
cure of the same, or the Title Defect Value attributable thereto, either Party
shall have the right to elect to have any such dispute determined by an
Independent Expert pursuant to Section 4.13.

(d) Once a Title Defect is cured within the time specified in Section 4.03, by
Seller at its sole cost and expense to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction, or the
existence or value of

 the Title Defect is determined with finality either by agreement between the
Parties or in accordance with Section 4.13, Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller
(i) in the case of a Title Defect which is cured, the amount the Purchase
Price was decreased at Closing as a result of this previously uncured Title
Defect or (ii) in the case of an Asset affected by an unresolved Title Defect
and for which the validity of the Title Defect or the Title Defect Value is
determined with finality whether by agreement or in accordance with Section
4.13, the difference, if any, between the amount the Purchase Price was
decreased at Closing as a consequence of such asserted and unresolved Title
Defect and the amount determined with finality.

Section 4.05 Special Warranty of Title. Except as to the fee interests among
the Assets, the transfer of the Assets by Seller to Buyer shall be
accomplished with an Assignment and Bills of Sale (an "Assignment") in the
form of Exhibit D. Special Warranty Deeds in the form of Exhibit E-1 and
Exhibit E-2 (the "Special Warranty Deeds") will be used to convey to Buyer
Seller's fee surface estate interests among the Garfield Properties. A special
warranty mineral deed in the form of Exhibit E-3 (the "Special Mineral Deed")
will be used by Seller to convey to Buyer all of Seller's fee Hydrocarbon
interests among the Garfield Properties.

(a) The Assignment, the Special Warranty Deed and the Special Mineral Deed
shall each be effective as of the Effective Time and shall each provide for a
special warranty of title, by, through, and under Seller, subject to the
Permitted Encumbrances and the terms of this Agreement. The term "Permitted
Encumbrances" shall mean any of the following matters to the extent the same
are valid and subsisting and affect the Assets as of the Effective Time;

(i) the terms, conditions, restrictions, exceptions, reservations,
limitations, and other matters contained in (including any liens or security
interests created by law or reserved in oil and gas leases for royalty, bonus,
or rental, or created to secure compliance with the terms of) the Contracts,
Surface Agreements, Leases, and any other agreements, instruments, documents,
and other matters described or referred to in any Exhibit or Schedule hereto;
provided, that, such matters do not operate to (i) reduce the Net Revenue
Interest of Seller in any Lease, Well, PUD Location and PDNP as reflected in
Exhibit C, or (ii) increase the proportionate share of costs and expenses of
leasehold operations attributable to or to be borne by the Working Interest of
Seller with respect to any Lease as reflected in Exhibit C, unless there is a
proportionate increase in Seller's applicable Net Revenue Interest;

(ii) any obligations or duties affecting the Assets to any Governmental
Authority with respect to any franchise, grant, license, or permit, and all
applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, regulations, guidances,
ordinances, decrees, and orders of any Governmental Authority ("Laws");

(iii) all royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests, carried
interests, production payments, reversionary interests, and other burdens on
or deductions from the proceeds of production created or in existence as of
the Effective Time, that do not (i) reduce the Net Revenue Interest of Seller
in any Lease, Well, PUD Location and PDNP as reflected in Exhibit C, or (ii)
increase the proportionate share of costs and expenses of leasehold operations
attributable to or to be borne by the Working

 Interest of Seller with respect to any Lease, Well, PUD Location and PDNP as
reflected in Exhibit C, unless there is a proportionate increase in Seller's
applicable Net Revenue Interest;

(iv) preferential rights to purchase or similar agreements (i) with respect to
which (A) waivers or consents are obtained from the appropriate parties for
the transaction contemplated hereby, or (B) required notices have been given
for the transaction contemplated hereby to the holders of such rights and the
appropriate period for asserting such rights has expired without an exercise
of such rights, or (ii) not exercised prior to Closing, subject to Section
4.06;

(v) required third party consents to assignments or similar agreements with
respect to which (i) waivers or consents have been obtained from the
appropriate parties for the transaction contemplated hereby, or (ii) required
notices have been given for the transaction contemplated hereby to the holders
of such rights and the appropriate period for asserting such rights has
expired without an exercise of such rights;

(vi) all rights to consent by, required notices to, filings with, or other
actions by, Governmental Authorities in connection with the sale, transfer, or
conveyance of the Assets that are customarily obtained after such sale or
conveyance;

(vii) rights reserved to or vested in any Governmental Authority to control or
regulate any of the Wells or units included in the Assets and the applicable
laws, rules, and regulations of such Governmental Authorities;

(viii) conventional rights of reassignment contained in any Leases, or
assignments thereof, providing for reassignment upon a decision to surrender
or abandon any Leases;

(ix) statutory liens for Taxes or assessments not yet due and delinquent;

(x) easements, rights‑of‑way, servitudes, permits, surface leases, and other
rights with respect to surface operations, on, over or in respect of any of
the Assets of which Buyer has notice, either actual, constructive, or inquiry;

(xi) materialmen's, mechanics', operators' or other similar liens arising in
the ordinary course of business (i) if such liens and charges have not been
filed pursuant to law and the time for filing such liens and charges has
expired, or (ii) if filed, such liens and charges have not yet become due and
payable or payment is being withheld as provided by law;

(xii) such Title Defects as Buyer has waived;

 (xiii) all deeds of trust and other security interests burdening the Assets
granted by Seller in connection with its Third Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement dated as of March 16, 2010, as further amended, under which JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. serves as administrative agent (the "JPMorgan Chase Liens"),
it being understood that the release of the JPMorgan Chase Liens is a
condition to the Closing as provided in Section 10.07(e); and

(xiv) any claim, assertion, contention or claim that any Lease has expired due
to a lack of production in paying quantities.

Section 4.06 Preferential Rights to Purchase.

(a) Seller shall use diligent efforts, but without any obligation to incur
anything but reasonable costs and expenses in connection therewith, to comply
with all preferential rights to purchase provisions relative to any Asset
prior to the Closing, all of which are identified on Schedule 4.06.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer if any of such
preferential purchase rights are exercised or if the requisite period has
elapsed without such rights having been exercised.

(c) If a third party who has been offered an interest in any Asset pursuant to
a preferential right to purchase elects prior to the Closing to purchase all
or part of such Assets, and the closing of such transaction does occur on or
before the Closing Date, then the interest or part thereof so affected will be
excluded from the Assets and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of such Assets without the requirement for Buyer to give
notice. If any such third party has elected to purchase all or a part of an
interest in any Asset subject to a preferential right to purchase but has
failed to close the transaction by the Closing Date, or if the election period
has not run and no election has been made, then the affected portion of the
Assets shall be excluded from the Assets and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of such affected Assets. If the election period
passes without the exercise of such preferential right to purchase or if any
election previously exercised is rescinded in writing by the party previously
electing to purchase this affected Asset, all such Assets will be conveyed to
Buyer and Buyer shall pay the portion of the Purchase Price therefor.

Section 4.07 Consents to Assignment. The Leases and Surface Agreements subject
to a consent to assign are listed on Schedule 4.07. All other Contracts
subject to a consent to assign are listed on Schedule 4.07A. The consents to
assignment listed on Schedule 4.07A shall be governed solely by Section 7.04
below:

(a) Certain of the Leases and Surface Agreements listed on Schedule 4.07
provide, in words or substance, that any assignment of such instrument without
the consent holder's approval shall be null and void and/or constitute a
breach of such instruments ("Hard Consents"). Certain other of the Leases and
Surface Agreements listed in Schedule 4.07 provide, in words or substance,
that any assignment of such instrument shall be made only with consent
holder's approval, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld ("Soft
Consents").

 (b) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Seller shall send to each
consent holder identified on Schedule 4.07 a request that each such holder
consent to the assignment of his, her, their or its instrument to Buyer.
Except for out-of-pocket costs incurred to send and monitor the return of
these consents to assignment, Seller shall have no obligation to pay any
consideration necessary to obtain any consent.

(c) If the consent to assignment by the holder of any Hard Consent or Soft
Consent is properly and timely denied prior to the Closing, the affected Asset
shall be retained by Seller, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of such Asset without the requirement for Buyer to give
notice.

(d) If, as of the Closing Date, the time for a holder of a Hard Consent to
approve an assignment of a Lease or Surface Agreement has not elapsed, the
affected Asset shall be retained by Seller, and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of such Asset without the requirement for Buyer
to give notice.

(e) If, as of the Closing Date, no response is received from the holder of a
Soft Consent, such holder shall be conclusively deemed to have consented to
the assignment of his, her, their or its Lease or Surface Agreement, in which
event such Asset shall be transferred at Closing and Buyer shall pay the
Allocated Value thereof at Closing. From and after Closing Buyer shall have
fully responsibility for any Claim that may be later asserted by any such
consent holder contesting the validity of the assignment of his, her, their or
its instrument.

(f) If any holder of a Hard Consent or a Soft Consent prior to Closing
attaches conditions to the granting of a consent or denies such consent, the
Parties shall confer as to the appropriate response thereto. If a Soft Consent
is denied on inappropriate grounds, it will be deemed to have been granted.

(g) If, prior to the Final Settlement Date, Seller obtains any consent that
had been previously denied or Hard Consents that were not resolved prior to
the Closing, Seller shall convey the affected Asset using the appropriate
Assignment(s). Within seven (7) days of the receipt of such an Assignment and
a copy of the consent, Buyer shall pay Seller the Allocated Value therefor, as
adjusted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

Section 4.08 Remedies for Title Benefits.

(a) If, prior to the Notification Date, Seller or Buyer discovers any Title
Benefit affecting the Assets, such Party shall promptly notify the other Party
in writing thereof. Subject to Section 4.14, Seller shall be entitled to an
upward adjustment to the Purchase Price with respect to all Title Benefits in
an amount (the "Title Benefit Value") determined in accordance with the
formula provided for in this Section 4.08(a). The term "Title Benefit" shall
mean Seller's Net Revenue Interest in any Lease, Well, PUD Location and PDNP
that is greater than or in addition to the Net Revenue Interest set forth in
Exhibit C, or Seller's Working Interest in any Lease, Well, PUD Location and
PDNP that is less than the Working Interest set forth in Exhibit C (without a
proportionate decrease in the Net Revenue Interest). The Title Benefit Value
shall be the absolute value of the number determined by the following formula:

 Title Benefit Value = [A x (B/C)] - A

| 
---|--- 

A

|

= Allocated Value for the affected Asset 

| 
---|--- 

B

|

= Correct Net Revenue Interest for the affected Asset 

| 
---|--- 

C

|

= Net Revenue Interest for the affected Asset as set forth on Exhibit C. 

(b) If the Title Benefit represents a decrease in Working Interest for which
there is not a proportionate decrease in Net Revenue Interest, the amount of
the Title Benefit Value shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of the affected Asset, the portion of the Asset affected by
the Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential
discounted economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of the affected
Asset, and the Title Benefit Values placed upon the Title Benefit by Buyer and
Seller.

(c) If the Parties have not agreed on the amount of the Title Benefit Value of
a Title Benefit by the expiration of thirty (30) days after Closing, Seller or
Buyer shall have the right to elect to have such Title Benefit Value
determined by an Independent Expert pursuant to Section 4.13. If the Title
Benefit Value is not determined pursuant to this Agreement by the Closing, the
Purchase Price paid at Closing shall be increased, subject to Section 4.14, by
the Title Benefit Value determined by Seller, acting reasonably and in good
faith. Upon the final determination of Title Benefit Value either by mutual
agreement of the Parties or by the Independent Expert, (i) Seller shall refund
to Buyer the amount, if any, by which the amount so paid by Buyer at Closing
exceeds such Title Benefit Value, or (ii) Buyer shall pay to Seller the
amount, if any, by which such Title Benefit Value exceeds the amount so paid
by Buyer at Closing.

Section 4.09 Environmental Review. From the date of this Agreement through the
Notification Date Buyer may conduct an environmental assessment of the Assets,
subject to the following:

(a) Buyer shall have the right to conduct on‑site inspections, including, but
not limited to, Phase I testing (but not Phase II testing) (as those terms are
defined by the American Society for Testing and Materials) environmental
assessments of the Assets, including, but not limited to, sampling and
analysis of soil, air, surface water, groundwater and waste materials, prior
to the end of the Notification Date ("Buyer's Environmental Review") and
Seller shall provide to Buyer a copy of any environmental review Seller has in
its possession subject to the same terms of confidentiality subsequently set
forth herein;

(i) The cost and expense of Buyer's Environmental Review shall be borne solely
by Buyer;

(ii) All inspections must be coordinated through a designated representative
of Seller who may accompany Buyer during the course of Buyer's inspection of
the Assets;

 (iii) Buyer shall give Seller notice not less than 48 hours before any visits
by Buyer and/or its consultant to the Assets, and Buyer shall seek and obtain
Seller's prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) before
either Buyer or Buyer's consultant enters the Assets;

(iv) Buyer shall provide Seller a copy of any Phase I reports affecting the
Assets promptly after Buyer's receipt of the same;

(v) Buyer and/or its consultant shall perform all such work in a safe and
workmanlike manner, shall not unreasonably interfere with Seller's operations,
and shall comply with all Laws of applicable Governmental Authorities;

(vi) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third
party consents that are required in order to perform any work comprising
Buyer's Environmental Review; and

(vii) Buyer hereby agrees to release and defend, indemnify, and hold harmless
Seller and Seller's Representatives from and against all Claims made by (or
attributable to the acts or omissions of) Buyer or Buyer's Representatives
(INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM THE SOLE, JOINT, OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE (BUT
NOT WILLFUL MISCONDUCT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF SELLER OR
ANY OF SELLER'S REPRESENTATIVES) arising out of or relating to Buyer's
Environmental Review. The release and indemnity provisions of this Section
4.09 shall survive termination or Closing of this Agreement notwithstanding
anything to the contrary provided for in this Agreement.

(b) Unless otherwise required by applicable Laws, Buyer shall treat any
matters revealed by Buyer's Environmental Review and any environmental review
provided by Seller to Buyer, including any analyses, compilations, studies,
documents, reports, or data prepared or generated from such review, but
excluding any public information (the "Environmental Information"), as
confidential, and, except as provided below, Buyer shall not disclose any
Environmental Information to any Governmental Authority, or, prior to Closing
to any other third party without the prior written consent of Seller. Buyer
may use the Environmental Information prior to Closing only in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Environmental Information
shall be disclosed by Buyer to only those persons who need to know the
Environmental Information for purposes of evaluating the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, and who agree to be bound by the terms of this
Section 4.09. If Buyer or any third party to whom Buyer has provided any
Environmental Information is requested, compelled, or required to disclose any
of the Environmental Information prior to Closing, Buyer shall provide Seller
with prompt notice sufficiently prior to any such disclosure so as to allow
Seller to file for any protective order, or seek any other remedy, as it deems
appropriate under the circumstances. If this Agreement is terminated prior to
the Closing, upon Seller's request Buyer shall deliver the Environmental
Information, and all copies thereof and works based thereon, to Seller, which
Environmental Information shall become the sole property of Seller. Upon
request Buyer shall provide copies of the Environmental Information to Seller
without charge. The terms and provisions

 of this Section 4.09(b) shall survive any termination of this Agreement,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary.

Section 4.10 Definitions Used in ARTICLE 4 and in this Agreement.

(a) Environmental Defects. The term "Environmental Defect" shall mean, with
respect to any given Asset (including, without limitation, air, land, soil,
surface and subsurface strata, surface water, groundwater, or sediments), a
violation of or a condition that can reasonably be expected to give rise to a
violation of any Environmental Law in effect before the Closing Date in the
jurisdiction in which such Asset is located.

(b) Governmental Authority. The term "Governmental Authority" shall mean the
United States and any state, county, city, and political subdivisions that
exercises jurisdiction over the Assets, and any agency, court, department,
board, bureau, commission, or other division or instrumentality thereof.

(c) Environmental Laws. The term "Environmental Laws" shall mean any and all
laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, or orders of any Governmental
Authority pertaining to health and natural resources (but excluding laws,
orders, rules, and regulations that pertain to the prevention of waste or the
protection of correlative rights) and the protection of wildlife or the
environment including, without limitation, the Clean Air Act, as amended, the
Clean Water Act, as amended, the Comprehensive Environmental, Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA"), the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act of 1976, as amended ("RCRA"), the Safe Drinking Water Act, as
amended, the Toxic Substances Control Act, as amended, the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments Act of 1984, as amended, the Superfund Amendments and
Reauthorization Act of 1986, as amended, the Hazardous Materials
Transportation Act, as amended, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA"), any
state laws implementing the foregoing federal laws, or equivalent or analogous
state or local laws, statutes or ordinances, any regulation promulgated
thereunder, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to the handling of
oil and gas exploration and production wastes or the use, maintenance, and
closure of pits and impoundments, and all other environmental conservation or
protection laws in effect as of the Closing Date hereof that are applicable to
the Assets. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "hazardous substance,"
"release," and "disposal" have the meanings specified in the applicable
Environmental Laws as in effect as of the Closing Date.

(d) Environmental Defect Value. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Environmental Defect Value" shall mean, with respect to any Environmental
Defect, the estimated costs and expenses net to Seller's interest in the
affected portion of the Assets to correct and/or remediate such Environmental
Defect consistent with applicable Environmental Laws.

Section 4.11 Notice of Environmental Defects. Buyer shall provide Seller
notice of all Environmental Defects no later than 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time on
the Notification Date. To be effective, such notice must (a) be in writing,
(b) be received by Seller prior to the expiration of the Notification Date,
(c) describe the Environmental Defect in reasonable detail, including the
written conclusion of Buyer that an Environmental Defect exists, which
conclusion shall be reasonably substantiated by the factual data gathered in
Buyer's Environmental Review, (d) identify the specific

 Assets affected by such Environmental Defect, (e) set forth the procedures
recommended to correct the Environmental Defect, (f) set forth Buyer's
reasonable, good faith estimate of the Environmental Defect Value, including
supporting calculations for such estimate, and (g) comply with the
Environmental Defect Value provisions of Section 4.14. Any matters that may
constitute Environmental Defects, but of which Seller has not been
specifically notified by Buyer in accordance with the foregoing, together with
any environmental matter that does not constitute an Environmental Defect,
shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all purposes and constitute
an Assumed Obligation. Upon receipt of notices of Environmental Defects, the
Parties shall meet and determine upon which of the Environmental Defects,
Environmental Defect Values, and methods of correction the Parties have
reached agreement. Upon the receipt of such effective notice from Buyer,
Seller shall have the option, but not the obligation, to attempt to correct to
Buyer's reasonable satisfaction such Environmental Defect during a period
expiring ninety (90) days after Closing.

Section 4.12 Remedies for Environmental Defects.

(a) If, as of the Closing Date, the Assets are affected by an uncured or
otherwise unresolved Environmental Defect noticed pursuant to the provisions
of Section 4.11, the affected portion of the Assets shall not be sold,
transferred, or conveyed to Buyer at Closing, and the Purchase Price shall,
subject to the terms of Section 4.14, be decreased by the Allocated Value of
the portion of the Assets so affected. Thereafter, Buyer and Seller shall act
reasonably and in good faith either (i) to agree (y) as to the manner of cure
for such Environmental Defect or (z) the value of such Environmental Defect
and adjust the Final Settlement Statement in the amount thereof net of any
Purchase Price adjustment made at Closing, in which event the affected portion
of the Assets shall be conveyed to Buyer; provided that if option (y) is
agreed to, no assignment of the affected portion of the Assets shall be made
as between Seller and Buyer until such agreed cure is accomplished to Buyer's
reasonable satisfaction whereupon the Allocated Value previously deducted from
the Purchase Price shall be paid by Buyer to Seller, or (ii) with respect to
any Environmental Defect as to which the Parties are unable to agree within 30
days of Closing as to the validity of the Environmental Defect, the
Environmental Defect Value, or the manner of correction, submit such matter to
be determined by an Independent Expert pursuant to Section 4.13.

(b) With respect to any Asset which is not sold, transferred, or conveyed to
Buyer at the Closing pursuant to the terms of Section 4.12(a), after the
Closing and at such time as any Environmental Defect Value or the manner of
correction for an Environmental Defect is determined and, in either event, the
amount thereof is determined to be less than the Allocated Value for the
affected portion of the Assets, Seller shall have the right (i) in the case of
an Environmental Defect Value determination, to have the Purchase Price
reduced by only the Environmental Defect Value as so determined or (ii) in the
case of the cure determination, to elect to cure the Environmental Defect to
Buyer's reasonable satisfaction. The consequence of (i) shall be that Buyer
will pay to Seller an amount equal to the Allocated Value for the affected
Assets minus the Environmental Defect Value and the affected portion of the
Assets previously retained by Seller shall be conveyed to Buyer. The
consequence of (ii) shall be that upon achieving Buyer's written
acknowledgement that the Environmental Defect has been cured to its reasonable
satisfaction, the Allocated Value for such previously retained Asset shall be
paid to Seller and the affected portion of the Assets shall be conveyed to
Buyer. If no Environmental Defect is determined to exist, Buyer shall pay the
Allocated

 Value attributable to the affected portion of the Assets to Seller, and Seller
shall convey the previously retained portion of the Assets to Buyer. If the
Environmental Defect Value or the cost to cure an Environmental Defect is
determined to be greater than the Allocated Value of the affected portion of
the Assets, Seller shall retain the affected portion of the Assets, and the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value attributable to such
portion of the Assets.

Section 4.13 Independent Experts.

(a) Any disputes regarding Title Defects, Title Benefits, Environmental
Defects, Title Defect Value, Title Benefit Value, Environmental Defect Value,
appropriate cure of any Title Defect or correction of any Environmental
Defects, and the calculation of the Statement or the Final Settlement
Statement, or revisions thereto, may, subject to the provisions of Section
4.04, Section 4.08, Section 4.12, and Section 4.14, be submitted by a Party,
with written notice to the other Party, to an independent expert (the
"Independent Expert"), who shall serve as the sole and exclusive arbitrator of
any such dispute. The Independent Expert shall be selected by the Parties
(acting reasonably and in good faith) within 15 days following the effective
date of said notice. The Independent Expert shall be a person who is
independent, impartial, and knowledgeable in the subject matter and
substantive laws involved. For example, but not by way of limitation, in the
case of a dispute concerning an alleged Environmental Defect, Environmental
Defect Value, or cure of the same, the Independent Expert shall have expertise
in both the applicable Environmental Laws and environmental science relating
to the oil and gas industry.

(b) The Parties shall determine, acting in good faith, the procedures to be
followed to facilitate the decision of the Independent Expert. Such procedures
shall include the following scenario:

(i) If the dispute involves the method or adequacy of cure or correction of a
Title Defect or Environmental Defect, the Independent Expert shall provide in
writing the particulars necessary to cure or correct or to remedy any
deficient cure or correction, and shall provide Seller 60 days (or such
additional time as reasonable and necessary under the circumstances, but not
to exceed 90 days unless specifically agreed to in writing by Seller and
Buyer) to effect such cure or correction; and

(ii) In the event of circumstances described in clause (i) above, Seller at
its option may at any time during the 60‑day cure period pursuant to clause
(i) (as such period may be extended pursuant to such clause) decline to cure
or correct the applicable defect, at which time the applicable remedies set
forth in Section 4.12 shall apply.

(c) If the Parties fail to select an Independent Expert within the 15-day
period referred to in Section 4.13(a) above, within three (3) days thereafter,
each of Buyer and Seller shall choose an Independent Expert meeting the
qualifications set forth above, and such experts shall promptly choose a third
Independent Expert (meeting the qualifications provided for herein) who alone
shall resolve the disputes between the Parties. Each Party shall bear its own
costs and expenses incurred in connection with any such proceeding, and one-
half (1/2) of the costs and expenses of the Independent Expert.

 (d) Disputes to be resolved by an Independent Expert shall be resolved in
accordance with mutually agreed procedures and rules and, failing such
agreement, in accordance with the rules and procedures for non-administered
arbitration set forth in the commercial arbitration rules of the American
Arbitration Association. The Independent Expert shall be instructed by the
Parties to resolve such dispute as soon as reasonably practicable in light of
the circumstances using the terms and provisions of this Agreement with
respect to title and environmental matters. The decision and award of the
Independent Expert shall be binding upon the Parties and final and non-
appealable to the maximum extent permitted by Laws or Environmental Laws, as
applicable, and judgment thereon may be entered in a court of competent
jurisdiction and enforced by any Party as a final judgment of such court.

(e) All proceedings under this Section 4.13 shall be conducted at a mutually
agreed location, or if Buyer and Seller acting reasonably do not mutually
agree upon a location for such proceeding, the proceeding shall be conducted
in Denver, Colorado.

Section 4.14 Limitation of Remedies For Title Benefits, Title Defects, and
Environmental Defects. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement,

(a) if the Title Defect Value for a given Title Defect, in each case as
determined pursuant to this ARTICLE 4, does not exceed three percent (3%) of
the Allocated Value of the affected Asset, or if the Environmental Defect
Value for a given Environmental Defect, as determined pursuant to this ARTICLE
4 does not exceed three percent (3%) of the Allocated Value of the affected
Asset, such Title Defect, or Environmental Defect shall not qualify for either
a Purchase Price adjustment, cure, or correction of such Defect. It is
understood and agreed that in each such case these three percent (3%) figures
are a threshold and not a deductible.

(b) if the aggregate net value of all Title Defects and Title Benefits plus
the value of all Environmental Defects does not exceed three percent (3%) of
the Purchase Price (prior to any adjustments thereto), then no adjustment of
the Purchase Price shall be made therefor; and

(c) if the aggregate net value of all Title Defects and Title Benefits plus
the value of all Environmental Defects exceeds three percent (3%) of the
Purchase Price (prior to any adjustments thereto), then the Purchase Price
shall be adjusted by just the amount in excess of such aggregate net value, it
being understood that this amount is a deductible and not a threshold.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Title Defects attributable to PUD Locations
will be excluded from the determinations described in Section 4.14(a), (b) and
(c) above, and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted by the value of all Title
Defects attributable to PUD Locations from the first dollar without regard to
the threshold and deductible amounts described in Section 4.14(a), (b) and (c)
above.

All Title Defects and Environmental Defects asserted by Buyer pursuant to this
ARTICLE 4 after being resolved in accordance with this ARTICLE 4 shall
thereafter constitute Permitted Encumbrances and Assumed Obligations, whether
or not an adjustment to the Purchase Price is made with respect thereto in
accordance with this ARTICLE 4.

 Section 4.15 DISCLAIMER AND WAIVER. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT,
SELLER DOES NOT MAKE ANY, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, AND BUYER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY SUCH REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTIES, AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY FILE AND/OR OTHER
INFORMATION, INCLUDING, PRINTOUTS, EXTRAPOLATIONS, PROJECTIONS, DOCUMENTATION,
MAPS, GRAPHS, CHARTS, OR TABLES WHICH REFLECT, DEPICT, PRESENT, PORTRAY, OR
WHICH ARE BASED UPON OR DERIVED FROM ANY SUCH INFORMATION AND/OR FILES,
INCLUDING MATTERS OF GEOLOGICAL, GEOPHYSICAL, ENGINEERING, OR OTHER SCIENTIFIC
INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO BUYER BY SELLER OR BY OTHERS ON BEHALF OF
SELLER. BUYER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT ANY CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM REVIEW OF SUCH
INFORMATION AND/OR FILES SHALL BE THE RESULT OF ITS OWN INDEPENDENT REVIEW AND
JUDGMENT.

operated by Seller have been drilled and completed within the boundaries of
the Leases or within the limits otherwise permitted by contract, pooling or
unit agreement, and applicable Laws, and no Well is subject to penalties
because of violations of applicable Laws.

Equipment free and clear of all liens and encumbrances other than those to be
released at Closing. Other than in connection with normal and customary
prudent operations, Seller has not removed any personal property, equipment,

injection facilities, saltwater disposal facilities, compression facilities,
gathering systems, fixtures and equipment that are necessary to conduct normal
operations on the Assets are in good working condition, reasonable wear and

or transferred or contracted to sell, assign, convey, or transfer any right or

purchase, or similar rights with respect to the production from the Assets.
Proceeds from the sale of oil, condensate, and gas from the Assets are being

the Leases (including, without limitation, royalties, overriding royalties,
shut‑in payments) have been timely and properly made in accordance with the
terms of the Leases and applicable Law. Seller has not received a written

Section 5.20 Property Expenses. In the ordinary course of business during the
period of its ownership, Seller has paid all property expenses attributable to
the period of time prior to the Effective Time as such property expenses

necessary or appropriate to own and operate the Assets as presently being
owned and operated. The Permits are in full force and effect and the Assets
have been operated in accordance with the terms thereof in all material
respects. Seller has not received written notice of any violations in respect
of any of the Permits that remain uncured, except as set forth in Schedule
5.29.

Section 5.22 No Adverse Change. During the period of Seller's ownership, with
respect to the Assets for which Seller is the operator of record, and to
Seller's knowledge as to Assets for which Seller is not the operator, the
Assets have been operated in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practices and there has been no event or series of events that have
either individually or in combination had a Material Adverse Effect on the
Assets.

 Section 5.23 Information. The information pertaining to revenue and expenses
attributable to the Assets that Seller has furnished to Buyer (the

files, or copies thereof, that Seller has used in the ordinary course of
operating and owning the Assets, (ii) Seller has not intentionally withheld
any material information from the Records, and (iii) Seller has not knowingly
misrepresented any material information in the Records. Except as set forth in
this Section 5.23, no representation or warranty of any kind is made by Seller
as to the Information or with respect to the Assets to which the Information
relates and Buyer expressly agrees that any conclusions drawn therefrom shall
be the result of its own independent review and judgment. The representations
and warranties contained in this paragraph shall apply only to matters of
fact, and shall not apply to any information, data, printouts, extrapolations,
projections, documentation, maps, graphs, charts, or tables which reflect,
depict, present, portray, or represent, or which are based upon or derived
from, in whole or in part, interpretation of the Information including, but
not limited to, matters of geological, geophysical, engineering, or scientific
interpretation.

no agreements for options, swaps, floors, caps, collars, forward sales
involving commodities, commodity prices, or indices based on any of the

OPERATION OF THE ASSETS

Section 7.01 Operation of the Assets.

(a) From and after the date of execution of this Agreement, and subject to the
provisions of applicable operating and other agreements, Seller shall (i)
during the period prior to the Closing, operate and administer the Assets in a
manner consistent with its past practices, (ii) make payment of all costs and
expenses attributable to the ownership or operation of the Assets and relating
to the period prior to the transfer of operations to Buyer, and shall carry on
its business with respect to the Assets in substantially the same manner as
before execution of this Agreement, (iii) not, without Buyer's express written
consent, commit to participate in the drilling of any well, or make or enter
into any other commitments reasonably anticipated to require future capital
expenditures by Buyer in excess of $100,000 net to Seller's interest for each
proposed operation, or terminate, materially amend, or extend any Contracts
affecting the Assets, or enter into or commit to enter into any material new
contract or agreement relating to the Assets, or settle, compromise, or waive
any material right relating to the Assets, (iv) maintain insurance coverage on
the Assets in the amounts and of the types presently in force, (v) maintain in
full force and effect the Leases, the Surface Agreements, and other Assets,
and properly pay all costs and expenses and perform all obligations of the
owner of the Assets promptly when due, (vi) maintain all Permits, (vii) not
transfer, sell, hypothecate, encumber, or otherwise dispose of any Assets
except for sales and dispositions of Hydrocarbons made in the ordinary course
of business consistent with Seller's past practices, (viii) not grant or
create any preferential right to purchase, right of first opportunity, or
other transfer restriction or requirement with respect to the Assets except in
connection with the renewal or extension of Assets after the Effective Time if
granting or creating such right or requirement is a condition of such renewal
or extension and then with prompt written notice of such action to Buyer,

 (ix) not elect to become a non-consenting party in any operation proposed by
any other Person with respect to the Assets unless requested to do so in
writing by Buyer, (x) maintain the Equipment in at least as good a condition
as it is on the date hereof, ordinary wear and tear excepted, (xi) not make
any change in any method of accounting or accounting practice or policy with
respect to the Assets, and (xii) not agree to extend any statute of
limitations with respect to Taxes or any extension of time with respect to a
Tax assessment or deficiency for any Taxes, or make any change in any Tax
elections with respect to the Assets.

(b) Buyer acknowledges that Seller owns undivided interests in some or all of
the Assets, and Buyer agrees that the acts or omissions of the other working
interests owners shall not constitute a violation of the provisions of this
ARTICLE 7, nor shall any action required by a vote of working interest owners
constitute such a violation so long as Seller has voted its interests in a
manner that complies with the provisions of this ARTICLE 7. Seller will,
without penalty for the failure to do so except to the extent that the failure
to give Buyer such notice has a Material Adverse Effect, notify Buyer of the
occurrence of such event to the extent of Seller's knowledge.

Section 7.02 Buyer's Qualification. At Closing, Buyer shall be qualified and
shall meet all requirements, comparable to the bonding requirements that have
been imposed on Seller that are described on Schedule 5.13, to be designated
operator of that portion of the Assets for which Seller serves as operator. It
is understood and agreed that certain Governmental Authorities may require
Buyer to provide higher levels of financial security than they required of
Seller. Buyer shall provide all such additional security in order to meet all
requirements necessary for Buyer to be designated as operator of the Assets.
Buyer shall cooperate with Seller to facilitate the release by Governmental
Authorities of Seller's bonds described on Schedule 5.13.

Section 7.03 Operation of the Assets after the Closing. If requested by Buyer
prior to Closing, Seller shall continue to operate the Assets (for which it
was the operator) and perform marketing services pursuant to an agreement
substantially in the form of the transition services agreement attached as
Exhibit F (the "Transition Services Agreement"). Seller shall make its
employees and contractors available to Buyer prior to the Closing as may be
reasonably necessary to assist in the transition if Buyer becomes the
operator. Seller does not warrant or guarantee that Buyer will become the
operator of the Assets or any portion thereof, as such matter will be
controlled by the applicable joint operating agreement(s) and other applicable
agreement(s); provided, however, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to assist
Buyer in becoming successor operator. As used in this Section 7.03, the phrase
"operate" shall mean both the physical operations on the Assets for which
Seller was the operator, and the accounting (including the payment of
royalties, Taxes and expenses and joint interest billings), reporting and
marketing functions Seller performed with regard to the Assets prior to
Closing, all of which are more fully described in the Transition Services
Agreement.

Section 7.04 Consents Related to Certain Contracts. Promptly after the
execution of this Agreement, Buyer shall send requests for consents to
assignments to the holders of those consent rights listed on Schedule 4.07A.
It is understood and agreed that in order to obtain the consent to the
assignment of certain of the Contracts listed on Schedule 4.07A), Buyer may be
required to provide financial security, such as the delivery of letters of
credit. Buyer covenants and agrees that

 it shall provide all such financial security required to obtain the consents
to such assignment and the release of Seller from any post-Effective Time
liability thereunder; provided, however, as to any interstate pipeline-related
Contract that are among the Contracts, if a pipeline demands security in any
amount the Parties agree in good faith is unreasonable, such Contract shall be
retained by Seller, but the Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward for the
discounted (PV 10) value of demand charges owed under the remaining term of
such Contract. It is further understood and agreed that Seller shall have no
obligation whatsoever to make any payment, or deliver any other consideration,
or retain or assume any obligation in order to accomplish the assignment of
any Contract.

Section 7.05 Interstate Pipeline Company Contracts/Marketing of Oil and Gas.
It is acknowledged and agreed that the assignment of any interstate
transportation requires the approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission ("FERC"). Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Seller
and Buyer shall file appropriate applications seeking all FERC approvals
necessary to accomplish the assignment of such interstate pipeline
transportation agreements to Buyer. It is acknowledged and agreed that all
such necessary FERC approvals are not likely to be obtained until after the
Closing Date. If such approvals are not obtained by the Closing Date, Seller
shall market the oil and natural gas production from the Assets at the
direction of Buyer without charge to Buyer following the Closing Date until
such time as all such necessary FERC approvals are obtained, pursuant to a
marketing arrangement as agreed to by the Parties. That certain Marketing
Agreement between Encore Energy Partners Operating, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company, an affiliate of Buyer, and Seller effective October 1, 2012
shall terminate as of the Closing Date.

Section 7.06 Public Announcements. Upon the execution of this Agreement the
Parties may make such public disclosures, including issue press releases, to
enable them to comply with applicable securities or other Laws or the
applicable stock exchange rules. Prior to issuing any press release, a Party
shall provide it to the other Party for approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld; however, the foregoing shall not restrict disclosures
by Buyer or Seller which are required by applicable securities or other Laws
or the applicable rules of any stock exchange having jurisdiction over the
disclosing Party or its affiliates. Following Closing, the Parties shall issue
a press release in form and substance to be agreed upon by the Parties prior
to the Closing, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Section 7.07 Proprietary Seismic. Seller has obtained certain three-
dimensional seismic covering certain of the Assets (the "Proprietary
Seismic"). Pursuant to Section 1.03(h) above, Seller is not selling and
transferring to Buyer the Proprietary Seismic. For the avoidance of doubt, the
non-exclusive seismic license that Seller and Encore Energy Partners
Operating, LLC, executed on December 12, 2012 shall not be affected or
otherwise modified by this Agreement.

Section 7.08 Parent Guarantee. It is acknowledged and agreed that Parent
Guarantor's guarantee of Buyer's performance of Buyer's obligations hereunder
is a material inducement for Seller to proceed with the execution of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transaction contemplated herein. In
light of the foregoing Parent Guarantor shall execute and deliver to Seller
the parent guarantee in the form of Exhibit G hereto (the "Parent Guarantee").

 Section 7.09 Employee Matters.

(a) Seller shall provide a list of available Business Employees to Buyer on or
before November 14, 2014 and shall update such list on and through November
30, 2014 (the date upon which Seller shall cease to physically operate the

or departures. Buyer may make an offer of employment to such Business
Employees as it chooses in its sole and absolute discretion, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver such offers no later than five (5)
days prior to November 28, 2014. Such offers shall be effective as of December
1, 2014 or such later date as any Business Employee who is on short or long
term disability may be ready to return to work. All offers of employment shall

that are no less favorable than the aggregate compensation and benefits
provided to each such Business Employee by Seller prior to December 1, 2014,
and (ii) shall provide for annual vacation or paid time off accrual that is no
less favorable than the vacation or paid time off accrual provided by Seller
to each Business Employee prior to November 30, 2014. The term "Business

(hourly and salaried) based in the State of Colorado, as identified by Seller,
whose primary employment is related to the Assets.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, a "New Employee" is a Business Employee
who accepts an offer of employment made pursuant to Section 7.09(a).

(c) Subject in all events to applicable Laws and to the existing general terms

situated employees of Buyer prior to the Closing Date), Buyer shall provide
each New Employee with credit for their years of industry service for Seller,
or other industry third parties, and its ERISA affiliates for purposes of
eligibility, vesting, and entitlement to benefits (and for benefit accruals
solely with respect to vacation, sick leave, and severance), under all
employee benefit plans (as defined in section 3(3) of ERISA) and all vacation,
sick leave, severance, and other compensation plans, policies, agreements and
arrangements maintained by the Buyer or any of its affiliates in which such

situated employees of Buyer prior to November 30, 2014), Buyer shall offer
medical and dental coverage for New Employees and their spouses and dependents
under Buyer's group health plan (the "Group Health Plan"). Buyer shall cause
each such Group Health Plan, and applicable insurance carriers, third party
administrators and any other third parties, to (i) waive any waiting period(s)
under the Group Health Plan otherwise applicable to such New Employees, (ii)
waive all limitations as to pre-existing medical conditions under the Group
Health Plan applicable to New Employees to the extent that such medical
conditions would be covered under the Group Health Plan if they were not pre-
existing conditions, and (iii) provide New Employees with credit, for the year
in which the New Employee begins employment with Buyer, for any co-payments
and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any

 applicable co-payment, deductible, and out-of-packet maximums under the Group
Health Plan. Buyer shall take such actions as are necessary to provide
continuation health care coverage to New Employees and their qualified
beneficiaries who incur qualifying events on or after the Closing Date in
accordance with the continuation health care coverage requirements of Section
4980B of the Code or any state analogue (collectively "COBRA").

(e) Any New Employees will become eligible to participate in Buyer's incentive
bonus plans effective as of their hire date and any and all bonuses paid under
such plans will not be pro-rated for service during the calendar year of hire.

(f) Following November 30, 2014, subject in all events to applicable Laws,
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be accepted by the
trustee of a Buyer Retirement Plan in which a New Employee is eligible to
participate a rollover of any eligible rollover distribution (within the
meaning of Section 402(c) of the Code) of such New Employee's benefit under a
Seller Retirement Plan (including any notes representing participant loans)
provided that Seller provides to Buyer such information as is satisfactory to
Buyer to assure itself that such Seller Retirement Plan satisfies the
qualification requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code.

(g) This Section 7.09 shall not constitute an amendment to any employee
benefit plan maintained by the Seller and its affiliates, or the Buyer and its
affiliates, create any third party beneficiary rights or inure to the benefit
of or be enforceable by any employee or any person representing the interests
of employees.

(h) Buyer agrees that, for a period of twelve (12) months following Closing,
Buyer will not, in any manner, directly or indirectly, solicit any person who
is an employee of Seller (other than any Business Employee) to apply for or
accept employment with Buyer or any other business entity, or discuss with any
person who is an employee of Seller (other than any Business Employee)
alternative employment with Buyer or any other business entity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not constitute a violation of this
Section 7.09(h) for Buyer to (A) make a general solicitation for employment or
other services through any form of media or any third party recruiting firm
not specifically directed to the employees, agents or consultants of Seller
and hire any person that responds to the same, (B) solicit or hire any person
who initiates discussions with Buyer regarding employment without any direct
or indirect prohibited solicitation by Buyer, or (C) solicit or hire any
person who has ceased to be employed by Seller prior to commencement of

Section 7.10 Updated Exhibits and Schedules.

(a) Updated Exhibits. The Parties agree that Exhibit A is intended to list all
of the Leases and Lands which are intended to be included as part of the
Assets to be conveyed to Buyer hereunder. In the event that between the date

Leases and Lands that have been inadvertently omitted from or incorrectly
described on Exhibit A, Seller, with the consent of Buyer, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, shall be permitted to supplement

or known at the date hereof or thereafter, would have been required to be set
forth or described in such Schedules, provided that such addition, supplement
or amendment does not have the effect of materially increasing any liabilities
of the Buyer or materially decreasing the value of the Assets. For all
purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of determining whether the
conditions set forth in ARTICLE 9 have been fulfilled, the Schedules to
Seller's representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to include only that information contained therein on the date of this

pursuant only to ARTICLE 4. Buyer shall be precluded from asserting any such
matter as a breach of any representation and warranty.

Section 12.13 Exclusive Remedy. The terms and provisions of this ARTICLE 12
and those provided in ARTICLE 2, ARTICLE 4, ARTICLE 7, ARTICLE 8, ARTICLE 9,
ARTICLE 10, and ARTICLE 11 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of each of
the Parties indemnified hereunder

 with respect to the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements of
the Parties set forth in this Agreement and the other documents executed and
delivered hereunder; provided, however, that the terms of this Section 12.13
shall not be applicable to the extent that a Party has committed fraud,
securities fraud (where one of the elements of the cause of action is scienter
or knowledge), or willful misconduct.

Section 12.14 Defenses and Counterclaims. Each Party that is required to
assume any obligation or liability of the other Party pursuant to this
Agreement or that is required to release and defend, indemnify or hold the
other Party harmless hereunder shall, notwithstanding any other provision
hereof to the contrary, be entitled to the use and benefit of all defenses
(legal and equitable) and counterclaims of such other Party in defense of
third party Claims arising out of any such assumption or indemnification.

Section 12.15 Anti-Indemnity Statute, No Insurance; Subrogation. Buyer and
Seller agree that with respect to any statutory limitations now or hereafter
in effect affecting the validity or enforceability of the indemnities provided
for in this Agreement, such indemnities shall be deemed amended in order to
comply with such limitations. This provision concerning statutory limitations
shall not apply to indemnities for all liabilities of the indemnifying Party
which are covered by such Party's insurance. The indemnification provisions
provided in this ARTICLE 12 shall not be construed as a form of insurance.
Buyer and Seller hereby waive for themselves and their successors and assigns,
including their insurers, any rights to subrogation for Claims for which each
of them is respectively liable or against which each respectively indemnifies
the other, and, if required by applicable policies, Buyer and Seller shall
obtain waiver of such subrogation from their respective insurers.

AND WARRANTS TO SELLER THAT BUYER WILL MAKE, OR CAUSE TO BE MADE SUCH
INSPECTIONS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ASSETS AS BUYER DEEMS APPROPRIATE. SELLER AND
BUYER AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAWS (INCLUDING
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND LAWS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF NATURAL RESOURCES,
HEALTH, SAFETY, OR THE ENVIRONMENT) TO BE EFFECTIVE, THE DISCLAIMERS OF THE
WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION ARE "CONSPICUOUS" DISCLAIMERS FOR ALL
PURPOSES.

 Section 13.02 NORM. BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INFORMED THAT OIL AND
GAS PRODUCING FORMATIONS CAN CONTAIN NATURALLY OCCURRING RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL
("NORM"). SCALE FORMATION OR SLUDGE DEPOSITS CAN CONCENTRATE LOW LEVELS OF
NORM ON EQUIPMENT AND OTHER ASSETS. THE ASSETS SUBJECT TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY
HAVE LEVELS OF NORM ABOVE BACKGROUND LEVELS, AND A HEALTH HAZARD MAY EXIST IN
CONNECTION WITH THE ASSETS BY REASON THEREOF. THEREFORE, BUYER MAY NEED TO AND
SHALL FOLLOW SAFETY PROCEDURES WHEN HANDLING THE EQUIPMENT AND OTHER ASSETS.

Section 13.03 Casualty Loss; Condemnation.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Buyer shall assume all
risk of loss with respect to, and any change in the condition of, the Assets

Hydrocarbons, the watering-out of any Well, the collapse of casing, sand
infiltration of Wells, and the depreciation of personal property.

(b) Prior to the Closing, there shall not have been a material adverse change
in the Assets taken as a whole caused by an event of casualty (a "Casualty"),
including, but not limited to, volcanic eruptions, acts of God, fire,
explosion, earthquake, wind storm, flood, drought, condemnation, the exercise
of any right of eminent domain, confiscation, or seizure, but excepting
depletion due to normal production and depreciation or failure of equipment or
casing.

(c) If, prior to the Closing, a Casualty occurs (or Casualties occur) which
results in a reduction in the value of the Assets in excess of ten percent
(10%) of the Purchase Price ("Casualty Loss"), Buyer or Seller may elect to
terminate this Agreement. If this Agreement is not so terminated, then this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any such
Casualty Loss, and, at Seller's sole option, (i) Seller shall retain such
Asset subject to such Casualty and such Asset shall be the subject of an
adjustment to the Purchase Price in the same manner set forth in Section 4.03
hereof, or (ii) at the Closing, Seller shall pay to Buyer all sums paid to
Seller by reason of such Casualty Loss, provided, however, that the Purchase
Price shall not be adjusted by reason of such payment, and Seller shall
assign, transfer, and set over unto Buyer all of the right, title, and
interest of Seller in and to such Asset and any unpaid awards or other
payments arising out of such Casualty Loss.

(t) For purpose of determining the value of a Casualty Loss, the Parties shall
use the same methodology as applied in determining the value of a Title Defect
as set forth in Section 4.03(a).

Section 13.04 Waiver of Consumer Rights. BUYER HEREBY WAIVES THE PROVISIONS OF
THE TEXAS DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES ACT, CHAPTER 17, SUBSECTION E, SECTIONS
17.41 THROUGH 17.63, INCLUSIVE (OTHER THAN SECTION 17.555, WHICH IS NOT

CONSUMERS SPECIAL RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS. AFTER CONSULTING WITH AN ATTORNEY OF
ITS OWN SELECTION, BUYER VOLUNTARILY CONSENTS TO THIS WAIVER. TO EVIDENCE

 ITS ABILITY TO GRANT SUCH WAIVER, BUYER REPRESENTS TO SELLER THAT (i) IT IS
NOT IN A SIGNIFICANTLY DISPARATE BARGAINING POSITION; (ii) IT IS REPRESENTED
BY LEGAL COUNSEL OF ITS OWN CHOOSING IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT; AND
(iii) SUCH LEGAL COUNSEL WAS NOT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IDENTIFIED, SUGGESTED,

no event later than 60 days after the Closing, Buyer shall remove the names of

Governmental Authorities to place the title or other indicia or responsibility
of ownership, including operation of the Assets, in a name other than the name
of the Seller, or any variations thereof.

Section 14.02 Expenses. Each Party shall be solely responsible for all

regular business hours during such time period. Seller shall have the right
during such period to make copies of any of the Documents at its expense.
Except to the extent necessary for the collection of monies due Seller by a

matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, understandings,

pertaining to the subject matter hereof. No supplement, amendment, alteration,
modification, or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in
writing by each of the Parties and specifically referencing this Agreement.

 Section 14.05 Waiver. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be
deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or
not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless
otherwise expressly provided.

Section 14.06 Construction. The captions in this Agreement are for convenience
only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the construction or
interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.

Section 14.07 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section
12.06(a), nothing in this Agreement shall provide any benefit to any third
party or entitle any third party to any claim, cause of action, remedy, or

shall not be construed as a third party beneficiary contract.

Section 14.08 Assignment. Except as provided in Section 2.04, neither Party
may assign or delegate any of its rights or duties hereunder to any individual

Section 14.11 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect and the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect their original intent
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 14.12 Interpretation. This Agreement shall be deemed and considered
for all purposes to have been jointly prepared by the Parties, and shall not
be construed against any one Party (nor shall any inference or presumption be
made) on the basis of who drafted this Agreement or any particular provision
hereof, who supplied the form of Agreement, or any other event of the
negotiation, drafting, or execution of this Agreement. Each Party agrees that
this Agreement has been purposefully drawn and correctly reflects its
understanding of the transaction that it contemplates. In construing this
Agreement, the following principles will apply:

(a) A defined term has its defined meaning throughout this Agreement and each
Exhibit and Schedule to this Agreement, regardless of whether it appears
before or after the place where it is defined.

 (b) If there is any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of the
main body of this Agreement and the provisions of any Exhibit or Schedule
hereto, the provisions of this Agreement shall take precedence. If there is
any conflict between the provisions of any Assignment or other transaction
documents attached to this Agreement as an Exhibit and the provisions of any
Assignment and other transaction documents actually executed by the parties,
the provisions of the executed Assignment and other executed transaction
documents shall take precedence.

(c) Schedules and Exhibits referred to herein are hereby incorporated and made
a part of this Agreement for all purposes by such reference.

(d) The omission of certain provisions of this Agreement from the Assignment
does not constitute a conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and the
Assignment, and will not effect a merger of the omitted provisions. To the
fullest extent permitted by Laws, all provisions of this Agreement are hereby
deemed incorporated into the Assignment by reference.

(e) The words "includes" and "including" and their derivatives means
"includes, but not limited to" or "including, but not limited to," and
corresponding derivative meanings.

(f) The Article, Section, Exhibit, and Schedules references in this Agreement
refer to the Articles, Sections, Exhibits, and Schedules of this Agreement.
The headings and titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall
have no significance in interpreting or otherwise affect the meaning of this
Agreement.

(g) The term "knowledge" whether or not capitalized, shall mean with respect
to (a) Seller the actual knowledge (without duty of inquiry) of any of David
R. Macosko (Senior Vice President Accounting), Mitchell J. Reneau (Vice
President-Land), Duane J. Zavadil (Senior Vice President-EHS, Regulatory and
Government Affairs) and Monty D. Shed (Vice President-Production), and (b) as
to Buyer, the actual knowledge (without duty of inquiry) of any of Scott Smith
(President and Chief Executive Officer) and Mark Carnes (Director of
Acquisitions).

(h) The adjective, "material," whether or not capitalized, shall mean a
situation, circumstance, consequence, or concept whose relevance to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a whole is of significance, and
would not be considered a small or insignificant deviation from the terms of
this Agreement.

(i) The term "Material Adverse Effect" shall mean any defect, condition,
change, or effect (other than with respect to which an adjustment to the
Purchase Price has been made) that when taken together with all other such
defects, conditions, changes, and effects significantly diminishes the value,
use, operations, or development of the Assets taken as a whole.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not be considered in
determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred:

(i) Fluctuations in commodity prices;

(ii) Changes in Laws or Environmental Laws; or

 (iii) Changes in the oil and gas industry that do not have a disproportionate
impact on the ownership and operation of the Assets.

(j) "Breach" shall mean any breach of, or any falsity or inaccuracy in, any
representation or warranty or any breach of, or failure to perform or comply
with, any covenant or obligation, in or of this Agreement or any other
contract, agreement, or instrument contemplated by this Agreement or any event
which with the passing of time or the giving or notice, of both, would
constitute such a breach, inaccuracy, or failure, provided that to constitute
a Breach, such breach, inaccuracy, or failure must diminish the value of the
subject matter regarding which the Breach is asserted in an amount of at least
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00).

(k) "Tax" means all taxes and any other assessments, duties, fees, levies, or
other charges imposed by a Governmental Authority based on or measured by the
value of the Assets, the production of Hydrocarbons, the receipt of proceeds
with respect to such Assets or Hydrocarbons, or otherwise related in any
manner or attributable to the Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons
including any production tax, windfall profits tax, severance tax, personal
property tax, real property tax, or ad valorem tax, together with any
interest, fine, or penalty thereon, or addition thereto.

(l) The plural shall be deemed to include the singular, and vice versa.

Section 14.13 Time of the Essence. Time shall be of the essence with respect
to all time periods and notice periods set forth in this Agreement.

Section 14.14 Counterpart Execution. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, and each counterpart hereof shall be effective as to
each Party that executes the same whether or not all of such Parties execute
the same counterpart. If counterparts of this Agreement are executed, the
signature pages from various counterparts may be combined into one composite
instrument for all purposes. All counterparts together shall constitute only
one Agreement, but each counterpart shall be considered an original. In the
event that this Agreement is delivered by facsimile transmission or by e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format date file, such signature shall create a valid and
binding obligation of the Party executing (or on whose behalf such signature
is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or ".pdf"
signature page were an original thereof.

Section 14.15 Audit Rights. Buyer, at Buyer's expense, may engage an auditing
firm to conduct an audit of the revenues and expenses of Seller attributable
to the Assets for the period of January 1, 2013 through the Closing Date.
Seller agrees, from the date of this Agreement until one hundred eighty (180)
days after Closing, that Seller will cooperate and assist such auditors,
including making available (at Buyer's sole cost and expense) books, records
and personnel of Seller reasonably requested by such auditing firm.
