viii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 5, 2016 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is by and among OceanFirst Financial Corp., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Justice Merger Sub Corp., a Maryland corporation
and a wholly-own Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Cape Bancorp,
Inc., a Maryland corporation (the " _Company_ ").

_W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their
shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction
provided for herein, pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub will, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into the Company (the "
_First-Step Merger_ "), so that the Company is the surviving corporation in
the First-Step Merger and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent and (ii)
immediately thereafter, the Company, as the surviving corporation in
the First-Step Merger, will merge (the " _Second-Step Merger_ ", and together
with the First-Step Merger, the " _Integrated Mergers_ ") with and into
Parent, with Parent being the surviving corporation (hereinafter
sometimes referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ");

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Integrated Mergers shall together be treated as a single integrated
transaction that qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and
this Agreement is intended to be, and is adopted as, a plan of reorganization
for purposes of Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the Code and within the meaning
of Treasury regulation section 1.368-2(g);

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and an inducement for Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain
shareholders of the Company have simultaneously herewith entered into separate
voting agreements with Parent (collectively, the " _Voting Agreements_ ") in
connection with the First-Step Merger; and

 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Integrated Mergers and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Integrated Mergers.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: ARTICLE I

 

 _THE INTEGRATED MERGERS_

 

1.1 _The Integrated Mergers; Effective Time_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with
the Maryland General Corporation Law (the " _MGCL_ "), at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company. The Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the First-Step Merger, and shall continue its
corporate existence under the laws of the State of Maryland. Upon
consummation of the First-Step Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall terminate. On or before the Closing Date, Parent and the
Company, respectively, shall cause to be filed articles of merger with the
Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation (the " _SDAT_ ") in
accordance with the MGCL (the " _Articles of Merger_ "). The First-Step Merger
shall become effective as of the date and time specified in the Articles
of Merger (such date and time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

(b) Immediately following the Effective Time, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ") and the MGCL, the Company, as the surviving
corporation in the First-Step Merger, shall merge with and into Parent. Parent
shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Second-Step Merger, and shall
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware. Upon
consummation of the Second-Step Merger, the separate corporate existence of
the Company shall terminate. On or before the Closing Date, Parent and the
Company, respectively, shall cause to be filed a certificate of merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary_ ")
and articles of merger with the SDAT (collectively, the " _Second-Step Merger
Certificates_ "). The Second-Step Merger shall become effective as of the date
and time specified in the Second-Step Merger Certificates.

 

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Integrated Mergers (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at
10:00 a.m., New York City time, at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher and Flom LLP, on a date which shall be no later than two (2) business
days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the
latest to occur of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof (other
than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), unless another
date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The
date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Closing Date_."

 

1.3 _Effects of the Integrated Mergers_. At and after the Effective Time, the
First-Step Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable
provisions of the MGCL. At the effective time of the Second-Step Merger, the
Second-Step Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable
provisions of the DGCL and the MGCL.

 

1.4 _Effects of First-Step Merger on Merger Sub and Parent Common Stock_. At
and after the Effective Time, each share of (a) capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one newly and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassesable share of the capital stock of the Company and (b) common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued
and outstanding and shall not be affected by the First-Step Merger.

 



2 1.5 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the First-Step Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company or the holder of any of the following securities:

(a) Subject to _Section 2.2(e)_, each share of the common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for shares
of Company Common Stock owned by the Company as treasury stock or owned by
the Company or Parent (in each case, other than shares of Company Common Stock
held in any Company Benefit Plans or related trust accounts, managed accounts,
mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency
capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted (collectively, the "
_Exception Shares_ ")), shall be converted, in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this Agreement, into the right to receive the following, without
interest:

(i) $2.25 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ "); and

(ii) 0.6375 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ "
and, together with the Cash Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ") and
cash in lieu of fractional shares as calculated pursuant to Section 2.2(e);
_it being understood_ that upon the effective time of the Second-Step Merger,
the Parent Common Stock, including the shares issued to former holders of
Company Common Stock as Merger Consideration, shall be the common stock of the
Surviving Corporation. 

(b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article I_ shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist
as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an " _Old Certificate_
", _it being understood_ that any reference herein to "Old Certificate" shall
be deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to
the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock) previously representing any
such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive (i) the Merger Consideration in accordance with, and subject to,
_Section 1.5(a)_, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted
into the right to receive pursuant to this _Section 1.5_ and _Section
2.2(e)_, without any interest thereon and (iii) any dividends or distributions
which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to _Section
2.2(b)_. Old Certificates previously representing shares of Company Common
Stock shall be exchanged for evidence of shares in book entry form or, at
Parents option, certificates (collectively referred to herein as " _New
Certificates_ "), representing the Stock Consideration (together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash in lieu of fractional
shares issued in consideration therefor) and the Cash Consideration,
as applicable, upon the surrender of such Old Certificates in accordance with
_Section 2.2_, without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Parent Common 

 



3  Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, or
changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or
securities, in any such case as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock
split, or other similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any
extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and
proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration to give
holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the
Company or Parent (in each case, other than the Exception Shares) shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and neither the Merger Consideration nor
any other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

1.6 _Effects of Second-Step Merger on Capital Stock_. At the effective time of
the Second-Step Merger, each share of (a) Parent Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to such time shall remain issued and outstanding
and shall not be affected by the Second-Step Merger and (b) capital stock of
the Company, as the surviving corporation in the First-Step Merger, issued
and outstanding immediately prior to such time, shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist and neither the Merger Consideration nor any other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

1.7 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by the Company to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock under the Cape Bancorp, Inc. 2008 Equity
Incentive Plan (the " _Company Equity Plan_ ") and the Colonial Financial
Services, Inc. 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "
_Company Stock Option_ ") shall, without any further action on the part of any
holder thereof, be assumed and converted into an option to purchase from
Parent, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share)
determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
by (y) 0.75, at a per share exercise price (rounded up to the nearest whole
cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the per share exercise
price for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option by (ii) 0.75 (each, as so adjusted, a " _Converted Company Option_ ").
All rounding described in this _Section 1.7(a)_ shall be done on an aggregate
basis.

 

(b) The Converted Company Options shall have the same vesting schedule
(including any acceleration of vesting as provided in the Company Equity
Plan) as the Company Stock Options and otherwise shall have the same terms and
conditions as such Company Stock Options; _provided_ , that Parent shall
convert the Company Stock Options into Converted Company Options in a
manner consistent with the requirements of Sections 409A and 424(a) of the
Code, as applicable. After such assumption and conversion, the Converted
Company Options shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the
plan and grant agreements under which the Company Stock Options were
originally issued (including any applicable change in control or other
accelerated vesting provisions, and this transaction shall constitute a change
in control for all relevant provisions).

 



4 (c) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock award in respect of shares of
Company Common Stock granted under the Company Equity Plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Restricted
Stock Award_ ") shall be or become fully vested and the restrictions thereon
shall lapse, and each holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 1.5_ of this Agreement. The Company
will be entitled to deduct and withhold such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld under the Code and any applicable state or local tax
laws as allowed under the Company Equity Plan. For purposes of this Agreement,
the Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Awards shall be
referred to as the " _Company Equity Awards_."

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of
the Company and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary, including obtaining any
consents, to (i) effectuate the provisions of this _Section 1.7_, (ii) ensure
that following the Effective Time, there are no obligations with respect to
the Company Equity Awards other than as set forth in this _Section 1.7_ and
(iii) terminate the Company Equity Plan solely for purposes of granting new
Company Equity Awards, effective as of the Effective Time; _provided_ , that
no action taken by the Company shall be required to be irrevocable until
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

1.8 _Certificate of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective
Time, the Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub
Articles_ "), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the Articles of Incorporation of the Company until thereafter amended in
accordance with their terms and applicable law. At the effective time of the
Second-Step Merger, the Certificate of Incorporation of Parent (the " _Parent
Certificate_ "), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and applicable law.

1.9 _Bylaws of Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of
Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Bylaws_ "), as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Company until thereafter
amended in accordance with their terms and applicable law. At the effective
time of the Second-Step Merger, the Bylaws of Parent (the " _Parent Bylaws_
"), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance
with their terms and applicable law.

1.10 _Directors; Officers_. At and immediately after the Effective Time, the
directors and officers of the Company shall consist of the directors and
officers of Merger Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective Time until
their respective successor are duly elected or appointed and qualified.
Subject to _Section 6.11_, the directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation in the Second-Step Merger shall be the directors and officers of
Parent in office immediately prior to the effective time of the Second-Step
Merger.

 



5 1.11 _Tax Consequences_. For U.S. federal income Tax purposes, (a) the parties
intend that (i) the Integrated Mergers shall together be treated as a single
integrated transaction that qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall each be a party to such reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(b) of the Code, and (b) this Agreement is intended to be, and is hereby
adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354, 361 and
368 of the Code and within the meaning of Treasury regulation Section
1.368-2(g).

1.12 _Bank Merg_ er. Immediately following the consummation of the Integrated
Mergers, Cape Bank, a New Jersey-chartered stock savings bank and a wholly-
owned Subsidiary of the Company (" _Company Bank_ "), will merge (the " _Bank
Merger_ ") with and into OceanFirst Bank, a federally-chartered capital stock
savings bank and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Parent Bank_ "),
pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ ,
dated as of the date hereof, by and between Company Bank and Parent Bank (the
" _Bank Merger Agreement_ "). Parent Bank shall be the surviving bank in the
Bank Merger and, following the Bank Merger, the separate corporate existence
of Company Bank shall cease. The parties agree that the Bank Merger shall
become effective immediately after the effective time of the Second-Step
Merger. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause Company Bank, and
Parent shall cause Parent Bank, to execute such certificates or articles of
merger and such other documents and certificates as are necessary to make the
Bank Merger effective (the " _Bank Merger Certificate_ ") immediately
following the effective time of the Second-Step Merger.

 

ARTICLE II

_EXCHANGE OF SHARES_

2.1 _Parent to Make Merger Consideration Available_. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or
trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Old
Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this  _Article II_ , (a) New
Certificates representing the aggregate Stock Consideration to be issued
pursuant to _Section 1.5_ and exchanged pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_, and
(b) cash in an amount sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate Cash Consideration
payable to holders of Company Common Stock and (ii) cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (such cash and New Certificates
described in the foregoing _clauses (a)_ and  _(b)_ , together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto (after giving effect to
_Section 6.10_), being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").
The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent, provided that no such investment or losses thereon shall
affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Old
Certificates. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Parent.

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than five (5) business days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing
shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that
have been converted at the Effective Time into the 

 



6  right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Article I_ and who
has not previously submitted its Old Certificates, a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration
which such holder shall have become entitled to receive in accordance with,
and subject to, _Section 1.5(a)_, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate
or Old Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive
pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be
paid pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_. From and after the Effective Time,
upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange
and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed
letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate or Old
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as
applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing the Stock Consideration to
which such holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled to
receive in accordance with, and subject to,  _Section 1.5(a)_, and (ii) a
check representing the amount of (1) the Cash Consideration which such holder
has the right to receive in respect of the surrendered Old Certificate or Old
Certificates in accordance with, and subject to, _Section 1.5(a)_, (2) any
cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive
in respect of the surrendered Old Certificate or Old Certificates pursuant to
_Section 2.2(e)_ and (3) any dividends or distributions which the holder
thereof has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_, and the Old
Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on the Cash Consideration or any cash in
lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Old Certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Old Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated
by this _Section 2.2_.

 

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until
the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with
this _Article II_. After the surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance
with this _Article II_ , the record holder thereof shall be entitled
to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest
thereon, which were previously payable with respect to the Stock Consideration
which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate
have been converted into the right to receive (after giving effect to
_Section 6.10_).

(c) If any New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to
be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or
Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by
an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by
reason of the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Parent
Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old
Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other
reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



7 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends or
distributions that the holder presenting such Old Certificates is entitled to,
as provided in this _Article II_.

 

 __(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New
Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable
on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of the Company who
otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in
cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average
of the closing-sale prices of Parent Common Stock on The Nasdaq Global Select
Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") (as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ ) for the
five (5) full trading days ending on the day preceding the Closing Date by
(ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed
in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.5_. __

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former shareholders of the Company who
have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration,
cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and
distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former
share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant
to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.

 

(g) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock,
cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ or any
other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over
to the appropriate governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Company Common Stock in respect of which the deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 



8 (h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
requested by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange
Agent or Parent, as applicable, will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Old Certificate the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

ARTICLE III

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

 

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent concurrently herewith (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by the Company
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect
and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of _Article III_ shall
be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of _Article III_  specifically
referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of _Article III_ to the
extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a
specific cross-reference) from a reading of the disclosure that
such disclosure applies to such other sections or (ii) as disclosed in any
Company Reports filed by the Company since December 31, 2014 and prior to the
date hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the
heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-
looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-
specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), the Company
hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Maryland, and is duly registered with
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the " _Federal Reserve
Board_ ") as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of
1956, as amended (" _BHCA_ "). The Company has the corporate power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. The Company is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties
and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not,
either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to Parent, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i)
the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or
financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (
_provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to this

 



9  clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the
impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable regulatory accounting
requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or
regulations of general applicability to companies in the industries in which
such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts
or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global,
national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or
acts of terrorism) or in economic or market conditions affecting the
financial services industry generally and not specifically relating to such
party or its Subsidiaries, (D) public disclosure of the transactions
contemplated hereby or actions expressly required by this Agreement
or actions or omissions that are taken with the prior written consent of the
other party in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby; except,
with respect to _subclauses (A)_ , _(B)_ or _(C)_ , to the extent that
the effects of such change are materially disproportionately adverse to the
business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial
condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to
other companies in the industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries
operate) or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word "
_Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any person, means any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, bank or other organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, or person of which (i) such first person
directly or indirectly owns or controls at least a majority of the securities
or other interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a
majority of the board of directors or others performing similar functions or
(ii) such first person is or directly or indirectly has the power to appoint
a general partner, manager or managing member or others performing similar
functions. True and complete copies of the Articles of Incorporation of the
Company (the " _Company Articles_ ") and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of
the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have previously been made available by the Company to Parent.

 

(b) Company Bank is a New Jersey chartered savings bank duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of New
Jersey. The deposits of Company Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance Fund to
the fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums and assessments required to
be paid in connection therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings
for the termination of such insurance are pending or threatened. Company Bank
is a member in good standing of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (the "
_FHLB_ ") and owns the requisite amount of stock therein. Without duplication
of the representations made by the Company in each of the foregoing sentences
of this _Section 3.1(b)_, each Subsidiary of the Company (each, a " _Company
Subsidiary_ "), (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of
its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and,
where such concept is recognized under applicable law, in good standing in
all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its
ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to
be so qualified and in which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (iii) has
all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. There are no
restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of the Company to pay dividends
or distributions except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated
entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to
all such regulated entities. The deposit accounts of each Subsidiary of the
Company that is an insured depository institution are

 



10  insured by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent
permitted by law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in
connection therewith have been paid in full when due, and no proceedings for
the termination of such insurance are pending or threatened. _Section 3.1(b)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all
Subsidiaries of the Company as of the date hereof.

 

3.2 _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01
par value, of which no shares of preferred stock are issued or outstanding. As
of the date of this Agreement, there are (i) 13,540,875 shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding, (ii) 2,532,834 shares of Company Common
Stock held in treasury, (iii) 799,171 shares of Company Common Stock reserved

62,019 shares of Company Common Stock outstanding in respect of Company
Restricted Stock Awards and (v) no other shares of capital stock or other
equity securities of the Company issued, reserved for issuance or

have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable
and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the
ownership thereof. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness
that have the right to vote on any matters on which shareholders of the
Company may vote. There are no trust preferred or subordinated debt securities
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries issued or outstanding. Other than
the Company Stock Options and the Company Restricted Stock Awards, in each
case, issued prior to the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or
convertible securities or other commitments or agreements obligating the
Company to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, any
such securities. There are no voting trusts, shareholder agreements, proxies
or other agreements in effect with respect to the voting or transfer of
Company Common Stock or other equity interests of the Company, other than the
Voting Agreements. _Section 3.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a true, correct and complete list of all the Company Equity Awards
issued and outstanding under the Company Equity Plan as of the date hereof
specifying, on a holder-by-holder basis, (A) the name of each holder, (B) the
number of shares subject to each such Company Equity Award, (C) the grant date
of each such Company Equity Award, (D) the vesting schedule for each such
Company Equity Award, (E) the exercise price for each such Company Equity
Award that is a Company Stock Option, and (F) the expiration date for each
such Company Equity Award that is a Company Stock Option. Other than the
Company Equity Awards, no equity-based awards (including any cash awards where
the amount of payment is determined in whole or in part based on the price of
any capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) are outstanding.

 

(b) The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests
of each of the Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges,
charges, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all
of such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid, nonassessable (except, with respect to bank
Subsidiaries, as provided under 12 U.S.C. § 55 or any comparable provision of
applicable state law) and free of preemptive rights, with no personal
liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Company

 



11  Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character calling
for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other
equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity
security of such Subsidiary.

 

3.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

 

(a) The Company has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Integrated Mergers have been duly and validly approved by the Board of
Directors of the Company. The Board of Directors of the Company has determined

shareholders, has adopted this Agreement and has directed that this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby be submitted to the Companys

by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total number of
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Company
Meeting as required by the Company Articles and the MGCL (the " _Requisite
Company Vote_ "), no other corporate proceedings or approvals on the part of
the Company are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent) constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be
limited by the Enforceability Exceptions). 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor

violate any provision of the Company Articles or the Company Bylaws or (ii)
assuming that the consents and approvals referred to in  _Section 3.4_ are
duly obtained, (x) violate any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation,

reflect only actual transactions. Crowe Horwath LLP has not resigned

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to

non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company (x) has implemented and maintains

Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to the Company,
including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and
the chief financial officer of the Company by others within those entities as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to
make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and (y) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the Companys Board
of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the

in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were
made in writing by management to the Companys auditors and audit committee

believe that the Companys outside auditors and its chief executive officer

attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next
due.

regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-

respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no
attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not

expected to result in any material liability of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the IRS, the DOL, any Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple
Employer Plan, any participant in any Company Benefit Plan, or any other
party.

benefit to any employee, officer, director, independent contractor, consultant
or other service provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or result
in any limitation on the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to

qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. True and complete copies of the Parent Certificate
and the Parent Bylaws, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have
previously been made available by Parent to the Company.

 



30 (b) Parent Bank is a federally chartered savings association duly organized,

in _Section 4.1(c)_, each Subsidiary of Parent (a " _Parent Subsidiary_ ") is
duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of

recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions

Material Adverse Effect on Parent, and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any
Subsidiary of Parent to pay dividends or distributions except, in the case of

distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. The
deposit accounts of each Subsidiary of Parent that is an insured depository
institution are insured by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the
fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums and assessments required to be
paid in connection therewith have been paid in full when due, and no
proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending or threatened.

jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so

rules or regulations of the United States, any state, or any Regulatory
Agency, and have paid in full all fees and assessments due and payable in
connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report,
registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Except for normal examinations conducted by
a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of business of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, (i) no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any
proceeding or, to the knowledge of Parent, investigation into the business or

criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or
statement relating to any examinations or inspections of Parent or any of its

disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory Agency with respect to the
business, operations, policies or procedures of Parent or any of its

expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent.

4.6 _Financial Statements_.

(a) The financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Parent Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash
flows, changes in shareholders equity and consolidated financial position of

in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv)
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the
periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in
the notes thereto. The books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have
been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with
GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect
only actual transactions. KPMG LLP has not resigned (or informed Parent that
it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
Parent as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Parent on a
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure.

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due),
except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of Parent included in its Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2015 (including any notes
thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business

this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent. Parent (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to
ensure that material information relating to Parent, including its
Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of Parent by others within those entities as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the
certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Parents outside auditors and the
audit committee of Parents Board of Directors (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Parents internal controls over financial
reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to
Parents auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made
available to the Company. There is no reason to believe that Parents outside
auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not
be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, without qualification, when next due.

assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with
respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting
or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of

or obligation arising under any Environmental Law, pending or threatened
against Parent, which liability or obligation would reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. To the knowledge of Parent, there is no reasonable basis for any such
proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation that would impose any
liability or obligation that would reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent
is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter agreement or
memorandum of agreement by or with any court, governmental authority,
regulatory agency or third party imposing any liability or obligation with
respect to the foregoing that would reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

and Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects
with their insurance policies, are not in default under any of the terms
thereof, each such policy is outstanding and in full force and effect and,
except for policies insuring against potential liabilities of officers,
directors and employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, Parent or the
relevant Subsidiary thereof is the sole beneficiary of such policies, and all
premiums and other payments due under any such policy have been paid, and all
claims thereunder have been filed in due and timely fashion.

 

4.18 _Real Property_. Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has good and
marketable title to all the real property reflected in the latest audited
balance sheet included in the Parent Reports as being owned by Parent or any
such Parent Subsidiary or acquired after the date thereof (except properties
sold or otherwise disposed of since the date thereof in the ordinary course
of business) (the " _Parent Owned Properties_ "), free and clear of all
material Liens, except for Permitted Encumbrances, and is the lessee of all
leasehold estates reflected in the latest audited financial statements
included in such Parent Reports or acquired after the date thereof (except
for leases that have expired by their terms since the date thereof) (the "
_Parent Leased Properties_ " and, collectively with the Parent Owned
Properties, the " _Parent Real Property_ "), free and clear of all Liens of
any nature whatsoever, except for Permitted Encumbrances, and is in possession
of the properties purported to be leased thereunder, and each such lease is
valid without default thereunder by the lessee or, to Parents knowledge, the
lessor. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
condemnation proceedings against Parent Real Property.

Effect on Parent, each Loan of Parent and its Subsidiaries (i) is evidenced by
notes, agreements or other evidences of indebtedness that are true, genuine
and what they purport to be, (ii) to the extent carried on the books and
records of Parent and its Subsidiaries as secured Loans, has been secured by
valid charges, mortgages, pledges, security interests, restrictions, claims,

the legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability
Exceptions.

 

(b) Each outstanding Loan of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including Loans held
for resale to investors) was solicited and originated, and is and has been
administered and, where applicable, serviced, and the relevant Loan files are
being maintained, in all material respects in accordance with the relevant
notes or other credit or security documents, the written underwriting
standards of Parent and its Subsidiaries (and, in the case of Loans held for
resale to investors, the underwriting standards, if any, of the applicable
investors) and with all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations
and rules.

 

(c) There are no outstanding Loans made by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
to any "executive officer" or other "insider" (as each such term is defined
in Regulation O promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board) of Parent or its
Subsidiaries, other than Loans that are subject to and that were made and
continue to be in compliance with Regulation O or that are exempt therefrom.

 



41 (d) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is now nor has it ever been
since December 31, 2013, subject to any fine, suspension, settlement or other
contract or other administrative agreement or sanction by, or any reduction in

financial point of view to Parent. Such opinion has not been amended or
rescinded as of the date of this Agreement.

Subsidiaries to be contained in the Joint Proxy Statement and the S-4, and the
information relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries that is provided by Parent
or its representatives for inclusion in any other document filed with
any other Regulatory Agency in connection herewith, will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
are made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement (except for such portions
thereof that relate only to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) will
comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder. The S-4 (except for such portions
thereof that relate only to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) will
comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder.

(a) Except for the representations and warranties made by Parent in this
_Article IV_ , neither Parent nor any other person makes any express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent, its Subsidiaries,
or their respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions
(financial or otherwise) or prospects, and Parent hereby disclaims any such

 _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

 

6.1 _Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) Parent and the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC, no
later than 30 business days after of the date of this Agreement, the Joint
Proxy Statement and Parent shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the
S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each
of Parent and the Company shall cooperate in respect of the form and content
of any other communication with shareholders of the Company. Each of Parent
and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to have the S-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing, and Parent and the Company shall thereafter mail or deliver the
Joint Proxy Statement to their respective shareholders. Parent shall also use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or
"Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action. 

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to promptly (and in the case of the
regulatory applications to the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the NJ
Department within 30 business days of the date of this Agreement) prepare and
file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices,
petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Integrated
Mergers and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of
all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such
Governmental Entities. Parent and the Company shall have the right to review
in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult with the other
on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of
information (and subject to necessary redactions relating to confidential or
sensitive information), all the information relating to the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the
parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The
parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to
the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to

 



48  consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party
will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion
of the transactions contemplated herein. Each party shall consult with the
other in advance of any formal meeting or conference with any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other party
and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings
and conferences. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require Parent or
the Company to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any
condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Entities that would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (measured on a scale
relative to the Company) on any of Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, after giving effect to the Integrated Mergers (a " _Materially
Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

(c) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other

Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Integrated Mergers, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval will be materially delayed. As used in this Agreement, the
" _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ " shall mean all regulatory authorizations,
consents, orders or approvals from (x) the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC
and the NJ Department and (y) any other approvals set forth in _Sections 3.4_
and _4.4_ which are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Integrated Mergers and the Bank Merger, the
failure of which to be obtained would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Surviving
Corporation.

 

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of Parent and
the Company, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties
of the other and preparing for the Integrated Mergers and the other matters
contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, advisors and other representatives of the other party, access,
during normal business hours during the period from the date of this Agreement
to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel, information technology systems and records (excluding Parents tax
returns and related work papers), and each shall cooperate with the other
party in preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or
consolidation of systems and business operations generally, and, during such
period, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries to, make available to

 



49  the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement
and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state banking laws
(other than reports or documents which Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, is not permitted to disclose under applicable law), and (ii) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party
may reasonably request. Neither Parent nor the Company nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice
the rights of Parents or the Companys, as the case may be, customers,
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or
control of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence
of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the
parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall hold all information furnished by or
on behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_ in confidence to the extent

agreement, dated December 3, 2015, between Parent and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive
the representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 

6.3 _Shareholders  Approvals_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall call a meeting of its shareholders
(the " _Parent Meeting_ " and the " _Company Meeting_ ," respectively) to be
held as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for
the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote and the Requisite Parent
Vote required in connection with this Agreement, the First-Step Merger and
the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the First-
Step Merger and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other matters of the
type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of shareholders
to approve a merger agreement or otherwise approve the transactions
contemplated hereby, and each shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
such meetings to occur as promptly as reasonably practicable and on the same
date.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 6.3(c)_ and _Section 6.3(d)_, as applicable, the
Board of Directors of each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of Parent and the Company, as the
case may be, the Requisite Parent Vote, in the case of Parent, and the
Requisite Company Vote, in the case of the Company, including
by communicating to its respective shareholders its recommendation (and
including

 



50  such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement) that such shareholders
approve (i) this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, in the
case of the Company, and (ii) the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock
in connection with the First-Step Merger, in the case of Parent.

(c) Subject to  _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_, if the Board of Directors
of Parent, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect
to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it
would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties
under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then in
submitting this Agreement to its shareholders, the Board of Directors of
Parent may (but shall not be required to) submit this Agreement to Parents
shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions approving this
Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which
event the Board of Directors of Parent may communicate the basis for its lack
of a recommendation to Parents shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or
an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law.

 

(d) Subject to _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_, if the Board of Directors of
the Company, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith
that it would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then in
submitting this Agreement to its shareholders, the Board of Directors of the
Company may (but shall not be required to) submit this Agreement to the
Companys shareholders without recommendation (although the
resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be
rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors may communicate
the basis for its lack of a recommendation to the Companys shareholders in
the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto
to the extent required by law; _provided_ , that the Board of Directors of the
Company may not take any actions under this _Section 6.3(d)_ in connection
with an Acquisition Proposal unless (i) such Acquisition Proposal did not
result from a breach by the Company of _Section 6.12_; (ii) such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; (iii) the Company gives Parent at
least three (3) business days prior written notice of its intention to take
such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving
rise to its determination to take such action, including its basis for
determining that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal
(including the latest material terms and conditions of, and the identity of
the third party making, any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or
modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or
circumstances) and (iv) at the end of such notice period, the Board of
Directors of the Company takes into account any amendment or modification to
this Agreement proposed by Parent ( _it_ _being_ _understood_ that
Parent shall not have any obligation to propose any adjustments,
modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement),
and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors, again determines in good faith
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that it
would nevertheless be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this
Agreement. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed
to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this _Section 6.3(d)_ and
will require a new determination and notice period as referred to in this
_Section 6.3(d)_.

 



51 (e) Parent or the Company shall adjourn or postpone the Parent Meeting or the
Company Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time for which such
meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of Parent Common
Stock or Company Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting the Company or Parent, as
applicable, has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Company Vote or the Requisite Parent
Vote ( _it_ _being_ _understood_ that, (i) if Parent, pursuant to _Section
6.3(c)_, submits this Agreement to Parents shareholders without
recommendation, or if (ii) the Company, pursuant to  _Section 6.3(d)_,
submits this Agreement to Companys shareholders without recommendation, an
adjournment or postponement of the meeting due to an insufficient quorum or
the failure to obtain the Requisite Company Vote or the Requisite Parent
Vote, as applicable, shall not be required by this _Section 6.3(e)_).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with its terms, each of the Parent Meeting
and the Company Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be
submitted to the shareholders of each of Parent and the Company at the Parent
Meeting and the Company Meeting, respectively, for the purpose of voting on
the adoption of this Agreement and the issuance of shares of Parent Common
Stock in connection with the First-Step Merger, as applicable, and the other
matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
relieve either Parent or the Company of such obligation.

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to _Section 6.1_ of
this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all
legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Integrated Mergers and the Bank Merger and, subject to the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the
other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval
of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party
that is required to be obtained by the Company or Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Integrated Mergers, the Bank
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the First-Step Merger to be approved for listing on the
NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

6.6 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary thereof, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, provide the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continue to
be employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) immediately following
the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), while employed by Parent
or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time, with base salaries and wages no
less favorable than, and with employee benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to, the base salaries, wages and employee
benefits provided to similarly situated

 



52  employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries; provided that (A) Parent may
satisfy its obligation under this _Section 6.6(a)_ by providing or causing
the Surviving Corporation to provide such Continuing Employees with base
salaries and wages that are no less favorable than, and with employee benefits
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to, the base salaries,
wages and employee benefits provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries to
such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) to
satisfy its obligation under this _Section 6.6(a)_, Parent shall not be
obligated to provide to such Continuing Employees any equity or equity-based
compensation.

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to assume and
honor all Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms. Parent hereby
acknowledges that a "change in control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning
of the Company Benefit Plans will occur at the Effective Time. Any employee of
Company or Company Bank whose employment is terminated by Parent or Parent
Bank (other than for cause) and who is not a party to an employment, change in
control or severance agreement or contract providing severance payments shall,
in the manner set forth on Section 6.6(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
be covered and be eligible to receive severance benefits under, and subject to
the terms and conditions of, the severance plan or policy of Parent (the "
_Parent Severance Plan_ "), set forth on Section 6.6(b) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, provided, however that such employee enters into a
release of claims against Parent, any Parent Subsidiary, Company, Company Bank
and any Subsidiary or Affiliate of any of the above, in a customary form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent. Notwithstanding the forgoing, at the
written direction of Parent to Company prior to the Closing, Company or
Company Bank shall pay such cash severance benefit to any Company or Company
Subsidiary employee whose employment will be terminated at Closing.

(c) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries
in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or after
the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive
all exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under
any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions
or waiting periods would apply under the analogous Company Benefit Plan, (ii)
provide each such employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a Company
Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans, and
(iii) recognize all service of such employees with the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New Plan to the same extent that such
service was taken into account under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior
to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing service recognition
shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits
for the same period of services, (B) for purposes of any defined benefit
pension plan or benefit plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, or (C)
to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits.

 



53 (d) Unless Parent requests otherwise in writing, effective prior to the
Closing, the Company shall terminate the Cape Bank Employees Savings and
Profit Sharing Plan (the " _Terminated Plan_ "). The Company shall provide
Parent with resolutions adopted by the Companys board of directors
terminating the Terminated Plan, the form and substance of which shall be
subject to the reasonable advance approval of Parent. As soon as practicable
following the Effective Time, with respect to the Terminated Plan, Parent
shall permit or cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation)
to permit the Continuing Employees to roll over their account balances and
outstanding loan balances, if any, thereunder into an "eligible retirement
plan" within the meaning of Section 402(c)(8)(B) of the Code maintained by
Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation).

(e) Company Bank shall, effective no later than immediately prior to, and
contingent upon, the Effective Time (the " _ESOP Termination Date_ "), adopt
such necessary resolutions and or amendments to the Company Bank Employee
Stock Ownership Plan (the " _Company ESOP_ ") to (i) direct the Company ESOP
trustee to deliver a sufficient number of unallocated shares of Company Common
Stock held in Company ESOPs Suspense Account (as defined in the Company ESOP)
to Company to repay any outstanding Company ESOP loan at the Effective Time,
(ii) provide for treatment of all remaining shares of Company Common Stock
held in the Company ESOP trust in accordance with Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of this
Agreement, and (iii) provide that no new participants shall be admitted to
the Company ESOP on or after the ESOP Termination Date. The form and substance
of such resolutions and any necessary amendments shall be subject to the
review and approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Company shall deliver to Parent an executed copy of such resolutions and any
necessary amendments as soon as practicable following their adoption by the
Board of Directors of Company and shall fully comply with such resolutions
and any necessary amendments. The accounts of all participants and
beneficiaries in the Company ESOP as of the ESOP Termination Date shall become
fully vested as of the ESOP Termination Date. Any unallocated shares of
Company Common Stock held in the Company ESOPs Suspense Account after
repayment of the Company ESOP loan shall be converted into Merger
Consideration and shall be allocated as earnings to the accounts of Company
ESOP participants who are employed as of the ESOP Termination Date based on
their account balances under the Company ESOP as of the ESOP Termination Date.
As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Company shall file or
cause to be filed all necessary documents with the IRS for a determination
letter for termination of the Company ESOP. As soon as practicable following
the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS regarding the
qualified status of the Company ESOP upon its termination, the
account balances in the Company ESOP shall either be distributed to
participants and beneficiaries or transferred to an eligible tax-qualified
retirement plan or individual retirement account as a participant or
beneficiary may direct. Parent agrees to permit Company ESOP participants who
become employees of Parent or Parent Subsidiaries to roll over their account
balances in the Company ESOP to the Parent Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("
_Parent ESOP_ ").

 

(f) Except as provided in _Section 6.6(i)_ below, nothing in this Agreement
shall confer upon any employee, officer, director, independent contractor or
consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates any right
to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation, the
Company, Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving
Corporation, the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to
discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or
consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any
time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing

 



54  in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any
Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other
benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the
Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the third sentence of
_Section 9.10_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any person, including without limitation any current or
former employee, officer, director, independent contractor or consultant (or
any spouse or dependent of such individual) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, each present and former director, officer
or employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in
such capacity) (collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or
after the Effective Time, arising out of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the fullest
extent as would have been permitted by the Company pursuant to the Company
Articles, the Company Bylaws, the governing or organizational documents of
any Subsidiary of the Company and the MGCL immediately prior to the Effective
Time; and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as
incurred by such Company Indemnified Party to the fullest extent as would have
been permitted by the Company pursuant to the Company Articles, the Company
Bylaws, the governing or organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the
Company and the MGCL immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
that, if required, the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company (
_provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies
with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage
and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to
the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which
occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis,
an amount in excess of 200% of the current annual premium paid as of the date
hereof by the Company for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such
premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then
the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance
which, in the Surviving Corporations good faith determination, provide the
maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In
lieu of the foregoing, the Company, in consultation with, but only upon the

 



55  prior written consent of Parent, may (and at the request of Parent, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the
Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that
described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be
obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium
Cap.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns will consolidate
with or merge into any other entity and not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger, transfer all or substantially all of
its assets or deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar
transaction, then in each case, the Surviving Corporation will cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.7_. The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Company
under this Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or modified in a manner so as
to adversely affect the Company Indemnified Party or any other person entitled
to the benefit of this Section 6.7 without the prior written consent of the
affected Company Indemnified Party or affected person.

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including, without limitation, any merger between a Subsidiary of
Parent, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of the Company, on the other hand)
or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties,
assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to
the Integrated Mergers, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent.

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Parent and the Company shall each promptly (but in
no event more than 24 hours) advise the other party of any change or event (i)
that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it
or (ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of any condition in
_Article VII_ ; _provided_ , that any failure to give notice in accordance
with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to
constitute a violation of this _Section 6.9_ or the failure of any condition
set forth in  _Section 7.2_ or _7.3_ to be satisfied, or otherwise
constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such
notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result
in a failure of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ or _7.3_ to be
satisfied.

6.10 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and the
Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in
respect of Parent Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the record dates
and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties
hereto that holders of Company Common Stock shall not receive two dividends,
or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares
of Company Common Stock and any shares of Parent Common Stock any such holder
receives in exchange therefor in the First-Step Merger.

 



56 6.11 _Corporate Governance_. Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent and
Parent Bank, respectively, shall (i) increase the size of the Board of
Directors of Parent and Parent Bank to ten (10) members and (ii) appoint
Michael D. Devlin to the Board of Directors of Parent and Parent Bank,
respectively, as a member of the class of directors that has a term expiring
at the 2018 annual meeting of the stockholders. In the event that Mr. Devlin
is unable to serve, Parent and Parent Bank, respectively, shall select and
appoint a director from the existing Board of Directors of the Company to
serve as a member of the class of directors of Parent and Parent Bank,
respectively, for a term to expire at the 2018 annual meeting of the
stockholders.

 

6.12 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) The Company agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and
its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or
proposals with respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations
with any person concerning, or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic
information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any
person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, except to notify such person
of the existence of the provisions of this _Section 6.12(a)_; _provided_ ,
that, prior to the date of the Company Meeting, in the event the Company
receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from a breach of this _Section 6.12(a)_, it may, and may permit its
Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or
cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in such
negotiations or discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors
concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel,
and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that (1) such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal and (2) failure to take such actions would be reasonably
likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law;
_provided_ , _further_ , that, prior to providing any nonpublic information
or data, or participating in any negotiations or discussions, in each case,
permitted pursuant to the foregoing proviso, the Company shall have entered
into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no
less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which
confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive
right to negotiate with the Company. The Company will, and will cause its
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any person other than Parent with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable law,
to (x) enforce any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement relating
to an Acquisition Proposal and (y) within ten (10) business days after the
date hereof, request and confirm the return or destruction of
any confidential information provided to any person (other than the Company)
pursuant to such agreement. The Company will promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent following receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the terms and
conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or
Acquisition Proposal, copies of any written Acquisition Proposal and written
summaries of any material oral communications relating to an Acquisition
Proposal), and will keep Parent apprised of any related developments,
discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to
or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal.

 



57 (b) As used in this Agreement,

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to,
or any third party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase,
direct or indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of the
Company, (ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party
beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of
the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of the
Company, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
other similar transaction involving the Company or its Subsidiaries whose
assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the
consolidated assets of the Company; and

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide written offer or
proposal made by a third party to consummate an Acquisition Proposal that the
Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith (after receiving the
advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisors) (1) would, if consummated, result in the acquisition of
all, but not less than all, of the issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock or all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Company; (2)
would result in a transaction that (A) involves consideration to the holders
of the shares of Company Common Stock that is more favorable, from a financial
point of view, than the consideration to be paid to the shareholders of the
Company pursuant to this Agreement, considering, among other things, the
nature of the consideration being offered and any material regulatory
approvals or other risks associated with the timing of the proposed
transaction beyond, or in addition to, those specifically contemplated hereby,
and which proposal is not conditioned upon obtaining financing and (B) is, in
light of the other terms of such proposal, more favorable to the shareholders
of the Company than the Integrated Mergers and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; and (3) is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms
proposed, in each case, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory
and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board
of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such Rules will
in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such
Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 



58 6.13 _Board of Directors and Committee Meetings_. Subsequent to the receipt of
all Requisite Regulatory Approvals, the Company shall permit representatives
of Parent and Parent Bank to attend any meeting of its board of directors or
the executive and loan committees thereof as an observer, subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement;  _provided_ , that the Company shall not be
required to permit such representatives to remain present during any
confidential discussions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby or any Acquisition Proposal or during any other matter (a) that the
Board of Directors of the Company has reasonably determined to be confidential
with respect to the participation of Parent or Parent Bank or (b) that the
Company would not be required to disclose under  _Section 6.2_ of this
Agreement.

6.14 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall each use their
reasonable best efforts to develop a joint communications plan, to ensure
that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and except in respect of any announcement required by
applicable law, or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other before issuing
any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

6.15 _Change of Method_. The Company and Parent shall be empowered, upon
their mutual agreement, at any time prior to the Effective Time, to change the
method or structure of effecting the combination of the Company and Parent
(including the provisions of _Article I_ ), if and to the extent they both
deem such change to be necessary, appropriate or desirable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind
of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely
affect the Tax treatment of the Companys shareholders or Parents
shareholders pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) adversely affect the Tax
treatment of the Company or Parent pursuant to this Agreement or (iv)
materially impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in a timely manner. The Parties agree to reflect any such
change in an appropriate amendment to this Agreement executed by both parties
in accordance with _Section 8.3_.

6.16 _Restructuring Efforts_. If either the Company or Parent shall have
failed to obtain the Requisite Company Vote or the Requisite Parent Vote at
the duly convened Company Meeting or Parent Meeting, as applicable, or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith
use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the
transaction provided for herein (it being understood that neither party shall
have any obligation to alter or change any material terms, including the
amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of the capital
stock of the Company as provided for in this Agreement, in a manner adverse to
such party or its shareholders) and/or resubmit this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this 
_Section 6.16_) to its respective shareholders for approval.

6.17 _Takeover Statutes_. None of the Company, Parent or their respective
Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover
Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Integrated Mergers, or any
of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all
necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the
Integrated Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any
applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover
Statute may become, or 

 



59  may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each
of Parent and the Company and the members of their respective Boards of
Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and thereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if
necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover
Statute.

 

6.18 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. The Company and Parent
agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain the Company
Insiders (as defined below), both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is
desirable that the Company Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability
under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of Company Common
Stock and the Company Equity Awards in the First-Step Merger, and for that
compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this _Section
6.18_. Assuming the Company delivers to Parent in a reasonably timely fashion
prior to the Effective Time accurate information regarding those officers and
directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _Company Insiders_ "), the Board of
Directors of Parent and of the Company, or a committee of non-employee
directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under
the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter, and in any event
prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be required to cause
(in the case of the Company) any dispositions of Company Common Stock or the
Company Equity Awards by the Company Insiders, and (in the case of Parent)
any acquisitions of Parent Common Stock by any Company Insiders who,
immediately following the Integrated Mergers, will be officers or directors of
the Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule
16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law.

 

6.19 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT_

 

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after the obtainment of the Requisite
Company Vote or the Requisite Parent Vote:

(a) by mutual consent of Parent and the Company in a written instrument, if
the Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the
members of its entire Board;

 



63 (b) by either the Board of Directors of Parent or the Board of Directors of
the Company if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory
Approval has denied approval of the Integrated Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated hereby and such denial has become final and
nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have
issued a final nonappealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, unless the failure to obtain a
Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and
agreements of such party set forth herein;

 

(c) by either the Board of Directors of Parent or the Board of Directors of
the Company if the Integrated Mergers shall not have been consummated on or
before the one (1) year anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the "
_Termination Date_ "), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date
shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth
herein;

(d) by either the Board of Directors of Parent or the Board of Directors of
the Company ( _provided_ , that the terminating party is not then in material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained
herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or
agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any such
representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement
on the part of the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent,
in the case of a termination by the Company, which breach or failure to be
true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such
party (or failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would
constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a
condition set forth in _Section 7.2_, in the case of a termination by Parent,
or _Section 7.3_, in the case of a termination by the Company, and which is
not cured within 45 days following written notice to the Company, in the case
of a termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by the
Company, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period (or
such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination Date);

(e) by the Company, if the Board of Directors of Parent shall have (i) failed
to recommend in the Joint Proxy Statement that the shareholders of Parent
approve the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the
First-Step Merger, or withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation in
a manner adverse to the Company, or resolved to do so, or failed to reaffirm
such recommendation within two (2) business days after the Company requests in
writing that such action be taken, or (ii) breached its obligations under
_Section 6.3_ in any material respect;

 

(f) by Parent, if the Board of Directors of the Company shall have (i) failed
to recommend in the Joint Proxy Statement that the shareholders of the
Company adopt this Agreement, or withdrawn, modified or qualified such
recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, or resolved to do so, or failed
to reaffirm such recommendation within two (2) business days after
Parent requests in writing that such action be taken, or failed to recommend
against acceptance of a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding Company
Common Stock that has been publicly disclosed (other than by Parent or an
affiliate of Parent) within ten (10) business days after the commencement of
such tender or exchange offer, in any such case whether or not permitted by
the terms hereof, (ii) recommended or endorsed an Acquisition Proposal, or
(iii) breached its obligations under _Sections 6.3_ or _6.12_ in any material
respect; or

 



64 (g) By the Company, if its Board of Directors so determines by a vote of a
majority of the members of its entire board within a five (5) day period
commencing on the Determination Date, if both of the following conditions are
satisfied, such termination to be effective on the tenth (10th) day following
the Determination Date: (i) the Parent Market Value on the Determination Date
is less than $15.74 and (ii) the number obtained by dividing the Parent
Market Value on the Determination Date by the Initial Parent Market Value is
less than the number obtained by dividing (x) the Final Index Price by (y) the
Initial Index Price minus 0.15; _subject_ , _however_ , to the following
three sentences. If the Company elects to exercise its termination right
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(g)_, it shall promptly (and in any event no
later than the last day of the five (5) day period commencing on the
Determination Date) notify Parent in writing of such election. During the
five (5) day period commencing with Parents receipt of such notice, Parent
shall have the option to increase the Exchange Ratio to equal the lesser of
(x) a quotient, the numerator of which is equal to the product of the Initial
Parent Market Value, the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect), and the Index
Ratio minus 0.15 and the denominator of which is equal to the Parent Market
Value on the Determination Date; or (y) the quotient determined by dividing
the Initial Parent Market Value by the Parent Market Value on the
Determination Date, and multiplying such quotient by the product of the
Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and 0.80. If within such five (5) day
period, Parent delivers written notice to the Company that it intends to
proceed with the Integrated Mergers by paying such additional consideration as
contemplated by the preceding sentence, and notifies the Company of the
revised Exchange Ratio, then no termination shall be permitted by, or shall
have occurred pursuant to, this _Section 8.1(g)_, and this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms (except that the
Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified). If Parent or any company
belonging to the Index declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction between the date of this Agreement and the Determination Date,
the prices for the common stock of such company shall be appropriately
adjusted for the purposes of applying this _Section 8.1(g)_. For purposes of
this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

(i) The " _Determination Date_ " means the first date on which all Requisite
Regulatory Approvals (and waivers, if applicable) necessary for consummation
of the Integrated Mergers have been received (disregarding any waiting
period).

 

(ii) The " _Final Index Price_ " means the average of the daily closing value
of the Index, for the ten (10) consecutive trading days immediately preceding
the Determination Date.

(iii) The " _Index_ " means the NASDAQ Bank Index or, if such Index is not
available, such substitute or similar Index as substantially replicates the
NASDAQ Bank Index.

 

(iv) The " _Index Ratio_ " means the Final Index Price divided by the Initial
Index Price.

 



65 (v) The " _Initial Index Price_ " means the closing value of the Index on the
date of this Agreement.

(vi) The " _Initial Parent Market Value_ " means, $19.67, adjusted
as indicated in the last sentence of _Section 8.1(g)_.

(vii) The " _Parent Market Value_ " means, as of any specified date, the
average of the daily closing sales prices of a share of Parent Common Stock as
reported on the NASDAQ for the ten (10) consecutive trading days immediately
preceding such specified date.

 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the
Company as provided in _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, and none of Parent, the Company, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them
shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) _Section 6.2(b)_
and this _Section 8.2_ and _Article IX_ shall survive any termination of this
Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Company shall be relieved or released
from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or knowing,
intentional and material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

 

(b) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made known to senior management or the Board of Directors of the Company
or has been made directly to its shareholders generally or any person shall
have publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with
respect to the Company and (x) (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by
either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ without the
Requisite Company Vote having been obtained or (B) thereafter this Agreement
is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_, and (y) on or prior to
the date that is eighteen (18) months after the date of such termination, the
Company enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition
Proposal as that referred to above), then the Company shall, on the earlier of
the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation
of such transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee
equal to $7,200,000.00 (the " _Termination Fee_ ").

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(f)_, then the Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of same
day funds, a fee equal to the Termination Fee on the date of termination.

 

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(e)_, then Parent shall pay the Company, by wire transfer of
same day funds, a fee equal to the Termination Fee on the date of termination.

 



66 (e) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this  _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Parent or the Company fails
promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.2_, and, in order
to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a
judgment against the non-paying party for the Termination Fee, such non-paying
party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party (including
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if
Parent or the Company fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this
_Section 8.2_, then such party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts at
a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase and
Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was
required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that such
overdue amount was originally required to be paid.

8.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement
may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Integrated Mergers by the
shareholders of Parent and the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that after
adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company or the approval
of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the First-
Step Merger by the shareholders of Parent, there may not be, without further
approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires
further approval under applicable law. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

8.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and waive
compliance with any of the agreements or satisfaction of any conditions
contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after adoption of this
Agreement by the shareholders of the Company or the approval of the issuance
of shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the First-Step Merger by
the shareholders of Parent, there may not be, without further approval of
such shareholders, any extension or waiver of this Agreement or any portion
thereof that requires further approval under applicable law. Any agreement on
the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

9.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and, accordingly, that the parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof (including the parties obligation to consummate the
Integrated Mergers), in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a)
any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would
be adequate and (b) any requirement under any law to post security or a bond
as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

9.11 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in
any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

9.12  _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.
