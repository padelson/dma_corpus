practices, consistent with past practice in the ordinary course of business.

               (c)   Dispute Resolution

                      (i) The Company Shareholders shall be deemed to
    have accepted the Closing Balance Sheet (A) if the Shareholders'
    Agent provides written notice to Parent that it accepts the Closing

    the date on which the Shareholders' Agent received the Closing

    specify in reasonable detail the nature and extent of such
    disagreement (a "Closing Balance Sheet Objection").  Parent and the
    Shareholders' Agent shall attempt in good faith to reach agreement

    an arbiter for resolution.

    after its acceptance of its appointment as Reviewing Auditor, the
    Reviewing Auditor shall determine, based solely on presentation by
    Parent and the Shareholders' Agent and not by independent review,
    those items in dispute on the Closing Balance Sheet Objection (the
    "Disputed Items") and shall render a written report to Parent and
    the Shareholders' Agent as to the resolution of each dispute and the
    resulting calculation of the Asset Accounts and Liability Accounts
    as of the Closing Date, the Closing Reference Amount, Company Debt,
    Transaction Expenses incurred by the Company or any Company
    Subsidiary and not paid or accrued and reflected in the Closing
    Balance Sheet before the Closing Date, Company Cash and any other
    item on the Closing Balance Sheet.  In resolving any Disputed Item,
    the Reviewing Auditor (A) shall not assign a value to such Disputed
    Item greater than the greatest value for such Disputed Item claimed
    by either Parent or the Shareholders' Agent or less than the
    smallest value for such Disputed Item claimed by either Parent or
    the Shareholders' Agent; (B) shall rule only on the objections
    raised by Shareholders' Agent, accepting all other aspects of the
    Closing Balance Sheet; and (C) shall have no right, authority or
    discretion to employ any accounting standard or principles except
    for those provided for herein.  The Reviewing Auditor will have
    exclusive jurisdiction over, and shall be the sole recourse and
    remedy of, the parties hereto against one another or any other
    Person with respect to any disputes arising out of or relating to
    Closing Balance Sheet.  The Reviewing Auditor's determination, as
    reflected in the report of the Reviewing Auditor, will be conclusive
    and binding on the parties hereto, in the absence of manifest error,
    and will be enforceable in a court of law.  The Closing Balance
    Sheet, as modified by the report of the Reviewing Auditor, shall
    constitute the Closing Balance Sheet for all purposes hereunder.

                      (iii) Each party shall cooperate with and make
    available to the other party and its representatives within three
    (3) Business Days of its receipt of a written request all
    information, records, data and working papers, and shall permit
    access to facilities, personnel and representatives, as reasonably
    required in connection with the preparation and analysis of the
    Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Balance Sheet Objection and the
    resolution of any disputes with respect thereto.

                      (iv) Unless Parent and the Shareholders' Agent
    otherwise mutually agree in writing, Parent and the Company
    Shareholders shall share the fees and expenses of the Reviewing
    Auditor as determined by such accounting firm based on the following
    formulas: (A) the Company Shareholders shall pay a portion of such
    fees and expenses equal to the total of such fees and expenses
    multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the dollar
    amount of the Disputed Items resolved in favor of Parent and the
    denominator of which is the total dollar amount of the Disputed
    Items and (B) Parent shall pay a portion of fees and expenses equal
    to the total of such fees and expenses multiplied by a fraction, the
    numerator of which is the dollar amount of the Disputed Items
    resolved in favor of the Company Shareholders and the denominator of
    which is the total dollar amount of the Disputed Items.

               (d)   Calculation of Payments

                      (i) If (A) the Closing Reference Amount plus the
    actual amount of Company Cash less the actual amount of Transaction
    Expenses incurred by the Company or any Company Subsidiary and not
    paid before the Closing Date or accrued on the Closing Balance Sheet
    less the actual amount of Company Debt, in each case as reflected in
    the Closing Balance Sheet, is greater than (B) the Reference Date
    Amount (such difference, the "Closing Amount Excess"), Parent shall
    pay to the Shareholders' Agent for the benefit of the Company
    Shareholders the full amount of the Closing Amount Excess by wire
    transfer of immediately available funds no later than five (5)
    Business Days after the date on which the Closing Reference Amount
    is finally determined to a bank account designated by the
    Shareholders' Agent for the benefit of the Company Shareholders.

                      (ii) In the event that (A) the Closing Reference
    Amount plus the actual amount of Company Cash less the actual amount
    of Transaction Expenses incurred by the Company or any Company
    Subsidiary and not paid before the Closing Date or accrued on the
    Closing Balance Sheet less the actual amount of Company Debt, in
    each case as reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet is less than (B)
    the Reference Date Amount (the absolute value of such difference,
    the "Closing Amount Deficiency"), the Shareholders' Agent shall pay
    to Parent the full amount of the Closing Amount Deficiency out of
    immediately available funds by wire transfer no later than five (5)
    Business Days after the date on which Closing Reference Amount is
    finally determined to a bank account designated by Parent.

                      (iii) Any amount paid in accordance with this
    Section 2.8(d) shall bear interest from the Closing Date through but
    excluding the date of payment, at the rate of the three-month
    treasury rate as published in The Wall Street Journal from time to
    time during such period.  Such interest shall accrue daily on the
    basis of a 365-day year.

          Section 2.9   Effect on Capital Stock

               (a)   Conversion of Stock.  Except as provided in Section
2.9(c) and Section 2.9(d) and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Certificate of Merger as of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of any of the parties hereto
or any Company Shareholder, all shares of Company Capital Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive the Aggregate Consideration, to be allocated among the
Company Shareholders in accordance with the Final Conversion Schedule.

               (b)   Capital Stock of Merger Sub.  As of the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any of the
parties hereto or any holder of securities of Merger Sub, each share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged
for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation.  As of the Effective Time, each stock certificate
of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares of common stock shall
evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

               (c)   Dissenters' Rights.  Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under the MGBCL,
shares of Company Capital Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Company Shareholder who
is entitled to exercise, and properly exercises, dissenter's rights with
respect to such Company Capital Stock (the "Dissenting Shares") pursuant to,
and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 351.455 of
the MGBCL, shall not be converted into, exchangeable for or represent the
right to receive, such Company Shareholder's Proportionate Share of the
Aggregate Consideration. Any such Company Shareholder (each a "Dissenting
Shareholder") shall instead be entitled to receive payment of the fair value
of such Company Shareholder's Dissenting Shares from the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with the provisions of the MGBCL; provided,
however, that all Dissenting Shares held by any Company Shareholder who shall
have failed to perfect or who otherwise shall have withdrawn, in accordance
with the MGBCL, or lost such Company Shareholder's rights to demand an
appraisal and payment in respect of such Company Shares under the MGBCL,
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive such Company
Shareholder's Proportionate Share of the Aggregate Consideration, without any
interest thereon, upon surrender or delivery, as applicable, of the ownership
evidence that formerly evidenced such Company Shares.  The Company, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall give the Shareholders' Agent (i) prompt
notice of any demands received by such Person for payment for Dissenting
Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments, notices or
other documents served pursuant to the MGBCL with respect thereto, and (ii)
the opportunity, pursuant to Section 10.8 (treating such demands as Third
Party Claims), to control and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demands for payment under the MGBCL.

               (d)   Cancellation of Company Capital Stock Owned by Parent or
the Company.  As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of any of the parties hereto or any Company
Shareholder, all shares of Company Capital Stock that are owned by the
Company as treasury stock and each share of Company Capital Stock owned by
Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof.

          Section 2.10  Escrow Amount and Shareholders' Escrow Amount

               (a)   At the Closing, Parent shall pay by wire transfer of
immediately available funds into the Escrow Account the Escrow Amount to be
held in escrow and disbursed by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the escrow
agreement (the "Escrow Agreement") to be entered into prior to Closing in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, the Company and the Escrow Agent.
The fees of the Escrow Agent shall be borne equally by Parent and the
Shareholders' Agent, on behalf of the Company Shareholders. The Company
Shareholders shall be entitled to receive the accretions and other earnings
in the Escrow Account.  Any Taxes in respect of the accretions and other
earnings in the Escrow Account shall be borne by the Company Shareholders.

               (b)   At the Closing, Parent shall pay by wire transfer of
immediately available funds into the Shareholders' Escrow Account the
Shareholders' Escrow Amount to be held in escrow and disbursed pursuant to
the Shareholders' Escrow Agreement.

          Section 2.11  Surrender of Certificates

               (a)   Exchange Procedures.  At the Closing, each holder of
record of a Company Certificate may surrender or cause to be surrendered to
Parent the Company Certificate(s) held by such holder (including by
attestation in the case of book-entry shares), together with a duly completed
and validly executed letter of transmittal in such form as Parent reasonably
may request (which form shall bind each Company Shareholder to the terms of
this Agreement, including those set forth in ARTICLE X).  In exchange
therefor, at the Closing, Parent shall (x) deliver to each Pre-Qualified
Company Shareholder whose aggregate portion of the Closing Amount is in
excess of or equal to One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the corresponding account designated in the
Final Conversion Schedule and (y) deliver at the location of the Closing for
the benefit of each Pre-Qualified Company Shareholder whose aggregate portion
of the Closing Amount is less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), a
cashier's check in the amount of the Closing Amount that such Pre-Qualified
Company Shareholder shall have the right to receive, as set forth in the
Final Conversion Schedule, and the Company Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled.  With respect to each Company Shareholder who is not
a Pre-Qualified Company Shareholder and each Pre-Qualified Company
Shareholder who does not surrender or cause to be surrendered its Company
Certificate and letter of transmittal at the Closing, Parent shall pay at the
Closing by wire transfer of immediately available funds into an account
designated by the Paying Agent the Closing Amount less any amounts paid to
the Pre-Qualified Company Shareholders who surrendered their Company
Certificates and letter of transmittal at the Closing.  Any cash deposited
with the Paying Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Payment Fund".
The Paying Agent shall invest the cash included in the Payment Fund on a
daily basis as directed by Parent pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent
to the Company Shareholders who have not surrendered their certificates at
the Closing.  Earnings from such investments shall become part of the Payment
Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to the Company
Shareholders who have not previously surrendered their certificates and
received payment in exchange thereof pursuant to this ARTICLE II shall be
promptly paid to Parent.  The Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to any holder of record of a Company Certificate who has not
surrendered such holder's Company Certificate(s) at the Closing (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk
of loss and title to the Company Certificates shall pass only upon receipt of
the Company Certificates by the Paying Agent and which shall be in such form
and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates in
exchange for the amount of the Closing Amount that such holder has the right
to receive as set forth on the Final Conversion Schedule.  Upon surrender of
a Company Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Company Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor from the Payment Fund a cashier's
check or wire transfer in the amount of the Closing Amount that such holder
has the right to receive as set forth on the Final Conversion Schedule, and
the Company Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.  Until
surrendered in accordance with this Section 2.11(a), each outstanding Company
Certificate will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all
corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to receive such portion of the
Aggregate Consideration as set forth on the Final Conversion Schedule without
interest.

               (b)   Conversion Schedule.  No later than five (5) Business
Days prior to the expected Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent
a schedule showing, as of the Closing Date, (i) the number and class of
shares of Company Capital Stock held by each Company Shareholder; (ii) the
allocation of the Closing Amount among the Company Shareholders; (iii) the
Proportionate Share of each Company Shareholder and (iv) (y) a definitive
list of those Company Shareholders (the "Pre-Qualified Company Shareholders")
who, prior to delivery of such schedule, have tendered to counsel for the
Company with instructions to deliver to Parent at Closing a duly completed
and validly executed letter of transmittal (in such form as Parent shall
reasonably request) and the Company Certificates held by such Company
Shareholder (including by attestation in the case of book-entry shares), and
(z) account wiring instructions for Parent's payment of each such Pre-
Qualified Company Shareholder's Proportionate Share of the Closing Amount
(the "Final Conversion Schedule").  The parties hereto agree that each of the
Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the Final
Conversion Schedule without independent verification in connection with
payments to be made hereunder

               (c)   No Liability.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 2.11, neither the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent nor
any party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law.

               (d)   Dissenting Shares.  The provisions of this Section 2.11
shall also apply to Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except
that the obligations of Parent under this Section 2.11 shall commence on the
date of loss of such status and the holder of such shares shall be entitled
to receive in exchange for such shares the portion of the Aggregate
Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this ARTICLE II.

          Section 2.12  No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock

          No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the expected Closing
Date, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of any shares of Common
Stock on the records of the Company.  From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Company Certificates evidencing ownership of shares of Company
Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided
for herein or by applicable Law.  If, after the Effective Time, Company
Certificates are presented to the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this ARTICLE II.

          Section 2.13  Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates

          In the event that any Company Certificates shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such payment of
Aggregate Consideration as may be required pursuant to this ARTICLE II;
provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the
Company Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

          Section 2.14  Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action

          If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to
vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all
assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company,
the officers and directors of Parent, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations
to take, and may take, all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such
action is not prohibited by this Agreement.

                                 ARTICLE III

            REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE COMPANY

          On or before August 3, 2007 (the "Disclosure Schedule Delivery

(the "Company Disclosure Schedule").  Except as disclosed in that section of
the Company Disclosure Schedule corresponding to the Section of this
Agreement to which the following representations or warranties pertain, each
of the Company and each Principal Shareholder jointly and severally
represents and warrants to Parent as of the Disclosure Schedule Delivery Date
and as of the Closing Date as follows:

          Section 3.1   Organization, Standing and Power

          Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other
organization duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and each has
the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and to carry on its business as currently conducted, except for such failures
as would not reasonably be expected to be material to any of the Company or
its Subsidiaries.  Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified
to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in every
jurisdiction where the properties, owned, leased or operated, or the business
conducted by it requires such qualification, except for such failures as
would not reasonably be expected to be material to any of the Company or its
Subsidiaries.  The Company has made available to Parent (i) a true and
correct copy of the Company Articles and Company Bylaws, each as amended to
date (collectively, the "Company Governing Documents") and (ii) the charter
and by-laws, or like organizational documents (collectively, "Subsidiary
Governing Documents"), of each Company Subsidiary, and each such instrument
is in full force and effect.  The Company is not in violation of any of the
provisions of the Company Governing Documents and each Company Subsidiary is
not in violation of its respective Subsidiary Governing Documents, except for
such violations as would not reasonably be expected to be material to the
Company or such Company Subsidiary, as the case may be.

equity or voting interests in, each Company Subsidiary and all such shares
have been duly authorized, validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable, free and clear of all Liens and restrictions imposed by

been given to the General Bureau of Foreign Investment in accordance with
Sitran's By-laws.  The Company has made available to Parent a copy of
Sitran's By-laws, which have been approved by both the General Bureau of
Foreign Investment and by the General Direction of Federal Transportation
(Direccion General de Autotransporte Federal).  Section 3.2(b)(ii) of the

violations or defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

               (b)   No notice to, filing with, and no permit, authorization,
consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity, or any other Person is

          Section 3.5   Financial Statements

          Attached hereto as Section 3.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
are true and correct copies of the Financial Statements.  The Financial
Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
throughout the periods involved and present fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial condition and the consolidated results of
operations and cash flows for such periods of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in each case in accordance with GAAP, subject in the case of
the Interim Financial Statements to normal year-end adjustments.  The Company
does not intend to correct or restate, and to the Company's Knowledge, there
is not any basis to correct or restate any of the Financial Statements.  The
Company has not had any material dispute with any of its auditors regarding
accounting matters or policies during any of its past three (3) full fiscal
years or during the current fiscal year-to-date.  The books and records of
the Company and each Company Subsidiary have been, and are being, maintained
in accordance with applicable legal and accounting requirements, and the

Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar off-balance sheet Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose Person, on the other
hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission).  All transactions between the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
on the one hand, and any Company Subsidiary on the other hand, have been
properly disclosed on the Financial Statements and are segregated from trade
receivables due from, and payables owed to, unrelated parties.

               (u) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has

               (a) Section 3.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists,
with respect to the Company and each Company Subsidiary and any trade or
business (whether or not incorporated) that is treated as a single employer
with the Company (an "ERISA Affiliate") within the meaning of Section 414(b),
(c), (m) or (o) of the Code, (i) all employee benefit plans (as defined in
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA")), (ii) each loan to any non-officer employee, loans to
officers and directors and any stock option, stock purchase, stock grant,
phantom stock, stock appreciation right, supplemental retirement, severance,
termination, change in control, sabbatical, medical, dental, vision care,
disability, employee relocation, cafeteria benefit (Code Section 125) or

former employment or executive compensation or severance agreements, written
or otherwise, for the benefit of, or relating to, outstanding payments (or
potential payments) to any present or former employee, consultant or director
of the Company and each Company Subsidiary (together, the "Company Employee
Plans").

               (b) The Company has made available to Parent a copy of each of
the Company Employee Plans and related material plan documents (including
trust documents, insurance policies or contracts, employee booklets and
handbooks, summary plan descriptions, summaries of material modifications,
material correspondence with any Governmental Entity or with Company Employee
Plan participants, other authorizing documents and, with respect to any
Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code, the applicable nondiscrimination tests for the last three (3) plan
years) and has, with respect to each Company Employee Plan that is subject to
ERISA reporting requirements, made available copies of the Form 5500 reports
filed for the last three (3) plan years.  Any Company Employee Plan intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has either obtained from the
IRS a favorable determination letter as to its qualified status under the
Code, or the expiration of the requisite period under applicable regulations
promulgated by the IRS under the Code ("Treasury Regulations") or IRS
pronouncements in which to apply for such determination letter and to make
any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination has not occurred
or has been established under a standardized prototype plan for which an IRS
opinion letter has been obtained by the plan sponsor and is valid as to the
adopting employer.  The Company has also made available to Parent the most
recent IRS determination, notification, advisory, or opinion letter issued
with respect to each such Company Employee Plan, and, to the Company's
Knowledge, nothing has occurred since the issuance of each such letter which
could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the tax-qualified status of
any Company Employee Plan subject to Code Section 401(a).

               (c) None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides
retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any Person, except as
required by applicable Law.  There has been no material non-exempt
"prohibited transaction," as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code, with respect to any Company Employee Plan.  Each
Company Employee Plan has been administered in accordance with its terms and
in compliance with the requirements prescribed by any and all applicable
statutes, rules and regulations (including ERISA and the Code).  Each Company
Employee Plan has been administered in good faith compliance with Section
409A of the Code to the extent applicable.  Neither the Company nor any of
its ERISA Affiliates is subject to any liability or penalty under Sections
4976 through 4980 of the Code (including Section 4980B of the Code) or Title
I of ERISA with respect to any of the Company Employee Plans.  All
contributions required to be made by the Company or any of its ERISA
Affiliates to any Company Employee Plan have been made on or before their due
dates.  With respect to each Company Employee Plan, no "reportable event"
within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for
which the thirty (30) day notice requirement has been waived under the
regulations to Section 4043 of ERISA) nor any event described in Section
4062, 4063 or 4041 of ERISA has occurred.  Each Company Employee Plan can be
amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Closing Date in
accordance with its terms, without liability to Parent (other than ordinary
administrative expenses typically incurred in a termination event).  With
respect to each Company Employee Plan subject to ERISA as either an employee
pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA or an
employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA,
the Company has prepared in good faith and timely filed all requisite
governmental reports (which, to the Company's Knowledge, were true and
correct as of the date filed).  No suit, administrative proceeding, action or
other litigation has been brought, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is
threatened, against or with respect to any such Company Employee Plan,
including any Audit or inquiry by the IRS or United States Department of
Labor other than requests for payments in the ordinary course or requests for
qualified domestic relations orders.

               (d) With respect to each Company Employee Plan, the Company or
such Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, has complied with (i) the
applicable health care continuation and notice provisions of the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA") and the regulations
thereunder, (ii) the applicable requirements of the Family and Medical Leave
Act of 1993 and the regulations thereunder and (iii) the applicable
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996 and the regulations thereunder.

               (e) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) entitle any
current or former employee, director or other service provider of the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliates to severance benefits
or any other payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement,
(ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable by the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliates or (iii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting of awards, including stock awards, under any Company Employee Plan or
any benefit, increase the amount of compensation due any such employee,
director or service provider or require the funding of any amount relating to
any Company Employee Plan.

               (f) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or
announcement (whether or not written) by the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or any ERISA Affiliates relating to, or change in participation or coverage
under, any Company Employee Plan that would increase the expense of
maintaining such Company Employee Plan above the level of expense incurred
with respect to that Company Employee Plan for the most recent fiscal year
included in the Financial Statements.

               (g) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary maintains,
sponsors, participates in or contributes to, or has ever maintained,
established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed to, any pension plan
(within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) that is subject to Section 302
of ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.  No Company Employee
Plan is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" subject to Section 409A
of the Code.

               (h) None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of its
ERISA Affiliates is a party to, or has made any contribution to or otherwise
incurred any obligation to contribute to, any "multi-employer plan" as
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

               (i) None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA
Affiliate (i) is obligated to make any parachute payments as such term is
defined in Section 280G of the Code; (ii) is a party to any agreement that
under certain circumstances is reasonably likely to obligate it, or any
successor in interest, to make any parachute payments that will not be
deductible under Section 280G of the Code; or (iii) is obligated to make
reimbursement or gross-up payments to any Person in respect to excess
parachute payments.

               (j) No amounts paid by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
by any Employee Benefit Plan would fail to be deductible under Sections 404
or 404A of the code.

               (k)   With respect to each employee benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement maintained by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
any ERISA Affiliate of the Company for the benefit of, or relating to, any
present or former employee, consultant or director of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary who performs services outside of the United States (each,
an "International Employee Plan"): (i) each International Employee Plan is in
compliance with the applicable provisions of the laws and regulations
regarding employee benefits, mandatory contributions and retirement plans of
each jurisdiction in which each such International Employee Plan is
maintained, to the extent those laws are applicable to such International
Employee Plan; (ii) each International Employee Plan has been administered at
all times and in accordance with its terms; (iii) to the Knowledge of the
Company, there are no pending investigations by any Governmental Entity
involving any International Employee Plan, and no pending claims (except for
claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of the International
Employee Plans), suits or proceedings against any International Employee Plan
or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any International
Employee Plan; and (iv) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not, by themselves or in conjunction with any other agreements, events or
occurrences, create or otherwise result in any liability, accelerated payment
or any enhanced benefits with respect to any International Employee Plan.
The Mexican Subsidiaries do not have and do not offer to its employees,
except for those benefits referred to in Section 3.17(k) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, any employee retirement plan or any other benefit plan
and do not give or offer any retirement benefits, other than those mandated
by applicable Mexican Law. Except for the statutory obligations of the
Mexican Subsidiaries for vacation, holiday pay, profit sharing and year-end
bonuses incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with the past
practice, the Mexican Subsidiaries have no obligation to make, and no
liabilities with respect to, any bonuses, other deferred compensation or
other special payments.

in compliance with all notice and other requirements under the WARN Act, and
any similar foreign, state or local law relating to plant closings and
layoffs.  Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is

          Section 3.19  Interested Party Transactions

          Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is indebted to any

publicly held and traded entities constituting less than five percent (5%) of
the equity of any such entity) or (c) has any material interest in any

          Section 3.20  Real Property

               (a)   Section 3.20(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a complete list of all Owned Real Property.  Each of the Company and
each Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, has valid and marketable fee
simple title to all Owned Real Property, free and clear of all Liens, other
than Permitted Liens.  There are no outstanding options, rights of first
offer or rights of first refusal to purchase any Owned Real Property or any
portion thereof.  Copies of (i) all title insurance policies currently
existing in favor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, as the case may
be and (ii) all currently existing surveys, with respect to the Owned Real
Property have been made available to Parent.  Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has leased, subleased, licensed or otherwise granted to
any Person the right to use or occupy all or any portion of the Owned Real
Property and other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, to the
Company's Knowledge, there are no parties in possession of any portion of the
Owned Real Property, whether as lessees, tenants at will, trespassers or
otherwise.

               (b)   Section 3.20(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a complete list of the real property leased by the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries (the "Lease Agreements").  The Company or the applicable
Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a valid and binding leasehold
interest in, and enjoys peaceful possession of, the real property described
in the corresponding Lease Agreement and each Lease Agreement is valid,
binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered
in a proceeding at law or in equity).  Copies of all such Lease Agreements
and any amendments thereto have been made available to Parent.  Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary leases any real property other than the
real property subject to the Lease Agreements.  There are no material
disputes, oral agreements, or forbearance programs in effect as to the Lease
Agreements.  There are no existing material defaults by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary under any Lease Agreement, and no event has occurred that
(with the giving of notice, lapse of time or both) would constitute a
material default by the Company or any Company Subsidiary under any Lease
Agreement.  Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has assigned,
transferred, conveyed, mortgaged, deeded in trust, or encumbered any interest
in the leasehold or any of its rights under any Lease Agreement, and the
leasehold estate created by each such lease is free and clear of all Liens
other than Permitted Liens.  Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
is engaged in any negotiation for the reviewing of the rent payable under any
Lease Agreement.

               (c)   The Owned Real Property together with the real property
subject to Lease Agreements (i) constitutes all of the real property used by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary for the conduct of its business as
currently conducted and such real property is sufficient for such purposes,
(ii) is maintained in reasonable order and repair (ordinary wear and tear
excepted) and is free of any material damage or defect, and (iii) does not
violate any Law relating to zoning, building, land use, fire and noise
controls, except for such violations as would not reasonably be expected to
be material to the current use of such property by the Company or such
Company Subsidiary, as the case may be.  The Company or any applicable
Company Subsidiary has obtained and maintains any and all licenses, permits
or approvals necessary for the use and operation of all such real property
for the conduct of its business as currently conducted thereon.

          Section 3.21  Insurance

          The Company and each Company Subsidiary has policies of insurance
and bonds of the type and in the amounts customarily carried by Persons
conducting businesses or owning assets similar to those of the Company or
such Company Subsidiary, as the case may be.  Section 3.21(i) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule contains (x) a complete list of the current policies and
Contracts of insurance maintained by the Company and each Company Subsidiary
other than employee benefit plans listed on Section 3.17 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and upon Closing, a complete historical listing of all
policies and Contracts of insurance in the Company's or its insurance
brokers' or agents' possession, (y) each individual claim under auto, workers
compensation, property damage and general liability policies, both open and
closed, for the period January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2006 and (z) the
total amounts paid, reserved and incurred from January 1, 1996 through
December 31, 2006 for auto, workers compensation and general liability
claims.  All current insurance policies and bonds of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries are in full force and effect, all premiums due and
payable to date under all such policies and bonds have been paid and the
Company or such Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, is otherwise in
material compliance with the terms of such policies and bonds.  A true and
complete copy of each current insurance policy of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries has been made available to Parent.  In states where the Company
and any Company Subsidiary are qualified to be self-insured for workers'
compensation, all material requirements set forth by the state to maintain
status as a qualified self-insurer have been continually met since the
granting of such status and all fees, assessments and reporting requirements
are current.  Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has entered into
a collateral agreement with any insurance company, state regulator or other
government official to secure such self-insurance arrangements.  No
underwriter of an insurance policy or bond of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries has denied or disputed in writing a claim currently pending
under any such policy or bond.  Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has received any written notice of cancellation or non-renewal of
any current insurance policy or bond from any of its insurance carriers, nor
to the Company's Knowledge, is the termination of any such current policy or
bond threatened.  Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received
any written notice from any of its insurance carriers that any insurance
coverage presently provided will not be available to the Company or such
Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, in the future on substantially the

          Section 6.3   Shareholder Meeting; No Solicitation

               (a)   Within one (1) day after the date hereof, the Company
will mail to each Company Shareholder a notice of the Shareholder Meeting and
shall take all action necessary in accordance with the MGBCL and the Company
Governing Documents to call, hold, convene and complete the Shareholder
Meeting as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 10 days after the
mailing of notice of such Shareholder Meeting to the Company's Shareholders,
provided, however, that the Shareholder Meeting may be postponed, continued
or adjourned before completion of the Shareholder Meeting, without a breach
of this Section 6.3, if the Company has received an unsolicited, bone fide
written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, in good faith determines could reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Offer, provided, further, that any such postponement,
continuation or adjournment shall be for the minimum period that the Company
Board reasonably determines to be necessary for the Company Board to
discharge its responsibilities to the Company Shareholders and to complete
any actions taken in accordance with Section 6.3(e) and Section 6.3(f), but
in no event for a period that exceeds twenty (20) days.

               (b)   Except to the extent expressly permitted by Section
6.3(f): (i) the Company Board shall unanimously recommend that the Company
Shareholders vote in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and
approval of the Merger at the Shareholder Meeting and (ii) neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or
propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent, the unanimous recommendation of the Company Board that the Company
Shareholders vote in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and
the approval of the Merger.

               (c)   Subject to Sections 6.3(e) and 6.3(f), until the earlier
of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, the Company and
its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees or other
agents will not, directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit or encourage
(including, without limitation, by way of furnishing information), or take
any action to facilitate any inquiry or the making of, any offer or proposal
which constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to any Alternate
Transaction, (ii) propose, enter into or participate in negotiations or
discussions with, or provide any information or data to, any Person (other
than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or
representatives) relating to any Alternate Transaction, (iii) make or
authorize any statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of, or
approve, any Alternate Transaction or (iv) enter into any letter of intent or
similar document or any Contract, agreement or commitment contemplating or
otherwise relating to any Alternate Transaction or transaction contemplated
thereby.  Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company will immediately
cease any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.  After the date of
this Agreement, the Company will promptly notify Parent after receipt of any
proposal for an Alternate Transaction or any notice that any Person is
considering an Alternate Transaction or any request for information relating
to the Company or for access to the properties, books or records of the
Company by any Person that has advised the Company that it may be
considering, or has proposed, an Alternate Transaction and shall provide
Parent with a true and complete copy of such Alternate Transaction notice or
request or correspondence or communications related thereto, if it is in
writing, or a written summary thereof (which shall include the identity of
the Person considering or proposing such Alternate Transaction and the
material terms thereof), if it is not in writing.

               (d)   As promptly as practicable (and in any event no later
than 24 hours) after receipt of any (x) Acquisition Proposal, (y) request for
nonpublic information or (z) inquiry (A) that could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal or (B) from any Person seeking to have
discussions or negotiations with the Company relating to a possible
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with notice of such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, including: (i) the material terms
and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry; (ii) the
identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request
or inquiry; and (iii) a copy of all written materials and a written summary
of all oral information provided by or on behalf of such Person or group in
connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.  The Company
shall provide Parent with forty-eight (48) hours prior notice of any meeting
of the Company Board at which the Company Board could reasonably be expected
to consider any Acquisition Proposal or any such inquiry or to consider
providing nonpublic information to any Person.  The Company shall notify
Parent, in writing, of any decision of the Company Board as to whether to
consider such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry or to enter into
discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal or to provide
nonpublic information or data to any Person, which notice shall be given as
promptly as practicable after such meeting (and in any event no later than 24
hours after such determination was reached and 24 hours prior to entering
into any discussions or negotiations or providing any nonpublic information
or data to any Person).  The Company agrees that it shall promptly provide
Parent with oral and written notice setting forth all such information as is
reasonably necessary to keep Parent currently informed in all material
respects of the status and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry (including any negotiations contemplated by Section
6.3(f)) and shall promptly provide Parent a copy of all written materials and
a written summary of all oral information subsequently provided to, by or on
behalf of such Person or group in connection with such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry.

               (e)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 6.3(b), in the event that the Company receives prior to the approval
of the Merger by the Company Shareholders in accordance with applicable Law
an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third party
that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.3 and that the Company
Board has in good faith concluded, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and an independent financial advisor of nationally-recognized
standing, that such Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to
result in, a Superior Offer, the Company may then (1) furnish nonpublic
information to the third party making such Acquisition Proposal and (2)
engage in negotiations with the third party with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal; provided that:

                      (i) the Company complies with all of the terms of
    this Section 6.3;

                      (ii) prior to furnishing any nonpublic information
    or entering into any negotiations or discussions with such third
    party, (1) the Company receives from such third party an executed
    confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the
    use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and oral information
    furnished to such third party on the Company's behalf in
    substantially the form of the Confidentiality Agreement and, in any
    event, no less restrictive to such third party than the
    Confidentiality Agreement is with respect to Parent, and (2)
    contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to
    such third party, the Company furnishes such nonpublic information
    to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been
    previously so furnished); and

                      (iii) the Company Board reasonably determines in
    good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
    failure to provide such information or enter into such discussion or
    negotiations would result in a breach of the Company Board's
    fiduciary duties to the Company Shareholders under applicable Law.

               (f)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 6.3(b), in response to the receipt of a Superior Offer, (x) the
Company Board may withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in
favor of the Merger (a "Change of Recommendation"), (y) the Company Board,
the Company or any Company Subsidiary (including each of their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents or other representatives) may approve,
endorse, or recommend a Superior Offer, and (z) the Company may, (A) after
payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.3(b) and (B) upon
execution of definitive documentation with respect to such Superior Offer,
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(h); provided that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries may execute or enter into a binding
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Offer, if and only if, prior
to any such action described in clauses (x), (y) and (z) hereof, all of the
following conditions in clauses (i) through (vi) are met:

                      (i) the Company Board determines in good faith,
    after consultation with an independent financial advisor of
    nationally-recognized standing and outside legal counsel, that a
    Superior Offer has been made and not withdrawn;

                      (ii) the Company Shareholders have not approved the
    Merger in accordance with applicable Law;

                      (iii) the Company shall have delivered to Parent
    written notice (a "Change of Recommendation Notice") at least five
    (5) Business Days prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation
    which shall state expressly (A) that the Company has received a
    Superior Offer, (B) the final terms and conditions of the Superior
    Offer and the identity of the Person or group making the Superior
    Offer, (C) that the Company intends to effect a Change of
    Recommendation and (D) if applicable, that the Company intends to
    terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(h);

                      (iv) after delivering the Change of Recommendation
    Notice, the Company shall (A) provide Parent with a reasonable
    opportunity to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
    this Agreement during such five (5) Business Day period and (B)
    negotiate in good faith with respect thereto during such ten (10)
    Business Day period, in each case as would enable the Company to
    proceed with its recommendation to stockholders in favor of adoption
    of this Agreement without making a Change of Recommendation;

                      (v) the Company Board shall have determined (A)
    after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally-recognized
    standing, that the terms of the Superior Offer are more favorable to
    the stockholders of the Company than the terms of the Merger (as
    they may be adjusted pursuant to paragraph (iv) (A) above) and (B)
    after consultation with outside legal counsel, the failure to effect
    a Change of Recommendation would result in a breach of the Company
    Board's fiduciary duties to the Company Shareholders under
    applicable Law; and

                      (vi) the Company shall not have breached any of the
    provisions set forth in this Section 6.3.

               (g)   The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that the provisions of this Section 6.3 were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.  It is
accordingly agreed by the parties hereto that Parent shall be entitled to an
immediate injunction or injunctions, without the necessity of proving the
inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and without the necessity of posting
any bond or other security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of this
Section 6.3 and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in
any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which Parent may be entitled at law or in
equity.  Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation
of the restrictions set forth above by any officer, director, employee,
agent, representative or affiliate of the Company shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Agreement by the Company.

          Section 6.4   Further Information

               (a) [reserved]

               (b) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, from the date
of this Agreement until Closing or termination of this Agreement, Parent and
the Company shall confer on a regular basis with each other to discuss
operational matters of materiality and the general status of ongoing
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

               (c) No information obtained in any investigation pursuant to
this Section 6.4 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of
the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

               (d) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent upon
obtaining Knowledge of (i) any material failure of the Company to comply with
or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder or (ii) any representation or warranty of the
Company contained in this Agreement having become, or being when made, untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect or (iii) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event whose occurrence or non-occurrence, as the case may
be, would reasonably be likely to cause any condition set forth in ARTICLE
VIII to be unsatisfied at the Closing Date (except to the extent it refers to
a specific date); provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section 6.4(d) shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the
representations, warranties or covenants of the parties hereto or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto.

               (e) As soon as such information becomes available, and in any
event not later than thirty (30) days after the end of each fiscal month, the
Company shall provide to Parent the Monthly Financial Statements together
with a list of the ages and amounts of all accounts and notes due and
uncollected as of the end of such month.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
during such period the Company and each Company Subsidiary agrees to provide
to Parent and its accountants, counsel and other representatives copies of
the internal financial statements of the Company and any Company Subsidiary
promptly upon request.

          Section 6.5   Compliance with the WARN Act and Similar Laws

          The Company shall not, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries not to, at any time within the 90-day period before the
Effective Time, without complying fully with the notice and other
requirements of the WARN Act, effectuate (1) a "plant closing" (as defined in
the WARN Act) affecting any single site of employment or one or more
facilities or operating units within any single site of employment of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries; or (2) a "mass layoff" (as
defined in the WARN Act) at any single site of employment or one or more
facilities or operating units within any single site of employment of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.  Nor shall the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries otherwise terminate or lay off employees in such
numbers as to give rise to liability under any applicable laws respecting the
payment of severance pay, separation pay, termination pay, pay in lieu of
notice of termination, redundancy pay, or the payment of any other
compensation, premium or penalty upon termination of employment, reduction of
hours, or temporary or permanent layoffs.  For purposes of the WARN Act and
this Agreement, the Effective Time is and shall be the same as the "effective
date" within the meaning of the WARN Act.

          Section 6.6   Assistance with Financing

          Subject to the limitations outlined and the obligations of Parent
set forth below, and subordinate to (1) the commitments set forth in Section
7.10 and (2) until the Disclosure Schedule Delivery Date, the efforts
required to complete the preparation of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
representatives to, reasonably cooperate in connection with the arrangement
of any Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent.  Such cooperation
by the Company shall include, at the request of Parent and if reasonably
necessary to obtain any such Financing, (i) agreeing to enter into such
agreements, and to use reasonable efforts to deliver such officer's
certificates and opinions, as are customary in financings of such type and as
are, in the good faith determination of the persons executing such officer's
certificates or opinions, accurate, and agreeing to pledge, grant security
interests in, and otherwise grant liens on, the Company's assets pursuant to
such agreements as may be reasonably requested (provided that no obligation
of the Company under any such agreement, pledge or grant shall be effective
until the Effective Time, and any fees, expenses, or other costs associated
with the preparation, execution, filing, and/or recording of such materials
will be borne by Parent), (ii) participating via telephone or in person in
Joplin, Missouri, in a limited number of meetings, drafting sessions, due
diligence sessions, management presentation sessions and sessions with rating
agencies, (iii) using commercially reasonable efforts to prepare or
participate in the preparation of business projections and financial
statements for inclusion in offering memoranda, private placement memoranda,
prospectuses and similar documents, (iv) instructing its independent
accountants to provide reasonable assistance to Parent (including to provide
consent to Parent to prepare and use their audit reports relating to the
Company and any necessary consent letters and "comfort letters" in connection
with such Financing), subject to Parent's payment of any associated fees,
expenses, or other costs, and (v) providing to the lenders in connection with
any such Financing financial and other information in the Company's
possession with respect to the Merger, making the Company's senior officers
available to assist such lenders and otherwise reasonably cooperating in
connection with the consummation of such Financing.  All of the foregoing
agreements of the Company are subject to Parent's covenant and obligation to
(x) limit to the greatest degree reasonably practicable the disruptions to
and extra demands placed upon the employees responsible for conducting the
operations of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (y) avoid
unreasonable interference with the necessary and proper performance by
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries of their usual and customary
responsibilities occasioned by the additional activities enumerated in this
Section 6.6, including but not limited to providing as much advance notice as
is reasonably practicable of scheduling arrangements, availability
requirements, and required deliverables; scheduling meetings and requests
cooperatively with Company employees for mutual convenience; structuring
meeting agendas and discussions with third parties to most efficiently
utilize the time and obtain the required information of Company employees,
including limiting participation to the portions of telephone conferences and
in-person meetings at which the presence of Company personnel is required;
and coordinating due diligence and other information requests of Parent with
those of third parties to minimize duplicative and overlapping inquiries and
requests.  Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions of this
Section 6.6, in no event shall any officer, director or other employee or
representative of the Company be required to be available for more than five
(5) hours on average each week to provide assistance with respect to the
Financing.

                                 ARTICLE VII

                            ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

          For purposes of this ARTICLE VII, for each requirement that applies
to the Company in respect of its Subsidiaries in those instances where the
Company does not own the majority of the voting stock of a Company
Subsidiary, all obligations of the Company with respect to such Company
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be the obligation to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such Company Subsidiary to take or not take, as
the case may be, such actions.

          Section 7.1   Public Disclosure

               (a) Parent and the Company have, prior to the date hereof,
agreed upon a joint press release regarding the existence or terms of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and, prior to the
Closing, neither the Company nor Parent shall (nor shall they permit any of
their Subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives or advisors to)
issue any other press release or make any other statement or disclosure
without the prior written approval of the other party, except as may be
required by applicable Law, in which case the disclosing party shall provide
the other party such advance notice as is reasonable under the circumstances
prior to the making of, and shall consult with the other party regarding the
form of, any such required disclosure.

               (b)   Each Principal Shareholder and the Shareholders' Agent
severally agrees that he or she shall not, prior to or following the Closing,
issue any press release, make any other public statement or make any other
disclosure to any third party (whether or not in response to an inquiry)
regarding the existence and terms of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior written approval of Parent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Principal Shareholders may reveal the
existence and terms of this Agreement to their respective representatives and
advisors (a) who need to know the terms of this Agreement for the purpose of
evaluating the Merger, (b) who are informed of the confidential nature of the
Agreement and (c) who agree to act in accordance with the terms of this
Section 7.1 (such representatives and advisors, "Principal Shareholder
Representatives").

               (c)   From the date hereof until that date that is two (2)
years after the Closing Date, each Principal Shareholder and his or her
respective Principal Shareholder Representatives severally agrees that he or
she shall maintain in confidence and not use or disclose to any third party
(i) any confidential or proprietary information regarding the business
operations, product formulations, processes, technical know-how or data,
specifications, finances or other business matters of the Company and (ii)
the terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.  Upon
discovery by any Principal Shareholder or any of their Principal Shareholder
Representatives that such Person is in possession of any such confidential or
proprietary information, such Person shall promptly destroy or return to
Parent such information without retaining any copies thereof except for
copies that such Person is required to retain by applicable Law or
professional obligation or to the extent such Person reasonably believes
necessary to preserve any legal right.  The Principal Shareholders shall be
responsible for ensuring the compliance of their respective Principal
Shareholder Representatives with the obligations in this Section 7.1(c)
applicable to them.  To the extent that any former Principal Shareholder
Representative is subject to a confidentiality agreement with a Principal
Shareholder with respect to confidential information subject to this Section
7.1(c), such Principal Shareholder shall undertake reasonable measures to
enforce such confidentiality obligations, shall not waive such rights, or
release such former Principal Shareholder Representative from its obligations
with respect thereto, and, to the extent reasonably practicable, allow Parent
to seek to enforce such rights directly.  If any Principal Shareholder or any
of their respective Principal Shareholder Representatives receives a request
or is required (by oral questions, interrogatories, request for information
or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar legal process
or by regulatory agency or stock exchange or other applicable rules) to
disclose all or any part of such confidential or proprietary information,
each Principal Shareholder severally agrees that he or she shall, and shall
undertake reasonable measures to ensure that his or her respective Principal
Shareholder Representatives shall, promptly notify Parent of each such
request or determination, to the extent practicable and not limited by Law or
legal or regulatory process, so that Parent may seek a protective order or
other appropriate remedy.

          Section 7.2   Consents; Cooperation

          The Company shall be responsible for promptly applying for or
otherwise seeking, and using its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain,
all consents, waivers and approvals required to be obtained by it or any
Company Subsidiary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

          Section 7.3   Legal Requirements

          Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will, and the Company will cause its
Subsidiaries to, take all actions necessary to comply in all material
respects promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on it with
respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and will take all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and will
cooperate with the other parties hereto in obtaining) any consent, approval,
order or authorization of, or any registration, declaration or filing with,
any Governmental Entity or other Person, required to be obtained or made by
it in connection with the taking of any action contemplated by this
Agreement.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of
Parent and the Company agrees (a) to make an appropriate filing under the HSR
Act as soon as practicable, but in no event more than ten (10) Business Days
of the date of this Agreement (the "Antitrust Filings") and (b) to supply
promptly any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested in connection with the Antitrust Filings.  Parent shall pay all
filing fees arising in connection with the Antitrust Filings.

          Section 7.4   Commercially Reasonable Efforts and Further Assurances

          Prior to the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, (x) each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to consummate and make effective the
Transactions as promptly as practicable and (y) the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to, or cause the Company Subsidiaries to,
consummate and make effective the Transactions as promptly as practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall this Section 7.4 require
Parent to take any action that is reasonably likely to adversely affect
Parent or its affiliates (other than Merger Sub) following the consummation
of the Transactions in any material respect.  Prior to closing, Parent agrees
that it shall not engage in any transaction that would reasonably be expected
to compromise its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.  Without limiting its obligations in this Section 7.4, the Company
and the Company Board shall, if any takeover statute or similar Law is or
becomes applicable to the Transactions, this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use commercially reasonable
efforts to consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such Law on the Transactions, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.  Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and its and their representatives to, reasonably
cooperate in connection with the development of plans, systems and procedures
in respect of the anticipated operation of the Surviving Corporation
following the Effective Time (provided that such requested cooperation does
not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall this
Section 7.4 require the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to the
Closing, to (i) sell, divest, hold separate, or otherwise dispose of any of
their respective businesses, product lines or assets; (ii) conduct their
respective businesses in a specified manner; (iii) agree to take any of the
actions set forth in clause (i) or (ii), other than agreements that would
require such actions only on or after the Closing; or (iv) agree to take any
other action or agree to any restriction, limitation or condition that would
or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company and its Subsidiaries, other than agreements that would require such
actions or would impose such restrictions, limitations or conditions only on
or after the Closing.

          Section 7.5   Termination of Plans

          Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent no later than
three Business Days prior to the Closing Date the Company shall, or shall
take all actions necessary or appropriate so that the Contract Freighters,
Inc. Employees' Retirement Plan (the "401(k) Plan") shall be terminated as of
no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, but contingent
on the Closing, including adopting such resolutions prior to the Effective
Time as are necessary or appropriate to implement the foregoing.  Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall provide to Parent evidence that the
Company Board has adopted resolutions to terminate the 401(k) Plan (the form
and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to prior review and
approval of Parent, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

          Section 7.6   Certain Tax Matters

               (a)   Tax Returns and Cooperation.

                      (i) The Principal Shareholders shall cause the
    Company to prepare and timely file, in a manner consistent with past
    practice and subject to the review and reasonable approval of
    Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
    or conditioned, all United States federal, state, local, and foreign
    Tax Returns and amendments thereto required to be filed by or for
    the Company and each Company Subsidiary for all taxable periods
    ending on or before the Closing Date.  The Principal Shareholders
    shall provide Parent with a draft of such Tax Returns at least
    fourteen (14) days prior to the due date (including applicable
    extensions) of each such Tax Return.  Parent will be given a copy of
    Tax Returns filed after the date hereof.

                      (ii) The Company Shareholders shall be liable for
    all Taxes of the Company and each Company Subsidiary for the Pre-
    Closing Taxable Period (other than to the extent that the liability
    for those Taxes is taken into account as an accrued Tax liability in
    the Liability Accounts that are a part of the Closing Balance Sheet
    or for which Parent has assumed responsibility for payment of the
    Tax pursuant to Section 7.6(a)(iv)) and all Taxes of the Company
    Shareholders for any taxable year or taxable period.  Each of the
    Company Shareholders and Parent hereby agree that the Tax year of
    the Company for Federal income tax purposes will end on the Closing
    Date and the Company's S Corporation status will terminate for
    Federal income tax purposes as of the Closing Date.  Notwithstanding
    the foregoing, in the case of any Straddle Period, the portion of
    the Taxes of the Company and each Company Subsidiary for such
    Straddle Period attributable to the period prior to close of the
    Closing Date shall be treated as Taxes of a Pre-Closing Taxable
    Period for purposes of this Section 7.6(a)(ii).  The amount of
    Straddle Period Taxes of the Company and each Company Subsidiary
    that are treated as Taxes of a Pre-Closing Taxable Period shall be
    computed (x) in the case of income, franchise, sales, or similar
    taxes, pursuant to an interim closing of the books method by
    assuming that the Company and each Company Subsidiary had a taxable
    year or period which ended on the Closing Date, except that
    exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
    annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be
    apportioned on a per-diem basis and (y) in the case of real property
    Taxes, personal property taxes and similar ad valorem obligations by
    prorating such Taxes owed for the Straddle Period on a per-diem
    basis.

                      (iii) Except as provided above with respect to
    Straddle Periods, Parent shall be liable for any and all Taxes
    imposed on the Company relating to or apportioned to any Post-
    Closing Taxable Period.

                      (iv) No new elections with respect to Taxes, any
    changes in current elections with respect to Taxes of the Company
    and/or any Company Subsidiary or any amendments to any Tax Returns
    of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in each case, which may
    have an effect on the Company and/or any Company Subsidiary for
    periods ending after the Closing Date shall be made after the date
    of this Agreement without the prior written consent of Parent, which
    consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
    No new elections with respect to Taxes, or any change in current
    elections with respect to Taxes of the Company which may have an
    adverse effect on the liability of Company Shareholders for Taxes
    shall be made after the Closing Date by Parent, the Company, the
    Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary (i) without the
    prior written consent of the Shareholders' Agent, which consent
    shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, or (ii)
    unless Parent agrees to (x) be responsible for any incremental Taxes
    of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and (y) reimburse the
    Company Shareholders for any incremental Taxes of the Company
    Shareholders (including, on an iterative basis, any Taxes on such
    reimbursement payments), in each case as a result of making any such
    election.  In the event of a dispute regarding the amount of
    reimbursement payable to Company Shareholders pursuant to clause
    (ii)(y) of the preceding sentence, (A) the dispute shall be
    submitted to the Reviewing Auditor or another accounting firm
    mutually agreeable to the Shareholders' Agent and the Parent, whose
    decision regarding the required amount of reimbursement shall be
    binding on Parent and the Company Shareholders, (B) all fees and
    costs of the Reviewing Auditor or other accounting firm selected
    pursuant to clause (A) above shall be borne by the Parent, and (C)
    the Parent and the Company Shareholders seeking reimbursement under
    clause (ii)(y) of the preceding sentence shall provide to the
    Reviewing Auditor or other accounting firm selected pursuant to
    clause (A) above all information reasonably requested by such Person
    to enable it to make a determination regarding the required
    reimbursement amount.

                      (v) Parent, the Company and the Principal
    Shareholders shall each cooperate fully, as and to the extent
    reasonably requested by any other party, in connection with the
    filing of Returns pursuant to this Section 7.6(a) and any audit,
    litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes.  Such
    cooperation shall include the retention and (upon any other party's
    request) the provision of records and information which are
    reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other
    proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
    basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
    material provided hereunder.  The Company (before the Closing) and
    Parent (after the Closing) shall each cause the Company and each
    Company Subsidiary (A) to retain all books and records with respect
    to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and each Company Subsidiary
    relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
    until the expiration of the statutory period of limitations of the
    respective taxable  periods, and to abide by all record retention
    agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority, and (B) to give
    the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
    destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if  the
    other party so requests, the Principal Shareholders or Parent as the
    case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such
    books and records.

                      (vi) Notwithstanding anything contrary herein,
    Parent and the Company further agree, upon request of the other
    party or the Shareholders' Agent, to use good faith commercially
    reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other documents from
    any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to
    mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
    (including, but not limited to, with respect to the Transactions
    contemplated hereby); provided that such certificate or other
    document does not increase the Tax of Parent, or the Company, or any
    Company Shareholder.

               (b)   Other Tax Matters

                      (i) The Company Shareholders shall be responsible
    for all transfer, sales and other similar taxes as a result of the
    Transactions.

                      (ii) Parent shall not bear any Taxes resulting from
    the Company's failure to qualify as an S corporation.  For the
    avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not be responsible for any Taxes of
    the Company Shareholders, including Taxes, if any, paid by the
    Company on a composite or other similar basis.

                      (iii) Neither the Company nor any Company
    Shareholder shall revoke, prior to the Closing, the Company's or any
    Company Subsidiary's election to be taxed as an S corporation or as
    a qualified subchapter S subsidiary.  Neither the Company nor any
    Company Shareholder shall take any action prior to the Closing that
    could reasonably be expected to result in the termination of the
    Company's or a Company Subsidiary's status as a validly elected S
    corporation or a qualified subchapter S subsidiary.

          Section 7.7   No Solicitation of Employees

          For a period of three (3) years commencing on the Closing Date,
each Principal Shareholder severally agrees that he or she shall not solicit
or attempt to solicit any Signing Date Employee to leave the employ of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, as the case may be.

          Section 7.8   Mexican Subsidiary Shareholders

          The Company shall cooperate with Parent in respect of the status of
the interests of the Mexican Subsidiaries held by the Mexican Subsidiary
Shareholders, including undertaking good faith efforts to assist Parent in
its efforts to cause such Mexican Subsidiary Shareholders to transfer any
stock of a Mexican Subsidiary held by such Mexican Subsidiary Shareholder to
other Persons as directed by Parent in Parent's sole discretion.

          Section 7.9   Communication with Employees

          The Company shall not (nor permit any Company Subsidiary or any of
their respective subsidiaries, representatives or advisors to) engage in
discussions with, or issue any communications (written or oral) or make any
other statement or disclosure to, the Company's or the Company Subsidiaries'
employees concerning the Merger or any effect or change to any terms of
employment without (x) substantially adhering to the terms of a script as to
the form and substance of any such communication provided by Parent to the
Company prior to the date hereof or (y) the prior written approval of Parent;
provided, that this Section 7.9 shall not apply to communications with the
Company Shareholders necessary or advisable in connection with the
Shareholders Meeting.

          Section 7.10  Due Diligence Period

               (a)   The Parties acknowledge and agree that Parent shall
continue to conduct its due diligence and transition planning with respect to
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries during the period commencing on the
date of this Agreement and terminating at 7:00 p.m. Central time on
August 21, 2007 (the "Due Diligence Period").  During the Due Diligence
Period and thereafter prior to the Closing the Company shall afford, and
shall cause each Company Subsidiary to afford, Parent and its accountants,
counsel and other representatives reasonable access and under reasonable
circumstances to (i) all of the properties, books, Contracts, commitments and
records, patent application files, advisors and personnel of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries and (ii) all other information concerning the
business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, their respective
properties, advisors and personnel as Parent may reasonably request
(collectively, "Due Diligence Access").  On or before August 3, 2007, the
Company shall fully respond to each of the requests set forth in that certain
diligence request list attached hereto as Exhibit F.  After August 3, 2007,
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to all other
due diligence requests promptly, and in any event not more than seventy-two
(72) hours after any request is made; provided, that nothing in this Section
7.10 shall be construed to require action by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary that is not practicable despite the exertion of commercially
reasonable efforts and provided, further that, except as specifically
provided in this Agreement, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
shall be required to create information, documents or other materials not
derivable from the books and records of the Company or such Company
Subsidiary through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts or in
forms or formats that cannot be derived from the forms in which the Company's
or such Company Subsidiary's information, documents, or other materials are
created, maintained or held through the exercise of commercially reasonable
efforts.  The Company Due Diligence Supervisor and the Parent Due Diligence
Supervisor shall be responsible for coordinating, organizing and facilitating
Due Diligence Access.  Each instance of Due Diligence Access is subject to
the prior approval of the Company Due Diligence Supervisor, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement, (x) Parent shall take reasonable
actions to reduce interference with or disruption of the operation of the
business of the Company and any Company Subsidiary, (y) Company shall have
the right to have the Company Due Diligence Supervisor or his designee
present during any entry by Parent, its accountants, counsel and other
representatives upon the properties of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
and (z) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor any of their
respective officers, directors, representatives, auditors and agents shall
have any obligation to disclose any information to Parent if such disclosure
would reasonably be expected to violate any applicable Law or Contract
entered into prior to the date hereof, provided that if such disclosure would
reasonably be expected to result in a violation of a non-disclosure
obligation under any such Contract, the Company shall, and shall cause each
Company Subsidiary to, provide Parent with the material terms of such
Contract without violating such non-disclosure obligation by providing Parent
a redacted copy of the Contract, a summary of the material terms of the
Contract or other means of conveying such information to Parent.  Subject to
the foregoing, up to and including the Closing Date, Parent or its employees,
representatives, engineers, consultants or agents may enter into and upon all
or any portion of the Company's or any Company Subsidiary's properties in
order to investigate and assess, as Parent deems necessary or appropriate in
its sole and absolute discretion, the environmental condition of such
properties or the business of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the
"Investigation").  The Investigation may include, but need not be limited to,
the performance of soil and surface or ground water sampling, monitoring,
borings, or testing, and any other tests, investigations, audits,
assessments, studies, inspections or other procedures relating to
environmental conditions or Materials of Environmental Concern relating to
the Company's or any Company Subsidiary's properties or the business of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary.  The Company shall cooperate, and shall
cause each Company Subsidiary to cooperate, with Parent in conducting any
such Investigation, shall allow Parent full access to the Company's or such
Company's Subsidiary's properties or the business of the Company or such
Company Subsidiary, together with full permission to conduct any such
Investigation, and shall provide, and shall cause such Company Subsidiary to
provide, to Parent all plans, soil or surface or ground water tests or
reports, any environmental investigation results, reports or assessments
previously or contemporaneously conducted or prepared by or on behalf of the
Company or such Company Subsidiary or its predecessors, and all information
relating to environmental matters regarding the Company's or such Company
Subsidiary's properties or the business of the Company or such Company
Subsidiary that is in the Company's or any Company Subsidiary's possession or
control, or is reasonably available to the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
any of their respective employees, representatives, engineers, consultants or
agents.  This grant of access shall not constitute a possessory right,
easement, or other property interest, but constitutes a temporary,
nonexclusive license to enter the properties to conduct the Investigation.
If drilling or subsurface testing is required for the Investigation, Parent
shall provide the Company Due Diligence Supervisor copies of a scope of work
or work plan no less than two (2) business days in advance of any proposed
drilling or subsurface testing.  Parent shall provide the Company a copy of
any (x) soil or surface or ground water tests or reports, (y) any
environmental investigation results, reports or (z) assessments prepared, or
data produced or created, by any third party conducting the Investigation in
conjunction with any Investigation.  At the conclusion of the Investigation
if Parent has terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.10(b), Parent
shall restore any physical disturbance to the properties caused by their
entry thereon so as to return the properties to their immediate prior
condition, including without limitation the abandonment of any groundwater
monitoring wells installed by Parent in accordance with applicable Laws.
Parent shall indemnify, defend, and hold the Company harmless against any
actual and direct physical damage to property, any liens or any personal
injury claim directly caused by and solely the result of Parent's
Investigation.  This obligation to indemnify the Company shall survive until
the date that is two (2) years from the earlier of (x) the date of
termination of this Agreement or (y) the Closing Date.

               (b)   Prior to 7:00 p.m. Central time on the first day
following the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Parent shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement by notice to the Company (the "Due
Diligence Termination Notice") if (i) (x) it shall not have completed its due
diligence investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (y) Parent
shall not be satisfied by the results of such investigations, in each case as
determined by Parent in Parent's sole discretion and (ii) it pays the Company
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (the "Due Diligence Termination
Fee") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be
designated in writing by the Company.  Parent shall be deemed to have elected
to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to have
waived its right to terminate the Agreement in accordance with this Section
7.10(b) unless, prior to 7:00 p.m. Central time on the first day following
the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, the Company shall have received
from Parent (x) written notice indicating that Parent is exercising its right
to terminate the Agreement in accordance with this Section 7.10(b) and (y)
the Due Diligence Termination Fee.

          Section 7.11  Directors and Officers.

          From and after the Closing, Parent shall cause the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and any of its
Subsidiaries that were formerly Company Subsidiaries to contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to limitation of liability and indemnification
than are set forth in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company
and the respective former Company Subsidiary as of the date of this
Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six (6) years after the Closing in any manner that
would materially and adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
individuals who at or prior to the Closing were directors, officer, agents or
employees of the Company or any former Company Subsidiary or who were
otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company or any former Company Subsidiary.

          Section 7.12  Retention of Reviewing Auditor

          In the event that the Reviewing Auditor is called upon to provide
the services set forth in this Agreement, each Principal Shareholder agrees
that it shall not and Parent agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, retain the services of the Reviewing Auditor (i.e., the
specific office of the auditing firm) for a period of two (2) years following
the completion of such services; provided that any such agreement shall be
limited to the retention of the specific office that serves as the Reviewing
Auditor.

enacted, entered or enforced, which makes the consummation of the Merger
illegal.  In the event an injunction or other order shall have been issued,

ARTICLE X to the extent of such excess severally, and not jointly, in
proportion to their Proportionate Share, provided that an Indemnified Person
shall be entitled to seek the full benefit of the indemnification to which
such Person is entitled hereunder from the Principal Shareholders, and not
the other Company Shareholders, severally, and not jointly, in the same
proportion as the number of Company Shares owned by such Principal
Shareholders immediately before the Merger bears to the number of Company
Shares owned by all Principal Shareholders.  Notwithstanding any other
provision contained in this ARTICLE X, in no event shall the liability of any
Company Shareholder under this ARTICLE X exceed an amount equal to the
aggregate amount paid or to be paid to such Company Shareholder under this

account in accordance with Section 2.8 and Section 9.3, (ii) (A) shall be
computed net of any third-party insurance proceeds which have been recovered
by the Indemnified Person in connection with the facts giving rise to the
right of indemnification (net of expenses incurred in obtaining such recovery
and net of any increase in insurance premiums resulting from such facts or
such recovery) and (B) if the Indemnifying Person makes any payment on any
Third Party Claim, the indemnifying Person shall be subrogated, to the extent
of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Person to any
insurance benefits or other claims of the Indemnified Person with respect to
such Third Party Claim, (iii) shall be reduced to take account of any net Tax
benefit realized but only if, and to the extent actually realized in the form
of an actual reduction in cash that would otherwise have been payable by such
Indemnified Party but for the indemnity claim in the Tax year in which such
claim is finally resolved (for the avoidance of doubt, any Tax attributes of
Parent, the Company, or their Subsidiaries shall be taken into account first
prior to any deductions or other Tax attributes resulting from such claim)
and (iv) shall be reduced by any reversal of such Damages in a subsequent
period occurring less than two (2) years after the related indemnification
payment has been made hereunder, provided, that in such instance Parent shall
promptly pay to the Shareholders' Agent the full amount of any such reversal;
provided further, if at the end of such two (2) years there shall be any suit
or other proceeding pending which may result in a reversal of Damages, such
two (2) year period shall be extended until final resolution of such action
or other proceeding.  Each Indemnified Party shall be obligated to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the amount of any Damages for
which it is entitled to seek indemnification hereunder, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain recovery under existing insurance
policies.  The existence or potential availability of insurance or any
potential recovery from any third party shall not delay the Indemnifying
Person's obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person as set forth herein.

               (k)   From and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Indemnified Persons with respect to any and all claims relating
to the subject matter of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
ARTICLE X.  In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent, on its own behalf and on
behalf of each Indemnified Person, hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, and agrees not to assert in any action or proceeding of any
kind, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may now or hereafter
have under any Law, other than claims for indemnification asserted as
permitted by and in accordance with the provisions set forth in this ARTICLE
X.

reasonable detail the basis for such objection.  In the event that the
Shareholders' Agent does not object to a claim in accordance with the
preceding sentence by the close of business on the thirtieth (30th) Business
Day following receipt by the Shareholders' Agent of the Officer's
Certificate, the Shareholders' Agent shall be deemed to have accepted and
agreed to the claim set forth in such Officer's Certificate on behalf of the
Company Shareholders, and shall be precluded from raising any objection
thereto following such date.  In the event that the Shareholders' Agent
accepts and agrees to a claim set forth in an Officer's Certificate, or is
deemed to accept and agree in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence, the Shareholders' Agent and Parent shall instruct the Escrow Agent
by jointly executed written notice to disburse the claimed amount to Parent.

               (b)   In case the Shareholders' Agent shall so object in
writing to any claim or claims by Parent made in any Officer's Certificate,

period there remains a dispute as to any claims, the Shareholders' Agent and
Parent shall attempt in good faith for sixty (60) days to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims.  If the
Shareholders' Agent and Parent should so agree, the claims set forth in such
Officer's Certificate shall be modified as necessary to reflect such
agreement, and the Shareholders' Agent and Parent shall instruct the Escrow
Agent by jointly executed written notice to disburse the agreed amount to
Parent.

               (c)   If no such agreement can be reached after good faith
negotiation during such sixty (60) day period, either Parent or the
Shareholders' Agent may pursue any and all legal remedies available to such
party.

for the accomplishment of any or all of the foregoing.  No bond shall be

receive no compensation for her services.  Notices or communications to or
from the Shareholders' Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the
Company Shareholders.

               (b)   The Shareholders' Agent shall not be liable for any act
done or omitted hereunder as Shareholders' Agent while acting in good faith
and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted
pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good
faith.  The Company Shareholders shall severally indemnify the Shareholders'
Agent on the basis of their respective Proportionate Shares and hold her
harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross
negligence or bad faith on the part of the Shareholders' Agent and arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of her duties
hereunder.  Nothing in this Section 10.6 shall limit the Shareholders'
Agent's obligations to any Indemnified Person pursuant to the terms of this
ARTICLE X.

          Section 10.7  Actions of the Shareholders' Agent

          A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders' Agent
shall constitute a decision of all of the Company Shareholders and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon each and every Company Shareholder, and

any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders' Agent as being

done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Shareholders' Agent.

claim (including any demand received by the Surviving Corporation for payment
for Dissenting Shares) which Parent believes give rise to indemnification
under this ARTICLE X (a "Third Party Claim"), Parent shall promptly notify
the Shareholders' Agent of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that so
long as the notice is delivered within the Indemnification Period the failure
to give prompt notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder
except to the extent the Shareholders' Agent, on behalf of the Company
Shareholders, has been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.  The
notice of Third Party Claim shall include, based on the information then
available to Parent, a summary in reasonable detail of the basis for the
claim and a reasonable estimate of the Damages.  The Shareholders' Agent, on
behalf of the Company Shareholders, shall be entitled, upon written notice
delivered to Parent within forty five (45) days of its receipt of Parent's
notice of a Third Party Claim to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent
and the payment of the fees and disbursements of such counsel from the Escrow
Account (for so long as funds are available in the Escrow Account, and with
respect to claims described in Section 10.1(d), (e), (f) and (g) for which
funds are no longer available, from the Company Shareholders, and with
respect to claims described in Section 10.1(h) for which funds are longer
available, from the Company Shareholders, but only to the extent of the
limitations set forth in Section 10.1(h)(ii)).  In the event that the
Shareholders' Agent declines or fails to assume the defense of the Third
Party Claim within such forty five (45) day period, then the Shareholders'
Agent shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for Parent
as incurred from the Escrow Account (for so long as funds are available in
the Escrow Account, and with respect to claims described in Section 10.1(d),
(e), (f) and (g) for which funds are no longer available, from the Company
Shareholders, and with respect to claims described in Section 10.1(h) for
which funds are longer available, from the Company Shareholders, but only to
the extent of the limitations set forth in Section 10.1(h)(ii)); provided,
however, that the Shareholders' Agent shall not be required to pay the fees
and disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Persons, and
additional local counsel, if necessary, for any single Third Party Claim.
With respect to any Third Party Claim for which indemnification is sought
hereunder, Parent or the Shareholders' Agent, whichever is not assuming the
defense of such Third Party Claim, shall have the right to participate in
such matter and to retain its own counsel at such party's own expense.  The
party controlling the defense of such Third Party Claim shall at all times
use reasonable efforts to keep the other party reasonably apprised of the
status of the defense of such Third Party Claim and the Parties shall
cooperate in good faith with each other with respect to the defense of any
such matter.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 10.8(a),
Shareholders' Agent shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third
Party Action (and shall be liable for the reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel of Parent in connection with defending such Third Party Claim, to
be paid from the Escrow Account (for so long as funds are available in the
Escrow Account, and with respect to claims described in Section 10.1(d), (e),
(f) and (g) for which funds are no longer available, from the Company
Shareholders, and with respect to claims described in Section 10.1(h) for
which funds are longer available, from the Company Shareholders, but only to
the extent of the limitations set forth in Section 10.1(h)(ii)) if the Third
Party Claim (i) involves a matter where a single counsel selected by
Shareholders' Agent may not represent Shareholders' Agent and Parent under
applicable ethical rules involving conflicts of interest or (ii) seeks an
order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief other than money
damages against the Indemnified Person that the Indemnified Person reasonably
determines cannot be separated from any related claim for money damages or
(iii) is in respect of Taxes that could adversely impact any Post-Closing
Taxable Period of the Parent, Company or any Company Subsidiary.  With
respect to any Third Party Claim in respect of Taxes related to any Pre-
Closing Taxable Period for which Parent has assumed responsibility pursuant
to Section 7.6(a)(iv), (y) Shareholders' Agent shall not be entitled to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim and (z) no Indemnified Person
shall be entitled to seek reimbursement hereunder for fees and disbursements
of counsel in connection therewith.

               (b)   Subject to Section 10.8(c), neither Parent nor any other
Indemnified Person may settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent
to the entry of any judgment in connection therewith without the prior
written consent of the Shareholders' Agent unless (i) Shareholders' Agent
fails timely to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim in accordance
with Section 10.8(a) hereof, or (ii) such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of Shareholders' Agent, the Company
Shareholders and any Person serving as an officer, director employee or agent
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing from all
liability arising from such Third Party Claim.  Shareholders' Agent may not
settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment in connection therewith without the prior written consent of Parent
unless such settlement, compromise or consent (except in respect of a Tax
matter that could adversely impact any Post-Closing Taxable Period of Parent,
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or in respect of Taxes related to any
Pre-Closing Taxable Period for which Parent has assumed responsibility
hereunder, which in all cases shall require prior written consent of Parent,
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (x) includes an
unconditional release of the Indemnified Persons from all liability arising
from such Third Party Claim, (y) does not contain any admission or statement
suggesting any wrongdoing or liability on behalf of any Indemnified Person
and (z) does not contain any equitable order, judgment or term that in any
manner affects, restrains or interferes with the business of any Indemnified
Person.

               (c)   None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company
or any Company Subsidiary may settle or compromise any claim with respect to
Taxes for which the Company Shareholders would be responsible hereunder (i)
without the prior written consent of the Shareholders' Agent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed or (ii) unless
Parent agrees to reimburse the Company Shareholders for any incremental Taxes
of the Company Shareholders (including, on an iterative basis, any Taxes on
such reimbursement payments), resulting from the settlement or compromise of
such Tax claim.  In the event of a dispute regarding the amount of
reimbursement payable to Company Shareholders pursuant to clause (ii) of the
preceding sentence, (x) the dispute shall be submitted to the Reviewing
Auditor or another accounting firm mutually agreeable to the Shareholders'
Agent and the Parent, whose decision regarding the required amount of
reimbursement shall be binding on Parent and the Company Shareholders, (y)
all fees and costs of the Reviewing Auditor or other accounting firm selected
pursuant to the preceding clause (x) shall be borne by the Parent, and (z)
the Parent and the Company Shareholders seeking reimbursement under clause
(ii) of the preceding sentence shall provide to the Reviewing Auditor or
other accounting firm selected pursuant to the preceding clause (x) all
information reasonably requested by such Person to enable it to make a
determination regarding the required reimbursement amount.

          Section 10.9  No Right of Contribution

          Neither the Shareholders' Agent nor any Company Shareholder,
including, without limitation, the Principal Shareholders, shall make any
claim for contribution from the Company or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to any indemnity claims arising under or in connection with this
Agreement to the extent that the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder for such claim,
and the Shareholders' Agent, on its own behalf and on behalf of all Company
Shareholders, hereby waives any such right of contribution from the Company
or the Surviving Corporation it has or may have in the future.

                                 ARTICLE XI

termination.

indicated.  The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein
shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation."  The phrase "made available" in this Agreement shall be deemed
to mean that the information referred to has been posted in an on-line data

purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.

          Section 11.4  Counterparts

          This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.  Delivery of an executed
signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or electronic transmission

          Section 11.5  Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest

other agreements specifically referred to herein or delivered pursuant

Disclosure Schedule (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof, (b) except by operation of the Merger, shall not
be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise except as otherwise specifically
provided, and (c) shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any third party

except for Section 7.11 which is intended to be for the benefit of the
Persons described therein and may be enforced by any such Person.

          Section 11.6  Severability

          In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto.  The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

          Section 11.7  Governing Law

          This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Missouri without reference to such state's
principles of conflicts of Law.  Each party hereto: (a) irrevocably and
unconditionally consents and submits to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court
sitting in Kansas City, Missouri and the United States District Court for the
Western District of Missouri for purposes of any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement; (b) agrees that service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. mail addressed to such party in
accordance with the notice provisions hereof shall be deemed to constitute
effective service thereof for purposes of any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement; (c) irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this letter agreement in
Circuit Court sitting in Kansas City, Missouri or the United States District

unconditionally waives the right to plead or claim, and irrevocably and

inconvenient forum.

          Section 11.8  Rules of Construction

          The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel
during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and,
therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

          Section 11.9  Specific Performance

          The parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at Law
would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and that the parties
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to
any other remedy at Law or equity.

          Section 11.10 Descriptive Headings

and are not intended to be part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.

          Section 11.11 Force Majeure

          No party shall be deemed to fail to perform its obligations or
respond to any notice on a timely basis if its failure results solely from
the following causes beyond its reasonable control, specifically: war,
terrorism, strikes, natural disaster or acts of God.  Any delay resulting
directly from any of said causes shall extend accordingly the time to perform
or respond by the length of the delay.  For avoidance of doubt, the foregoing
shall in no event relieve any party of its obligations hereunder or permit a
party to fail to respond to notice beyond the extension described in the
preceding sentence.

          Section 11.12 No Personal Liability

          Parent and the Merger Sub acknowledge that the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and their shareholders, officers, employees, agents and
representatives, including the Shareholders' Agent, have performed or may
perform acts in connection with this Agreement on behalf of the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries, or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub, to facilitate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, after the Closing Date no such shareholder, officer, employee,
agent or representative shall have, as a result of serving in such capacity,
and Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries hereby
absolve all such Persons from, any personal liability or obligation for any
matter relating to or arising out of this Agreement and any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, other than each such Person's
indemnification and other obligations as set forth herein or in any other
agreement to which Person is a party.

          Section 11.13 Merger Sub

contain a confirmation by such Subsidiary of the accuracy with respect to it
of the representations set forth in ARTICLE IV.  Upon delivery of such
notice, wherever the words "Merger Sub" are used in this Agreement (other
than in this Section 11.13), such words shall be deemed to refer to such
Subsidiary in lieu of Merger Sub.
