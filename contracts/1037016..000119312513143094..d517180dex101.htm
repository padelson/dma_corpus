cause to be timely paid) all Taxes due with respect to Seller Returns, to the
extent not already taken into account in determining Net Working Capital (as

Price adjustment hereunder. The Sellers shall make available to the Purchasers
any Seller Returns and related workpapers for the Purchasers review and

Sellers with the Purchasers comments no later than 15 Business Days (or such
shorter period as the circumstances require, but only in the case of a non-
income Tax Return) before the respective due dates of such Seller Returns. The
Sellers shall consider in good faith any revisions to the Seller Returns that
are timely and reasonably requested by the Purchasers, except if any such
revisions would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect
to the Sellers. The Sellers and the Purchasers agree to consult and resolve in
good faith any issue arising as a result of the Purchasers review of such
Seller Returns. No Seller Returns shall be filed without the prior written
consent of the Purchasers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

cause timely preparation and filing) with the appropriate Taxing Authority

dates of such Straddle Period Returns, and the Sellers shall provide the
Purchasers with the Sellers comments no later than 15 Business Days (or such
shorter period as the circumstances require, but only in the case of a non-
income Tax Return) before the respective due dates of such Straddle Period
Returns. The Purchasers shall consider in good faith any revisions to the
Straddle Period Returns that are timely and reasonably requested by the
Sellers, except if any such revisions would reasonably be expected to result
in a material adverse effect to the Purchasers. The Sellers and the Purchasers
agree to consult and resolve in good faith any issue arising as a result of
the Sellers review of such Straddle Period Returns. No Straddle Period
Return shall be filed without the prior written consent of the Sellers, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

(c) _Apportionment_. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any
Straddle Period, the amount of Taxes of the Company allocable to the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Straddle
Period Taxes") shall be deemed to be: (i) in the case of Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis (such as real or personal property Taxes), the amount of such
Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period)
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days in the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant
Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in clause (i)
above (such as franchise Taxes, Taxes that are based upon or related to income
or receipts, based upon occupancy or imposed in connection with any sale or
other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or
intangible)), the amount of any such Pre-Closing Straddle Period Taxes shall
be determined as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business on
the Closing Date.

(d) _Refunds and Elections_.

(i) The Sellers shall be entitled to any Tax refunds actually received,
including interest actually paid by the relevant Taxing Authority therewith,
in respect of Pre-Closing Taxes, less any costs or expenses actually incurred
by Purchasers (including Taxes) in respect of the receipt of such refunds. In
the event that the Company is entitled to receive any such Tax refund
described in the preceding sentence, the Purchasers shall elect, and shall
cause the Company to elect, under applicable provisions of the Peruvian Tax
code, to actually receive a payment of such refund and shall not elect to
receive such Tax refund in the form of a credit against future Taxes. The
Purchasers shall forward to the Seller Beneficiaries or reimburse the Seller
Beneficiaries for any such Pre-Closing Tax refunds received within 30
Business Days of such receipt. Notwithstanding the foregoing three sentences,
any such refunds, shall be for the account of Purchasers to the extent such
refunds are attributable (determined on a marginal basis) to the carryback
from a Post-Closing Tax Period of items of loss, deduction or credit, or other
Tax items, of the Company or any of its Affiliates, including Purchasers. The
Purchasers shall be entitled to any Tax refunds of the Company attributable
to any Post-Closing Tax Period. Any refunds actually received with respect to
a Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the Sellers and the Purchasers
pursuant to the principles of Section 7.13(c).

powers of attorney reasonably necessary in connection with Taxes of
the Company, (B) giving the other Party timely notice (to the extent required
hereunder) and responding to any inquiries, audits or similar proceedings by
any Taxing Authority relating to Taxes of the Company (each of the items
referred to in clause (B) of this _Section 7.13(e)(i)_, a "Tax Matter"), and
(C) resolving all disputes and audits with Taxing Authorities relating to
Taxes of the Company, including any dispute or audit of the Sellers and the
Sellers Parents Tax Returns with respect to the Company by any Taxing
Authority. The failure to give timely notice of a Tax Matter shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations hereunder except
to the extent such failure has materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.
The Party requesting cooperation under this _Section 7.13(e)(i)_ shall bear
all costs and expenses attributable to such cooperation.

 

(ii) The Sellers or the Sellers Parent shall have the responsibility for, and
the right to control, at the Sellers or the Sellers Parents sole expense,
any Tax Matter relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period; _provided_ that the
Purchasers and counsel of their own choosing, shall have the right to
participate fully, at their own expense, in all aspects of the prosecution or
defense of such Tax Matter if the Purchasers reasonably determine that such
Tax Matter could have a material adverse impact on the Tax attributes of the
Company created or generated in any Post-Closing Tax Period. The Sellers and
the Purchasers shall jointly control and participate in all proceedings taken
in connection with any Tax Matter relating to Taxes of the Company for a
Straddle Period, and shall bear their own respective costs and expenses. The
Purchasers shall control all proceedings with respect to any Tax Matter
relating to a Post-Closing Tax Period; _provided_ that the Sellers or the
Sellers Parent shall have the right to participate fully, at their
own expense, in the settlement of such a Tax Matter if and to the extent that
such matter is reasonably likely to give rise to a claim for indemnification
under this Agreement or could affect the Tax attributes of the Company for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period. For the avoidance of doubt, (1) the Purchasers shall
be entitled to be timely informed in writing by the Sellers of any Tax Matter
relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (it being understood that such writing
shall set forth in reasonable detail the amount and the nature of such matter
as it pertains solely to the Company as well as the core assertions of the
Taxing Authority underlying such matter as they pertain solely to the Company)
and the developments with respect to such matter at any administrative
meeting, conference, hearing or other proceeding as they pertain solely to the
Company;

 



45  and (2) the Sellers shall be entitled to be timely informed in writing by
the Purchasers of any Tax Matter relating to a Post-Closing Tax Period to the
extent such matter may give rise to a claim for indemnification under this
Agreement (it being understood that such writing shall set forth in reasonable
detail the amount and the nature of such matter as it pertains solely to the
Company as well as the core assertions of the Taxing Authority underlying
such matter as they pertain solely to the Company) and the developments with
respect to such matter at any administrative meeting, conference, hearing or
other proceeding as they pertain solely to the Company. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this _Section 7.13(e)(ii)_ shall in any way restrict the

with any Taxing Authority and (B) give the other Party reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books,
records and documents, and, if the other Party so requests, the Purchasers,
the Company, or the Sellers or the Sellers Parent, as the case may be, shall
allow the other Party to take possession of such books, records and documents
at the sole expense of the requesting party. The Purchasers, and the Sellers
and the Sellers Parent shall, upon request of the other Party, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or provide any certificate or other
document from any Taxing Authority or any other Person, at the sole expense
of the requesting Party, as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate
any Tax that could be imposed in connection with the transitions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

(iv) The Purchasers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
promptly to the Sellers, at the Sellers sole cost and expense, the
information reasonably requested by the Sellers that is necessary for the
Sellerss Parent to determine its pro-rata share of the Companys Subpart F
income under Section 951(a)(2) of the Code for any taxable year of the
Company for which the Sellers Parent has a U.S. federal income tax reporting
obligation.

(f)  _Amendments_. Unless required by applicable Law, none of the Purchasers,
the Company or any of the respective Affiliates of the foregoing shall amend
or otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election of the Company in respect
of a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period without the prior written
consent of the Sellers or the Sellers Parent, which consent may not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed.

Sellers or the Sellers Parent shall not have any indemnification obligation
to the Purchasers under this Agreement for any Taxes or Losses resulting
directly from a Purchaser Tax Act.

registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges
and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with the consummation of the

 



46  transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid one-half by the
Purchasers and one-half by the Sellers. The Sellers shall prepare and timely
file all Tax Returns required to be filed in respect of Transfer Taxes
(including, without limitation, all notices required to be given with respect
to bulk sales taxes); _provided_ that the Purchasers shall timely prepare any
such Tax Returns that are the primary responsibility of the Purchasers under
applicable Law. The Purchasers preparation of any such Tax Returns shall be
subject to the Sellers approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

 

7.14 Notice of Certain Events. From the date hereof until the Closing, each
Party shall promptly notify the other Parties of (i) any fact, circumstance,
event or action the existence, occurrence or taking of which has resulted in,
or would reasonably be expected to result in, the failure of any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ or  _Section 8.2_ as applicable to be
satisfied; (ii) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv) any Legal Proceedings
commenced relating to or involving or otherwise materially affecting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Receipt of

such Party in this Agreement. No party shall be required to take any action
that would jeopardize its attorney-client privilege.

customers that allow such customers who purchase services from an Affiliate
of any Seller, which Affiliate must be located outside of Peru, to obtain such

to any such employees. Nothing in this _Section 7.15(b)_ shall prevent any of
the Sellers, the Sellers Parent or any of their respective Affiliates from
hiring any employee whose employment with the Company has terminated or apply
with respect to any of the seconded headquarters employees set forth on
_Schedule 7.15(b)_.

(c) If any Seller or the Sellers Parent breaches, or threatens to commit a
breach of, any of the provisions of this _Section 7.15,_ the Purchasers and
the Company shall have in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights
and remedies available to the Purchasers or the Company the right and remedy
to specific enforcement, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach
or threatened breach may cause irreparable injury to each of the Purchasers
and the Company and that money damages may not provide an adequate remedy to
the Purchasers or the Company.

(d) The Sellers and the Sellers Parent acknowledge that the restrictions
contained in this _Section 7.15_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the
legitimate interests of the Purchasers and constitute a material inducement
to the Purchasers to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If any covenant contained in this _Section
7.15_ should ever be adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or
service, or other limitations permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction,
then any court is expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such
covenant shall be deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time,
geographic, product or service, or other limitations permitted by applicable
Law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as
written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants
or provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or
provision in any other jurisdiction.

 

7.16 Release. Effective as of the Closing, each Seller and the Sellers Parent
hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any claims that each such
Seller and/or the Sellers Parent, solely in its capacity as a shareholder of
the Company, has or may have in the future against the Company and releases,
on its own behalf and on behalf of its successors and assigns, the Company
and its directors and officers, from any and all Legal Proceedings with
respect thereto arising out of, based upon or resulting from any Contract,
transaction, event, circumstance, action, failure to act, or occurrence of any
sort or type, whether known or unknown, and which occurred, existed, was
taken or permitted prior to the Closing, in each case except (i) to the extent
in the nature of or related to any exculpatory, indemnification, contribution,
or similar provisions and (ii) with respect to this Agreement, or any of the
agreements contemplated hereby, and all covenants, agreements and arrangements
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



48 7.17 Capital and Other Expenditures. From January 1, 2013 until the
day immediately prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers and the Sellers
Parent shall cause the Company to make the following expenditures, in each
case, in the Ordinary Course of Business (i) capital expenditures in a
cumulative amount that are not less than 90% of the Capital Expenditure
Amount and (ii) expenditures for marketing and related sales expenses and
customer care activities in a cumulative amount that are not less than 80% of
the Marketing Amount.

 

7.18 Intercompany Accounts. All intercompany payables and loans between the
Company, on the one hand, and any of the Sellers, the Sellers Parent or
their Affiliates, on the other hand, which exist and are reflected in the
accounting records of the relevant parties may be settled at any time on or
prior to the Closing by means of a capital contribution in exchange
for ordinary shares of the Company (shares so issued, "Additional Shares").
Except for the Contracts set forth on _Schedule 7.18_ , which shall remain in
full force and effect after the Closing Date in accordance with
their respective terms (the "Surviving Affiliate Agreements"), the Sellers
and the Sellers Parent shall cause all Related Party Transactions to be
terminated at or prior to the Closing without any Liability to the
Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all
intercompany receivables and intercompany payables (including those under the
Surviving Affiliate Agreements) between the Company, on the one hand, and
Sellers Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall be cancelled
immediately prior to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
_Section 7.18_ shall affect any obligations with respect to the Surviving
Affiliate Agreements following the Closing.

7.19 OSIPTEL Certification Process.

(a) Following the date of this Agreement, the Sellers and the Sellers Parent,
shall, and shall cause the Company to, cooperate and use commercially
reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate to
complete the Company Certification as soon as reasonably practicable. Promptly
after the date hereof, each of the Purchasers and the Company shall establish
a technical committee, consisting of no less than two representatives
designated by each of the Purchasers and the Company (the "Technical
Committee"). During the period from the date of this Agreement until the
Company Certification Date, the Technical Committee will (i) reasonably
confer on a regular basis regarding the status of the Company Certification
and (ii) reasonably communicate and consult with its members with respect to
(x) the manner in which the Company Certification is being conducted, in each
case to the extent consistent with applicable Laws, including Laws regarding
the exchange of information and other Laws regarding competition. The Company
shall coordinate, manage and control the Company Certification
in consultation with the Technical Committee.

(b) After the Company determines in its reasonable discretion that it
has satisfied the requirements for the OSIPTEL Certification, the Sellers and
the Sellers Parent shall cause the Company (as soon as reasonably practicably
following such determination by the Company) to submit a filing with OSIPTEL
(the "OSIPTEL Filing") (i) certifying that it is in compliance with its
obligations under the 1900 MHz Concession Agreement with respect to the
coverage and subscribers requirements established in clause 8.3 of the 1900
MHz Concession Agreement and Annex 3 of the _Resoluci on Directoral No.
108-2012-MTC/27_ issued by the MTC, in each case as of the date of such
filing, and (ii) requesting the OSIPTEL Certification. The OSIPTEL Filing
shall include such information as the Company reasonably determines is

 



49  required by the OSIPTEL, or that is requested by the OSIPTEL, in order for
OSIPTEL to determine whether the Company has met the requirements for OSIPTEL
Certification and to issue the OSIPTEL Certification. To the extent permitted
by applicable Law, the Sellers and Sellers Parents shall provide the other
Parties with copies of all correspondence between the Company and OSIPTEL
relating to the OSIPTEL Filing.

 

(c) If the Purchasers consummate the transactions contemplated hereby without
receipt of the OSIPTEL Certification, then from the Closing until receipt of
the OSIPTEL Certification, the Purchasers will not permit the Company to, move
or redeploy any of the Network Assets or the Companys equipment in any manner
that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
OSIPTEL Certification in any material respect or materially delay receipt of
the OSIPTEL Certification.

(d) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date or earlier
termination of this Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, each of the Sellers and the Sellers Parent
shall, and shall cause the Company to, make or cause to be made all filings
or applications required to obtain the OSIPTEL Certification. Each Party shall
promptly inform the other Parties of any material oral communication with, and
provide copies of any material written communications with, any Peruvian
Governmental Authority regarding any such filings or applications.

(e) The Sellers and the Sellers Parent shall provide to the Purchasers
copies of any documents or other written materials to be filed or otherwise
submitted to any Peruvian Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall consider
all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the Purchasers in
connection therewith, prior to filing or submitting such documents or
materials.

(f) Each of the Purchasers, the Sellers and the Sellers Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to
obtain the OSIPTEL Certification as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the execution of this Agreement. The Purchasers will not, and will cause their
Affiliates and representatives not to, (i) make any inquiries relating to the
status of the pending OSIPTEL Certification or (ii) interfere with the
Companys application for the OSIPTEL Certification in any way that adversely
affects the ability of the Company to obtain the OSIPTEL Certification.

 

7.20 No-Shop. Prior to the Seller Termination Date, the Sellers and Sellers
Parent shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of their Affiliates
(including the Company) or any of their representatives to, directly or
indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate or continue inquiries
regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person concerning a
possible Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreements or other
instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an Acquisition Proposal.
The Sellers and Sellers Parent shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated, and shall cause their Affiliates (including the Company) and all
of their representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore
with respect to, or that could lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. For purposes
hereof, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any Person (other than Entel or any of its Affiliates) concerning (i) a

 



50  merger, consolidation, liquidation, recapitalization, share exchange or
other business combination transaction involving the Company; (ii) the
issuance or acquisition of shares of capital stock or other equity securities
of the Company; or (iii) the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of any
significant portion of the Companys properties or assets.

ARTICLE IX

 

INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 Indemnification by Sellers.

(a) Subject to the limitations of  _Section 9.4_ and _Section 9.6_ and the
procedures of _Section 9.3_, the Sellers and the Sellers Parent hereby
jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold the Purchasers and their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, partners,
attorneys, accountants, agents, employees, heirs, successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Purchaser Beneficiaries") from and against any Losses
incurred or suffered by any of the Purchaser Beneficiaries resulting from or
arising out of:

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the
Sellers or the Sellers Parent contained in this Agreement or any of the other
Seller Documents,

(ii) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement by the
Sellers or the Sellers Parent contained in this Agreement,

 



52 (iii) any Pre-Closing Taxes (whether or not disclosed in the Schedules to this
Agreement);  _provided_ that Sellers shall be liable only to the extent that
such Pre-Closing Taxes were not already taken into account in determining Net
Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to this Agreement) or
otherwise as a Net Purchase Price adjustment hereunder or

(iv) any Remedial Losses.

 

(b) The Purchasers shall take and shall cause their respective Affiliates to
take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware
of any event which gives rise thereto.

9.2 Indemnification by the Purchasers.

 

(a) Subject to the limitations of _Section 9.4_ and the procedures of
_Section 9.3_, the Purchasers hereby jointly and severally agree to
indemnify and hold the Sellers and their respective Affiliates, directors,
officers, stockholders, partners, attorneys, accountants, agents, employees,
heirs, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller Beneficiaries" and,
collectively with the Purchaser Beneficiaries, the "Beneficiaries") from and
against any Losses incurred or suffered by any of the Seller Beneficiaries
resulting from or arising out of:

 

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the
Purchasers contained in this Agreement or any of the other Purchaser
Documents,

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement by the Purchasers contained in
this Agreement and 

(iii) any obligations of the Company following the Closing arising from the
Contracts assumed by the Purchasers pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) The Sellers and the Sellers Parent shall take and cause their respective
Affiliates to take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon
becoming aware of any event which gives rise thereto.

9.3 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) If any claim or demand for which the Sellers, the Sellers Parent or
the Purchasers, as the case may be (an "Indemnifying Party"), may be liable
to any Beneficiary hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected
from any Beneficiary by a third party (a "Third Party Claim"),
such Beneficiary shall promptly, but in no event more than 30 days following
notice to the Beneficiary of the claim or demand, notify the Indemnifying
Party stating in reasonable detail (taking into account the information then
available to the Beneficiary) the basis for the claim or demand and the
amount of the claim or demand (the "Claim Notice"). The failure of the
Beneficiary to give timely notice of a Third Party Claim shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations hereunder except to the
extent such failure has materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. For the
avoidance of doubt, Third Party Claims that relate to Taxes (including Tax
Matters) shall, to the extent addressed by  _Section 7.13_, be governed by
_Section 7.13_ and not this _Section 9.3_.

 



53 (b) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Beneficiary of its election to
defend against such Third Party Claim or demand, the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to defend the Beneficiary by appropriate proceedings and shall
have the sole power to direct and control (subject to _Section 9.3(c)_) such
defense, upon written notice delivered to the Beneficiary within 30 days
after the date of the Claim Notice. The Indemnifying Party shall promptly
inform the Beneficiary upon request of the status of any Third Party Claim. If
any Beneficiary desires to participate in the defense, it may do so at its
sole cost and expense, and the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the
Beneficiary for legal expenses incurred by the Beneficiary. All costs and
expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in defending such Third Party
Claim shall be a liability of, and shall be paid by, the Indemnifying Party.

(c) The Indemnifying Party agrees that it will not settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened Third Party
Claim, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of each such Beneficiary from all Liability arising or that may arise
out of such Third Party Claim and provides solely for monetary relief
satisfied or to be satisfied by the Indemnifying Party and no admission of
wrongdoing or liability. Furthermore, with respect to a Third Party Claim that
relates to Taxes of the Company, the rights of the Indemnifying Party under
_Section 7.13_ and _Section 9.3(b)_ to direct and control the defense of
such claim shall be limited solely to the issues raised in such Third Party
Claim for which an indemnification is claimed.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend the Beneficiary against
such Third Party Claim, then the amount of any such Third Party Claim, or, if
the same be contested by the Beneficiary, that portion thereof as to which
such defense is unsuccessful (including the reasonable costs and expenses
pertaining to such defense) shall be the liability of the Indemnifying Party
and shall constitute Losses hereunder. The Beneficiary shall not settle any
Third Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(e) To the extent the Indemnifying Party shall direct, control or participate
in the defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim, the Beneficiary will
provide the Indemnifying Party and its counsel access to, during normal
business hours, relevant business records and other documents, and shall
permit them to consult with the employees of and counsel to the Beneficiary.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, with respect to a Third Party Claim
that relates to Taxes of the Company, the Indemnifying Party shall have no
right to access any information that relates to the Company that is
not reasonably necessary to the defense of such claim. The Beneficiary shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to defend all such Third Party Claims
that the Indemnifying Party does not elect to defend.

 

(f) If a Beneficiary asserts any claim for indemnification provided for under
this _Article IX_ other than a claim in respect of, arising out of or
involving a Third Party Claim, such Beneficiary shall promptly notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing, and in reasonable detail of the basis for and
the amount of the claim. The failure of the Beneficiary to give timely notice
of a claim shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations hereunder except to the extent such failure has materially
prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

 



54 9.4 Limitations on Indemnification.

 

(a) The Sellers or the Purchasers, as applicable, must provide notice of a
claim for indemnification pursuant to  _Section 9.1(a)_ or _Section 9.2(a)_
prior to the expiration of the survival period provided in this _Section
9.4(a)_. The representations and warranties contained in _Article V_ and
_Article VI_ of this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the date that
is 18 months following the Closing Date, after which time such representations
and warranties shall terminate and have no further force or effect (and
thereafter no claim arising from a breach thereof may be made, except as
otherwise provided herein); except that (i) any claim arising from a breach or
inaccuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 5.1_
(Corporate Existence; Authority),  _Section 5.2_ (Companys Corporate
Existence), _Section 5.4_ (Capitalization), _Section 5.5_ (Ownership of
Shares), _Section 5.6_ (Subsidiaries), _Section 5.17_ (Financial
Advisors),  _Section 5.19_ (Transactions with Related Parties), _Section
6.1_ (Corporate Existence; Authority) or _Section 6.5_ (Financial Advisors)
shall not be subject to the time limit of this sentence and (ii) any
claim arising from a breach or inaccuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 5.10_ (Taxes) and Sellers indemnification
obligation pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(iii)_ shall survive for the full
period of all applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect to any
extension thereof) plus 60 days. The indemnification obligations under
_Section 9.1(a)(ii)_ and under _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_ shall survive for the
full period of the applicable statute of limitations governing the underlying
claim for indemnification (giving effect to any extension thereof) plus 60
days. If any Beneficiary delivers to an Indemnifying Party, before the
expiration of the applicable survival period, notice of an indemnification
claim pursuant to this _Article IX_ , then the applicable representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement will survive with respect to such claim until,
but only for purposes of, the final resolution of the matter specifically
stated in such notice.

(b) The Sellers and the Sellers Parent shall have no liability to
the Purchaser Beneficiaries for any Losses pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(i)_
except to the extent (and then only to the extent) the Losses incurred by the
Purchaser Beneficiaries exceed an aggregate amount equal to $4,000,000
(the "Deductible Amount") and then only for all such Losses in excess
thereof, and no indemnity shall be recoverable by the Purchaser Beneficiaries
for any Losses incurred with respect to any individual item or matter (or
series of related items or matters arising from the same or substantially
similar facts or circumstances) unless the amount of such Losses exceeds
$150,000 (the "Individual Threshold Amount"), and if the Individual Threshold
Amount is not exceeded, then none of such Losses with respect thereto will
count toward satisfying the Deductible Amount; _provided_ that notwithstanding
the foregoing, and solely in the case of Losses arising out of any breach or
inaccuracy of the representation in the first sentence of _Section 5.16(c)_
insofar as it relates to the municipal Permits identified on _Schedule
5.16(c)_ , the Individual Threshold Amount shall not apply to any such Losses
with respect to such municipal Permits and no indemnity shall be recoverable
by the Purchaser Beneficiaries for any such Losses with respect to such
municipal Permits unless the amount of all such Losses (without regard to the
Individual Threshold Amount) exceeds $500,000 in the aggregate. The aggregate
liability of the Sellers and the Sellers Parent under _Section 9.1(a)(i)_
shall in no event exceed $50,000,000. The limitations set forth in the
foregoing two sentences shall not apply to Losses relating to, resulting from
or arising out of any inaccuracy or breach of the Fundamental Representations
or Losses indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(ii)_ or _Section
9.1(a)(iii)_. The Sellers and the Sellers Parents aggregate liability to
the Purchaser Beneficiaries for any Losses

 



55  (i) relating to any breach of the Fundamental Representations, (ii)
indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(ii)_ and (iii) indemnifiable
pursuant to  _Section 9.1(a)(iii)_ shall not exceed an aggregate amount
equal to the Net Purchase Price less any other Losses paid pursuant to
_Section 9.1(a)_.

(c) The Purchasers shall have no liability to the Seller Beneficiaries for any
Losses pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ except to the extent (and then only to
the extent) the Losses incurred by the Seller Beneficiaries exceed the
Deductible Amount and then only for such Losses in excess thereof, and no
indemnity shall be recoverable by the Seller Beneficiaries for any Losses
incurred with respect to any individual item or matter (or series of related
items or matters arising from the same or substantially similar facts or
circumstances) unless the amount of such Losses exceeds the Individual
Threshold Amount, and if the Individual Threshold Amount is not exceeded, then
none of such Losses with respect thereto will count toward satisfying the
Deductible Amount. The aggregate liability of the Purchasers under _Section
9.2(a)(i)_ shall in no event exceed $50,000,000. The limitations set forth in
the foregoing two sentences shall not apply to Losses relating to, resulting
from or arising out of any inaccuracy or breach of the representations or
warranties set forth in _Section 6.1_ (Corporate Existence; Authority) or
_Section 6.5_ (Financial Advisors) or Losses indemnifiable pursuant to
_Section 9.2(a)(ii)_ or _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_. The Purchasers aggregate
liability to the Seller Beneficiaries for any Losses (i) relating to any
breach of the representations or warranties set forth in _Section 6.1_
(Corporate Existence; Authority) or _Section 6.5_ (Financial Advisors), (ii)
indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_ or (iii)
indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ shall not exceed an
aggregate amount equal to the Net Purchase Price less any Losses paid pursuant
to _Section 9.2(a)_.

(d) Any matter disclosed in any Section of the Disclosure Schedule relating to
any representations and warranties shall be deemed to be disclosed for all
other Sections of the Disclosure Schedule relating to any representations and
warranties to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the text of such
disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other Sections of the
Disclosure Schedule.

 

(e) The limitations on damages set forth in this _Section 9.4_ shall not
apply to claims by any party based on fraud, willful misconduct or
intentional misrepresentation.

(f) The amount paid to the Purchaser Beneficiaries pursuant to  _Article IX_
will be reduced by all insurance or other third party indemnification proceeds
actually received by any of the Purchaser Beneficiaries. Each of the
Purchasers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to claim and recover
any Losses suffered by the Purchaser Beneficiaries under available insurance
policies to the extent such Losses are covered by such policies. Each of the
Purchasers shall cause the Purchaser Beneficiaries to remit to NII Telecom any
such insurance proceeds that are paid to the Purchaser Beneficiaries with
respect to Losses for which the Purchaser Beneficiaries have been previously
compensated under _Article IX_.

 

(g) For purposes of determining whether any breach or inaccuracy of a
representation or warranty or Loss has occurred and the amount of any Loss,
the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement will be
considered without regard to any materiality (including "material,"
"materially," "in all material respects" and similar qualifications) or

 



56  Material Adverse Effect qualification set forth therein, except this
sentence does not apply to (i) _Section 5.9(b)_ (Absence of Certain
Developments), (ii) each reference to "material" and "materially" solely to
the extent it is used to define a list of items in the first sentence of
_Section 5.11(b)_ (Leased Property), the first sentence of _Section 5.12(a)_
(Intellectual Property), or clause (xvii) of _Section 5.13(a)_ (Material
Contracts) or (iii) the word "Material" in the term "Material Contract."

(h) No Beneficiary shall be entitled to recover from an Indemnifying Party
more than once in respect of the same Loss.

(i) The representations, warranties and covenants of the Indemnifying Party,
and the Beneficiarys right to indemnification with respect thereto, shall not
be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the Beneficiary (including by any of its representatives) or by
reason of the fact that the Beneficiary or any of its representatives knew or
should have known that any such representation or warranty is, was or might
be inaccurate, or that any such covenant had been or would be breached or by
reason of the Beneficiarys waiver of any condition set forth in _Section
8.1_ or _Section 8.2_, as the case may be.

 

(j) In the event of payment by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party to any
Beneficiary in connection with a Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party
shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Beneficiary as to
any events or circumstances in respect of which such Beneficiary may have any
right, defense or claim relating to such claim or demand against any claimant
or plaintiff asserting such claim or demand; _provided_ that such Beneficiary
shall not be obligated to be a party to, participate in or incur expenses in
connection with any such claim or demand by any Indemnifying Party.

 

9.5 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. The Sellers and the Purchasers agree
to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this  _Article IX_ as an
adjustment to the Net Purchase Price as adjusted under _Section 3.3_ for all
Tax purposes unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

9.6 Exclusive Remedy; Remedial Losses

(a) The sole and exclusive remedy for any breach or inaccuracy, or alleged
breach or inaccuracy, of any representation or warranty in this Agreement or
any, covenant or agreement to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date,
shall be indemnification in accordance with this  _Article IX_ , except that
this _Section 9.6(a)_ shall not prevent any Party from seeking specific
performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, amounts owing to the Purchaser Beneficiaries
under _Section 9.1(a)(iv)_ may be claimed and recovered, as the Purchaser
Beneficiaries may in their sole discretion elect, from (A) the Supplemental
Escrow Funds remaining from time to time in the Supplemental Escrow Account
(if such escrow is established under _Section 3.2(b)(ii)_) without regard to
the Deductible Amount or the Individual Threshold Amount (and any such claims
and recoveries from Supplemental Escrow Funds shall not be deemed to have been
made under _Section 9.1(a)(i)_ or otherwise count against the $50,000,000
limitation applicable to claims 

 



57  under _Section 9.1(a)(i)_) and/or (B) the Indemnification Escrow Funds
remaining from time to time in the Indemnity Escrow Account. The Parties agree
that the aggregate amount of recovery of Remedial Losses under _Section
9.1(a)(iv)_ shall be the funds remaining from time to time in the Supplemental
Escrow Amount (if such escrow is established under _Section 3.2(b)(ii)_) and,
subject to the limitations of  _Section 9.4(b)_, any Remedial Losses payable
pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(i)_).

the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, all costs and expenses
(including any brokerage commissions or any finders or investment bankers
fees and including attorneys and accountants fees) incurred by a Party in
connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other
agreement, document and instrument contemplated hereby and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid by the Party
incurring the expense, and for the avoidance of doubt, any Company Transaction
Expenses shall be paid by the Sellers and the Sellers Parent.

10.2 Arbitration Agreement.

 

(a) Any and all controversies, disputes, or claims arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement (including the existence, validity,
interpretation or breach of this Agreement and any claim based on obligations
imposed by contract, tort, statute, or other Law) shall be resolved and
finally settled through binding arbitration before a single arbitrator under
the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC
Rules"). The Emergency Arbitrator Provisions of the ICC Rules shall not apply.

(b) The arbitrator shall be appointed by the International Court of
Arbitration pursuant to the ICC Rules. It is the mutual intention and desire
of the Parties that the arbitrator be appointed as expeditiously as possible
following the submission of the dispute to arbitration.

(c) The place of the arbitration shall be New York, New York, United States
of America. The language of the arbitration shall be English.

(d) Each Party shall bear its own attorneys and experts fees incurred in
connection with arbitration. The arbitrator shall have the discretion to
determine which Party or Parties shall pay the fees and expenses of the
arbitrator and the International Chamber of Commerce.

(e) It is the intent of the Parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances,
the arbitrator will render its final award within 120 days from the date on
which the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time only if
all the parties to the arbitration agree or if the interests of justice
require. The arbitrator shall establish such procedural measures, set
procedural timetables, establish methods for establishing the facts of the
case, and conduct hearings consistent with the Parties intent. Failure to
adhere to the 120 day time limit, however, shall not constitute a basis
for challenging the award.

 



58 (f) Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, the Parties agree
that any disclosure required as part of the arbitration shall be limited to
information or documents directly relevant to the controversy or claim in
arbitration. In resolving any disagreements regarding disclosure requested as
part of the arbitration, the arbitrator may, in its discretion, refer to the
International Bar Association Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International
Arbitration. Any disagreement regarding disclosure, including the relevance or
scope of requests for disclosure, shall be determined by the arbitrator,
which determination shall be conclusive.

(g) The award shall be in writing, shall be signed by the arbitrator, and
shall include a statement setting forth the reasons for the award. The
decision of the arbitrator in any such proceeding will be final and binding
and not subject to judicial review. Final judgment may be entered upon such
an award in any court of competent jurisdiction, but entry of such judgment
will not be required to make the award effective.

 

10.3 Submission to Jurisdiction. The Parties agree that any action against any
Party in support of an arbitration, ancillary to an arbitration, or otherwise
related to an arbitration commenced or to be commenced pursuant to _Section
10.2_, including any actions for provisional, interim, or conservatory
measures or actions to enforce an arbitration award or any judgment entered
by any court in respect of any such action may be brought in any federal or
state court of competent jurisdiction located within the State of New York,
and the Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction
of any federal or state court located within the State of New York over any
such action. The Parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any objection which they may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such action brought in such court or any
defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such action. Each of the
Parties agrees that a judgment in any such action may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

10.4 Consent to Service of Process. Each of the Parties hereby consents to
process being served by any Party in any suit, action or proceeding,
including any proceeding initiated to confirm or enforce an arbitration award,
by delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of _Section
10.8_.

 

10.5 Waiver of Jury Trial. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT
CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT
ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF
ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER, RELATED TO, BASED ON OR
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, WHETHER NOW
EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT OR CONTRACT OR
OTHERWISE. ANY PARTY MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS
_SECTION 10.5_ WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH
SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 



59 10.6 Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers.

 

(a) This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement),
the Confidentiality Agreement and any other written instrument executed by
each of the Parties and expressly referencing this Agreement represent the
entire understanding and agreement between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement.

 

(b) This Agreement can be amended, supplemented or changed, and any provision
of this Agreement can be waived, only by written instrument making specific
reference to this Agreement signed by the Party against whom enforcement of
any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is sought.

(c) No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by
or on behalf of any Party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party
taking such action of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained herein. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any
provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or
continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent
breach. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or
remedy by such Party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

10.7 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made
and performed in such State.

10.9 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

10.10 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this

 



61  Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary
rights in any person or entity not a party to this Agreement except as stated
in _Article IX_. No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or
obligations hereunder may be made by any Party, directly or indirectly (by
operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other
Parties, and any attempted assignment without the required consents shall be
void; _provided_ that any Purchaser may assign all of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates so long as Entel
continues to control such Affiliates until the Closing. No assignment
shall relieve the assigning Party of any obligation. Upon any permitted
assignment, the references in this Agreement to the assigning Party shall also
apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.

 

10.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement.

 

10.12 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that, if any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy
at Law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and that the
parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in
addition to any other remedy at Law or in equity.

10.13 Further Assurances.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, each of the Parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to execute, deliver or furnish or cause to be
executed, delivered or furnished, such additional documents and other papers
and to take or cause to be taken such further actions as may reasonably be
necessary, proper or advisable to make effective the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(b) With respect to the Transferred Contracts, the Sellers and the Sellers
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) provide to the
Company the benefits of the applicable Contract, (ii) cooperate in any
reasonable and lawful arrangement designed to provide such benefits to the
Company and (iii) enforce at the request of the Company and for the account
of the Company any rights of the Sellers or the Sellers Parent arising from
any such Contract as necessary to give the Company the benefits of such
Contract.

 

10.14 Non-Recourse. No past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
representative of any of the Parties shall have any liability for any
obligations or liabilities for any such Party, as the case may be, under this
Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of,
the transactions contemplated hereby.
