Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").



W I T N E S S E T H:



WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
each determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of
their respective stockholders, and consistent with and in furtherance of
their respective business strategies and goals, for Parent to acquire all of
the outstanding shares of the Company through the merger of Merger Sub with
and into the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with the applicable

terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;



WHEREAS, in furtherance of such combination, the Boards of Directors of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have each adopted this Agreement providing
for the Merger;



WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock, par
value $.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in Section
1.3), other than shares owned or held directly or indirectly by Parent, Merger
Sub or their respective Subsidiaries or the Company or its Subsidiaries and
other than Appraisal Shares (as defined in Section 1.8(f)), will be converted
into the right to receive $25.00, as may be adjusted pursuant to Section
1.8(a) (the "Merger Consideration");



WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and also to prescribe various
conditions to the transactions contemplated hereby; and



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as
follows: ARTICLE I



 

THE MERGER



1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). 



1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at
10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by their
terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date) set forth in Article VI
(the "Closing Date"), unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by
the parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Simpson
Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017,
unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.



1.3 _Effective Time_. As part of the Closing, the parties hereto shall (A)
file a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as is
required by and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
DGCL and (B) make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is
duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such subsequent time as
Parent and the Company shall agree and be specified in the Certificate of
Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective
Time").



1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger will
have the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall
be vested in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties
of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties
of the Surviving Corporation. __



1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation_. The Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company as in effect at the Effective Time shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein and under applicable law. 



1.6 _By-Laws_. The Amended and Restated By-laws of the Company as in effect
at the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein and under applicable law. __



1.7 _Officers and Directors of Surviving Corporation_. The officers of the
Company as of the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or otherwise
ceasing to be an officer or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified. The directors of Merger Sub as of the Effective Time shall be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their



 

2  resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be a director or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent and Merger Sub
the valid resignation, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, of each director of the Company specified by Parent in writing.



1.8 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities: __



(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Except as otherwise provided herein,
each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled pursuant to Section 1.8(c)
and any Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in cash, payable to the holder thereof, without interest,
in the manner provided in Section 2.2; provided that, for all purposes of the
Agreement, including the conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Section 1.8(a), in the event the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or
prior to the later of (i) March 1, 2004 and (ii) the date that is thirty days
after the delivery to the Parent of unaudited condensed consolidated balance
sheet, statement of income, retained earnings and cash flows, in each case of
the Company as of and for the period ending December 28, 2003, as applicable,
prepared in accordance with GAAP (as defined in Section 3.1(f)(i)) and
reviewed by the Companys independent auditors, together with a schedule
reviewed by the Companys independent auditors showing net positive
adjustments to EBITDA (as defined in the Commitment Letters) of the Company
and its Subsidiaries aggregating not less than $3.3 million calculated in
accordance with clauses (1) through (5) of paragraph (G) of Exhibit A to
the Commitment Letters, (the "Target Date") the Merger Consideration shall be
increased for each calendar day thereafter, up to and including the day which
is one day prior to the Closing Date, by an amount equal to $0.01 per
share, except to the extent that any delay in the Effective Time beyond the
Target Date was caused by a material breach of this Agreement by the Company
or by exercise of the Companys cure rights under Section 7.1(g); provided
further that if the satisfaction of paragraph (G) of Exhibit A to the
Commitment Letters shall have been waived by the Lead Arrangers (as defined in
the Commitment Letters) and the condition set forth in Section 6.2(c)(iv)
shall have been satisfied, the Merger Consideration shall be increased
pursuant to the immediately preceding proviso without regard to the
satisfaction of the EBITDA requirements described therein.



 

(b) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. As of the Effective Time, all
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled as provided in Section
1.8(c) and any Appraisal Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares of Company Common Stock (a "Certificate") shall, to the extent
such Certificate represents such shares, cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender
of such Certificate in accordance with Article II.



(c) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each share
of Company Common Stock owned or held, directly or indirectly, by the Company
or its Subsidiaries or



 

3  Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries, in each case
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be canceled and retired without
any conversion thereof and no payment of cash or any other distribution shall
be made with respect thereto.



(d) _Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, be converted into one
share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.



(e) _Treatment of Outstanding Company Stock Options and Unissued Company
Common Stock and Warrants_.



(i) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised Company Stock
Option (as defined in Section 3.1(c)) shall be canceled, and, in consideration
for the cancellation of the vested portion, if any, of any such Company Stock
Option, the holder of such Company Stock Option shall be entitled to receive,
and the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall be required
to pay, at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no
event later than 10 days after the Effective Time) an amount in cash equal
to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
subject to the vested portion of such Company Stock Option and (y) the excess,
if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
previously subject to such Company Stock Option, less any required
withholding taxes.



(ii) As of the Effective Time, all rights of any holder of an Allowed
Unsecured Claim (Class 4) or an Allowed Tort Claim (Class 5) (each as defined
in the Plan) to receive Company Common Stock and Warrants under the Plan
shall be canceled, and any holder of any such rights (an "Unissued
Equityholder") shall be entitled to receive from the Exchange Agent (as
defined in Section 2.1(i)) at the time such holder would have been entitled to
receive any Class 4 Distribution or Class 5 Distribution (each as defined in
the Plan), as the case may be, in consideration for such cancellation an
amount in cash equal to: (A) in the case of any Unissued Equityholder who held
a right to receive Company Common Stock, the Merger Consideration in respect
of each share of Company Common Stock previously eligible to be received
pursuant to such rights and (B) in the case of any Unissued Equityholder who
held a right to receive Warrants, the product of (x) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock which would have been issuable upon the exercise of such
Unissued Equityholders Warrants had such Warrants been issued prior to the
Effective Time and (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per share of such Unissued Equityholders Warrants had such
Warrants been issued prior to the Effective Time.



(f) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (the "Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 1.8, but instead
such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of



 

4  Section 262. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw
or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and each
such Appraisal Share shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective
Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Section 1.8. The Company shall serve prompt
notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common
Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.



1.9 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties
or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger. __



ARTICLE II



EXCHANGE AND PAYMENT



2.1 _Exchange Agent; Payment Funds_. (i) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint a bank or trust company as may be approved by the Company (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) as exchange and paying agent
(the "Exchange Agent") for the exchange and payment of the Merger
Consideration and payment and distribution of the Unissued Equityholders Fund
(as defined below). __



(ii) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, an amount in cash sufficient to make all payments pursuant to
Section 2.2. Any cash deposited with the Exchange Agent in trust for the
benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall hereinafter be
referred to as the "Exchange Fund."



(iii) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of Unissued Equityholders, an amount
in cash sufficient to make all payments pursuant to Section 2.9. Any cash
deposited with the Exchange Agent in trust for the benefit of Unissued
Equityholders shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Unissued Equityholders
Fund." 



 

5 2.2 _Exchange Procedures_. (i) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of a Certificate
immediately prior to the Effective Time (A) a letter of transmittal which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree and (B)
instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for
the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange
Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate and such Certificate shall then be canceled. No interest will be
paid or will accrue for the benefit of holders of the Certificates on the
Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration may be made with respect to such Company Common Stock to such a
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such shares of Company
Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. __



(ii) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent also shall mail a
letter of transmittal to each record holder of uncertificated shares held
in book-entry form, as evidenced on the records of the Companys transfer
agent, Mellon Investor Services LLC (the "Transfer Agent"), as of the

material in amount. All of such Company SEC Reports, as of their respective
dates (and as of the date of any amendment to the respective Company SEC
Report), complied as to form in all material respects with the

rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act") and the
Exchange Act. No Subsidiary of the Company is required to file any form,
report or other document with the SEC.

Company under this Agreement to be breached, that renders or will render
untrue any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this
Agreement or that would cause any condition contained in this Agreement not to
be satisfied. Parent and Merger Sub will each use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cure before the Closing, any event, transaction or circumstance, as
soon as practicable after it becomes known to Parent or Merger Sub, that
causes or will cause any covenant or agreement of Parent and/or Merger Sub,
as the case may be, under this Agreement to be breached, that renders or will

in discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any non-public information
relating to the Company or its



 

30  Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books or records of the
Company or its Subsidiaries to, any Person (other than Parent or
its representatives) concerning an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any
letter of intent or agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal other than a
confidentiality agreement, or (iv) withhold, withdraw, modify or change in a
manner adverse to Parent, or fail to make, its recommendations in favor of
the transactions contemplated hereby or approve, endorse or recommend such
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that, in each case, if and to the extent that
the Board of Directors of the Company concludes, prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting, in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to
lead to the delivery of a, Superior Proposal and that the failure to engage
in such discussions or negotiations, provide such information or access, enter
into any letter of intent or agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal, so
withhold, withdraw, modify, change or fail to make its recommendations in
favor of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and/or so approve,
endorse or recommend such Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the
Company under applicable law, then the Company may, pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality provisions no more
favorable to the proponent of the Acquisition Proposal than those in the
Confidentiality Agreement, participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding such Acquisition Proposal, provide non-public information with

applicable. In each case, the Company agrees that it will notify Parent
promptly (but no later than 24 hours) if, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
Acquisition Proposal is received by, any information is requested from, or
any discussions or negotiations relating to an Acquisition Proposal are sought
to be initiated or continued with the Company, its Subsidiaries, or their
officers, directors, employees, advisors, representatives or agents. Upon its
receipt thereof, except to the extent prohibited by nondisclosure agreements
in effect as of the date hereof and identified to Parent, the Company shall
promptly provide Parent with a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal
received and a written statement with respect to any non-written Acquisition
Proposal received, which statement shall include the identity of the parties
making the Acquisition Proposal and the terms thereof, and shall
promptly advise Parent of any material modification or proposed modification
thereto, and shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status and
terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of any such discussions
or negotiations. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the
Company or the Board of Directors of the Company from taking and disclosing to
the Companys stockholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange
offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure required by applicable law.



(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its officers, directors, employees,
advisors, representatives and agents to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any third party
(other than Parent) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, except that the Company may request any such parties in possession
of confidential information about the Company that was furnished by or on
behalf of the Company in connection with any Acquisition Proposal to return or
destroy all such information in the possession of any such Person or in the
possession of any representative of any such Person.

Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 5.7,
upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,

where applicable who are currently covered by the Companys directors and
officers liability insurance policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts and containing terms and conditions that are substantially as
advantageous to those persons currently insured under such policies;
_provided_ , however, that in no event will the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend in the aggregate in excess of 250% of the annual premium
paid or payable for the current in force directors and officers liability
insurance policies for such coverage (or such comparable coverage as is
available for such 250% of such annual premium). The Company further

disposition of such claim, action, proceeding or investigation.



(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors or
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall

Effective Time, is intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Indemnified Parties and the Covered Persons, shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and shall be
enforceable by the Indemnified Parties and the Covered Persons.

efforts to develop a joint communications plan and each party shall use all
reasonable efforts (A) to ensure that all press releases (or portions thereof)
and other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be consistent with such joint communications plan, and (B)

such extension or waiver shall be valid



 

39  only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of a party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights, and no single or partial exercise of
any right, remedy, power or privilege shall preclude any other or further
exercise thereof by any party. The waiver by any party of any breach of this
Agreement, or the failure of any party to require the performance or
satisfaction of any term or obligation of this Agreement, shall not prevent
subsequent enforcement of such term or obligation or be deemed a waiver of any
subsequent breach. __

Disclosure Schedule with respect to one Section shall be considered to be
made with respect to other Sections of this Agreement where it is readily

provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is found to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, (A)
a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to
carry out, so far as may be valid or enforceable, such provision and (B) the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other
