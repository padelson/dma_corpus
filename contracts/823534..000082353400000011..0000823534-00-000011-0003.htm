<LI>if the Acquisition Agreement is terminated in circumstances in which no Break Fee is payable pursuant to Section 6.4 of the Acquisition Agreement.</LI></OL>

<LI>Repap shall notify UPM promptly in writing of the occurrence of any Exercise Event, it being understood that the giving of such notice by Repap shall not be a condition to the right of UPM to exercise the Option.</LI>
<LI>In the event UPM wishes to exercise the Option, UPM shall send a written notice (an "<B>Exercise Notice</B>") to Repap specifying the total number of Option Shares that UPM wishes to purchase, the denominations of the certificate or certificates
evidencing such Option Shares which UPM wishes to receive, the date (subject to the earlier of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 1.3 hereof) on which the Option Shares are to be issued (the "<B>Closing Date</B>") which shall be a Business Day not later than the fifth Business Day and not earlier than the second Business Day after delivery of such notice, and the place for the closing (the "<B>Closing</B>") of such purchase; <I>provided</I>,
that if the closing of such purchase cannot be consummated by reason of any applicable judgment, injunction, decree, order, law or regulation, the period of time that would otherwise run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which
such restriction on consummation has expired or been terminated; and <I>provided</I>, further, that if prior notification to, approval of or filing with any Governmental Entity is required in connection with such purchase, UPM and Repap shall promptly file the required notice or application for approval and responses
thereto, and shall expeditiously process the same and the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the last date on which any required notification periods have expired or been terminated and such approvals
have been obtained and any requisite waiting period or periods shall have passed. </LI></OL>

</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<OL>
<OL>
<OL>

<LI>The Option Shares shall have been approved for listing on The Toronto Stock Exchange (<B>"TSE"</B>), provided however, that Repap and UPM agree that Repap shall not be obligated to qualify the Option Shares for resale in the United States or Canada
other than on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 3.2 hereof; and</LI>
<LI>No preliminary or permanent injunction or other order by any court of competent jurisdiction prohibiting such issuance of Option Shares shall be in effect (provided that Repap has used its reasonable best efforts to resist or overturn same).</LI></OL>
</OL>
</OL>

<B><P>Section 1.4 Closing.</P>
<OL>
<OL>
<OL>

</B><LI>In the event of a Closing pursuant to Section 1.2(5), Repap shall deliver to UPM a certificate or certificates evidencing the applicable number of Option Shares (in the denominations specified therein), and UPM shall purchase each such Option
Share from Repap at the Purchase Price.</LI>
<LI>Payment of the Purchase Price shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds, <I>provided</I> that failure or refusal of Repap to designate such a bank account shall not preclude UPM from exercising the Option by delivery of a certified
cheque or bank draft.</LI>
<LI>Upon the tender of the applicable Purchase Price in immediately available funds, UPM shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Repap Common Shares issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of Repap shall then
be closed or that certificates representing such Repap Common Shares shall not then be actually delivered to UPM. Repap shall pay all expenses, and any and all federal, provincial, state and local taxes and other charges that may be payable in connection
with the preparation, issue and delivery of stock certificates in the name of UPM or its assignee, transferee or designee, excluding for greater certainty, income taxes or other taxes payable by UPM in relation to its capital or profits.</LI></OL>

</B><LI>In the event of any change in Repap Common Shares or in the number of outstanding Repap Common Shares by reason of a stock dividend, split-up, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction or any other extraordinary
change in the corporate or capital structure of Repap (including, without limitation, the declaration or payment of an extraordinary dividend of cash, securities or other property), the type and number of shares or securities to be issued by Repap upon
exercise of the Option and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted appropriately, and proper provision shall be made in the agreements governing such transaction, so that UPM shall receive upon exercise of the Option the number and class of shares and/or
other securities and/or cash and/or property that UPM would have received in respect of Repap Common Shares if the Option had been exercised immediately prior to such event, or the record date therefor, as applicable, and elected, to the fullest extent it
would have been permitted to elect, to receive such securities, cash or other property (as UPM shall determine).</LI>
<LI>In the event that Repap shall enter into an agreement (other than the Acquisition Agreement): (i) to consolidate with, amalgamate or merge into any person, other than UPM or any subsidiary of UPM, and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation of such consolidation, amalgamation or merger; (ii) to permit any person, other than UPM or any subsidiary of UPM, to merge into Repap and Repap shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then
outstanding Repap Common Shares shall be changed into or exchanged for shares or other securities of Repap or any other person or cash or any other property or the then outstanding Repap Common Shares shall after such merger represent less than 50% of the
outstanding shares and share equivalents of the surviving corporation; or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any person, other than UPM or any subsidiary of UPM; then, and in each such case, proper provision
shall be made in the agreements governing such transaction (and the continuing or surviving or transferee corporation shall also enter into an agreement with UPM to provide UPM with such rights) so that UPM shall receive upon exercise of the Option, the
number and class of shares and/or other securities and/or cash and/or property that UPM would have received in respect of Repap Common Shares if the Option had been exercised immediately prior to such transaction, or the record date therefor, as
applicable, and elected, to the fullest extent it would have been permitted to elect, to receive such securities, cash or other property (as UPM shall determine), and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted appropriately.</LI>
<LI>The provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.4 and 3.2, shall apply with appropriate adjustments to any securities for which the Option becomes exercisable pursuant to this Section 1.5.</LI></OL>

</B><LI>As promptly as practicable, Repap shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Option Shares to be approved for listing on the TSE, subject to notice of issuance, and shall provide prompt notice to the TSE of the issuance of each Option Share.</LI>

<LI>Repap shall use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law, regulation or policy (including complying with all applicable
notification, filing, reporting and waiting period requirements under applicable laws and cooperating fully with UPM in preparing any applications or notices and providing such information to any Governmental Entity as it may require) to consummate and

<B><P>Section 3.2 Qualification</P>
<OL>
<OL>
<OL>

</B><LI>In the event that UPM shall desire to sell any of the Option Shares and such sale in the manner proposed by UPM requires, in the opinion of counsel to UPM (which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to Repap and its counsel), qualification of
such Option Shares for resale under applicable securities laws, Repap shall cooperate with UPM and any underwriters in qualifying such Option Shares for resale, including, without limitation, promptly filing a prospectus which complies with the
requirements of applicable Canadian federal, provincial and territorial securities laws and United States federal and state securities laws, as the case may be, and entering into and complying with an underwriting agreement with such underwriters upon
such terms and conditions as are customarily contained in underwriting agreements with respect to secondary distributions; <I>provided, however</I>,<I> </I>that Repap shall not be required to file more than two prospectuses hereunder and shall be entitled to delay the filing of any prospectus for up to 120 days (but not more than once in any 12 month period) if the offering
would, in the judgment of the Board of Directors of Repap, require premature disclosure of any material corporate development or otherwise materially interfere with or materially adversely affect any pending or proposed offering of securities of Repap or
any other material transaction involving Repap.</LI>
<LI>If Option Shares are qualified pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.2, Repap agrees (i) to furnish copies of the prospectus relating to the Option Shares covered thereby in such numbers as UPM may from time to time reasonably request and (ii)
if any event shall occur as a result of which it becomes necessary to amend or supplement any prospectus, to prepare and file under the applicable securities laws such amendments and supplements as may be necessary to keep available for at least 90 days a
prospectus covering the Option Shares meeting the requirements of such securities laws, and to furnish UPM with such numbers of copies of the prospectus, as amended or supplemented, as may reasonably be requested. UPM shall bear the cost of the
registration or qualification, including but not limited to, all registration and filing fees, printing expenses, and fees and disbursements of counsel and accountants for Repap, and UPM shall pay the fees and disbursements of its counsel and the
underwriting fees and commissions applicable to the Option Shares sold by UPM. Repap shall indemnify and hold harmless UPM, its affiliates and their respective officers and directors from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses arising out of or based upon any statements contained in or omissions or alleged omissions from, each prospectus (or any amendment thereto) filed pursuant to this paragraph; <I>provided, however</I>, that this provision shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent it arises out of any untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to
Repap by UPM, its affiliates and its officers and other representatives expressly for use in any prospectus (or any amendment thereto) filed pursuant to this paragraph. Repap shall also indemnify and hold harmless each underwriter and each person who
controls any underwriter against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arising out of or based upon any statements contained in or omissions or alleged omissions from, each prospectus (or any amendment thereto) filed pursuant to
this paragraph; <I>provided, however</I>, that this provision shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent it arises out of any untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to
Repap by the underwriters expressly for use in any prospectus (or any amendment thereto) filed pursuant to this Section 3.2.</LI></OL>

<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P>If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. If for any reason such court or regulatory agency determines that UPM is not permitted to acquire the full number of shares of Repap Common
Shares provided in this Agreement and also does not permit the payment of the Spread in respect to such prohibited shares, it is the express intention of Repap to allow UPM to acquire such lesser number of Repap Common Shares (or receive payment of the
Spread in respect of such lesser number) as may be permissible, without any amendment or modification hereof.</P></DIR>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, UPM may assign this Agreement and any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any wholly-owned subsidiary of UPM without the consent of Repap, provided that UPM remains jointly and severally liable hereunder
with such wholly-owned subsidiary. Subject to the first and second sentence of this section, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall enure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.</P></DIR>
