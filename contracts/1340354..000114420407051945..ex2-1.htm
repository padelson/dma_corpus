**ARTICLE  III**

 

 

**REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF THE  COMPANY**

 

 

Except  as  set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure letter  delivered to the Parent by the Company concurrently with
the entering into  of  this Agreement (the " **Company  Disclosure Letter**
")  or to  the extent that the qualifying nature of such disclosure with
respect to such  section or subsection is reasonably apparent from the
disclosure in any other  section or subsection of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company hereby  represents and warrants to the Parent and
Canadian Sub that:

 

 

3.1 _Organization,  Good Standing and Qualification_.  Each of  the Company
and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly  existing and
in good standing under the Laws (as defined in _Section _ _3.10_ )  of its 
respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate
power  and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and
to carry  on its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do
business and  is in  good standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership,
leasing or operation  of  its assets or properties or conduct of its
business requires such qualification,  except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not be  expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made  available to the Parent
complete and correct copies of the Organizational  Documents of the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries, each as amended as of  the  date of this
Agreement.

 

 

3.2 _Capital  Structure_. 

 

 

(a) The  authorized share capital of the Company consists of (i) an unlimited
number  of common shares of which 9,825,678 shares are outstanding as of the
date hereof  (the " **Company  Common Shares** "),  (ii) 750,000 Class A
Common Shares of which 750,000 shares are  outstanding as of the date hereof
(the " **Company  Class A Common Shares** "),  (iii) an unlimited number of
Class A Preference Shares, none of which  are outstanding as of the date
hereof and (iv) an unlimited number of  Class B Preference Shares, none of
which are outstanding as of the date  hereof (collectively, the " **Company**
**Shares** ").  All  of the Company Shares have been duly authorized and are
validly issued, fully  paid and nonassessable. The Company has no shares
reserved for  issuance.  The  Company is not a reporting issuer (as such
term is defined under the Securities  Act (Ontario)) and there is no
published market for the Company  Shares.

 

 

(b) The  Company has, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement,  delivered to the Parent a true and complete list (the **"
Shareholder  List**")  of the  Shareholders on the date hereof, showing
with respect to each such Shareholder  (i) the number of Company Common
Shares and Company Class A Common Shares owned  beneficially and of record by
such Shareholder, (ii) the number and class of  any  restricted shares held
by such Shareholder that remain subject to repurchase,  redemption or call or
a vesting period following the Closing and a description  of such repurchase,
redemption or call rights or vesting period, and (iii)  an  estimate of the
portion of the Arrangement Consideration to which such  Shareholder would be
entitled in connection with the Arrangement based on  information reasonably
available to the Company and the agreed assumptions  and  allocations set
forth in such schedule. No shareholder or former shareholder  of  the
Company or any other Person is or could be entitled to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  7 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional  payments under the Shareholders Agreement in connection with the
Transactions,  including pursuant to Sections 3.9(d) and 6.6(b) thereof,
other than, in the  case of Shareholders, their portion of the Arrangement
Consideration hereunder. 

 

 

(c) Each  outstanding share of each of the Company's Subsidiaries has been
duly authorized  and validly issued and is fully paid and nonassessable and
owned by the Company  directly or indirectly, free and clear of any lien,
charge, pledge, security  interest, claim or other encumbrance (a " **Lien**
").  There  are no preemptive or other outstanding options, warrants,
agreements,  commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the Company or
any of its  Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of Capital Stock of the
Company or  any  of its Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations
convertible or exchangeable  into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a
right to subscribe for or  acquire, any securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, and no  securities or obligations evidencing such rights
are authorized, issued or  outstanding. The Company does not have outstanding
any bonds, debentures, notes  or other obligations granting the holders
thereof the right to vote (upon a  conversion or otherwise) with the
Shareholders on any matter.

 

 

(d) Section  3.2(d)  of the  Company Disclosure Letter sets forth (x) each
of the Company's Subsidiaries and  the ownership interest of the Company in
each such Subsidiary, as well as the  ownership interest of any other Person
in each such Subsidiary and (y) the  Capital Stock or other direct or
indirect ownership interest beneficially owned  by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in any other Person, except for broker  warrants and trading
positions maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries  in  the ordinary
course of business. The Company does not own, directly or  indirectly, any
voting interest in any other Person.  For the  purpose of this _Section _
_3.2_ _(d)_ ,  "beneficially owned" means the power, directly or indirectly,
of a Person to  direct the vote or disposition of shares of Capital Stock.

 

 

3.3 _Corporate  Authority; Approval and Fairness_.  a)  The  Company has
all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all  corporate
action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its  obligations
under this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement and to consummate  the
Arrangement, subject only to the approval of the Arrangement by the Court

agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with 
its  terms.

directed that the Arrangement Resolution be submitted to the Shareholders 
for their approval.

Company from, any  U.S.,  Canadian, U.K., or other governmental, regulatory

other legislative,  executive or judicial governmental entity (each, a "
**Governmental  Entity** "),  in  connection with the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by  the  Company and the consummation of
the Arrangement and the other transactions  contemplated hereby by the
Company.

 

 

(b) The  execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not,  and  the consummation of the Arrangement and the other transactions
contemplated  hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or
violation of the  Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (B) with  or  without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach
or violation of, a termination  (or right of termination) or default under,

Lien on any of the assets of the Company  or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant
to any agreement, lease, license, contract,  note, mortgage or indenture
(each, a " **Contract** ")  binding upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or, assuming (solely with  respect to performance of this
Agreement and consummation of the Arrangement  and  the other transactions
contemplated hereby) compliance with the matters referred  to in _Section _
_3.4_ _(a)_ ,  under  any requirement of Law applicable to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries  or  (C) any change in the rights or obligations of
any party under any Contract  binding upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except, in the case of  clause (B) or (C) above, for any such
breach, violation, termination, default,  creation, acceleration or change
that would not, individually or in the  aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Section 3.4(b)  of the  Company Disclosure Letter sets forth

or waivers are required prior to  consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

sublease for such property is valid and in good standing in all  material
respects, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in  material
breach of or material default under such lease or sublease, and no  event has
occurred which, with notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute  such a
breach or default by any of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

 

(c) Section  3.11(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth all leases
and subleases  of  the Leased Real Property that require the consent or
approval of the landlord  in  connection with or upon completion of the
Arrangement or the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Each  of  the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
the Parent and  Canadian Sub does not, and the consummation of the

4.6 _Parent  Reports; Financial Statements_.  i)  The  Parent has filed or
furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis all forms,  statements, reports

or furnished since the Audit Date and those filed or furnished subsequent  to

Reports** ").  Each  of the Parent Reports, at the time of its filing or
being furnished complied,  or  if not yet filed or furnished, will comply,

Act and the Exchange Act, and any  rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder applicable to the  Parent

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  19 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reports.  As of their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of
this  Agreement, as of the date of such amendment) the Parent Reports did
not, and  any  Parent Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent
to the date of  this  Agreement will not, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit  to  state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the  statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made,  not misleading. There is no
information of which the Parent or any of its  officers or directors is
currently aware which would require the Parent to  file  an amendment to the
Parent Reports or a current report with the SEC pursuant  to  the Exchange
Act or the Securities Act and any rules and regulations promulgated 
thereunder other than to announce the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement upon the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated  hereby by the board of directors of the Parent.

 

 

(b) The  Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15  or  15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are  reasonably designed to effectively ensure that information
required to be  disclosed by the Parent is recorded and reported on a timely
basis to the  individuals responsible for the preparation of the Parent's
filings with the SEC  and other public disclosure documents. The Parent
maintains internal control  over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable,  under the Exchange Act). Such internal
control over financial reporting is  effective in providing reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of  financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external  purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and  includes policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records  that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions of
the asset of the Parent, (ii) provide reasonable assurance  that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that  receipts and expenditures of the Parent are being made only in
accordance with  authorizations of management and directors of the Parent,
and (iii) provide  reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized  acquisition, use or disposition of the Parent's
assets that could have a  material effect on its financial statements.

 

 

(c) The  financial statements included in the Parent Reports fairly present
the  consolidated financial position and results of operations of the Parent
and  its  consolidated Subsidiaries as of their respective dates and for the
periods  set  forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements,
to normal year-end  recurring audit adjustments that will not be material in
amount or effect),  in  each case in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied during the periods  involved, except as noted therein, and to the
Knowledge of the Parent there  are  no facts or circumstances that would
require that such financial statements  be  withdrawn, restated or otherwise
modified in any material respect under GAAP.  The Parent has not filed any
current report on a confidential basis with the  SEC  which remains
confidential.

 

 

4.7 _Financial  Ability._   The  Parent has the financial means to satisfy
its obligation to pay the Cash Payment  pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement
and this Agreement, and the performance  of  such obligation is not subject
to any requirement for the Parent or any of  its  Affiliates to obtain any
financing, consent or approval or meet any financial  or  other test.

 

 

4.8 _Litigation_.  Other  than as disclosed in the Parent Reports, there are
no material civil, criminal  or administrative actions, suits, claims,
hearings, arbitrations, investigations  or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  20 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 


 

other  proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Parent, threatened
against  the  Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any other facts or
circumstances of which  the Parent has Knowledge that could reasonably be
expected to result in any  material claims again the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries. Other than as  disclosed in the Parent Reports, neither the
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries  is a party to or subject to the
provisions of any judgment, order, writ,  injunction, decree or award of any
Governmental Entity.

9.4 _Monetary  Limits on Indemnification_.  k) No  claim  shall be made by
an Indemnified Party under _Sections  9.2(1)_   and  _9.2(2)_   of this 
Agreement until the aggregate Losses in respect of all matters which could 
be  the subject of indemnification to such Indemnified Party exceeds
$1,500,000  in  which case the indemnification liability shall commence from
the first dollar  of  Losses. The liability of each Shareholder to indemnify
for Losses (including  with respect to any Extended Claims) shall not exceed
in aggregate 25% of the  Arrangement Consideration received by such
Shareholder (with any shares of  Parent Common Stock or Exchangeable Shares
being valued at the volume weighted  average of the daily closing prices for
a share of Parent Common Stock on the  principal securities exchange on which
the Parent Common Stock is traded for  the  ten (10) consecutive trading
days ending on the trading day immediately  preceding the Closing Date). No
claim shall be made by an Indemnified Party  under _Sections  9.2(1)_ and 
_9.2(2)_   of this  Agreement with respect to any matter unless the
aggregate Losses suffered or  incurred by the Indemnified Party with respect
to such matter (taken together  with Losses resulting from the same or
substantially similar set of  circumstances, acts or occurrences) exceeds
$50,000. The limitations set forth  in this Section shall not apply to
indemnification under _Section  9.2(3)_ or  _Section  9.2(4)_ and  any 
Losses (or indemnification thereof) in respect of the foregoing shall not be 
taken into account for purposes of determining whether such limitations have 
been met (such Losses, " **Excluded  Losses** ").

 

 

(b) All  Acquiror Losses for which a Parent Indemnified Party is entitled
to  indemnification hereunder (such event being referred to herein as an "
**Arrangement  Indemnification Event** "),  other  than Excluded Losses and
other than Acquiror Losses in respect of indemnifiable  Claims arising after
the General Termination Date in respect of claims that  survive such date ("
**Extended  Claims** "),  shall  be satisfied solely through the
enforcement by the Parent against the Pledged  Securities of such Shareholder
then pledged to the Parent under the Pledge  Agreement following a final
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction or  a  mutual settlement
agreement entered into between the Parent and the  Shareholders'
Representative, _it  being understood, however_ ,  that  (x) in the event
Excluded Losses shall have been satisfied pursuant to  enforcement by the
Parent against the Pledged Securities of a Shareholder under  such
Shareholder's Pledge Agreement (such Excluded Losses, " **Satisfied  Excluded
Losses** ")  and  an

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  37 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 


 

Arrangement  Indemnification Event subsequently occurs, to the extent there
are no longer  Pledged Securities under such Pledge Agreement available to
satisfy the  applicable Claim, then the Parent Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to enforce  its indemnification rights hereunder directly against
the applicable Shareholder  in respect of the Pro Rata Share of such
Shareholder in an amount not to exceed  the Satisfied Excluded Losses, (y) in
the event that Parent has enforced  its rights under the Pledge Agreement in
respect of any portion of the Pledged  Securities as a result of a claim by
Parent against a Shareholder under the  Equity Agreement, the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall thereafter only be  entitled to satisfy Acquiror
Losses under this Agreement in respect of the  Pledged Securities then
remaining pledged in favor of Parent under the Pledge  Agreement, and, if no
Pledged Securities are then pledged to Parent under the  Pledge Agreement,
such Shareholder\'s liability for Acquiror Losses shall  terminate, other
than with respect to Excluded Losses and other than in the  case  of
Extended Claims and (z) in the event a Shareholder does not enter into a 
Pledge Agreement, the Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to enforce 
its  indemnification rights hereunder directly against the applicable
Shareholder.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, except with respect
to Excluded  Losses, in no event will a Shareholder's obligations to
indemnify for Acquiror  Losses hereunder (including with respect to any
Extended Claims), taken together  with any Liquidated Damages (as defined in
the Equity Agreement) paid by such  Shareholder under the Equity Agreement,
exceed such Shareholder's Initial  Liquidated Damages.

 

 

(c) (i)  To  the extent that there are no more Pledged Securities of a
Shareholder remaining  to satisfy a Claim in respect of Excluded Losses or
Extended Losses for which  the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification against such  Shareholder hereunder or  (ii)  in the case
of a Shareholder that does not execute a Pledge  Agreement,  the  Parent
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to proceed directly against such 
Shareholder with respect to such Claim but shall not be obligated to do so 
before satisfying any such Claim as against any other Shareholder (whether 
through the Pledged Securities or directly).

 

 

9.5 _Exclusivity_.  Except  for claims for specific performance or other
injunctive relief from and after  the Closing or in the case of fraud or
willful breach, recourse under this  _Article _ _IX_   will  serve as the
sole and exclusive remedy for breaches of any covenant,  representation,
warranty or other provisions in this Agreement. The parties  and  the
Shareholders will not have any liability under, or with respect to, this 
Agreement other than for indemnification pursuant to this _Article _ _IX_ , 
except  in  the case of fraud or willful breach.

 

 

9.6 _Procedure  Related to Direct Claim_.

 

 

(a) If  a  claim for Losses is to be made by (i) any Parent Indemnified
Parties, or (ii)  the Shareholder Indemnified Parties (each an "
**Indemnified  Party** "),  the  Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt
written notice (a " **Claim  Notice** ")  to the  Shareholders'
Representative, in the case of a Parent Indemnified Party or the  Parent, in
the case of a Shareholder Indemnified Party (or, in the case of  a 
Shareholder Breach, a Shareholder Claim Notice to the applicable
Shareholder),  in each case on behalf of the parties providing
indemnification pursuant to  this  _Article  IX_   (the "
**Indemnifying  Parties** ")  of the  assertion of any fact, condition,
event, claim, action or proceeding giving  rise  to such Losses in respect
of which indemnity is sought under this _Article _ _IX_   (a " **Claim**
");  _provided_   that the  failure to give such prompt written notice
shall not affect the rights of the  Indemnified Party except to the extent
the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  38 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 


 

Indemnifying  Party is actually prejudiced by such failure. The Claim Notice
or Shareholder  Claim Notice, as applicable, shall specify in reasonable
detail (to the extent  that the information is available after due inquiry)
the factual basis for  the  Claim and the amount of the Claim, if known and
shall include a request for  indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_.

 

 

(b) The  obligations of an Indemnifying Party to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless  an  Indemnified Party will terminate on the General Termination
Date or the Specific  Termination Date, as the case may be; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  such obligations to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
will not terminate  with  respect to any item as to which one or more
Indemnified Parties have, prior  to  the applicable Indemnification
Termination Date, made a claim by delivering  a  Claim Notice or Shareholder
Claim Notice, as applicable, in accordance with  this  Agreement, and such
obligation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless shall  continue until such
time as the claim to which such Claim Notice or Shareholder  Claim Notice, as
applicable, relates has been fully quantified and/or  adjudicated or
otherwise resolved.

 

 

(c) In  the  event that an Indemnifying Party objects to any amount claimed
in connection  with any Claim specified in any Claim Notice (or, in the case
of a Shareholder  Breach, such Shareholder objects to any amount claimed in
connection with any  Claim specified in any Shareholder Claim Notice), the
Indemnifying Party (being  the Parent, Shareholders' Representative or the
Shareholder, as the case may be)  on the one hand and the Parent on the other
hand shall for a period of not  less  than sixty (60) days following
delivery of the Claim Notice or Shareholder  Claim  Notice, as applicable,
seek to resolve the Claim in good faith. In connection  therewith, such
Indemnifying Party shall specify in reasonable detail: (i)  any  amount set
forth in the Claim Notice or the Shareholder Claim Notice, as the  case may
be, to which the Indemnifying Party objects; and (ii) the nature and  basis
for such objection.

 

 

(d) In  the  event a Claim Notice or Shareholder Claim Notice has been
delivered by the  Parent, then Pledged Securities having a Fair Market Value
equal to the Loss  reflected therein, or in the case of a Third Party Claim,
Pledged Securities  having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such
Third Party Claim, shall  remain subject to the pledge under the Pledge
Agreement and shall not be  released from the pledge to either the Parent or
the applicable Shareholder,  except in accordance with either a written
settlement agreement between the  Parent and the Shareholders' Representative
(or, in the case of a Claim  involving a Shareholder Breach, the applicable
Shareholder) or the final  judgment of a court having competent jurisdiction
over such matter, after which  time there shall be deemed to have been a
Payment Event under each Pledge  Agreement with respect to Pledged Securities
having a Fair Market Value equal  to  each such Shareholder's Pro Rata Share
of the amount of Losses indemnifiable  under this Agreement as set forth in
the written settlement agreement or such  judgment, as the case may be;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that in  the case of a Claim relating to a
Shareholder Breach, there shall be deemed  to  have been a Payment Event
under the applicable Shareholder's Pledge Agreement  with respect to Pledged
Securities having a Fair Market Value equal to the  amount of Losses
indemnifiable under this Agreement as set forth in the written  settlement
agreement or such judgment, as the case may be.

 

 

9.7 _Procedures  Related to Third Party Claim_.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  39 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 


 

(a) In  the  event the Parent or the Shareholders\' Representative becomes
aware of a  third-party claim made by any Person against an Indemnified
Party, which claim  the Indemnified Party believes is reasonably likely to
result in an  indemnification claim under this _Article _ _IX_   (a "
**Third  Party Claim** "),  the  Indemnified Party will promptly deliver a
Claim Notice with respect to such  claim to the applicable Indemnifying
Party, and such Indemnifying Party will  be  entitled, at its expense, to
undertake control of the defense thereof by counsel  chosen by it that is
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party;  _provided_   that (x)  if
the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable remedy, 
the Indemnifying Party may undertake control of the defense of such Third
Party  Claim acting with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
(y) in  the  event that the Parent is the Indemnified Party, the Parent
shall have reasonably  concluded that there is a reasonable probability that
the Third Party Claim  may  materially and adversely affect its business,
the Parent may control such  defense and (z) if the Third Party Claim is in
respect of Taxes, the  Shareholders' Representative pays any amount of Tax
required to be paid in order  to dispute such Third Party Claim in respect of
Taxes; and _provided_ _further_   that any  delay on the part of the
Indemnified Party to notify the Indemnifying Party  of  such Third Party
Claim will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability  or obligation
hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has  actually been
prejudiced as a result of such delay. The Indemnified Party may  participate
in (but not control) through its own counsel and at its expense  the 
defense of a Third Party Claim of which the Indemnifying Party has
undertaken  control pursuant to this _Section _ _9.7_ _(a)_. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, the
Indemnifying  Party will be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel
employed by the  Indemnified Party for any period during which the
Indemnifying Party has not  elected to undertake the defense thereof pursuant
to this _Section _ _9.7_ _(a)_.  If the  Indemnifying Party fails or
refuses to undertake control of the defense of  such  Third Party Claim
within thirty (30) days after the Claim Notice has been  delivered to the
Indemnifying Party by the Indemnified Party pursuant to  _Section _ _9.7_
_(a)_ ,  the  Indemnified Party will have the right to undertake the defense
and to compromise  and settle such Third Party Claim with counsel of its own
choosing. 

 

 

(b) If  the  Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, all
the parties  hereto will cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such
Third Party Claim,  _provided_   that,  upon the request of the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party shall enter  into a reasonable confidentiality
agreement related to the information to be  provided by the Indemnified Party
with respect to such Third Party  Claim.

 

 

(c) The  Indemnifying Party will not consent to a settlement of, or the entry
of any  judgment arising from, any such claim or legal proceeding, without
the prior  written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not
be unreasonably  withheld or delayed). The Indemnifying Party shall have no
liability with  respect to any settlement or compromise of a Third Party
Claim effected without  the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party
(which consent will not  be  unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

 

(d) Each  party hereby consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any
court in which  a  Third Party Claim is brought for purposes of any claim
for indemnification  or  reimbursement with respect to such Third Party
Claim or the matters alleged  therein, and agrees that process may be served
on such party with respect to  any  such claim anywhere in the world.

9.8 _Insurance;  Tax Benefits_.  i)  In  calculating the amount of any
Loss, there shall be deducted the amount of  proceeds actually received under
any indemnification arrangement or any  insurance policy paid to any
Indemnified Party, in the case of any Loss claimed  by such Indemnified
Party. The reduction specified in this _Section 9.8_  shall  not be applied
if to do so would excuse any insurer or indemnitor from any  obligation to
cover any Loss.

 

 

(b) The  amount of any payment made pursuant to this _Article _ _IX_   in 
respect of an indemnified Loss shall be reduced to take into account any Tax 
benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates arising 
in  connection with the accrual or payment of an indemnified Loss and shall
be  increased to take into account any Tax detriment actually realized by
such  Indemnified Party or Affiliate arising in connection with the accrual
or receipt  of an indemnity payment. In computing the amount of any Tax
benefit, such  Indemnified Party or its Affiliate shall be deemed to
recognize all other items  of income, gains, loss, deduction or credit before
recognizing any item arising  from the incurrence of payment of the
indemnified Loss. An Indemnified Party  or  its Affiliate shall be deemed to
have "actually realized" a Tax benefit to the  extent that, and at such time
as, the amount of Taxes payable by such  Indemnified Party or its Affiliate
is increased above or reduced below, as  the  case may be, the amount of
Taxes such Indemnified Party or its Affiliate would  be required to pay but
for the receipt of the indemnity payment or incurrence  or  payment of the
indemnified Loss.

connection with  any  claims under this Agreement or in connection with the
