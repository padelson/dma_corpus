may be adjusted in accordance with Section 1.04(b), to Seller (provided, that
if any Purchaser fails to pay its pro rata portion of the Estimated Purchase

be entitled to comment on and request reasonable changes to the Preliminary
Closing Statement, and Seller shall consider in good faith any such comments
and changes Purchasers propose to the Preliminary Closing Statement; provided,
that Seller shall not be required to accept any such comments or changes, and
the Closing shall not be delayed as a result of any unresolved comments or
changes made or requested by Purchasers. If Purchasers shall accept the
Preliminary Closing Statement delivered in accordance with this Section
1.04(a), Purchasers shall not waive their rights to challenge such position
pursuant to Section 1.04(b).

(b) Post-Closing Adjustment.

(i) Final Closing Statement. Within seventy-five (75) days after the Closing
Date, Purchasers shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Seller
a written statement (the "Final Closing Statement") that shall include and set
forth a calculation of the actual (A) Net Working Capital ("Closing Net
Working Capital"), (B) Indebtedness ("Closing Indebtedness"), (C) Cash
("Closing Cash"), and (D) Transaction Expenses ("Closing Transaction
Expenses") (with each of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness,
Closing Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses determined as of immediately
prior to the Closing and, except for Closing Transaction Expenses, without
giving effect to the Transactions). Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness and Closing Cash shall be calculated in accordance with the
Applicable Accounting Principles.

(ii) Examination. After receipt of the Final Closing Statement, Seller will
have thirty (30) days (the "Review Period") to review the Final Closing
Statement. During the Review Period, Seller and its representatives will have
reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the personnel of, and work
papers prepared by, Purchasers and Purchasers' representatives to the extent
that they relate to calculations set forth in the Final Closing Statement
(excluding work papers of Purchasers' accounting firm), and to such historical
financial information relating to the calculations set forth in the Final
Closing Statement as Seller may reasonably request specifically for the
purpose of reviewing the Final



Closing Statement and preparing a Statement of Objections; provided, that such
access will be upon reasonable advance notice from Seller to Purchasers and in
a manner that does not interfere with the normal business operations of
Purchasers in any material respect.

(iii) Objection. On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, Seller may
object in writing to the calculations of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing Transaction Expenses, by delivering
to Purchasers a written statement setting forth Seller's objections in
reasonable detail, indicating the nature and amount of any dispute as to
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing
Transaction Expenses, as set forth in the Final Closing Statement, and the
basis with reasonable support for Seller's disagreement therewith (the
"Statement of Objections"). If Seller fails to deliver the Statement of
Objections prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then the Final
Closing Statement will be deemed to have been accepted by Seller. If Seller
delivers a Statement of Objections on or prior to the last day of the Review
Period, then Seller and Purchasers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
any differences that they may have with respect to the computation of Closing
Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing
Transaction Expenses as specified in the Final Closing Statement within
fifteen (15) days after the receipt by Purchasers of the Statement of
Objections (the "Resolution Period"). Seller shall be deemed to have agreed
with all items and amounts of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing Transaction Expenses not
specifically referenced in the Statement of Objections, and such items and
amounts shall not be subject to review in accordance with Section 1.04(b)(iv).
Any Statement of Objections may reference only disagreements based on
mathematical errors or based on amounts of Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing Transaction Expenses as
reflected on the Final Closing Statement not being calculated in accordance
with this Section 1.04, the definitions of Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing Transaction Expenses and,
with respect to Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing
Cash only, the Applicable Accounting Principles. If such objections are
resolved within the Resolution Period, the Final Closing Statement shall be
updated with such changes as have been agreed to in writing by Seller and
Purchasers, and will be final and binding on the Parties and shall not be
subject to appeal or further review.

(iv) Resolution of Disputes. If Purchasers and Seller fail to reach an
agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the Statement of
Objections before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any items or
amounts of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash
and/or Closing Transaction Expenses remaining in dispute (the "Disputed
Amounts" and any items or amounts not so disputed, the "Undisputed Amounts")
will be submitted for resolution to the Accounting Firm, along with a written
brief from Purchasers, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand,
detailing their views as to the correct nature and amount of each item
remaining in dispute. The



Accounting Firm, acting as an expert and not an arbitrator, will resolve
(based solely on the written briefs submitted to the Accounting Firm by Seller
and Purchasers and the documents and information requested and received by the
Accounting Firm in connection with such written briefs and not by independent
review) the Disputed Amounts only and make any adjustments to the Final
Closing Statement. The Accounting Firm will only decide the specific Disputed
Amounts, and the Accounting Firm's written determination for each Disputed
Amount must be within the range of values assigned to each such item in the
Final Closing Statement and the Statement of Objections, respectively. Seller
and Purchasers shall promptly (A) execute, if requested by the Accounting
Firm, a reasonable engagement letter and (B) provide each such Party's written
brief to the Accounting Firm regarding the Disputed Amounts and all documents
and information reasonably requested by the Accounting Firm related thereto.

(v) Fees of the Accounting Firm. Purchasers shall pay a portion of the fees
and expenses of the Accounting Firm equal to one hundred percent (100%) of
such fees multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of
Disputed Amounts submitted to the Accounting Firm that are resolved in favor
of Seller and the denominator of which is the total amount of Disputed Amounts
submitted to the Accounting Firm. Seller shall pay that portion of the fees
and expenses of the Accounting Firm that Purchasers are not required to pay
pursuant to this Section 1.04(b)(v).

(vi) Determination by Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm must make a
reasoned written determination with respect to each Disputed Amount submitted
to it as soon as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days (or
such other time as Purchasers and Seller agree in writing) after its
engagement. The resolution by the Accounting Firm of the Disputed Amounts and
adjustments to the Final Closing Statement made by the Accounting Firm will be
final, conclusive and binding upon the Parties and shall not be subject to
appeal or further review. The Parties agree that the procedure set forth in
this Section 1.04 for resolving disputes with respect to Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing Transaction
Expenses will be the sole and exclusive method for resolving such disputes.

(vii) Payment of Post-Closing Adjustment. The Estimated Purchase Price shall
be adjusted, upwards or downwards, as follows:

(A) For the purposes of this Agreement, the "Net Adjustment Amount" means an
amount, which may be positive or negative, equal to (A) Closing Net Working
Capital as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.04 minus Estimated
Net Working Capital, minus (B) Closing Indebtedness as finally determined
pursuant to this Section 1.04 minus Estimated Indebtedness, plus (C) Closing
Cash as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.04 minus Estimated Cash,
minus (D) Closing Transaction Expenses as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 1.04 minus Estimated Transaction Expenses;



(B) If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, the Estimated Purchase Price
shall be adjusted upwards in an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount. In
such event, Purchasers shall pay the Net Adjustment Amount to Seller within
five (5) Business Days of the determination of the Net Adjustment Amount; and

(C) If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative (in which case the "Net
Adjustment Amount" for purposes of this clause (C) shall be deemed to be equal
to the absolute value of such amount), the Estimated Purchase Price shall be
adjusted downwards in an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount. In such
event, Seller shall pay the Net Adjustment Amount to Purchasers within five
(5) Business Days of the determination of the Net Adjustment Amount.

Section 1.05. Withholding. Each Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by a Purchaser, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. At least three
(3) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Purchasers shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Seller a written statement
that shall include and set forth a good faith estimate of any proposed
deduction or withholding from any consideration otherwise payable to any
Person pursuant to this Agreement, other than with respect to compensatory
payments. Each Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with Seller prior to the Closing in seeking to reduce or eliminate
any such deduction or withholding.

Section 1.06. Pre-Closing Reorganization.

(a) In connection with the Transactions, one (1) Business Day prior to the
Closing Date, Seller, at Purchasers' request and direction, shall (i) cause
Ruby Automation to be converted into a Delaware limited liability company and
cause Ruby PR to be converted into a Puerto Rico limited liability company
(collectively, the "Conversions") by filing a certificate of conversion and
certificate of formation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
with respect to Ruby Automation and a certificate of conversion with respect
to Ruby PR with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, in
each case, in form and substance as set forth on Exhibit D; and (ii) provide
Purchasers with copies of the certificate of formation of Ruby Automation, LLC
and the certificate of organization of Ruby PR, LLC, and copies of the
certificate of conversion for each such entity as filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or the Department of State of the Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico. Within five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date,
Purchasers shall file a PR Treasury Form 6045 to cause Ruby PR, LLC to be
treated as a partnership for Puerto Rican tax purposes and an IRS Form 8832 to
cause Ruby PR, LLC to be treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, in each case effective as of the date of the Conversions.
Purchasers shall provide Seller with copies of the PR Treasury



Form 6045 and IRS Form 8832 (the "Ruby PR Tax Election Forms") filed with the
PR Treasury and IRS, as applicable.

(b) Purchasers shall be primarily responsible for, and Seller shall cooperate
with Purchasers in, the preparation of all necessary filings, certificates,
instruments, agreements and other documents reasonably necessary or
appropriate in order to effectuate the Conversions (including the Ruby PR Tax
Election Forms). Seller shall review and, except with respect to the Ruby PR
Tax Election Forms, cause each filing, certificate, instrument, agreement and
other document legally required to effect the Conversions to be executed by an
officer of the entity making such filing, certificate, instrument, agreement
and other document.

(c) At the effective time of the Conversions, the operating agreement of each
of Ruby Automation, LLC and Ruby PR, LLC, shall be in form and substance as
set forth on Exhibit E.

(d) Subject to Seller's compliance in all material respects with the foregoing
provisions of this Section 1.06, nothing in this Section 1.06 shall impose any
incremental liability on Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers, managers, shareholders, employees or Affiliates, and all of the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to have been made without regard
to the Conversions and the other matters contemplated by this Section 1.06.

ARTICLE 2 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

Subject to the exceptions set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, Seller hereby
represents and warrants to Purchasers as of the Effective Date and as of the

corporation in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, operation or leasing of its properties or assets makes such

good standing or to have such power or authority would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
Seller has heretofore made available to Purchasers a complete and correct copy
of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or equivalent organizational
documents, each as amended to date, of the Company.



(c) Section 2.01(c)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth the name of each

would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Seller has
heretofore made available to Purchasers a complete and correct copy of the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws or equivalent organizational

the context of the business and operations in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries are engaged. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements will not prevent Purchasers, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries from recovering under the occurrence-based
insurance policies set forth on Section 2.18 of the Disclosure Schedule
pursuant to, and, in accordance with, Section 6.05.

products sold, manufactured, distributed or delivered by the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on Section 2.22(a) of the Disclosure

of the Transactions.

Section 3.05. Financing. Purchasers have delivered to Seller true and complete
copies of (a) executed commitment letter(s) (as the same may be amended
pursuant to Section 5.06, the "Debt Financing Commitments"), pursuant to which
the lender parties thereto have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, to provide or cause to be provided the debt amounts set forth therein
for purpose of funding the Transactions (the "Debt Financing") and (b)
executed equity commitment letters (the "Equity Financing Commitments" and,

and, to the Knowledge of Purchasers, the other parties thereto (except to the
extent that enforceability may be limited by the applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general principles of
equity). There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to
the funding of the full amount of the Financing other than as expressly set
forth in the Financing Commitments. As of the Effective Date, there are no
side letters, understandings or other agreements or arrangements, whether
written or oral, relating (directly or indirectly) to the Financing or the
Financing Commitments to which any Purchaser or any of its Affiliates are a
party that have not been provided to Seller (provided, that any fee letter may
be redacted in a customary way as to economic and "flex" provisions). As of
the Effective Date, no Purchaser is in default under any provision of any
Financing Commitment, and, to the Knowledge of Purchasers, no event has
occurred that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) would
constitute (A) reasonably be expected to constitute or result in a breach or
default on the part of any Person under any Financing Commitment, or (B) would
reasonably be expected to constitute or result in a failure to satisfy a

provide until the earlier of the Closing and the valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with their respective terms, that Seller is a third-

forth in Article 2 in all material respects and compliance by Seller with the
covenants set forth herein in all material respects, and subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions contained in Sections 9.01 and 9.02, Purchasers
(i) have no reason to believe



that they will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition to
be satisfied by it and contained in the Financing Commitments, (ii) are not
aware of any fact or occurrence that makes any of the representations or
warranties of Purchasers in the Debt Financing Commitment inaccurate except
where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and
correct has not prevented or materially delayed or would not reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay Purchasers' consummation of the
Transactions and (iii) have no reason to believe that any portion of the Debt
Financing will not be made available to Purchasers on the Closing Date.
Purchasers have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required
by the terms of the Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the
Effective Date. Purchasers will have at Closing, subject to the satisfaction
of the conditions contained in Sections 9.01 and 9.02, assuming the accuracy
of Seller's representations and warranties set forth in Article 2 in all
material respects and assuming compliance by Seller with the covenants set
forth herein in all material respects and subject to the funding under the
Financing Commitments, together with other financial resources of Purchasers
including cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of Purchasers,
sufficient cash for Purchasers to consummate the Acquisition upon the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and pay all related fees and expenses. Such
Purchaser affirms that it is not a condition to the Closing or to any of its
other obligations of this Agreement that Purchasers obtain financing for or
related to any of the Transactions.

Section 3.06. Litigation. There is no Action pending against, or to
Purchasers' Knowledge, threatened against or affecting, such Purchaser that in
any way challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay the
Transactions.

Section 3.07. Investment Intent. Such Purchaser is acquiring the Shares for
its own account, for investment purposes only and not with a view to the
distribution of such Shares. Such Purchaser is an "accredited investor" as
defined in Regulation D promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). Such Purchaser acknowledges that the
Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act, or any state or
foreign securities Laws and that the Shares may not be sold, transferred,
offered for sale, assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of
unless such transfer, sale, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other
disposition is pursuant to the terms of an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act, and the Shares are registered under any applicable
state or foreign securities Laws or sold pursuant to an exemption from
registration under the Securities Act, and any applicable state or foreign
securities Laws. No Purchaser is an "interested shareholder" or an "affiliate"
or "associate" of an "interested shareholder" of Seller as such terms are
defined in Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 33-840.

Section 3.08. RandW Insurance Policy. Purchasers have entered into a binder
evidencing coverage with respect to the RandW Insurance Policy, a true, complete
and correct copy of which has been provided to Seller as of the Effective
Date.

Section 3.09. Limited Guaranty. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Purchasers have delivered to Seller the Limited Guaranties. The
execution, delivery and performance of each Limited Guaranty by the Guarantor
party thereto have been duly and validly authorized by all requisite action by
such Guarantor, and no other proceedings on the part of such Guarantor are
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery or performance of such Limited
Guaranty by such Guarantor. Each Limited Guaranty has been duly and validly



executed and delivered by the Guarantor party thereto and is in full force and
effect and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of such Guarantor,
enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms. There is no
default under the Limited Guaranty by the Guarantors and no event has occurred
which (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) would constitute a
default under the Limited Guaranties.

Section 3.10. Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection with the
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of a Purchaser.

Section 4.03. Access to Information; Confidentiality.

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period and subject to the confidentiality
obligations of Purchasers set forth in Section 5.01, Seller shall, or shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, (i) give Purchasers and their
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice to the offices, properties, books and records of the Company
and its Subsidiaries relating to the Business and (ii) furnish to Purchasers,

representatives such financial and operating data and other information of the
Company and its Subsidiaries relating to the Business as Purchasers may
reasonably request, in the case of each of the foregoing, to the extent needed
for the purpose of consummating the Acquisition, except that (A) Purchasers
and their representatives will not have the right to perform any investigative
procedures that involve physical disturbance or damage to the Owned Real
Property or the Leased Real Property and (B) such access will not include any
sampling of environmental media, including soil, surface water, groundwater,
indoor air, ambient air or building materials. Any inspection pursuant to this
Section 4.03 must be conducted in such a manner so as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the businesses of Seller, the Company or its
Subsidiaries, and in no event will any provision hereof be interpreted to
require



Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to permit any inspection, or to
disclose any information, that Seller determines in good faith, based on
advice of counsel, may waive any attorney-client or similar privilege that
Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries may hold; provided, however, that
Seller shall, and shall cause the Company to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to make alternative arrangements to provide Purchasers with access to,
or otherwise disclose, such information, including the entrance into customary
common interest agreements. To the extent that Seller, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries incurs any out-of-pocket costs in processing, retrieving or
transmitting any information pursuant to this Section 4.03, Purchasers shall
reimburse Seller for the reasonable out-of-pocket costs thereof promptly upon
submission to Purchasers of an invoice therefor accompanied by reasonable
supporting documentation.

(b) For a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, Seller and its
Affiliates shall hold, and shall cause their Representatives to hold, in
confidence all information (written or otherwise) in any form or medium that
is confidential, proprietary or otherwise not generally available to the
public relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries or the Transactions (the
"Confidential Information"), except to the extent that such information can be
shown to have been (i) in the public domain prior to the Closing, (ii) in the
public domain at or after the Closing through no fault of Seller or its
Affiliates or Representatives or (iii) lawfully and independently developed by
Seller or its Affiliates or Representatives without use of, or reference to,
the Confidential Information, and except that Seller may disclose Confidential
Information to its Representatives in connection with their evaluation of the
Transactions so long as such Representatives are informed by Seller of the
nature of the Confidential Information and are required by Seller to hold such
in confidence. If, for a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date,
Seller or any of its Representatives are legally required to disclose any
Confidential Information, Seller shall (A) promptly notify Purchasers of such
legally required disclosure in order to permit Purchasers, at Purchasers' sole
cost and expense, to seek a protective order or take other appropriate action,
and (B) cooperate as reasonably requested by Purchasers in Purchasers' efforts
to obtain a protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information, at Purchasers' sole
cost and expense; provided, however, that Seller or any of its Representatives
shall only disclose Confidential Information to the extent its counsel advises
is necessary to comply with applicable Law.

Section 4.04. Third-Party Consents. Without limiting the effect of Section
6.01, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain all
authorizations, consents, approvals and waivers of, and give all notices to,
each third party that may be necessary or desirable, in the reasonable
discretion of Purchasers, in connection with the Transactions, it being
understood that (a) except as set forth on Section 9.02(c) of the Disclosure
Schedule, obtaining any such authorizations, consents, approvals and waivers,
or giving of such notices, is not a condition to the obligations of Purchasers
under this Agreement, including the obligation to effect the Closing and (b)
in connection with obtaining any such authorizations, consents, approvals and
waivers, or the giving of any notices, in each case, other than any
authorization, consent, approval, waiver or notice with respect to the matters
set forth on Section 9.02(c) of the



Disclosure Schedule, in no event will Seller be required to incur any out-of-
pocket costs or any other obligation or Liability unless de minimis in nature.

Section 4.05. Financing.

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller, the Company and the Company's
Subsidiaries shall, and shall direct their respective Representatives,

with the arrangement and closing of the Debt Financing at Purchasers' sole
cost and expense, including:

obtaining such documentation and items;

(v) executing and delivering, (i) prior to the Closing, a customary
authorization letter in connection with the marketing of the Debt Financing

customary representations that such information does not contain a material
misstatement or omission and containing a representation to the Debt Financing
Sources that the public-side versions of such documents, if any, do not
include material non-public information about Seller or its Subsidiaries or
their respective securities) (the "Authorization Letters") in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller and Purchasers and provided that
Seller and the Company are given a reasonable opportunity prior to execution
to review and provide comments on such information distributed to prospective
lenders in connection therewith and (ii) as of the Closing Date, any
definitive financing documents, including any credit or purchase agreements,
guarantees, pledge agreements, security agreements, mortgages, deeds of trust

to the Debt Financing (including a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer
of the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to solvency matters and consents
of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt
Financing) as may be reasonably requested by Purchasers in connection with the
Debt Financing and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledge of collateral
and other matters ancillary to the Financing (including cooperation in
connection with the payoff of existing indebtedness and the release of related
Liens, and the negotiation and delivery of customary payoff and release
letters) as may be reasonably requested by Purchasers in connection with the
Debt Financing;

(vi) taking all reasonable actions necessary to (1) permit the Financing

respect to the Company's and its Subsidiaries' current assets and other
collateral, and to evaluate its cash management and accounting systems,

and to arrange discussions among Purchasers and their Debt Financing Sources
with other parties to material leases, encumbrances and contracts in each
case, to the extent required by the Debt Financing Sources and necessary or
customary for the consummation of the financings contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitments; provided, however, that in no event shall obtaining any
such waivers, consents, estoppels or approvals be a condition to the Closing
(unless expressly contemplated in Section 9.02(c)) or to any of Purchasers'
other obligations of this Agreement;

(ix) taking all corporate or other actions as reasonably requested by
Purchasers, and providing such other assistance, necessary or reasonably
requested by Purchasers to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing and
to permit the proceeds thereof to be made available to Purchasers on the
Closing Date to consummate the Transactions;

(x) upon Purchasers' request, using commercially reasonable efforts to
periodically update any Required Information (to the extent it is available)
to be included in an offering document to be used in connection with such Debt
Financing in order to permit Purchasers to ensure that such Required
Information, when taken as a whole, does not contain as of the time provided,
giving effect to any supplements, any untrue statement of material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
contained therein not misleading; and

(xi) delivering to Purchasers copies of the interim monthly consolidated
financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries as soon as reasonably

each monthly accounting period between the date of hereof and the Closing Date

income, operations and cash flows);

provided, that (A) such cooperation requested by this Section 4.05(a) does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Seller, the Company and
its Subsidiaries, (B) none of Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or their respective Affiliates shall be required to (1) pay any commitment or

respective assets, in connection with the Financing prior to the Closing Date,
(C) none of Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
Affiliates shall be required to obtain or provide any opinions, and (D)
subject to the Authorization Letters'



provisions respecting the representations referenced in clause (v)(i) of this
Section 4.05(a), no liability shall be imposed on Seller, the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers or employees involved;
provided, further, that, (x) for the avoidance of doubt, no obligation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any agreement, instrument,
certificate or other document executed in connection with the Financing shall
be effective until the Closing (and no such agreement, instrument or document
shall be effective until the Closing Date) and none of the foregoing shall be
required to be executed by any individual Person who is not, immediately
following the Closing, an officer of the Company or its applicable Subsidiary
and (y) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of
Seller, the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to deliver
or cause the delivery of any landlord waivers or estoppels, non-disturbance
agreements, surveys or title insurance prior to the Closing.

(b) Nothing in this Section 4.05 will require cooperation of Seller or any of
its Affiliates to the extent it would require Seller or any of its Affiliates
or representatives to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses or otherwise incur
any liability or give any indemnities. Purchasers shall concurrently with the
Closing (and if requested in writing by Seller after the Closing, as promptly
as reasonably practicable following such written request), reimburse Seller
and its Affiliates for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, costs
and expenses incurred by Seller, its Affiliates and their representatives in
connection their compliance with this Section 4.05 and shall indemnify and
hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against all losses and
liabilities suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the
arrangement of any Financing, any Alternative Financing or any other financing
that Purchasers may raise in connection with the Transactions, any cooperation
provided pursuant to this Section 4.05, and any information used in connection
therewith, except to the extent any of the foregoing was suffered or incurred
as a result of fraud or willful breach of this Agreement by Seller or any of
its Affiliates.

(c) Nothing in this Section 4.05 will require cooperation of Seller or any of
its Affiliates to the extent it would (i) require Seller or any of its
Affiliates to take any action that would reasonably be expected to conflict
with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, the Organizational Documents of
Seller or any of its Affiliates, any material contract, or any applicable Law,
to waive or amend any term of this Agreement, or to cause any representation
or warranty in this Agreement to be breached by Seller or any of its
Affiliates, (ii) unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business or
operations of Seller or any of its Affiliates, (iii) result in any officer,
manager or director (or Person occupying a similar position) of Seller or any
of its Affiliates incurring (or potentially incurring) personal liability with
respect to any matters relating to the Financing or the approval thereof, (iv)
require Seller or any of its Affiliates to incur any liability or commit to
any obligation that is not contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, (v)
require providing access to or disclose information that Seller is advised by

confidentiality requirements binding on, Seller or any of its Affiliates, or
(vi) require any such Person to change any fiscal period.



(d) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries' logos
in connection with the Debt Financing; provided, that such logos are used
solely in a customary manner that does not, and would not reasonably be likely
to, harm or disparage the Company or any of its Affiliates or their reputation
or goodwill or their respective trademarks, products, services, offerings or
other Intellectual Property rights.

Section 4.06. Exclusivity. Seller agrees that between the Effective Date and
the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement, Seller shall

Representatives shall, directly or indirectly:

(a) solicit, initiate, consider, knowingly encourage, enter into or approve
any proposals or offers from any Person (i) relating solely to any direct
acquisition or purchase of all or any portion of the capital stock or other
equity or ownership interest of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
substantially all of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
other than Inventory to be sold in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice, (ii) to enter into any merger, consolidation or other
business combination relating solely to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or (iii) to enter into a recapitalization, reorganization or any other
extraordinary business transaction relating solely to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (any such proposals or offers described in clause (i)-(iii)
above, an "Acquisition Proposal"); or

(b) participate in any discussions, conversations, negotiations or other
communications regarding, or furnish to any other Person any information with
respect to, or otherwise participate in, knowingly facilitate or knowingly
take any other action which would reasonably be expected to lead to, the
making, submission or announcement of, any Acquisition Proposal. Seller
immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions,
conversations, negotiations and other communications with any Persons
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

Seller shall notify Purchasers promptly, but in any event within 24 hours,
orally and in writing of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal. Any such
notice to Purchasers shall indicate in reasonable detail the material terms
and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal; provided, that such disclosure
does not violate the terms of any Contracts or applicable Law. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing herein shall
prohibit, restrict or otherwise limit (i) the Transactions contemplated
herein, (ii) any purchase, sale or other transactions involving the publicly
traded securities of Seller, (iii) Seller from participating in discussions or
negotiations with any Person making a proposal to acquire any assets of, or
equity in, Seller or any of its Affiliates other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries (a "Seller Proposal"), (iv) Seller or any of its Affiliates other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries from providing access to its properties,

Representatives from participating in discussions or negotiations with respect
to a Seller Proposal, (vi) Seller or Seller's Representatives from disclosing

Company. 

Section 4.07. Seller Release. Effective as of the Closing, Seller, on its own
behalf and on behalf of Seller's past, present and future equity holders,
Affiliates, agents, attorneys, administrators, heirs, executors, spouses,
trustees, beneficiaries, representatives, successors and assigns claiming by

and forever discharges the Company, Purchasers and their respective past,
present and future directors, managers, members, shareholders, officers,
employees, agents, Subsidiaries, Affiliates, attorneys, representatives,

causes of action, suits, arbitrations, proceedings, debts, liabilities,
obligations, sums of money, accounts, covenants, contracts, controversies,
agreements, promises, damages, fees, expenses, judgments, executions,
indemnification rights, claims and demands arising out, relating to, against
or in any way connected with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in
respect of any and all agreements, liabilities or obligations entered into or
incurred on or prior to the Closing Date, or in respect of any event occurring
or circumstances existing on or prior to the Closing Date, whether or not
relating to claims pending on, or asserted after, the Closing Date; provided,
however, that the foregoing release does not extend to, include or restrict or
limit in any way, and Seller hereby reserves all rights, if any, to pursue any
and all claims, actions or rights available now or in future (a) under or
pursuant to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, (b) under the Tail
Policy or (c) under any agreement or arrangement set forth on Section 4.07 of
the Disclosure Schedule.

Section 4.08. Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation.

(a) For a period of four (4) years following the Closing, Seller shall not,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly through any
Person or contractual arrangement:

(i) engage in any business anywhere in North America that is competitive with
the Business, or perform management, executive or supervisory functions with
respect to, own, operate, join, control, render financial assistance to,
receive any economic benefit from, exert any influence upon, participate in,
render services or advice to, or allow any of its officers (while employed by
Seller) to be connected as an officer, employee, partner, member, stockholder
or consultant with, any business or Person that competes in whole or in part
with the Business; provided, that Seller and its Affiliates and such officers
may individually own up to five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of a
publicly held Person that is competitive with the Business so long as Seller
and its Affiliates do not actively participate in the management of such
Person, or otherwise control or exert influence over such Person;

(ii) solicit, recruit or hire any person who at any time on or after the
Effective Date is a Company Group Employee (as hereinafter defined); provided,
that the foregoing shall not prohibit (A) a general solicitation to the public
of general advertising or similar methods of solicitation by search firms not
specifically directed at Company Group Employees or (B) Seller or any of its



Affiliates from soliciting, recruiting or hiring any Company Group Employee
who (x) has voluntarily ceased to be employed or retained by the Company,
Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates for at least twelve (12)
months, or (y) has been terminated and ceased to be employed or retained by
the Company, Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates. For purposes of
this Section 4.08, "Company Group Employees" means, collectively, officers,
directors and employees of the Company, Purchasers and their respective
Affiliates; or

(iii) disparage Purchasers or any of their Affiliates in any way that could
adversely affect the goodwill, reputation or business relationships of
Purchasers or any of their Affiliates with the public generally, or with any
of their customers, suppliers or employees (other than ordinary course sales
communications or as required by applicable Law).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 4.08(a)(i),
Seller and its Subsidiaries shall not be prohibited or restricted in any way
from (i) manufacturing any products and from selling any products manufactured
by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries whether sold directly or through third-
party distributors, including any products manufactured by any Person that
becomes a Subsidiary of Seller after the Effective Date, (ii) selling third-
party manufactured products incidental to, and in conjunction with, (A) the
sale by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries of products manufactured by Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) a PMA held by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries or (C) maintenance, repair and overhaul services for aerospace
aircraft and related components offered or performed by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, (iii) acquiring an interest in or securities of any Person as an
investment by its pension funds or other benefit plan funds whether or not
such Person is engaged in a Competing Business, or (iv) acquiring any business
or Person that is engaged in a Competing Business, so long as for the most
recent fiscal year ending prior to the date of such acquisition, the revenues
derived from such Competing Business were less than twenty-five percent (25%)
of the total consolidated revenues of such business or Person (provided,
however, that (A) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall be prohibited from
acquiring any business or Person listed on Section 4.08(b) of the Disclosure
Schedule and (B) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall be required to divest the
portion of such business or Person engaged in a Competing Business within one
(1) year of the consummation of such acquisition).

(c) Seller acknowledges that the covenants of Seller set forth in this Section
4.08 are an essential element of this Agreement and that any breach by Seller
of any provision of this Section 4.08 could result in irreparable injury to
Purchasers. Seller acknowledges that in the event of such a breach, in
addition to all other remedies available at Law, Purchasers shall be entitled
to equitable relief, including injunctive relief, and an equitable accounting
of all earnings, profits or other benefits arising therefrom, as well as such
other damages as may be appropriate. Seller has independently consulted with
its counsel and after such consultation agrees that the covenants set forth in
this Section 4.08 are reasonable and proper to protect the legitimate interest
of Purchasers.



(d) If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the character,
duration or geographical scope of the provisions of this Section 4.08 are
unreasonable, it is the intention and the agreement of the Parties that these
provisions shall be construed by the court in such a manner as to impose only
those restrictions on Seller's conduct that are reasonable in light of the
circumstances and as are necessary to assure to Purchasers the benefits of
this Agreement. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to
enforce all of the separate covenants of this Section 4.08 because taken
together they are more extensive than necessary to assure to Purchasers the
intended benefits of this Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed by
the Parties that the provisions hereof that, if eliminated, would permit the
remaining separate provisions to be enforced in such proceeding, shall be
deemed eliminated, for the purposes of such proceeding, from this Agreement.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4.08 shall not (i) be binding on
any Person who may acquire control of Seller or a Subsidiary of Seller after
the date hereof in the conduct of such Person's business as such business is
conducted by such Person directly or through its Affiliates or Subsidiaries
other than Seller and its Subsidiaries, or (ii) prohibit or restrict Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries from engaging in any such transaction (provided, that
Seller and its Subsidiaries comply with the other terms of this Section 4.08).
Seller and its Subsidiaries shall remain subject to the restrictions set forth
in Section 4.08, notwithstanding the consummation of any transaction described
in this Section 4.08(e).

Section 4.09. Transaction Expense Payoff Instructions. With respect to any
Transaction Expenses which will not have been paid in full prior to the
Closing Date, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall submit to Purchasers reasonably satisfactory documentation
setting forth an itemized list of all, and amounts of all, Transaction
Expenses, including the identity of each payee, dollar amounts owed, wire
instructions and any other information necessary to effect the final payment
in full thereof, and copies of final invoices from each such payee (which may
exclude information that could potentially waive any attorney-client or
similar privilege) acknowledging the invoiced amounts as full and final
payment for all services rendered to the Company or its Subsidiaries (the
"Transaction Expenses Payoff Instructions").

ARTICLE 5

COVENANTS OF PURCHASERS

Section 5.01. Confidentiality. Prior to the Closing and after any termination
of this Agreement, Purchasers and their Affiliates shall hold, and shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to cause their Representatives to hold,
in confidence, all information (written or otherwise) in any form or medium
that is confidential, proprietary or otherwise not available to the public,
relating to Seller, the Company or the Company's Subsidiaries or the
Transactions that Seller, the Company, the Company's Subsidiaries or any of
their Affiliates or Representatives have furnished to Purchasers or any of
their Affiliates in connection with the Transactions, in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, and such information shall be deemed
"Evaluation Material" as such term is defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full



force and effect until the Closing Date, at which time, such Confidentiality
Agreement and the obligations under this Section 5.01 shall terminate;
provided, however, that the obligations of Littlejohn and Co., LLC set forth in
Section 1 of the Confidentiality Agreement (solely to the extent such
obligations relate to Evaluation Material relating to businesses of Seller
retained by Seller and its Affiliates after the Closing only, and not
Evaluation Material relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) and
Section 11 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the Closing and
shall expire in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. If
the Closing does not occur, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue until
its expiration in accordance with its terms.

Section 5.02. Contacts with Customers, Suppliers, Employees. During the Pre-
Closing Period, Purchasers (and all of their Affiliates and Representatives
(acting in their capacities as such)) will not contact or communicate with the
employees, landlords, customers or suppliers of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions without Seller's prior
written consent; provided, that, this Section 5.02 shall not prohibit contacts
made in the ordinary course of business unrelated to the Transactions so long
as Purchasers and all of their Affiliates and Representatives do not use any
of the "Evaluation Material" or "Transaction Information" as such terms are
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise violate the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement in connection therewith.

Section 5.03. Solicitation of Employees. Purchasers agree that neither
Purchasers nor any of their Affiliates will, until the end of the two (2)-year
period immediately following the Closing Date, except as contemplated in
Article 8, without the prior written consent of Seller, (a) solicit any
employee of Seller or any of its Affiliates set forth on Section 5.03 of the
Disclosure Schedule (each, a "Key Employee") to leave his or her employment
with Seller or such Affiliate or in any way interfere with the employment
relationship between Seller or its Affiliates and any of their employees or
(b) hire or otherwise engage any Key Employee with whom Purchasers first had
contact with after the date of the Confidentiality Agreement and during the
course of pursuing the Acquisition, except that nothing in this Section 5.03
will preclude Purchasers or their Affiliates from hiring any person (i) who
responds to any general solicitation or advertisement (including any
recruitment efforts conducted by any recruitment agency, provided that
Purchasers and their Affiliates have not directed any recruitment efforts at
such person), (ii) who contacts Purchasers or any of their Affiliates on his
or her own initiative without any direct or indirect solicitation or
encouragement from Purchasers or any of their Affiliates, other than any
general solicitation or advertisement, (iii) whose employment with Seller or
any of its Affiliates has been terminated by Seller or such Affiliate for at
least six (6) months or (iv) with whom Purchasers and their Affiliates have
not had any contact in connection with pursuing the Acquisition.

Section 5.04. Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

(a) At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall purchase a "tail" policy to the
current policy of directors', LLC managers' and officers' liability insurance
maintained by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which "tail"
policy will (i) be effective and provide continuation of coverage for a period
from the Closing through and including the date six (6) years after the
Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
on or prior to the Closing, (ii) contain substantially the



same coverage and amounts as, and contain terms and conditions no less
advantageous than, in the aggregate, the coverage currently provided by the
current policy for which continuation of coverage is being provided, and (iii)
otherwise be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller (the
"Tail Policy"). The Tail Policy shall be deemed a Transaction Expense for
purposes of this Agreement.

(b) As of and following the Closing, Purchasers, each of their Subsidiaries
and each of their Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) (the
"Releasing Parties") release, remise, acquit, satisfy and forever discharge
each of (i) the directors, managers and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and (ii) the directors, managers, employees and officers of
Seller and its Subsidiaries other than the Company and its Subsidiaries, in
the case of each of clause (i) and clause (ii), that are not Employees
(collectively, the "Covered Persons") and his or her present, former and
future heirs, executors and administrators (all of the foregoing collectively,
the "Released Parties"), of and from any and all actions, cause and causes of
action, suits, debts, accounts, bills, interests, costs, liabilities,
agreements, damages, judgments, executions, claims and demands whatsoever, in
law or in equity, whether based in contract law, tort law or other law, and
whether known or unknown that any of the Releasing Parties has, has ever had,
or may have against the Released Parties, individually and collectively, to
the extent related, arising out of, or concerning a Covered Person's provision
of services as a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries on or
prior to the Closing Date, whether or not relating to claims pending on, or
asserted after, the Closing Date (collectively, the "Release Subject Matter");
provided, however, that the foregoing release does not extend to, include or
restrict or limit in any way, and each Releasing Party hereby reserves all
rights, if any, to pursue any and all claims, actions or rights available now
or in future (a) under or pursuant to this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements or (b) for losses arising out of actual fraud. It is understood and
agreed that this is a full and final agreement applying not only to all claims
which are presently known, anticipated or disclosed, but also to any claims
which are presently unknown.

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.04 will survive the consummation of the
Transactions and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each of the Covered Persons and their successors, assigns and
heirs and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract
or otherwise.

Section 5.05. Preservation of Records. Purchasers agree that they will not,
for a period of at least six (6) years following the Closing Date, destroy or
cause to be destroyed, or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
destroy or cause to be destroyed, any material books or records relating to
tax, accounting, financial or regulatory affairs of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for the period prior to the Closing without first obtaining the
consent of Seller (or providing to Seller notice of such intent and a
reasonable opportunity to copy such books or records, at Seller's expense, at
least thirty (30) days prior to such destruction). For a period of six (6)
years following the Closing, except in connection with a dispute under this
Agreement, Purchasers shall provide Seller and its authorized Representatives
with reasonable access (for the purpose of examining and copying), during
normal business hours and upon reasonable advance



notice, to the books and records in the possession of the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to the tax, accounting, financial and regulatory affairs
of the Company and its Subsidiaries solely in connection with (a) the
preparation or amendment of any Tax Returns or claims for refund (and any
materials necessary for the preparation of any of the foregoing) for periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (b) the preparation of financial
statements for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, and (c)
compliance with the rules and regulations of the IRS, the SEC or any other
Governmental Authority. Purchasers' obligations with respect to such books and
records include maintaining, for at least the retention period specified in
this Section 5.05, computer systems permitting access to any such books and
records that are stored in electronic form in a fashion which is not less
efficient than current access methods. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, except with prior written consent of
Purchasers, (A) unless required by Law, neither Seller nor its authorized
Representatives shall have access to personnel records of any of the Company
or its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or evaluation records,
medical histories or other information which in Purchasers' good faith opinion
is sensitive or the disclosure of which could subject the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to risk of liability and (B) Purchasers shall not be required
to disclose any information if doing so (x) violates any applicable Law to
which the Company or its Subsidiaries is subject or (y) it believes in good
faith based on advice of counsel could result in a loss of the ability to
successfully assert a claim of privilege (including the attorney-client and
work product privileges).

Section 5.06. Financing.

(a) Purchasers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and
obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Financing Commitments (including any flex provisions applicable thereto)
(provided, that Purchasers may amend or replace the Debt Financing Commitments
to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities who had not executed a Debt Financing Commitment as of the date
hereof), including using commercially reasonable efforts to (A) negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitments, (B) satisfy on a
timely basis all conditions and covenants applicable to Purchasers in the Debt
Financing Commitments that are within their control (or obtain the waiver of
conditions applicable to Purchasers contained in the Debt Financing
Commitments) in order to obtain the Debt Financing at Closing, (C) draw down
upon and consummate the Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments at or prior to the Closing, and (D) fully pay, or cause to be
fully paid, all commitment or other fees arising pursuant to the Debt
Financing Commitment as and when they become due. Subject to the following
sentence, Purchasers shall maintain in full force and effect the Debt
Financing Commitments in accordance with their terms until the earlier of the
consummation of the Transactions or the valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms (provided, that such date is no later than the
termination or expiration date set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments).
Purchasers shall have the right from time to time to (x) amend, replace,
supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the Debt
Financing Commitments, (y) substitute other debt or equity financing for all
or any portion of the Debt Financing from the same and/or alternative Debt
Financing Sources and/or (z) reduce the amount of Debt Financing



under the Debt Financing Commitments in its reasonable discretion; provided,
that any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or
waiver of any provision of the Debt Financing Commitments that amends the Debt
Financing, and/or substitution of all or any portion of the Debt Financing,
and/or reduction in the amount of Debt Financing shall not, without the prior
written consent of Seller, (1) expand, amend, modify or add to the conditions
precedent to the Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments
in any respect that would make such conditions materially less likely to be
satisfied by the Closing Date, (2) adversely affect the ability of Purchasers
to enforce their rights against other parties to the Debt Financing
Commitment, or the definitive documentation governing the Debt Financing as so
amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to the ability
of Purchasers to enforce their rights against such other parties to the Debt
Financing Commitment and any related fee letter as in effect on the date
hereof, (3) affect Purchasers' ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the terms contemplated by this Agreement or
(4) prevent or materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the
Acquisition and the other Transactions or otherwise make materially less
likely to occur the funding of the Debt Financing; provided, further, that
Purchasers shall not reduce the Debt Financing to an amount committed below
the amount that is required, together with other financial resources of
Purchasers, including amounts available under the Equity Financing
Commitments, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of Purchasers,
the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, to consummate
the Acquisition on the terms contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance
of doubt, the syndication of the Debt Financing to the extent permitted by the
Debt Financing Commitments shall not be deemed to violate Purchasers'
obligations under this Agreement. Purchasers shall give the Company and Seller
prompt (in no event more than five (5) Business Days) written notice: (1) of
any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any breach or default) by any party to any Financing Commitments or definitive
document related to the Financing of which a Purchaser obtains actual
knowledge; (2) of the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Person with respect to any actual or potential breach,
default, termination, or repudiation by any party to any Financing Commitments
or any definitive document related to the Financing or any provisions of the
Financing Commitments or any definitive document related to the Financing; and
(3) if for any reason Purchasers believe in good faith that they will not be
able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on substantially the terms
contemplated by the Financing Commitments or the definitive documents related
to the Financing. Purchasers shall promptly provide to the Company (but in any
event within five (5) Business Days upon receipt of any information related
thereto) any information relating to any circumstance referred to in clause
(1), (2) or (3) of the immediately preceding sentence.

(b) In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated in the Debt
Financing Commitments, Purchasers shall promptly notify Seller and shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain alternative debt
financing (the "Alternative Financing") from alternative sources on terms not
less favorable



to Purchasers (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Purchasers, taking
into account the flex provisions set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments),
in an amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions promptly following the
occurrence of such event and if Purchasers proceed with any Alternative
Financing, Purchasers will be subject to the same obligations with respect to
such Alternative Financing as set forth in this Agreement with respect to the
Debt Financing. Purchasers shall promptly deliver to Seller true and complete
copies of all agreements pursuant to which any such alternative source shall
have committed to provide Purchasers with any portion of the Debt Financing;
provided, that any fee letter may be redacted in a customary way as to
economic and "flex" provisions.

(c) Purchasers shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to,
or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, or replace, any Equity
Financing Commitments without the consent of Seller. Purchasers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
arrange the Equity Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Equity Financing Commitments, including using commercially reasonable efforts
to (i) maintain in effect the Equity Financing Commitments and (ii) satisfy on
a timely basis all conditions within its control applicable to Purchasers to
obtaining the Equity Financing set forth in the Equity Financing Commitments.
In the event that all conditions to the Equity Financing Commitments have been
satisfied in Purchasers' good faith judgment, Purchasers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Investors to fund on the Closing
Date the Equity Financing required to consummate the Closing. Purchasers shall
not, and shall not permit any of their Subsidiaries to, take any action not
otherwise required or expressly permitted under this Agreement that is a
breach of, or would result in termination of, the Equity Financing Commitment.
Purchasers shall give Seller prompt written notice of any material breach by
any party to any Equity Financing Commitment, of which Purchasers become
aware, or any termination of any Equity Financing Commitment or unavailability
of any portion of the Equity Financing. Purchasers shall keep the Company
fully informed on a current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Equity Financing including any alternative or replacement financing therefor.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Section 5.06 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
require, and in no event shall the "commercially reasonable efforts" of
Purchasers be deemed or construed to require, Purchasers to bring (A) any
Action against any source of any Debt Financing to enforce its respective
rights under the Financing Commitments, (B) seek the Equity Financing from any
source other than those counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that
contemplated by, the Equity Financing Commitments, (C) seek or accept Debt
Financing on terms less favorable than the terms and conditions described in
the Debt Financing Commitments (including the exercise of flex provisions) or
(D) pay any fees in excess of those contemplated by the Financing Commitments
(whether to secure a waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise).



(e) For purposes of this Agreement, references to "Financing" shall include
the financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments as permitted to be
amended, modified, replaced, supplemented or substituted by this Section 5.06
and references to "Financing Commitments" or "Debt Financing Commitments"
shall include such documents as permitted to be amended, modified, replaced,
supplemented or substituted by this Section 5.06.

Section 5.07. Maintenance of the RandW Insurance Policy. Purchasers shall, at
their sole cost and expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
the RandW Insurance Policy in accordance with its terms. Purchasers shall not
amend the waiver of subrogation provisions of Section 8(b) of the RandW
Insurance Policy in any manner that is adverse to Seller or its Subsidiaries
without the prior written consent of Seller.

ARTICLE 6 
COVENANTS OF PURCHASERS AND SELLER

Section 6.01. Consents; Further Assurances.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Parties agree to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to

to cooperate with each other in connection with the foregoing, including using

consents and approvals from other parties to the Material Contracts, (ii)
obtain all consents, approvals and authorizations that are required to be
obtained under any applicable Law, (iii) prevent the entry, enactment or
promulgation of any threatened or pending Governmental Order that would

(iv) lift or rescind any Governmental Order adversely affecting the ability of
the Parties to consummate the Transactions, and (v) effect all necessary
registrations, applications, notices and filings and submissions of
information requested by Governmental Authorities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything else in this Agreement (other than as provided in
Section 4.04 hereof), nothing in this Agreement will require Seller, the
Company or the Company's Subsidiaries to agree to or execute any material
changes to any Contracts, offer or grant any accommodation (financial or
otherwise), commence any Action or make any payments to any third party in
order to obtain third party consents to the Transactions.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, each Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) make their respective filings under the HSR Act as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Date (but in no event later than
five (5) Business Days after the Effective Date), (ii) cause the satisfaction
of such other filing requirements, or the issuance of such approvals,

other applicable Antitrust Law, (iii) request early termination of applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Law, (iv) comply at the
earliest practicable date with any request for information or documentary
material received by Purchasers or Seller or any of their Affiliates from any
Governmental

temporary, preliminary or permanent, under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust
Law, that would have the effect of prohibiting, preventing or restricting
consummation of the Transactions. The Parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by
any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions under the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Law. If any administrative, judicial or legislative
Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the
Transactions as in violation of the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, each
Party shall cooperate with the other and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to contest any such Action.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchasers shall not be
required by this Section 6.01 to take or agree to undertake any action,
including entering into any consent decree, hold separate order or other
arrangement, that would (A) require the divestiture of any assets of
Purchasers, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, (B) limit
Purchasers' freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to consolidate
and control, the Company and its Subsidiaries or any of their assets or
businesses or any of Purchasers' or their Affiliates' other assets or
businesses, (C) limit Purchasers' ability to acquire or hold, or exercise full
rights of ownership with respect to, the Shares, or (D) violate or be
prohibited by applicable Law.

(d) The Parties' commercially reasonable efforts under Section 6.01(b) will
include, subject to Section 6.01(c) (i) reasonably cooperating in all respects
with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection
with any Action under an Antitrust Law relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions, (ii) promptly keeping each other appropriately informed of
substantive communications from and to a Governmental Authority under an
Antitrust Law relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, (iii) conferring
with each other in advance, and reasonably considering each other's views,
regarding appropriate contacts with and responses to such a Governmental
Authority, (iv) providing each other in advance, with a reasonable opportunity
for review and comment thereon, drafts of all substantive written
communications to a Governmental Authority concerning an Action under an
Antitrust Law relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, (v) not
arranging for or participating in any meeting with any Governmental Authority
in respect of any Action under an Antitrust Law relating to this Agreement or
the Transactions without consulting with each other in advance, and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, giving the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, and (vi) furnishing all
information reasonably required for any application or other filing to be made
pursuant to any applicable Law of any Governmental Authority in connection
with the Transactions.

(e) Purchasers shall pay the cost of all fees payable to a Governmental
Authority in connection with filings relating to the Transactions under the
HSR Act or other Antitrust Law.

Section 6.02. Public Announcements. During the Pre-Closing Period, none of
Purchasers, their Affiliates and their Representatives will issue any public
release or



announcement concerning the Transactions without the prior consent of Seller
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and none of
Seller, its Affiliates or its Representatives will issue any public release or
announcement concerning the Transactions without the prior consent of
Purchasers (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
except (a) in each case, as such release or announcement may be required by
Law or the rules, regulations or policies of any United States or foreign
securities exchange, in which case the Party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other
Party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of
such issuance, (b) that Seller may make internal announcements regarding the
Transactions to its employees after reasonable prior notice to, and
consultation with, Purchasers, and (c) Purchasers and their Affiliates may
make disclosures (i) in connection with the Debt Financing or (ii) to their
respective direct and indirect Affiliates, equity holders, partners, members,
investors, prospective investors, financing sources, counsel, accountants,
consultants and other advisors (so long as, in each case, such disclosure has
a valid business purpose and is effected in a manner consistent with customary
practices and the Confidentiality Agreement).

Section 6.03. Trademarks; Tradenames. Each Purchaser, for itself and its
Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that such Purchaser is not purchasing,
acquiring or otherwise obtaining any right, title or interest in or to any
Marks of Seller or any of its Affiliates using or containing "Kaman" (in block
letters or otherwise) or any variations and derivatives thereof, either alone
or in combination with other words or elements, together with the goodwill
associated with any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Tradenames and
Trademarks"), and neither Purchasers nor any of their Affiliates shall have
any rights in or to the Tradenames and Trademarks except as set forth in the
Transitional Trademark License Agreement. Neither Purchasers nor any of their
Affiliates shall (a) use, register or seek to use or register in any
jurisdiction any of the Tradenames and Trademarks or any and all Marks
confusingly similar thereto or using or containing any of the foregoing either
alone or in combination with other words or elements or (b) except in
connection with (i) the enforcement of their rights under the Transitional
Trademark License Agreement or (ii) a challenge by Purchasers that Seller or
its Affiliates have abandoned any Tradenames and Trademarks in defense of an
Action initiated by or on behalf of Seller or its Affiliates arising out of
such Tradenames and Trademarks, contest the use, ownership, validity or
enforceability of any rights of Seller or any of its Affiliates in or to any
of the Tradenames and Trademarks. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Section 6.03, Purchasers may continue to use the Tradenames and
Trademarks pursuant to the terms of, and only during the phase-out period set
forth in, the Transitional Trademark License Agreement.

Section 6.04. Notices of Certain Events. During the Pre-Closing Period, each
Party shall promptly notify the other Party of:

(a) any written notice or other written communication from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions;

(b) any written notice or other written communication from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions; and



(c) any change or fact of which it is aware that will or is reasonably likely
to result in any of the conditions set forth in Article 9 becoming incapable
of being satisfied.

Section 6.05. Insurance.

(a) In the event Purchasers provide written notice to Seller of a claim
asserted in connection with the Company or its Subsidiaries after the Closing
arising out of an occurrence taking place on or prior to the Closing or with
respect to facts, circumstances or conditions that arose or existed on or
prior to the Closing ("Post-Closing Claims"), Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain recoveries under any applicable occurrence-based
insurance policies maintained by Seller that covered the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any assets or properties thereof to the extent such insurance
coverage exists and provides coverage and shall pay to Purchasers any net
proceeds recovered thereunder; provided, that Purchasers shall (i) be
responsible for the satisfaction or payment of any and all associated self-
insured retentions, deductibles, any other self-insurance mechanisms, costs
and expenses with respect to any Post-Closing Claim that occurred on or prior
to Closing and (ii) reasonably cooperate with Seller with respect to the
tendering of, and pursuing coverage for, any such claims including providing
notices, information and backup materials as may be necessary in connection
therewith. For purposes of this Section 6.05(a), it is acknowledged and agreed
that "commercially reasonable efforts" shall not include the need or
requirement to pursue an insurance recovery effort by means of mediation,
arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution proceeding or litigation.

(b) Seller agrees that with respect to any act, omission, event or occurrence
that results in a material liability relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective assets or properties that first occurs, and that
Seller first becomes aware of, during the period beginning on the Effective
Date and ending as of the Closing that is covered by insurance policies under
which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective
assets or properties, as applicable, is insured prior to the Closing, (i)
Seller shall promptly notify Purchasers of the occurrence of such event, and
(ii) Seller shall promptly make claims under such policies in respect of such
act, omission, event, occurrence or liability, subject to the terms and
conditions of such policies, and, to the extent any insurance proceeds are
received by Seller in respect of such claims, then Seller shall (but
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing), promptly after Seller's
receipt thereof, remit to Purchasers the amount of such proceeds (net of any
deductibles or expenses), less any amounts thereof actually paid to third
parties who perform repairs or other similar work in connection with restoring
the applicable assets or property to its prior condition.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 6.05 shall
apply with respect to all insurance held by or for the benefit of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date except with respect to the
insurance policies described in Section 8.01, which shall be governed by the
provisions of Section 8.01. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, Seller shall retain and shall have no obligation to
surrender to Purchasers any insurance proceeds received



by Seller with respect to Covered Losses for which Purchasers have recovered
in full pursuant to Article 11.

Section 6.06. Intercompany Accounts. Other than as provided in Section 6.07
and except as set forth on Section 6.06 of the Disclosure Schedule, at or
prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to
cancel, discharge and settle as of the Closing all cash balances, intercompany
payables and receivables, indebtedness and other accounts between the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its other
Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the other hand
(the "Intercompany Accounts"), and shall ensure that none of the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall owe any Liability relating to the Intercompany Accounts
to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, or vice versa. Any Intercompany Accounts
not settled as of the Closing shall be treated as Indebtedness under this
Agreement.

Section 6.07. Termination of Intercompany Commitments. Except as contemplated
in (a) Section 6.06 of the Disclosure Schedule, (b) the Transition Services
Agreement, (c) the Transitional Trademark License Agreement, (d) this
Agreement and (e) the Ancillary Agreements, all of the agreements and
commitments (whether written or oral) between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, and all products
and services provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries will terminate as of the Closing without any further
action or liability on the part of the parties thereto. The provision of any
services by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from and after the Closing will be for the convenience, and at
the expense, of Purchasers only and will be furnished without any liability on
the part of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries with respect thereto; provided,
that the provision of any services in connection with any Ancillary Agreement
will be governed by the terms of such Ancillary Agreement.

Section 6.08. Transfer of Permits. Prior to the Closing, Seller will duly and
validly transfer or cause to be transferred to the Company without any
consideration all Permits, other than the Permits listed on Section 6.08 of
the Disclosure Schedule, that are held in the name of Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) on behalf of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and used in connection with the
Business, and the representations, covenants and agreements contained herein
shall apply to such Permits as if held by the Company on the Effective Date.

Section 6.09. Wrong Pockets. In the event that Seller or any of its Affiliates
receives any payments on behalf of the Business after the Closing, such
payments shall be the property of, and shall be forwarded and remitted to,
Purchasers or their designee as promptly as practicable, but no later than
twenty (20) days, after receipt thereof (or, if later, after notice or
determination of receipt of such improper payment). In the event that any
Purchaser or its Affiliates receives any payments on behalf of any business of
Seller or any of its Affiliates after the Closing, such payments shall be the
property of, and shall be forwarded and remitted to, Seller as promptly as
practicable, but not later than twenty (20) days, after receipt thereof (or,
if later, after notice or determination of receipt of such improper payment).

Section 6.10. Release of Guarantees. Seller and Purchasers agree to cooperate
and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain
the release of Seller or its



Affiliates that are a party to or otherwise have liability with respect to
(and to cause a Purchaser or its Subsidiaries to be substituted for Seller and
its Affiliates with respect to) any guarantees, performance bonds, bid bonds
and other similar agreements set forth on Section 6.10 of the Disclosure
Schedule, correct and complete copies of which have been made available to
Purchasers (the "Seller Guarantees") on or prior to the Effective Date, in
each case solely to the extent related to the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Seller and its Affiliates shall keep each Seller Guarantee in place and in
full force and effect until the date Purchasers' replacement arrangement is in
full force and effect and accepted by the relevant counterparty. In the event
any of the Seller Guarantees are not released prior to or at the Closing,
Purchasers will indemnify and hold Seller and its Affiliates that are a party
to or otherwise have liability with respect to each such Seller Guarantee
harmless for any and all payments required to be made under such Seller
Guarantee until such Seller Guarantee is released. The foregoing indemnity
will survive Closing indefinitely and will not be subject to the limitations
set forth in Article 11. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Section 6.10, neither Seller nor its Affiliates shall have any obligation
to keep any Seller Guarantee in place for any renewal, extension,
modification, supplement, amendment or rearrangement of the terms of any or
all of the obligations or liabilities relating to the Seller Guarantees.

Section 6.11. Enterprise Wide Contracts. Seller and Purchasers recognize and
acknowledge that the Enterprise-Wide Contracts set forth in Section 6.11(a) of
the Disclosure Schedule relate to both the Business and the business of Seller
to be retained by Seller after the Closing. Except as set forth on Section
6.11(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, all Enterprise-Wide Contracts shall be
retained by Seller. Following the Effective Date, except as set forth on
Section 6.11(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, Seller and Purchasers shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate a new Contract
for the benefit of Purchasers and their Affiliates as it relates to the
Business and with respect to the matters covered by such Enterprise-Wide
Contracts. The terms and conditions of any Contract or arrangement applicable
to the Business entered into pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall be reasonably
acceptable to Purchasers. In the event that Seller and Purchasers are not able
to obtain any such new Contract, then Seller shall cause the Transition
Services Agreement to include, as a service, for such time as is reasonably
necessary for the Company to obtain a new Contract covering such products and
services, which period shall be set forth in the Transition Services
Agreement, either (x) the products and services provided under such Contract
or (y) reasonable alternative arrangements which permit Purchasers to continue
operating the Business in substantially the same manner as currently
conducted.

ARTICLE 7 
TAX MATTERS

Section 7.01. General. In the event of any conflict between this Article 7 and
any other provision in this Agreement, the provisions of this Article 7 will
govern.

Section 7.02. Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns.

(a) Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns. Seller shall prepare or cause to be
prepared all income Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date (the "Seller Returns"). Subject
to



Section 7.02(b), Seller shall timely file or cause to be timely filed all
Seller Returns on or prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing
such Seller Returns and timely pay all Taxes due as reflected on such Seller
Returns. With respect to any Seller Return that is due after the Closing, is
filed on a separate company basis and that Seller is not permitted to file
under applicable Law (a "Seller Separate Return"), Purchasers will timely file
or cause to be timely filed such Seller Return as prepared by Seller. All
Seller Separate Returns will be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with
the past practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries unless otherwise
required by applicable Law. Seller shall pay to Purchasers, no later than five
(5) days prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing each Seller
Separate Return, an amount equal to the Taxes due as reflected on such Seller
Separate Return to the extent such Taxes are payable by Purchasers or their
Affiliates. Seller shall submit each such Seller Separate Returns to
Purchasers at least 20 days prior to the due date for the filing of such
Seller Separate Returns (taking into account any extensions). Purchasers will
have ten (10) days from receipt of each Seller Separate Returns to review and
comment on such Seller Separate Returns. If Purchasers reasonably dispute any
such Seller Separate Return and the Parties are unable to resolve such dispute
within five (5) days, such dispute shall be settled by the Accounting Firm in
accordance with the procedures of Section 1.04.

(b) Other Tax Returns. With respect to any Tax Return of (or that includes)
the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than a Seller Return) that relates to
Taxes for taxable periods beginning before the Closing Date (the "Purchaser
Returns"), Purchasers shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared
and timely filed, such Purchaser Returns. Seller shall, as soon as practicable
after the end of the relevant Tax period, provide to Purchasers such
information, work papers and supporting information reasonably determined by
Seller to be necessary for Purchasers to prepare such Purchaser Returns. All
such Purchaser Returns will be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with
the past practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries unless otherwise
required by applicable Law. Seller shall pay to Purchasers, no later than five
(5) days prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing each
Purchaser Return, an amount equal to the Taxes due as reflected on such
Purchaser Return, to the extent such Taxes arise in or are incurred with
respect to a Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing
Date (as determined in accordance with Section 7.07). Purchasers shall submit
each such Purchaser Returns to Seller at least 20 days prior to the due date
for the filing of such Purchaser Returns (taking into account any extensions).
Seller will have ten (10) days from receipt of each Purchaser Return to review
and comment on such Purchaser Return. If Seller reasonably disputes any such
Purchaser Return and the Parties are unable to resolve such dispute within
five (5) days, such dispute shall be settled by the Accounting Firm in
accordance with the procedures of Section 1.04.

(c) Transaction Tax Deductions. With respect to the preparation of Tax
Returns, Purchasers and Seller agree to allocate all Transaction Tax
Deductions on the consolidated U.S. federal income Tax Return of Seller, and,
as applicable and permitted, state and local income Tax Returns, for the
taxable period or portion thereof ending on the Closing Date, to the extent
permitted under applicable Law. For avoidance of doubt, Purchasers and Seller
agree that any payments or expenses generating Transaction Tax



Deductions are not, and will not be treated as, subject to the "next day rule"
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(ii)(B).

Section 7.03. Tax Refunds; Carryforwards.

(a) Seller will be entitled to any Tax refunds or credits that are received by
Purchasers or the Company or its Subsidiaries attributable to Taxes paid by
either Seller or the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period and Purchasers shall pay to Seller any such refund or the
amount of any such credit within five (5) days after actual receipt of such
refund or credit against Taxes, net of (i) any increased Tax liability of
Purchasers or their Affiliates (including, for periods after the Closing, the
Company or its Subsidiaries) by reason of receipt of such amounts and (ii) any
expenses incurred in obtaining such amounts, in each case, except to the
extent any such Tax refund or credit was included in the calculation of Net
Working Capital; provided, that Purchasers shall be entitled to reduce such
payment by any amount otherwise owed by Seller to Purchasers pursuant to this
Article 7 or Section 11.02(a)(iii) (and the amount of such reduction shall be
treated for purposes of this Section 7.03(a) as having been paid to Seller).
After the Closing, at the sole expense of Seller, Purchasers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
continue to work in good faith and prosecute any Tax refund claims in order to
legally obtain any such Tax refunds or credits.

(b) Purchasers shall pay Seller the amount of any reduction in Tax payments
that would otherwise be made in the first three (3) Tax periods ending after
the Closing Date by Purchasers, the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Affiliates that is attributable to any net operating or
capital loss or credit carryforwards of the Company or its Subsidiaries for
periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date,
calculated by comparing Taxes that would have been payable without any such
carryforwards and Taxes actually payable taking into account such
carryforwards. Purchasers shall, no later than ninety (90) days following the
end of each such Tax period, provide to Seller a written confirmation (i) of
the amount of such reduction in Tax payments realized or (ii) that no such
reduction was realized, in each case together with supporting documentation.
Purchasers shall pay to Seller any such reduction in Taxes within five (5)
days of the realization by Purchasers, the Company or their Affiliates of such
reduction in Tax payments.

(c) If any amount paid to Seller pursuant to this Section 7.03 shall
subsequently be challenged successfully by any Governmental Authority, Seller
shall repay to Purchasers or the Company such amount (together with any
interest and penalties assessed by such Governmental Authority in respect of
such amount).

Section 7.04. Books and Records; Cooperation. Purchasers and Seller shall, and
shall each cause its Representatives to, at the expense of the Party making
such request and in a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the
conduct of the business of the Parties, 
(a) provide the other Party and its Representatives with such assistance as
may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation of any Tax
Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or any audit or other examination by
any Taxing Authority or judicial or administrative



proceeding relating to Taxes with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries
or the computation or verification of amounts under this Article 7, (b) retain
and provide the other Party and its Representatives with reasonable access to
all records or information that are relevant to any Tax Return for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or audit, examination or proceeding, and (c) make employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided pursuant to this Section 7.04; provided,
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither Seller nor any
of its Affiliates will be required to provide or make available Tax Returns
for the consolidated group of which Seller is the common parent corporation or
other information relating to Seller's taxes that it regards as privileged or
confidential.

Section 7.05. Transfer Taxes. All Transfer Taxes that are incurred as a result
of the Acquisition will be paid fifty percent (50%) by Purchasers and fifty
percent (50%) by Seller. The Parties agree to cooperate in the filing of any
Tax Returns with respect to the Transfer Taxes, including promptly supplying
any information in its possession that is reasonably necessary to complete
such Tax Returns.

Section 7.06. Section 336(e) Election.

(a) Seller and the Company shall join with Purchasers in making an election
pursuant to Section 336(e) of the Code and any corresponding or similar
elections under applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law (collectively, the
"Section 336(e) Election") with respect to the purchase and sale of the Shares
of the Company and its Subsidiaries hereunder. Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, Purchasers shall prepare and file all forms and documents
required in connection with the Section 336(e) Election. Seller, at the
instruction of Purchasers, shall take (and shall cause the Company to take)
all actions reasonably necessary to facilitate the Section 336(e) Election,
including to promptly execute (or cause to be executed) and deliver to
Purchasers, and file such documents or forms provided by Purchasers to
complete the Section 336(e) Election and an agreement pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.336-2(h) to make the Section 336(e) Election (the
"Section 336(e) Election Forms").

(b) No later than sixty (60) days following the final determination of the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.04, Purchasers shall provide Seller with
an allocation of the Purchase Price, liabilities and other relevant items
among the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Draft Allocation").
Seller shall have the right to object to the Draft Allocation only on the
basis that the Draft Allocation is unreasonable. If Seller so objects within
forty five (45) days of receipt thereof, Seller and Purchasers shall cooperate
in good faith to resolve such objections and to revise the Draft Allocation to
reflect their agreement, or, if the Parties cannot reach an agreement within
ten (10) days after Seller's objection, any disputes shall be resolved by the
Accounting Firm on a basis consistent with the procedures of Section 1.04
(such allocation, as finally determined by Seller and Purchasers or the
Accounting Firm, as applicable, the "Final Allocation").

(c) Seller and Purchasers shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to) report,
act, and file all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8883) in a manner consistent
with the



Section 336(e) Election and the Final Allocation (appropriately taking into
any subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price) and shall not take any
position (whether in audits, Tax Returns, or otherwise) that is inconsistent
with the foregoing, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

Section 7.07. Straddle Period Allocation. The Acquisition will be structured
so that, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, the taxable period of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall end on the Closing Date. In
addition, to the extent permitted by Law, the taxable period of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for all other Tax purposes shall end on the Closing Date.
To the extent it is necessary for purposes of this Agreement to determine the
allocation of Taxes during a Straddle Period, (i) any Taxes of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period that are imposed on a periodic basis
(such as real, personal and intangible property Taxes) will be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period and (ii) the amount of any other Taxes will be determined
based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or
other pass-through entity in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
holds a beneficial interest will be deemed to terminate at such time);
provided, that any Taxes attributable to the Section 336(e) Election shall be
allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date.

Section 7.08. Amendment of Tax Returns. Without the prior written consent of
Seller, Purchasers will not (a) except for Tax Returns that are filed pursuant
to Section 7.02, file or amend or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to file or amend any Tax Return relating to a taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (b) with respect to
Tax Returns filed pursuant to Section 7.02, after the date such Tax Returns
are filed pursuant to Section 7.02, amend or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to amend any such Tax Return, or (c) extend, waive, cause to be
extended or waived or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to extend
or waive any statute of limitations or other period for the assessment of any
Tax or deficiency related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case, unless
required by applicable Law or to the extent such action would not give rise to
a Tax liability for which Seller is liable.

ARTICLE 8

EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Section 8.01. Purchaser Benefit Plans; Assumption of Liabilities.

(a) From the Closing through the first anniversary thereof, except as may be
required by applicable Law, Purchasers and their Subsidiaries shall provide
each Employee with (i) a salary or base wage and cash bonus opportunities that
are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those provided to such Employee
by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing, (ii)
employee benefits (excluding deferred compensation benefits, equity and long-
term incentives, defined benefit pensions and post-employment welfare
benefits) that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those provided to
such Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries



immediately prior to the Closing and (iii) severance benefits that are no less
favorable than those provided under the Employee Plans specified in Section
8.01(a)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule covering such Employee immediately prior
to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, the aggregate severance benefits (including the employer portion of
any payroll Taxes) that become payable to any Employee pursuant to Article IV
of the Company Senior Management Change in Control Severance Plan or pursuant
to any agreement entered into with the Employee set forth on Section
8.01(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule on or before the Closing Date shall be
allocated between Seller and Purchasers as set forth on Section 8.01(a)(iii)
of the Disclosure Schedule (the Seller portion of such amount, the "Seller
Severance Payable"). Should an event giving rise to such a severance benefit
occur on or before the first anniversary of the Closing Date (whether or not
such severance benefit is due to be paid on or before the first anniversary of
the Closing Date), Seller shall promptly (and, in any event within five (5)
Business Days) following receipt of written notice from Purchasers thereof
reimburse Purchasers for the applicable Seller Severance Payable (provided,
however, that the Parties acknowledge and agree, and shall take all actions
necessary to ensure, that the only Employees eligible for severance benefits
pursuant to the Company Senior Management Change in Control Severance Plan are
those Employees set forth on Section 8.01(a)(iii) of the Disclosure Schedule
and the amount, and terms and conditions, of such severance benefit are as set
forth on Section 8.01(a)(iii) of the Disclosure Schedule). On or prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall offer (x) each of the Employees set forth on
Section 8.01(a)(iii) of the Disclosure Schedule a Participation Agreement (as
defined in the Company Senior Management Change in Control Severance Plan) and
(y) the Employee set forth on Section 8.01(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule
an agreement in a form satisfactory to Purchasers, in each case, that contains
the severance benefits and terms and conditions as set forth on Section
8.01(a)(iii) of the Disclosure Schedule.

(b) Purchasers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all plans
and programs of Purchasers and their Subsidiaries to recognize all service of
the Employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries or any of its predecessors
and Affiliates to the same extent and for the same purposes thereunder as such
service was recognized under similar benefit plans of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or any of its predecessors and Affiliates for all purposes and as
such service recognition is further described on Section 8.01(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule (except that, with respect to benefit accrual, such
service will not be recognized to the extent that it would result in a
duplication of benefits and will not be recognized for purposes of benefit
accrual under any defined benefit plan or post-employment welfare benefit
plan). Purchasers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that
any welfare benefit plan of Purchasers and their Subsidiaries within the
meaning of section 3(1) of ERISA (each, a "Purchaser Welfare Plan") will not
include with respect to any Employee any restrictions or limitations with
respect to pre-existing condition exclusions or any actively-at-work
requirements (except to the extent such restrictions or limitations were
applicable as of the Closing under any Employee Plans that are welfare benefit
plans within the meaning of section 3(1) of ERISA (each, a "Seller Welfare
Plan")). Purchasers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that
any eligible expenses incurred by any Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of such



Seller Welfare Plan ending on the date such Employee's participation in such
Purchaser Welfare Plan begins will be taken into account under the Purchaser
Welfare Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such Purchaser Welfare Plan.

(c) From and after the Closing Date, subject to the terms of the Transition
Services Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall cease to be
participating employers in the Seller Plans, and Purchasers shall cause the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries to assume or retain, as applicable, and
honor, in accordance with their terms, the Assumed Plans and to perform and
satisfy all Liabilities thereunder, regardless of whether such Liabilities
arise before, on or after the Closing Date. Without limiting the foregoing,
Purchasers shall cause the Company or one of its Subsidiaries to retain and
honor, in accordance with its terms, the Company Plans set forth on Section
8.01(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, and to perform and satisfy all Liabilities
thereunder, regardless of whether such Liabilities arise before, on or after
the Closing Date, for a period of at least one (1) year following the Closing
Date. Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller will take all actions
necessary to transfer, or cause to be transferred, to the Company or one of
its Subsidiaries (as directed by Purchasers) all of the rights and obligations
(to the extent not already held by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries as
of the Closing) of the Assumed Plans. "Assumed Plans" means (i) each Company
Plan specifically identified as such on Section 8.01(c) of the Disclosure
Schedule and (ii) each Seller Plan that Purchasers explicitly agree to assume
as set forth on Section 8.01(c) of the Disclosure Schedule.

(d) Coverage for all Employees and Former Employees and their respective
spouses and dependents under the Seller Welfare Plans will cease to be
effective immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, that the Seller
Welfare Plans shall remain solely responsible for (and Seller shall take any
and all actions necessary to cause the Seller Welfare Plans to continue to be
responsible for) all disability and other welfare benefits for any Employee or
Former Employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who is eligible to receive
short- or long-term disability benefits immediately prior to the Closing Date.
Purchasers shall extend offers of employment to all Former Employees who
return from short-term disability within six (6) months following the Closing
Date. Seller and the Seller Welfare Plans will be responsible for all claims
incurred under the Seller Welfare Plans prior to the Closing Date with respect
to Employees, Former Employees and their respective spouses and dependents.
Purchaser Welfare Plans will cover all Employees and Former Employees and
their respective spouses and dependents on and after the Closing Date other
than as otherwise provided in this Section 8.01(d). Purchasers and Purchaser
Welfare Plans will be responsible for all claims incurred by all Employees and
Former Employees and their respective spouses and dependents under the
Purchaser Welfare Plans on and after the Closing Date. A claim will be deemed
"incurred" on the date that the event that gives rise to the claim occurs (for
purposes of life insurance, sickness, accident and disability programs) or on
the date that treatment or services are provided (for purposes of healthcare
programs).



(e) The Employees shall, as of or as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date, become eligible to participate in one or more U.S. tax-qualified
defined contribution retirement plans with a cash or deferred arrangement
under Section 401(k) of the Code sponsored by Purchasers or one of their
Subsidiaries (collectively, "Purchasers' 401(k) Plan"). Prior to the Closing
Date, Seller shall or shall cause its Affiliates to make the matching, profit
sharing, and any other employer contributions to the applicable U.S. tax-
qualified defined contribution retirement plans sponsored by Seller or its
Affiliates (collectively, "Seller's 401(k) Plans") on behalf of the Employees
that would have been made irrespective of any end-of-year service requirements
otherwise applicable to such contributions, prorated for the portion of the
plan year ending on the Closing Date. As of the Closing Date, Seller shall
fully vest the applicable Employees in their account balances under the
applicable Seller's 401(k) Plans. Seller shall cause Seller's 401(k) Plans to
distribute, and Purchasers shall cause Purchasers' 401(k) Plan to accept
rollovers of, the account balances of such Employees (including, to the extent
permitted by the service provider of Purchasers' 401(k) Plan, the direct in-
kind rollover of participant loan promissory notes, subject to the following
sentence) from Seller's 401(k) Plans. With respect to the direct in-kind
rollover of participant loans, Seller and Purchasers shall reasonably
cooperate to take such commercially feasible actions as are reasonably
necessary to permit Employees with outstanding participant loans under
Seller's 401(k) Plans as of the Closing Date and who timely elect to directly
roll over such loans to Purchasers' 401(k) Plan to continue to make scheduled
loan payments to Seller's 401(k) Plans after the Closing Date so that such
loans will not default pending such rollover, and, if loan rollovers are
permitted by the service provider of Purchasers' 401(k) Plan, Seller and
Purchasers will accommodate the loan rollover process for loans which, as of
the date of the rollover, are not in default; provided, however, that any such
rollover shall be subject to such administrative rules and procedures as may
be mutually agreeable, the terms of the plans and receipt of a timely
participant election.

(f) Purchasers shall credit each Employee with the unused vacation, sick leave
or personal days to which the Employee is entitled through the Closing Date to
the extent reflected in Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined in
accordance with Section 1.04, except that if Seller is required by applicable
Law to pay any Employee the cash value of his or her unused vacation, sick
leave or personal days described in this Section 8.01(f), then Seller shall
pay such amount and Purchasers will not be required to honor such vacation,
sick leave or personal days.

(g) To the extent Employees participate in a dependent care or medical expense
reimbursement account under an Employee Plan ("Seller's FSA") during the
calendar year that includes the Closing, Purchasers shall establish one or
more comparable plans ("Purchasers' FSA") that will recognize the elections
that such Employees had in effect for purposes of the plan year in which the
Closing occurs under Seller's FSA. Purchasers' FSA will (i) assume the
obligations of Seller's FSA with respect to Employees as of the Closing Date
and (ii) provide the same level of dependent care and medical expense
reimbursement account benefits as those provided under Seller's FSA at least
through the end of the plan year in effect as of the Closing. As soon as
practicable after the Closing, Seller shall transfer to Purchasers in cash an



amount equal to the total amount that Employees have contributed to Seller's
FSA through the Closing Date for the calendar year that includes the Closing
less all amounts that have been paid from Seller's FSA through the Closing
Date for medical expense and dependent care claims incurred by the Employees
in the calendar year that includes the Closing (such difference, the "Flex
Plan Amount"). If the Flex Plan Amount is less than $0, as soon as practicable
after the Closing, Purchasers shall transfer to Seller, in cash, an amount
equal to all amounts that have been paid from Seller's FSA through the Closing
Date for medical expense and dependent care claims incurred by the Employees
in the calendar year that includes the Closing less the total amount that
Employees have contributed to Seller's FSA through the Closing Date for the
calendar year that includes the Closing. After the Closing Date, Purchasers'
FSA will be responsible for reimbursement of all previously unreimbursed
reimbursable medical and/or dependent care claims incurred by Employees,
regardless of when the claims were incurred.

(h) Purchasers will have the sole responsibility for "continuation coverage"
benefits provided after the Closing for all Employees and "qualified
beneficiaries" of Employees for whom a "qualifying event" occurs after the
Closing (including all qualifying events that occur in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions). The terms "continuation coverage,"
"qualified beneficiaries" and "qualifying event" will have the meanings
ascribed to them under section 4980B of the Code and sections 601-608 of
ERISA.

(i) Seller will retain the obligation and Liability for any workers'
compensation, occupational disease or illness, or similar workers' protection
claims with respect to each Employee and Former Employee for injuries that
occur prior to the Closing Date. Purchasers will be responsible for any
obligation and Liability for workers' compensation, occupational disease or
illness, or similar workers' protection claims with respect to each Employee
for injuries that occur on or after the Closing Date, which will include
claims with respect to injuries sustained by Employees on or after the Closing
Date that are aggravations or re-injuries of injuries or illnesses that were
sustained prior to the Closing Date.

Section 8.02. Labor Relations. It is expressly agreed and understood that
neither Purchasers nor Seller has any right, power or authority to control,
direct or regulate the labor relations and human resources policies and
procedures of the other Party, that neither Party is deemed to constitute the
agent or representative of the other Party, and that neither Party is liable
in any manner whatsoever for the acts or omissions of the other Party or the
other Party's agents, representatives or employees.

Section 8.03. No Right of Employment; Third Party Beneficiary. Nothing herein
expressed or implied will (a) create any third-party beneficiary or other
rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) of Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or any other Person other than the Parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, (b) constitute or create an
employment agreement or (c) constitute or be deemed to constitute an amendment
to any employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Seller, the Company,
the Company's Subsidiaries, Purchasers or any of their



Affiliates. Nothing herein shall impact the rights of Purchasers, the Company
and its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Employee after the
Closing.

Section 8.04. WARN Act. For the ninety-one (91)-day (inclusive) period
immediately following the Closing Date, Purchasers will not, and will cause
any successor or permitted assign of any portion of the Business not to, cause
or permit to be implemented any plant closing, mass layoff or other
termination (whether actual or constructive) of Employees which, either alone
or in the aggregate (with each other or any plant closing, partial closing,
mass layoff or other termination of Employees occurring on or prior to the
Closing Date), would reasonably be expected to create any Liability for Seller
or any Affiliate of Seller under the WARN Act or similar applicable Law.

Section 8.05. Acceleration of Equity Awards. Prior to the Closing Date,
conditioned upon the Closing, Seller shall cause all outstanding stock options
or other equity equivalents or equity-based awards or rights issued to
Employees by Seller to accelerate, vest and become fully payable or
exercisable.

Section 8.06. Replacement Employee Plans. Prior to the Closing Date,
conditioned upon the Closing and effective as of the Closing Date, Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all of the Seller Plans
specified on Section 8.06 of the Disclosure Schedule to be replaced with plans
sponsored by the Company or its Subsidiaries that include substantially-
identical terms as contained in the corresponding Seller Plans as of the
Effective Date. All documents to be entered into in connection herewith shall
be provided to Purchasers for their review and comment, and all actions
hereunder shall be subject to the written consent of Purchasers (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

earlier date), and (B) the other representations and warranties of Purchasers
contained in this Agreement and in any certificate or other writing delivered
by Purchasers pursuant hereto will be true and correct both when made and at
and as of the Closing Date as if made at and as of such date (except to the
extent that any such representation or warranty speaks as of an earlier date,
in which case it must be correct only as of such earlier date), except where
the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct has

consummate the Acquisition as required by the provisions of this Agreement,
including Section 6.01.

ARTICLE 10

TERMINATION

Section 10.01. Grounds for Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing Date:

(a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Purchasers;

(b) (i) by Seller, if any of the conditions set forth in Section 9.01 or
Section 9.03 shall have become incapable of fulfillment on or prior to the
date that is one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Date (the
"Termination Date") or (ii) by Purchasers, if any of the conditions set forth
in Section 9.01 or Section 9.02 shall have become incapable of fulfillment on
or prior to the Termination Date, except that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01(b) will not be available to the Party
seeking to terminate if any action of such Party or the failure of such Party
to timely perform any of its obligations under this Agreement has been the
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to
the Termination Date and such action or failure to perform constitutes a
breach of this Agreement;

(c) by Seller, if Seller is not then in material breach of any term of this
Agreement, upon written notice to Purchasers if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Purchasers
contained in this Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section
9.03(a) would not be satisfied, and which breach has not been cured prior to
the earlier of (i) fifteen (15) Business Days following notice of such breach
and (ii) the Termination Date;

(d) by Purchasers, if Purchasers are not then in material breach of any term
of this Agreement, upon written notice to Seller if there has been a breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Seller
contained in this Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section
9.02(a) would not be satisfied, and which breach has not been cured prior to
the earlier of (i) fifteen (15) Business Days following notice of such breach
and (ii) the Termination Date; or

(e) by Seller if (i) each of the conditions set forth in Section 9.01 and
Section 9.02 has been satisfied or waived on or prior to the date that the
Closing should have been consummated in accordance with Section 1.03(a) (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing
and which were, as of such date, capable of being satisfied), (ii) Seller has
confirmed by written notice delivered to Purchasers to the effect that (x)
Seller stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Transactions on the
date that the Closing should have been consummated in accordance with Section
1.03(a) and (y) all conditions set forth in Section 9.03 have been satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing and which were, as of such date, capable of being satisfied) or that
Seller has irrevocably



waived any unsatisfied conditions in Section 9.03, and (iii) Purchasers shall
have failed to consummate the Closing on or prior to the date the Closing is
required to have occurred in breach of Section 1.03(a) (provided, that Seller
is prepared and able to consummate the Closing as of such date, including by
satisfying those conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing).

The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Sections 10.01(b),
10.01(c), 10.01(d) or 10.01(e) shall give written notice of such termination
and the basis therefor to the other Party.

Section 10.02. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated as
permitted by Section 10.01, except as provided in Section 10.03, such
termination will be without liability of any Party (or any equity holder,
member, manager, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or
representative of any Party) to any other Party, except that nothing in this
Section 10.02 will relieve any Party from liability for any willful and
material breach of this Agreement prior to such termination. The provisions of
Sections 5.01 (Confidentiality), 6.02 (Public Announcements), 10.02 (Effect of
Termination), 10.03 (Termination Fee) and Article 12 (Miscellaneous) will
survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01. No
termination of this Agreement will affect the obligations of the Parties to
the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations will survive the
termination of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of
termination of this Agreement, the Financing Source Parties will have no
liability to Seller, the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of its
or their respective Affiliates hereunder or under the Debt Financing
Commitments or otherwise relating to or arising out of the transactions
contemplated by such agreements; provided, that the foregoing shall not
preclude any liability of the Financing Sources to Purchasers under and
subject to the express terms of the Debt Financing Commitments (and the
related fee letters) or the Debt Financing.

Section 10.03. Termination Fee.

(a) If this Agreement is validly terminated by Seller pursuant to Section
10.01(e) (the "Termination Event"), then Purchasers, jointly and severally,
shall promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the
date of such termination pay or cause to be paid to Seller a fee equal to
$35,000,000 (the "Termination Fee"); provided, that Purchasers shall be
entitled to proceed with the Closing no later than ten (10) Business Days
after such termination, in which case Purchasers shall have no obligation or
liability to pay the Termination Fee whatsoever, and this Agreement shall no
longer be terminated.

(b) Except for Purchasers and the Investors (but only to the extent set forth
in the Limited Guaranty), no other Person, including any Affiliate of a
Purchaser or any Financing Source Party, shall have any liability for any
obligation or liability to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Seller, or
any of their respective Affiliates or any of their respective direct or
indirect equity holders for a claim for any loss suffered as a result of any
breach of this Agreement, any financing commitment or the Limited Guaranty, or
the failure of the Transactions to be consummated, or in respect of any oral
representation made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.



(c) The Parties further acknowledge and agree that any amount payable pursuant
to Section 10.03(a) does not constitute a penalty but shall constitute
liquidated damages to compensate Seller. Upon payment of the Termination Fee,
none of Purchasers, the Investors or any Financing Source Party or any of
their respective Affiliates shall have any liability or obligation to the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates
or direct or indirect equity holders whatsoever (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, payment of the Termination Fee to Seller shall be the
Company's, the Company's Subsidiaries', Seller's, their respective Affiliates'
and their respective direct and indirect equity holders' sole and exclusive
remedy against Purchasers or any lender participating in the Debt Financing
and their respective Affiliates as a result of and following a Termination
Event (except as provided in Section 10.03(c)(i)), and under no circumstances
shall:

(i) Seller, the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any of their
respective Affiliates or direct or indirect equity holders be entitled to any
non-monetary or other relief against Purchasers, the Investors or any
Financing Source Party or any of their respective Affiliates (whether at law,
in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise), unless Seller elects specific
performance under Section 12.07 to the extent available (in which case, if
Seller elects specific performance, such specific performance pursuant to
Section 12.07 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy against Purchasers and
their Affiliates (other than as a third party beneficiary of Purchasers' right
to seek specific performance against the Investors as expressly permitted by
the applicable Equity Financing Commitments) or direct or indirect equity
holders and neither Seller nor any other Person shall have any right to, or
any right to demand payment of, the Termination Fee or any other amount
whatsoever); or

(ii) Purchasers be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

ARTICLE 11

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

Section 11.01. Survival.

(a) The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall not
survive the Closing Date; provided, however, that (i) the Fundamental
Representations shall survive until the date that is three (3) years following
the Closing Date and (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 2.07 shall survive until sixty (60) days following the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations. The covenants and agreements contained
in the Agreement (I) which by their terms are to be performed after the
Closing shall survive the Closing in accordance with their terms and (II)
which by their terms are to be performed prior to the Closing shall survive
the Closing for one (1) year following the Closing; provided, however, that
Section 11.02(a)(iii) shall survive until the date that is 60 days following
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (taking into account
any extensions thereof).



(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties (i) intend the foregoing sentences
of this Section 11.01 and all other time limitations in this Agreement to
operate as a contractual statute of limitations and to shorten, replace and
supersede any statute of limitations that may otherwise be applicable to
claims for breaches of representations or warranties or covenants and (ii)
acknowledge and agree that such shortening, replacement and supersession of
any such statute of limitations by such contractual statute of limitations are
reasonable and appropriate.

Section 11.02. Indemnification of Purchasers by Seller.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Seller shall indemnify, save and hold
harmless Purchasers and its officers, directors and Affiliates (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries) and their respective Representatives, successors
and assigns (collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties") from and
against any Covered Losses suffered by any such Purchaser Indemnified Parties
resulting from or arising out of: (i) any breach of, misrepresentation of, or
inaccuracy in (A) any Fundamental Representation of Seller in this Agreement
or (B) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.07; (ii) any
nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement made by Seller in this
Agreement; (iii) any Pre-Closing Taxes, other than Taxes included in the
calculation of Closing Indebtedness, Closing Transaction Expenses or Closing
Net Working Capital (each, as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.04); or
(iv) the matters set forth on Section 11.02(a)(iv) of the Disclosure Schedule.

(b) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties will not be entitled to assert any
indemnification pursuant to Section 11.02(a) after the expiration of the
applicable survival period referenced in Section 11.01, except that if, on or
prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period, Purchasers have
given Seller a notice of claim in accordance with Section 11.04 for such
indemnification, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties will continue to have the
right to be indemnified with respect to such indemnification claim until such
claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided
in this Article 11.

(c) Any indemnification of a Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Section 11.02 will be effected by wire transfer or transfers of immediately
available funds from Seller to an account or accounts designated in writing by
the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party to Seller within fifteen (15) days
after the final determination thereof.

Section 11.03. Indemnification of Seller by Purchasers.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Purchasers shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify and save and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and their
respective officers and directors and their respective Representatives,
successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties," and
together with the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, the "Indemnified Parties")
from and against any Covered Losses suffered by any such Seller Indemnified
Parties resulting from or arising out of: (i) any breach of, misrepresentation
of, or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Purchasers in



this Agreement; or (ii) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or
agreement made by Purchasers in this Agreement.

(b) The Seller Indemnified Parties will not be entitled to assert any
indemnification pursuant to Section 11.03(a) after the expiration of the
applicable survival period referenced in Section 11.01, except that if, on or
prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period, Seller has given
Purchasers a notice of claim in accordance with Section 11.04 for such
indemnification, the Seller Indemnified Parties will continue to have the
right to be indemnified with respect to such indemnification claim until such
claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided
in this Article 11.

(c) Any indemnification of a Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section
11.03 will be effected by wire transfer or transfers of immediately available
funds from Purchasers to an account or accounts designated by the applicable
Seller Indemnified Party to Purchasers within fifteen (15) days after the
final determination thereof.

Section 11.04. Procedures Relating to Indemnification.

(a) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Article 11 in respect of, arising out of or involving
a claim or demand made by any Person (other than a Party or Affiliate thereof)
against the Indemnified Party (each, a "Third-Party Claim"), such Indemnified
Party must notify the indemnifying Party in writing, and in reasonable detail,
of the Third-Party Claim as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt
by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third-Party Claim, except
that failure to give such notification will not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying Party will have been
actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. The
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the indemnifying Party, within five (5)
Business Days after the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the indemnified
party relating to the Third-Party Claim.

(b) If a Third-Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof (and
to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the Indemnified Party's
counsel) and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense of any such claim that
exclusively involves civil monetary damages thereof with counsel selected by
the indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense of (i) any Third-Party Claim for equitable or injunctive
relief, (ii) any Third-Party Claim that would impose criminal liability or
criminal damages or (iii) any Third-Party Claim that involves any material
customer, material supplier or material distributor of the Indemnified Party,
and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, at the expense of
the indemnifying Party, any such Third-Party Claim. Should the indemnifying
Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim in accordance with
this Section 11.04, the



indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof, unless the Third-Party Claim involves potential conflicts of
interest between the Indemnified Party and the indemnifying Party. If the
indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party will have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense (except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence), separate
from the counsel employed by the indemnifying Party, it being understood that
the indemnifying Party will control such defense. To the extent the Third-
Party Claim is a claim that the indemnifying Party is ultimately responsible
for under this Article 11, the indemnifying Party will be liable for the fees
and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period
during which the indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof. If
the indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third-Party Claim, all the
Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such
cooperation will include the retention and (upon the indemnifying Party's
request) the provision to the indemnifying Party of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and the use of
commercially reasonable efforts to make employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Whether or not the indemnifying Party has assumed
the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-
Party Claim without the indemnifying Party's prior written consent (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld). The indemnifying Party may pay,
settle or compromise a Third-Party Claim without the written consent of the
Indemnified Party, so long as such settlement (A) includes (i) an
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect
of such Third-Party Claim, (ii) does not subject the Indemnified Party to any
injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, (iii) does not include a
statement or admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf
of any Indemnified Party and (B) only provides for the payment of monetary
damages for which the Indemnified Party will receive indemnification under
this Article 11.

(c) If any Indemnified Party desires to assert any claim for indemnification
provided for under this Article 11 other than a claim in respect of, arising
out of or involving a Third-Party Claim, such Indemnified Party shall notify
the indemnifying Party in writing, and in reasonable detail (taking into
account the information then available to such Indemnified Party), of such
claim promptly after becoming aware of the existence of such claim, except
that the failure of an Indemnified Party to notify the indemnifying Party will
relieve the indemnifying Party from its obligation to indemnify only to the
extent that the indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure.

Section 11.05. Limitations on Indemnification; RandW Insurance Policy.

(a) In no event will the aggregate indemnification to be paid by Seller
pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(i)(A) exceed five percent (5%) of the Purchase
Price. In no



event will the aggregate indemnification to be paid by Purchasers pursuant to
Section 11.03(a)(i) exceed five percent (5%) of the Purchase Price.

(b) Notwithstanding the fact that any Indemnified Party may have the right to
assert claims for indemnification under or in respect of more than one
provision of this Agreement in respect of any fact, event, condition or
circumstance, no Indemnified Party will be entitled to recover the amount of
any Covered Losses suffered by such Indemnified Party more than once,
regardless of whether such Covered Losses may be as a result of a breach of
more than one representation, warranty or covenant.

(c) If the Transactions are consummated, Purchasers expressly reserve the
right to seek indemnity or other remedy pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and such rights shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of
any investigation by, disclosure to, knowledge or imputed Knowledge of
Purchasers or any of their Representatives in respect of any fact or
circumstance that reveals the occurrence of any such breach, whether before or
after the execution and delivery hereof. In furtherance of the foregoing,
Seller agrees that as knowledge or lack of reliance shall not be a defense in
law or equity to any claim of breach of representation, warranty or covenant
by Seller pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Seller shall not in any
proceeding concerning a breach or alleged breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant herein, or any indemnity thereof, pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, seek information concerning knowledge or reliance of
Purchasers or any of their Representatives, through deposition, discovery or
otherwise or seek to introduce evidence or argument in any proceeding
regarding the knowledge or lack of reliance of Purchasers or any of their
Representatives prior to the Closing on or with respect to any such
representations, warranties or covenants.

(d) For purposes of determining whether any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any
representation or warranty in this Agreement has occurred for purposes of
Article 11 hereof, and for the purposes of determining the amount of any
Covered Losses (and for the avoidance of doubt, not for any other purposes
under this Agreement), any and all exceptions, limitations, restrictions,
modifications, qualifications and exclusions contained in such representations
and warranties that are based or conditioned on or refer to the terms
"Material Adverse Effect," "material" and/or "materially" (including when
"material" and "materially" are used as adjectives and/or adverbs) shall be
disregarded.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be
entitled to indemnification by Seller hereunder resulting from or arising out
of any breach of, misrepresentation of, or inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty of Seller hereunder except for the Fundamental Representations and
the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.07. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that other than with respect to fraud, Purchasers
shall first seek to recover Covered Losses from the RandW Insurance Policy, to
the extent that recovery therefrom is available, with respect to any
indemnification claim under Sections 11.02(a)(i) and 11.02(a)(iii), before
seeking to recover any Covered Losses directly from Seller.



(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for the
avoidance of doubt, the limitations, if any, on Purchasers' right to recover
under the RandW Insurance Policy shall be solely as set forth therein and
nothing in this Agreement shall impact Purchasers' right to recover under the
RandW Insurance Policy.

Section 11.06. Exclusive Remedy. This Article 11 (in addition to any rights of
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to recover under the RandW Insurance Policy),
will be the exclusive remedy of the Parties following the Closing for any and
all losses, Liabilities, claims, fines, deficiencies, damages, obligations or
payments arising out of or relating to any misrepresentation or breach of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties contained
herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, except
for (a) actions for specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable
relief pursuant to Section 12.07 and (b) claims for actual fraud, in any which
case the Parties will have all rights and remedies available under this
Agreement and available under any Law. In furtherance of the foregoing, other
than as set forth in this Section 11.06, following the Closing, each of the
Parties hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may have against the other
Parties under this Agreement, arising under or based upon any Law, other than
the right to seek indemnity pursuant to this Article 11.

Section 11.07. Purchase Price Adjustment. All amounts paid under this Article
11 (including any payment received by Purchasers under the RandW Insurance
Policy) will, to the extent permitted by Law, be treated as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment, modification or supplement to the
provisions of which the Financing Sources are expressly made third party
beneficiaries pursuant to Section 12.10 shall be permitted in a manner adverse
to any Financing Source without the prior written consent of such Financing
Source. No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or

the Party incurring such cost or expense.

event of any merger, acquisition, consolidation or restructuring of Seller or
a sale of all or substantially all of its assets and (ii) Purchasers may
collaterally assign their rights under this Agreement to the Debt Financing
Sources as collateral security.

Section 12.06. Governing Law. This Agreement will be construed in accordance
with, and governed in all respects by, the internal Laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of law or choice of law
provisions thereof.

Section 12.07. Specific Performance; Jurisdiction.

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that, subject to Section 12.07(b), the Parties will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case without
the necessity of proving the inadequacy of monetary damages as a remedy and
without the requirement to post bond or other security, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which such Party is entitled at law or in equity.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, it
is explicitly agreed that the right of Seller to specific performance to cause
Purchasers to



draw down the Equity Financing, to enforce the rights of Purchasers under the

each of the following requirements:

(i) Purchasers are required to consummate the Closing in accordance with
Section 1.03(a);

(ii) all of the conditions set forth in Section 9.01 and Section 9.02 have
been satisfied or waived on or prior to the date that the Closing should have
been consummated in accordance with Section 1.03(a) (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing and which
were, as of such date, capable of being satisfied);

(iii) Purchasers have failed to consummate the Closing in breach of Section
1.03(a);

(iv) the proceeds of the Debt Financing are available to Purchasers (or will
be available at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing)
on the terms set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments; and

(v) Seller has confirmed by written notice to Purchasers that if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded,
then the Closing pursuant to Section 1.03(a) will occur.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
under no circumstances shall Purchasers, the Investor, any Financing Source
Party or any of their respective Affiliates have any liability to Seller, the
Company, any of their respective Affiliates or any of their respective direct
or indirect equity holders for monetary damages in excess of the Termination
Fee (including in the event of a willful and material breach) and under no
circumstances shall the Company or any other Person be permitted or entitled
to receive both a grant of specific performance under Section 12.07(b) and any
monetary damages.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the rights of the parties to
the Debt Financing Commitments under the terms thereof, none of the Company or
any of its Affiliates or Seller shall have any rights or claims (whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise) against any Financing Source Party, solely
in their respective capacities as lenders, agents or arrangers in connection
with the Debt Financing.

Section 12.08. Jurisdiction.

(a) Unless otherwise explicitly provided in this Agreement, any Action
relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this
Agreement must be brought or otherwise commenced in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware, provided, that if jurisdiction is not then available in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, any state or federal court
located in the State of Delaware. In addition, each Party (a) expressly and
irrevocably consents and submits to the jurisdiction of each such court, and
each appellate court located in the State of Delaware, in connection with any



such proceeding, (b) agrees that each such court will be deemed to be a
convenient forum, (c) agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or
otherwise, in any such proceeding commenced in any such court, any claim that
such Party is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that
such proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of
such proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the subject matter of
this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such court, and (d) to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, consents to service of process being made through the
notice procedures set forth in Section 12.02 (provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not be construed to limit the ability to serve process by any
other legal means). This provision is intended to comply with 6 Del. C.
Section 2708, and each Party hereby agrees that (i) this Agreement involves at
least $100,000 and (ii) this Agreement has been entered into by the Parties in
express reliance upon 6 Del. C. Section 2708. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each of the Parties to this Agreement hereby agrees that any right or
obligation with respect to any Debt Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitments, the Debt Financing and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and any Action brought against
any of the Debt Financing Sources, will governed by the Laws of the State of
New York, without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof that would
cause the laws of another state to apply.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to
the next sentence and except and to the extent provided in the Limited
Guaranty or the Equity Financing Commitments, each of the Parties hereto
agrees that (i) it will not bring or support any Action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the
Financing Source Parties, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Financing Commitments, the Debt Financing or the definitive agreements
executed in connection therewith or the performance thereof, in any forum
other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or,
if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal
courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
(and, in each case, appellate courts thereof) and (ii) any such action, cause
of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim shall be governed by the
laws of the State of New York. Seller further agrees that it shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates and its and their direct and indirect stockholders
not to, bring or support any Action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source
Party, in any way relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Financing Commitments, the Debt Financing or the definitive agreements
executed in connection therewith or the performance thereof except and to the

UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO



INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY

(b) the Financing Sources, who are express third party beneficiaries of, and

Section 12.11. Interpretation. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of like import used in this Agreement will refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. Terms
defined in the singular in this Agreement will also include the plural and
vice versa. The captions and headings in this Agreement are included for
convenience of reference only and will be ignored in the construction or
interpretation hereof. References to Articles, Sections, Exhibits and
Schedules are to Articles, Sections, Exhibits and Schedules of this Agreement
unless otherwise specified. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation," whether or not they are in fact followed by
those words or words of like import. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" will mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and
such phrase will not simply mean "if." The term "or" has the



inclusive meaning represented by the phrase "and/or." The Parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If any
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will
be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or
burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 12.12. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Exhibits and the
Disclosure Schedule hereto, together with the Ancillary Agreements, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the RandW Insurance Policy, constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written,
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereto. The recitals
hereto are incorporated herein by reference.

Section 12.13. Disclosure Schedule. There may be included in the Disclosure
Schedule and elsewhere in this Agreement items and information that are not
"material," and such inclusion will not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or
agreement that any such item or information (or any non-disclosed item or
information of comparable or greater significance) is "material," or to affect
the interpretation of such term for purposes of this Agreement. Disclosures
included in any section of the Disclosure Schedule will be considered to be
made for purposes of all other sections of the Disclosure Schedule to the
extent that the relevance of any such disclosure to any other section of the
Disclosure Schedule is reasonably apparent on its face. Matters reflected in
the Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters required by
this Agreement to be disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule.

Section 12.14. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted so as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable
Law, then such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect the
validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement, and this Agreement will be re-formed, construed
and enforced in such manner as will effect as nearly as lawfully possible the
purposes and intent of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion of any provision of this Agreement.

Section 12.15. Non-Recourse. No past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, Affiliate, agent, attorney
or representative of any Party will have any liability for any Liabilities of
any Party under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Transactions (other than the
Investors pursuant to, and subject to the terms of, the Equity Financing
Commitments). Seller and the Company each agree that, except to the extent a
named party in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements and except and to
the extent provided in the Limited Guaranty, the Equity Financing Commitments
or the Confidentiality Agreement, (a) neither it nor any of its Affiliates
will bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Related Party of
Purchasers, in any way relating to this Agreement or the Transactions,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing
Commitments, the Debt Financing or the definitive agreements executed in
connection therewith or the performance thereof and (b) no Related Party of a
Purchaser shall have any liability



(whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or based upon any theory
that seeks to impose liability of an entity party against its owners or
Affiliates) to Seller or the Company or any of its and their respective
Affiliates or their respective directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners, managers or equity holders for any obligations or liabilities of any
party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each of the Seller
and Company (each on their own behalf and on behalf of their respective
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, members, managers, partners,
controlling persons, advisors, attorneys, agents and representatives) hereby
(i) waives any claims or rights against any Debt Financing Source relating to
or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Financing
Commitments or any related agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, whether at law or in equity and whether in tort, contract or
otherwise, (ii) agrees not to bring or support any suit, action or proceeding
against any Debt Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Financing, the Debt Financing Commitments or any related agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, whether at law or in equity and
whether in tort, contract or otherwise, and (iii) agrees to cause any suit,
action or proceeding asserted against any Debt Financing Source by or on
behalf of itself or any of its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
members, managers, partners, controlling persons, advisors, attorneys, agents
and representatives in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the
Debt Financing Commitments or related agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, to be dismissed or otherwise terminated. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing waivers and agreements, it
is acknowledged and agreed that no Debt Financing Source shall have any
liability for any claims or damages to the Seller or the Company in connection
with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Financing Commitments or
related agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

Section 12.16. Waiver of Privilege. The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that, as to all communications between KandL Gates LLP (the "Firm"), on the one
hand, and Seller, the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries (prior to the
Closing), on the other hand, that relate exclusively to this Agreement, the
Transactions or the process leading up to this Agreement, the attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence belong to Seller and will
not pass to or be claimed by Purchasers, the Company or any of the Company's
Subsidiaries in the event of a legal dispute with Seller. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event a dispute arises between Purchasers, the Company and
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a third party other than Seller or its
Affiliates, on the other hand, Purchasers, the Company and its Subsidiaries
may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of
communications involving attorney-client privilege among the Firm, the
Company, its Subsidiaries, and/or Seller that relate exclusively to this
Agreement or the Transactions.

Section 12.17. Conflict Waiver. Each Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that
(a) at the Closing, the attorney-client relationship between the Firm and the
Company and its Subsidiaries will terminate, and (b) the Firm in the future
may represent Seller (and any of its affiliates, successors and assigns)
(individually, a "Seller Party" and collectively, the "Seller Parties") in any
matter, including any dispute, negotiation, controversy, arbitration or
litigation that may arise between any Seller Party on the one hand, and
Purchasers, the Company, or any Subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the
"Purchaser Entities"), on the other hand, with



respect to this Agreement or the Transactions, even if such matters are
directly adverse to the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of the
other Purchaser Entities, and each of the Company, each Subsidiary of the
Company and the other Purchaser Entities hereby consents to such
representation. The Firm will not be required to notify the Company, any
Subsidiary of the Company or any other Purchaser Entity of any such
representation as it arises. In connection with any such representation by the
Firm of any one or more of the Seller Parties in any matter with respect to
this Agreement or the Transactions in which the Purchaser Entities are
adverse, the Company, each Subsidiary of the Company and each other Purchaser
Entity hereby waive any duty of confidentiality or attorney-client privilege
that may have arisen as a result of the Firm's representation of the Company,
any Subsidiary of the Company, and Seller. The Company and each other
Purchaser Entity understand that it is being asked now to waive future
conflicts as described above without knowledge as to the specifics of those
conflicts because the waiver pertains to future facts and events. This consent
and waiver is intended to be for the benefit of the Firm and effective in all
jurisdictions in which the Firm practices, and to extend to any rights
conferred on the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any other Purchaser
Entity by the professional rules of conduct of any such jurisdiction and any
other statute, rule, decision or common law principle relating to conflicts of
interest that may otherwise be applicable.

Section 12.18. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which will be an original and all of which
together will constitute a single instrument. The electronic transmission of
any signed original counterpart of this Agreement will be deemed to be the
delivery of an original counterpart of this Agreement.

after the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Purchasers desire to have the Company and its Subsidiaries
receive from Seller, and Seller has agreed to provide, or cause to be
provided, certain transition services as set forth herein to the Company and
its Subsidiaries; and

WHEREAS, Purchasers and the Company acknowledge that Seller is not in the
business of providing the transition services set forth in this Agreement to
third parties and that such services will be provided by Seller at Purchasers'
request and solely to accommodate Purchasers and the Company and its
Subsidiaries during the transitional period after the Closing so as to
maintain the continuity of the Business and to enable the Company and its
Subsidiaries to establish stand-alone status without continued reliance upon
the services of Seller ("Transition").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Parties hereto agree as follows:

 ARTICLE I

DEFINITIONS



Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement will have the
respective meanings ascribed to such terms in the Purchase Agreement, except
as expressly provided herein.

ARTICLE II

SERVICES



Section 2.1Scope of Services.



(a)During the Term (as defined below) and subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, Seller shall provide to the Company and its Subsidiaries, or cause
to be provided to the Company and its Subsidiaries, (i) the services listed in
Schedule 2.1 hereto (and Annex 2.1.1 thereto) and (ii) those services,
systems, functions or responsibilities not specifically described in Schedule
2.1 (or Annex 2.1.1 thereto), but which are inherently required for the proper
performance and delivery of the services listed in Schedule 2.1 (and Annex
2.1.1 thereto) (collectively, the "Services" and each of them, individually, a
"Service"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary that may be set forth or
implied elsewhere in this Agreement or in the Purchase Agreement, Seller shall
not, and shall be under no obligation to, provide (y) the services set forth
in Schedule 2.2 hereto (collectively, the "Excluded Services"), and (z) any
services other than those explicitly included in the Services and the Omitted
Services (as defined below).

(b)If (i) Seller (or one of its Affiliates) provided a service (other than the
Excluded Services) to the Company in the ordinary course during the 12 month
period immediately prior to the Closing Date and such service is not set forth
in Schedule 2.1 (or Annex 2.1.1 thereto) as of the date of this Agreement
(each, an "Omitted Service") and (ii) during the three month period after the
date of this Agreement, Purchasers reasonably determine that the Company
requires such Omitted Service in connection with the operation of the Company
and none of Purchasers, the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries are reasonably
able to provide or procure such Omitted Service on commercially reasonable
terms without materially disrupting the continuity of the Business or causing
a hardship to the Company, then Purchasers have the right to add such Omitted
Service to Schedule 2.1 (or Annex 2.1.1 thereto, as applicable) by delivering
a written notice to Seller (an "Omitted Service Notice"). As soon as
reasonably practicable following receipt of an Omitted Service Notice, Seller
(or one of its Affiliates) shall begin providing such Omitted Service to the
Company, and the parties hereto shall amend Schedule 2.1 (or Annex 2.1.1
thereto, as applicable) to set forth such Omitted Service, the duration of
such Omitted Service (not to exceed the Term), and the terms and conditions
for the provision of such Omitted Service, as agreed upon by the parties
hereto. The fees applicable to such Omitted Service shall be determined by
written agreement of the parties hereto, with each party hereto negotiating
the applicable fee in good faith; provided that in no event shall such
applicable fee be more than the

 actual cost incurred by Seller in providing such Omitted Service to the
Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, under no
circumstances shall Purchasers be required to pay for the cost of any Service
or any Omitted Service twice pursuant to this Agreement.



Section 2.2Service Standards; Level of Service. Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to perform the Services with substantially the same degree
and at substantially the same level of accuracy, quality, completeness,
responsiveness and efficiency as provided during the 12 month period before
the Closing Date, if applicable (the "Service Standards"). Subject to Sections
2.1 and 2.2, appropriate modifications in the manner of delivery of a Service
may be made by Seller as necessary to ensure the security, confidentiality and
data integrity of the Services upon written notice to the Company.



Section 2.3Means of Providing Services.



(a)Subject to Sections 2.1 and 2.2, Seller shall, in its reasonable
discretion, determine the manner, means and resources used to provide the
Services in accordance with its reasonable business judgment. Subject to
Sections 2.1 and 2.2, in providing the Services, Seller may modify or replace
(i) its policies and procedures, (ii) any Affiliates and/or third parties that
provide any Services, (iii) the location from which any Service is provided,
or (iv) the Intellectual Property rights, information technology assets,
systems, products and services used to provide the Services.



(b)Subject to Sections 2.1 and 2.2, Seller will not be obligated to (i)
maintain the employment of any specific employee or number of employees, (ii)
hire any employees in addition to the employees who are currently employed by
Seller for the provision of Services for the benefit of the Business, or (iii)
acquire, lease or license additional systems, equipment or software in order
to provide the Services. Certain of the personnel dedicated to the provision
of the Services are set forth in Schedule 2.3(b) hereto (the "TSA Employees").
At the end of the Term, Purchasers shall cause the Company to offer employment
to the TSA Employees on terms consistent with the provisions of Section 8.01
of the Purchase Agreement. If the Company fails to extend such an offer of
employment to any TSA Employee, or if such an offer triggers severance for any
TSA Employee, Purchasers shall promptly reimburse Seller for fifty percent
(50%) of any severance actually paid by Seller to such TSA Employee within 180
days after the termination of the Services under this Agreement that such TSA
Employee renders and receipt by Purchasers of documentation establishing the
payment of such severance to such TSA Employee. For the avoidance of doubt,
during the Term, TSA Employees shall be under the direction, control and
supervision of Seller (and not Purchasers) and Seller shall have the sole
right to exercise all authority with respect to, and shall be solely
responsible for, the employment, assignment and compensation of such employees
(including any withholding, employment or other tax obligations).



(c)Purchasers acknowledge and agree that the Services provided by a third
party on Seller's behalf, and the assets licensed from a third party and used
in connection

 with providing the Services, remain subject to the terms and conditions of any
applicable contracts with such third parties, and the Company (and its
Subsidiaries) shall continue to adhere to such terms and conditions. Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary consent from
such third parties in order to provide such Services, and to the extent that
any additional consent fees are requested by such third parties for such
consents, Seller and Purchasers shall evenly divide such additional consent
fees (unless such additional consent fees relate to an assignment of this
Agreement by Purchasers, or a Change of Control of the Company, as described
in Section 9.14, in which event Purchasers shall be solely responsible for any
such additional consent fees); provided, that Purchasers consent to the fees
to be paid; provided, further, that if Purchasers do not consent to paying a
particular fee, then Seller will be relieved of its obligation to provide the
Services with respect to that particular software or service.



(d)In the event that any such consent referred to in clause (c) above is not
obtained despite Seller using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent, the parties hereto shall discuss in good faith, as applicable,
alternative arrangements or modifications to the Services in order to meet a
mutually agreed alternative standard, including Seller using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain alternative providers or provide temporary
workarounds. Seller shall obtain Purchasers' consent prior to agreeing to any
consent fees to be paid to a third party and shall afford Purchasers the
opportunity to procure alternative arrangements.



(e)Subject to Sections 2.1 and 2.2, Seller reserves the right, upon giving
prior written notice to Purchasers, to subcontract with third parties to
provide all or part of any Service or the Services; provided, that Seller is
responsible for any incremental costs in excess of the Fees in connection with
such third party providing such Service. In the event of any subcontracting,
Seller shall remain responsible for ensuring the provision of the Services in
accordance with this Agreement.



Section 2.4Certain Limitations. Subject to Sections 2.1 and 2.2, the Services
will be subject to the following limitations (the "Limitations") unless
otherwise agreed by the parties hereto:

(a)Seller will only be required to provide the Services to or for the benefit
of the Business as conducted (or contemplated to be conducted during the Term
in the Projection Materials) prior to the Closing Date. In particular, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller will not be obligated to
provide Services in a volume or quantity which exceeds the historical volumes
or quantities of the services provided (or contemplated to be provided during
the Term in the Projection Materials), by Seller to the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the benefit of the Business other than to account for
reasonable business growth (which growth will not obligate Seller to provide
any additional functionality through the Services, to the extent not otherwise
contemplated during the Term by the Projection Materials). For purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Projection Materials" means the Additional Financial
Data, the Project Ruby Confidential Evaluation Materials, dated March 2019,
prepared by Robert W. Baird and

 Co. Incorporated and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and the Project Ruby
Management Presentation, dated April 2019.



(b)Seller will only be required to allocate the means and resources to provide
Services necessary for the continued operation of the Business as was
conducted (or contemplated to be conducted during the Term in the Projection
Materials) prior to the Closing Date, so that the Service Standards are
conducted in a manner consistent with the operation of the Business prior to
the Closing, and the manner in which the Business is contemplated to be
conducted during the Term pursuant to the Projection Materials.



(c)Seller, as a legal entity, will not be obligated to devote its sole
attention to the provision of the Services; provided that, for the avoidance
of doubt, the TSA Employees will devote their sole attention to the provision
of the Services.



(d)Seller will not be obligated to provide any Services to any entity other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries.



(e)For the avoidance of doubt, Seller will not be required to convert
Service(s) to technology platforms other than that supported by Seller in
providing the Services, but Seller shall remain available during the Term to
respond to Purchasers' reasonable inquiries in any efforts by Purchasers to
effectuate such conversions on its behalf.



(f)Seller will not be obligated to provide any Services to the extent
prohibited by applicable Law.



(g)Purchasers will not use the Services other than in a manner related to the
operation of the Business.



(h)As promptly as practicable during the Term, Purchasers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make a transition of each Service to its
own internal organization or to obtain alternate third-party sources to
provide the Services. Without limiting the foregoing, in connection with any
acquisitions or transactions contemplated in the Projection Materials or
otherwise undertaken by Purchaser or its Affiliates during the Term, Purchaser
and its Affiliates will use commercially reasonably efforts to obtain
transition services arrangements from the sellers that are parties to such
acquisitions or transactions.



Section 2.5Temporary Suspension of Services. Upon notice to Purchasers, Seller
may, in its reasonable discretion, suspend the provision of the Services (or
any part thereof), from time to time, to enable it to perform routine or
emergency maintenance to those parts or components of buildings, plant,
machinery, information technology systems, or other assets of Seller required
to provide the Services; provided, that: (a) Seller shall perform such routine
maintenance outside of the normal business hours of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or during other mutually acceptable times; (b) Seller shall
provide Purchasers with reasonable prior notice

 of any routine maintenance and, if practicable, prior notice of any such
emergency maintenance and the anticipated duration of the suspension; (c)
Seller carries out the applicable maintenance and resumes provision of the
relevant Services efficiently and promptly; and (d) Seller avoids any
unnecessary interruption or disruption to the Business.



Section 2.6Emergencies. In the event of an emergency or other exceptional
circumstance affecting Seller's own business or the business of its Affiliates
which require the allocation of resources normally used for the provision of
the Services, Seller shall inform Purchasers and the Company of such emergency
or exceptional circumstance, and the parties hereto shall discuss in good
faith the manner in which the Services will be provided until the emergency or
exceptional circumstance is resolved. During such discussions Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to resume providing the Services in accordance
with the Service Standards as soon as reasonably practicable. In the event
such emergency or exceptional circumstance causes Seller to allocate limited
resources between or among its Affiliates and the Company, Seller shall not
provide to any of its Affiliates priority over the Company. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.6, in the event any
emergency or exceptional circumstance shall be a Force Majeure Event, the
provisions of Section 9.1 will control with respect to such emergency or
exceptional circumstance.



Section 2.7Cooperation.



(a)Each party hereto shall perform all obligations under this Agreement in
good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other
in order to facilitate the provision and receipt of the Services.



(b)Without limiting the foregoing, and subject to Section 7.2, (i) Purchasers
and the Company (and its Subsidiaries) shall follow the workplace, security
and data privacy policies, procedures, practices and requirements
(collectively, the "Security Policies") of Seller as applicable to the
Services, and (ii) Seller shall follow the Security Policies of the Company as
applicable to the Services to the extent that Seller was obligated to follow
such Security Policies prior to the Closing; provided in the case of (i) and
(ii) above, that none of the foregoing parties will be obligated to follow any
policies, procedures and practices to the extent in doing so it would be in
violation of applicable Law; provided, further, that the foregoing will in no
way limit a party's obligations to obtain consents pursuant to Section 2.3(c).



(c)Purchasers and the Company shall provide (and shall cause to be provided)
to Seller and its employees, agents, consultants and contractors the
following, at no cost to Seller, as necessary in the reasonable judgment of
Seller in order for Seller to provide the Services pursuant to the terms
hereof: (i) access to facilities, hardware, equipment, systems, Intellectual
Property and related items of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and (ii)
access to, and the cooperation of, personnel of Purchasers, the Company and
its Subsidiaries (including timely hiring and placement of those personnel
necessary for knowledge transfer and assumption of functional responsibilities
in connection with the Services).

 (d)A failure of Seller, on the one hand, or Purchasers or the Company (and its
Subsidiaries), on the other hand, to act in accordance with this Section 2.7
that prevents or materially inhibits the other party(s) ability to provide a
Service or meet its obligations hereunder, including the failure to comply
with Security Policies with which it is obligated to comply hereunder, will
relieve such party(s) from such obligation until such time as the failure has
ceased; provided, that the party that is unable to provide a Service or meet
its obligations hereunder notifies the other party(s) promptly after becoming
aware of such failure by the other party(s).



Section 2.8Unauthorized Access. If, at any time, Purchasers, the Company or
its Subsidiaries (or any Affiliate thereof), on the one hand, or Seller or its
Subsidiaries (or any Affiliate thereof), on the other hand, determines that
(a) any of their respective personnel has sought to circumvent, or has
circumvented, the Security Policies of the Company or the Seller, as
applicable, (b) any unauthorized personnel of Purchasers, the Company or its
Subsidiaries (or any Affiliate thereof), on the one hand, or Seller or its
Subsidiaries (or any Affiliate thereof), on the other hand, has accessed
Seller's Systems or the Company's Systems, as applicable, or (c) any of their
respective personnel has engaged in activities that may reasonably be expected
to lead to the unauthorized access, use, destruction, alteration or loss of
data, information or software, Seller, Purchasers or the Company, as
applicable, shall promptly terminate (or cause to be terminated) such
personnel's access to Seller's Systems or the Company's Systems, as
applicable, and promptly notify Seller or the Company (as applicable) in
writing. In addition, (x) Seller will have the right to deny such personnel of
Purchasers, the Company or its Subsidiaries (or any Affiliate thereof) access
to Seller's Systems and (y) Purchasers or the Company will have the right to
deny such personnel of Seller (or any Affiliate thereof) access to the
Company's Systems, upon written notice to Purchasers or Seller, as applicable,
in the event that Seller or Purchasers, as applicable, reasonably believe that
such personnel have engaged in any of the activities set forth in this Section
2.8 or otherwise pose a security concern. Each party hereto shall reasonably
cooperate with the other parties in investigating any apparent unauthorized
access to or use of Seller's Systems or the Company's Systems, as applicable.



Section 2.9Insurance. Each party hereto shall, throughout the term of this
Agreement, carry appropriate insurance with a reputable insurance company
covering property damage, business interruptions and general liability
insurance (including contractual liability) to protect its own business and
property interests. To the extent a party hereto insures, in whole or in part,
through a comparable plan of self-insurance, the other parties acknowledge
that such self-insurance will be acceptable for purposes of this Agreement.



Section 2.10Divestiture, Sale or Transfer of Assets. Subject to Sections 2.1
and 2.2, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to limit Seller's ability to
divest, sell or otherwise transfer any of its assets, including contracts and
Intellectual Property licenses.



 ARTICLE III

PRICING



Section 3.1Payment for Services. As compensation for the Services, Purchasers
shall (a) pay Seller the fees described in Schedule 2.1 and (b) reimburse to
Seller an amount equal to Seller's and its Affiliates' out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by Seller or its Affiliates that are attributable to providing the
Services (including pro-rata shares of expenses incurred in connection with
providing the Services); provided, that any such out-of-pocket expenses in
excess of any expenses set forth in Schedule 2.1 are approved in writing by
Purchasers in advance of such expenses being incurred by Seller (which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the
foregoing clauses (a) and (b), collectively, the "Fees"). Seller shall not be
responsible for any delay or failure in providing the Services hereunder to
the extent caused by an unreasonable delay or failure by Purchasers to approve
any such out-of-pocket expenses. If Purchasers terminate any Service, the
applicable fee for that Service set forth in Schedule 2.1 will be prorated on
the next invoice for the actual time the Service was provided, and such fee
will be eliminated from all future invoices. If Purchasers exercise their
option to renew a Service in accordance with Section 4.1, the applicable fee
for such Service set forth in Schedule 2.1 will be increased for the Renewal
Term by an amount equal to 10% over the applicable fee set forth in Section
2.1.



Section 3.2Taxes. In addition to the other amounts payable under this
Agreement, for any Services for which Seller charges Fees hereunder,
Purchasers shall pay, or reimburse Seller for, the amount of any present or
future Taxes levied against, upon or in respect of the Services and/or payable
by Seller on amounts earned (if any, including the amount of any interest or
penalties levied upon any such amounts, to the extent the interest or
penalties result from the failure by Purchasers to pay Seller any amounts
pursuant to this Section 3.2 when due) in connection with the provision of any
Services or to the use of such Services by Purchasers, the Company and its
Subsidiaries, other than (i) Taxes associated with Seller's income, gross
receipts (for the avoidance of doubt, not including sales tax), property or
employment and (ii) Taxes that were levied against, upon or in respect of the
Services prior to the Closing. Invoices issued pursuant to Section 3.3 will
separately state any taxes payable by Purchasers. The parties shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold Taxes required by applicable Law to be
withheld on payments made pursuant to this Agreement. To the extent any
amounts are so withheld, (i) such amounts shall be paid to the proper
Governmental Authority and (ii) the party that made such payment shall
promptly provide to the party with respect to which withholding was made
evidence of such payment to such Governmental Authority.



Section 3.3Billing and Cash Settlement. Any amounts due under this Agreement
will be billed and paid for in the following manner: (a) Seller shall invoice
Purchasers on a monthly basis for all Services delivered during the preceding
month and all Taxes payable by Purchasers to Seller in accordance with Section
3.2 related thereto in the preceding month; (b) all undisputed amounts under
each such invoice will be payable within 30 days after Purchasers' receipt
thereof; and (c) invoices and payment of all invoices in respect of the
Services provided hereunder will be made in U.S. Dollars ($) payable by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such account or accounts as may be
designated from time to time by Seller. If

 Purchasers fail to pay in full any invoice when due, interest will accrue
daily on the unpaid amount at a rate of 3% per annum. With respect to any
amounts due under this Agreement that accrue or are incurred by Seller or its
Affiliates during the Term but that are not billed by Seller in a monthly
invoice, or of which Seller does not become aware until after the Term, Seller
shall set forth such fees in an invoice or invoices submitted to Purchasers
following the end of the Term (each, a "Post-Term Invoice"), provided such
invoice is submitted to Purchasers no later than 90 days following the date
the applicable Service was rendered. Purchasers shall remit payment under any
such Post-Term Invoice to Seller within 30 days after its receipt of such
invoice.

ARTICLE IV

TERM; TERMINATION



Section 4.1Term; Renewal Option. The initial term of this Agreement will
commence on the Closing Date and will end on the one year anniversary date
thereafter (the "Initial Term"); provided, that, Purchasers will have the
option to renew the term for one or more Services up to the period of time set
forth in Schedule 2.1 (the "Renewal Term") exercisable by written notice to
Seller not less than 30 days before the expiration of the Initial Term (the
Initial Term and the Renewal Term are collectively referred to as the "Term").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term period for a particular Service will
end before the Initial Term to the extent set forth in Schedule 2.1, subject
to Purchasers' right to renew such period for the Renewal Term. The Fees
charged by Seller will then be reduced by the amount applicable to such
Services that so terminate, and if Purchasers have prepaid any such amounts,
those amounts will be credited towards future invoices or refunded at Seller's
discretion.



Section 4.2Partial Termination of the Services. Except as set forth in
Schedule 2.1, to the extent that a Service, or a portion thereof, can be
terminated without requiring termination of all Services and without causing a
material disruption to the Services provided by a third party, Seller will, at
a mutually agreeable time no more than 30 days after Purchasers give written
notice thereof, cease performance of any such Service or Services. As from the
day such Service(s) ceases, the Fees will be appropriately reduced, and if
Purchasers have prepaid any such amounts, those amounts will be credited
towards future invoices or refunded at Seller's discretion.



Section 4.3Termination of the Agreement. This Agreement or any Service
hereunder may also be terminated:

(a)By either Seller or Purchasers upon written notice to the other party if
the other party is in material breach of this Agreement or the Purchase
Agreement; provided, however, that the breaching party will have 30 days from
receipt of written notice thereof to cure such breach, at which time this
Agreement or Service, as applicable, will terminate upon written notice if the
breach has not been cured;



(b)By Purchasers upon written notice to Seller, if performance of this
Agreement or any Service has been rendered impossible or impracticable for a
period of 10 days as a direct result of the occurrence of any Force Majeure
Event described in Section 9.1;

 (c)By Purchasers with regard to a portion of the Services as provided under
Section 4.2; or



(d)By either Seller or Purchasers upon written notice to the other party if
the other party (i) files a petition in bankruptcy, (ii) becomes or is
declared insolvent, or becomes the subject of any proceedings (not dismissed
within 60 days) related to its liquidation, insolvency or the appointment of a
receiver, (iii) makes an assignment on behalf of all or substantially all of
its creditors, or (iv) takes any corporate action for its winding up or
dissolution.



Section 4.4Effect of Termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, no
party hereto will have any further obligation to the other parties (including
with respect to the provision of any Services), except:



(a)No termination of this Agreement will prejudice any claim a party may have
under this Agreement that arises prior to the effective date of such
termination;



(b)Such termination will not terminate or otherwise affect (i) any obligations
to pay monies due or which become due for Services performed prior to the date
of expiration or termination; (ii) the provisions of Articles V, VI, VII, VIII
and IX; or (iii) any other obligations under this Agreement which specifically
survive or are to be performed after the date of expiration or termination;
and



(c)Purchasers shall reimburse Seller for any incremental fees charged by third
party service providers in connection with the termination of Services.

officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents, representatives and
members) (each, an "Indemnified Party") from and against all Covered Losses
arising out of or relating to (a) any third party claim relating to a breach
by Seller of this Agreement or (b) a material breach by Seller of this
Agreement, including a complete abandonment of a Service under this Agreement
by Seller, except in each of the foregoing cases to the extent such Covered
Losses result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of a Purchaser
or Purchaser-related Indemnified Party or other breach hereunder. Subject to
the limitations set forth in this Agreement, including in Article VI,
Purchasers (in such capacity, also the "Indemnifying Party") shall indemnify

officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents, representatives and

not settle any such claim without the Indemnified Party's prior written
consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (ii)
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's
expense, in defending or settling such claim.



(c)If any Indemnified Party desires to assert any claim for indemnification

reasonable detail (taking into account the information then available to such
Indemnified Party), of such claim promptly after becoming aware of the
existence of such claim, except that the failure of an Indemnified Party to
notify the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from its
obligation to indemnify only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

provider to provide such service.



 Section 6.3Consequential Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement (including the definition of Covered Loss), in no
event will any party be liable to the other parties for (a) any damages
incurred as a result of third party claims except as provided in this
Agreement, (b) any indirect or consequential damages, or (c) any special,
exemplary, incidental or punitive damages, including lost or anticipated
revenues, diminution in value, loss of profits, lost or anticipated savings,
loss of business opportunity or injury to goodwill or reputation, in
connection with, or related to the performance of, this Agreement or arising
out of the Services rendered hereunder, whether such liability is asserted on
the basis of contract (including the breach or any termination of this
Agreement or any matter contemplated in Article V)), tort (including
negligence or strict liability), misrepresentation or otherwise, even if the
party has been warned of the possibility of any such loss or damage in
advance.



Section 6.4Exceptions. The limitation on liability set forth in Section 6.2
shall not apply in the case of Covered Losses suffered by Purchasers or
Company resulting from the (a) complete abandonment of a Service under this
Agreement by Seller or (b) gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller.



Section 6.5Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS.



ARTICLE VII

CONFIDENTIALITY; SECURITY



Section 7.1Confidentiality. The parties hereto acknowledge that Seller, on the
one hand, and Purchasers, the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand,
will have access to confidential and proprietary information concerning the
other party, its customers, employees, Affiliates and its business, which
information is not readily available to the public ("Confidential
Information").



(a)Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential
Information" of a party means information, ideas, materials or other subject
matter of such party, whether disclosed orally, in writing, electronically or
otherwise, that is provided under circumstances reasonably indicating that it
is confidential or proprietary. "Confidential Information" of a party will
include any and all trade secrets, processes, techniques, drawings, models,
customer-related information and data, computer programs, databases, business
plans, technical data, product ideas, marketing data and plans, contracts and
financial information disclosed or otherwise provided by the disclosing party
("Disclosing Party") to the receiving party ("Receiving Party"). Confidential
Information will not include any information or material that: (i) is or
becomes part of public knowledge other than as a result of any action or
inaction of the

 Receiving Party; (ii) is disclosed to the Receiving Party without confidential
or proprietary restriction by a third party who rightfully possesses the
information (without confidential or proprietary restriction); or (iii) is
independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to the
Confidential Information and as evidenced by the records of the Receiving
Party, or (iv) is properly known by the Receiving Party before receipt thereof
from the Disclosing Party; provided, however, that the foregoing subsection
(iv) will not apply to the Confidential Information of the Company or its
Subsidiaries known to Seller prior to Closing, or the Confidential Information
of Seller known to the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to Closing.



(b)Restrictions on Use. Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party will
not be used for any purpose other than as expressly permitted under this
Agreement, and will not be disclosed to any third party without the prior
written consent of the Disclosing Party. Each party agrees to limit access to
the other party's Confidential Information to those of its Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, contractors and other representatives who: (i)
have a need to know such Confidential Information for purposes of such party
performing its obligations hereunder; and (ii) are obligated to protect the
confidentiality of such Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall
treat the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party with at least the
same degree of care and protection as it would use with respect to its own
confidential and proprietary information (and in no event less than a
reasonable degree of care). Subject to Sections 6.2 and 6.3, the Receiving
Party shall be responsible and liable to the Disclosing Party for any breach
of this Article VII by the Receiving Party's employees or other third parties
receiving access to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information through or
on behalf of the Receiving Party.



(c)Exclusions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement will not prevent
the Receiving Party from disclosing Confidential Information of the Disclosing
Party to the extent required by a judicial order or other legal obligation;
provided, that, in such event, the Receiving Party shall promptly notify the
Disclosing Party in writing to allow intervention (and shall cooperate with
the Disclosing Party) to contest or minimize the scope of the disclosure
(including application for a protective order). Further, each party may
disclose the terms and conditions of this Agreement (i) as required by the
applicable securities laws or self-regulatory bodies or the rules, regulations
or policies of any United States or foreign securities exchange, including
requirements to file a copy of this Agreement (redacted to the extent
reasonably permitted by applicable law) or to disclose information regarding
the provisions hereof or performance hereunder to applicable regulatory
authorities, (ii) in confidence, to legal counsel, (iii) in confidence, to
accountants, banks and financing sources and their advisors, and (iv) in
connection with the enforcement of this Agreement or any rights hereunder.



Section 7.2Security. If a party is given access to any of the other parties'
computer systems or software (collectively, "Systems") or physical facilities
in connection with receipt of the Services, the accessing party will not
tamper with, compromise or circumvent any security or audit measures employed
by the other parties. The accessing party will access and use only

 those Systems of the other parties for which it has been granted the right to
access and use, and to access and use such Systems only to the extent
reasonably necessary to provide or to receive the Services, as the case may
be.

Section 7.3Remedies. The parties acknowledge, understand and agree that a
breach of this Article VII may cause irreparable injury to the non-breaching
party and that there may be no adequate or complete remedy at law available
for such breach. Accordingly, the parties (a) agree that the non-breaching
party will be entitled to seek enforcement of this Article VII by injunction
(without the requirement to post bond or other security), and (b) irrevocably
waive any defense based on the adequacy of the remedy at law which might be
asserted as a bar to such injunctive relief.



ARTICLE VIII

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY



Section 8.1Ownership of Intellectual Property.



(a)Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in the Purchase Agreement,
Seller, on the one hand, and Purchasers, on the other hand, will retain all
right, title and interest in and to their respective Intellectual Property
rights and any and all improvements, modifications and derivative works
thereof, and no other license (other than to the extent necessary for the
provision or receipt of the Services) or other right, express or implied, is
granted hereunder by any party to its intellectual property rights.



(b)Each party shall from time to time execute any documents and take any other
actions reasonably requested by the other parties to effectuate the purposes
of this Section 8.1.



Section 8.2Reservation of Rights. Except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, no party hereto will have any rights or licenses with respect to
any hardware or facility of the other parties. All rights and licenses not
expressly granted in this Agreement are expressly reserved by the relevant
party.



ARTICLE IX

MISCELLANEOUS



Section 9.1Force Majeure. In the event that Seller is wholly or partially
prevented from, or delayed in, providing one or more Services, or one or more
Services are interrupted or suspended, or if Seller fails to meet the Service
Standards, by reason of events beyond its reasonable control (which may
include acts of God, fire, explosion, accident, floods, embargoes, epidemics,
war, acts of terrorism, nuclear disaster or riot) (each, a "Force Majeure
Event"), Seller will not be obligated to deliver (or timely deliver, as
applicable) the affected Services (including not delivering such Services on
the Service Standards) during such period, and Purchasers will not be
obligated to pay for any Services not delivered. Upon the occurrence of a
Force Majeure Event, Seller shall give written notice to Purchasers of the
Force Majeure Event upon which it intends to rely to excuse its performance
and of the expected duration of such Force Majeure

 Event. The duties and obligations of Seller with regard to the Services
hereunder that are directly affected by such Force Majeure Event will be
tolled for the duration of the Force Majeure Event, but only to the extent
that the Force Majeure Event prevents Seller from performing its duties and
obligations hereunder and in no event will such duties and obligations be
tolled beyond expiration of the Term. During the duration of the Force Majeure
Event, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or remove
such Force Majeure Event and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
resume its performance under this Agreement with the least practicable delay.
From, during and after the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, Purchasers or
the Company (or its Subsidiaries) may replace the affected Services by
providing such Services for itself or engaging a third party to provide such
Services at Purchasers' sole cost and expense.



Section 9.2Interpretation. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of like import used in this Agreement will refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. Terms defined in
the singular in this Agreement will also include the plural and vice versa.
The captions and headings in this Agreement are included for convenience of
reference only and will be ignored in the construction or interpretation
hereof. References to Articles, Sections, Exhibits and Schedules are to
Articles, Sections, Exhibits and Schedules of this Agreement unless otherwise
specified. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation," whether or not they are in fact followed by those words or words
of like import. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" will mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase will not
simply mean "if." The term "or" has the inclusive meaning represented by the
phrase "and/or." The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. If any ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.



Section 9.3Preparation of this Agreement. The parties hereby acknowledge that
(a) Purchasers and the Company, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other
hand, jointly and equally participated in the drafting of this Agreement, (b)
Purchasers and the Company, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand,
have been adequately represented and advised by legal counsel with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (c) no
presumption will be made that any provision of this Agreement will be
construed against any party by reason of such role in the drafting of this
Agreement and any other agreement contemplated hereby.



Section 9.4Relationships of the Parties. The parties hereto are and will
remain independent contractors and not employees or agents of each other.
Except as expressly granted by a party in writing, none of Purchasers, the
Company or Seller will have any authority, express or implied, to act as an
agent of such other party or its subsidiaries or Affiliates under this
Agreement. It is not the intent of the parties hereto to create, nor should
this Agreement be construed to create, a partnership, joint venture, fiduciary
relationship or employment

 relationship among or between the parties (including their respective
officers, employees, agents or representatives).



Section 9.5Employees of the Parties. The employees, agents or representatives
of Seller providing services to Purchasers, the Company and its Subsidiaries
under this Agreement will not be deemed employees, agents or representatives
of Purchasers, the Company or its Subsidiaries. Similarly, the employees,
agents or representatives of Purchasers, the Company or its Subsidiaries will
not be deemed employees, agents or representatives of Seller.



Section 9.6Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable in
compliance with applicable Laws for the provision of the Services and to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein.



Section 9.7Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Purchase Agreement, the
Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules thereto, together with the other Ancillary
Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement and the RandW Insurance Policy,
constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral
and written, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereto. The
recitals hereto are incorporated herein by reference.



Section 9.8Third Party Beneficiaries. No provision of this Agreement is
intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies or Liabilities hereunder
upon any Person other than the parties, their successors and assigns, except
as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement.



Section 9.9Incorporation by Reference. Sections 12.06, 12.08 and 12.09 of the
Purchase Agreement are incorporated by reference into this Agreement and shall
be applied mutatis mutandis herein.



Section 9.10Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto will be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case
without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of monetary damages as a
remedy and without the requirement to post bond or other security, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in
equity.



Section 9.11Notices. Any notice or other communication provided for in this
Agreement or given hereunder to a party must be in writing and (a) sent by
electronic mail,

Section 9.12Amendments and Waivers. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party hereto, or in the case
of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No
failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof nor will any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.



Section 9.13Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement will be paid by
the party incurring such cost or expense.

 Section 9.14Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their successors and
permitted assigns, except that (a) no party may assign, delegate or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement (subject to
Section 2.3(d)) without the prior written consent of the other parties and (b)
in the event of a merger or Change of Control of the Company, any Subsidiary
or any single Purchaser, the prior written consent of Seller shall be required
hereunder (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); provided, however, that no consent of Seller shall be required in
the event of any merger or Change of Control of Purchasers collectively to one
or more affiliated acquirers, or with or into one or more affiliated surviving
entities, in a single transaction or in connection with the acquisition,
consolidation or restructuring of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Business to one or more affiliated acquirers, or with or into one or more
affiliated surviving entities, in a single transaction. For purposes hereof,
"Change of Control" means any transaction in which, following such
transaction, fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding voting equity of
the acquired, surviving, or combined entity is owned, directly or indirectly,
by Persons other than the equityholders of such party immediately prior to
such transaction. Any increase in Fees resulting from a permitted assignment,
merger or Change of Control hereunder shall be borne solely by Purchasers or
the successor in interest hereunder to Purchasers.



Section 9.15Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
will be interpreted so as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but
if any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law,
then such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect the
validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement, and this Agreement will be re-formed, construed
and enforced in such manner as will effect as nearly as lawfully possible the
purposes and intent of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion of any provision of this Agreement.



Section 9.16Counterparts; Effect. This Agreement may be signed in any number
of counterparts, each of which will be an original and all of which together
will constitute a single instrument. The electronic transmission of any signed
original counterpart of this Agreement will be deemed to be the delivery of an
original counterpart of this Agreement.



Section 9.17Administrative Contacts. Purchasers designate Purchasers' Chief
Financial Officer (contact information above) as its administrative contact
for purposes of this Agreement, and Seller designates Seller's Chief Financial
Officer (contact information above) as its administrative contact for purposes
of this Agreement. All initial contacts between the parties regarding issues
and matters arising under this Agreement or any other administrative matters
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby will be directed to
such party's administrative contact.



Section 9.18Dispute Resolution. Purchasers and the Company, on the one hand,
and Seller, on the other hand, shall attempt in good faith to resolve any
dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement amicably and promptly by
good faith negotiations between executives who have authority to settle such
dispute. A party may give the other parties written notice of

 any dispute not resolved in the normal course of business. Within five
business days after delivery of such notice, the administrative contacts of
the parties shall agree to meet at a mutually acceptable time and place, and
thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute. If the matter has not
been resolved within five business days of the first meeting of such
administrative contacts (or, if the parties are unable to mutually agree upon
an acceptable time and place to meet, within five business days of the sending
of such notice of dispute), a party may, by notice to the other parties, refer
the matter to executives of the parties. Such executives shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve the matter in an amicable manner within five business
days of such second notice. In the event the matter is not resolved within
such five-day period, a party may, by notice to the other parties, refer the
matter to the parties' chief executive officers. Such officers shall negotiate
in good faith to resolve the matter in an amicable manner within five business
days of such third notice. In the event the matter is not resolved within such
five-day period, a party may pursue all other means available to it to resolve
the dispute.



Section 9.19No Setoff. Each of the parties hereto hereby acknowledges that it
will have no right under this Agreement to offset any amounts owed (or to
become due and owing) to another party hereto, whether under this Agreement,
the Purchase Agreement or otherwise, against any other amount owed (or to
become due and owing) to it by such other party.

TRADEMARK, TRADE NAME AND DOMAIN NAME LICENSE AGREEMENT

THIS TRADEMARK, TRADE NAME AND DOMAIN NAME LICENSE AGREEMENT (the
"Agreement"), effective as of the Closing Date, is made by and among Kaman
Corporation, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State
of Connecticut ("Licensor"), and [•], a [•] ("Licensee", and with Licensor,
each a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties").

WHEREAS, Licensor and LJ KIT Blocker, Inc., LJ KAI Blocker, Inc., and LJ KFP
Blocker, Inc. (collectively, "Purchasers") have entered into a Share Purchase
Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2019 (the "Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to
which, at the Closing, Licensor has agreed to sell and transfer the Shares of
Kaman Industrial Technologies Corporation to Purchasers, and Purchasers have
agreed to purchase the Shares of Kaman Industrial Technologies Corporation
from Licensor (unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, capitalized terms
used in this Agreement have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Purchase
Agreement).

WHEREAS, Purchasers and Licensee acknowledge that Licensor is not in the
business of licensing out its intellectual property to third parties as set
forth in this Agreement and that such licensing will be provided by Licensor
at Purchasers' request and solely to accommodate Purchasers, Licensee and
Additional Licensees (as defined below) to maintain the continuity of the
Business while Licensee and Additional Licensees each phase out the use of the
intellectual property licensed under this Agreement and Additional License
Agreements (as defined below), respectively, over the course of the Term of
this Agreement and Additional License Agreements, respectively ("Transition").

WHEREAS, Licensor owns trademarks, service marks, logos, business names,
commercial names, trade names, domain names, and registrations and
applications therefor, consisting of or containing the word KAMAN in standard
characters and/or in stylized typeface and/or in colors and/or in combination
with other words and letters and/or in combination with graphic elements
(collectively the "KAMAN Marks"), and included within the KAMAN Marks are
those certain registered service marks set forth in Schedule A as well as
certain related common law service mark rights to KAMAN owned by Licensor
(collectively, the "Licensed Marks") and those certain domain names set forth
in Schedule B (the "Licensed Domain Names").



WHEREAS, within the Business, Licensee is engaged in (a) the service of
promoting, advertising, distributing and selling the following third party
goods: power transmission products and components, industrial automation
products and components, fluid power products and components, electro-
mechanical products and components, bearings, motion control products and
components, and electrical power products and components (collectively, the
"Third Party Industrial Goods"); (b) providing services in connection with its
engineered integrated solutions, including, maintenance, repair and other
services related thereto ("Industrial Services") and (c) selling products
resulting from Licensee's Industrial Services that are assembled by Licensee
("Licensee Goods").



WHEREAS, in connection with the Transition, and upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Purchasers desire to have Licensee
receive from Licensor, and Licensor desires to grant to Licensee, a license to
the Licensed Marks as part of the Combination Marks (as defined below) and
Licensed Domain Names in the manner set forth in this Agreement.



WHEREAS, also in connection with the Transition, under separate Trademark,
Trade Name and Domain Name License Agreements (each an "Additional License
Agreement" and, collectively, the "Additional License Agreements"), Licensor
has granted to [LJ KIT Blocker, Inc., LJ KAI Blocker, Inc., LJ KFP Blocker,
Inc., Kaman Industrial Technologies Corporation, Ruby Automation, LLC, Kaman

 Fluid Power, LLC, and Ruby PR, LLC] (each an "Additional Licensee" and,
collectively, the "Additional Licensees") a license to the Licensed Marks as
part of the Combination Marks and Licensed Domain Names.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Parties agree as follows:



1\. Grant of License.



(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Licensor
hereby grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non‑transferable,
non‑sublicensable, non‑assignable, royalty free, fully paid up, license to
use, within the Licensed Territory (as defined herein), the (i) Licensed Marks
as part of the trade names set forth in Schedule C (each a "Combination Mark"
and collectively the "Combination Marks") on signage located on the exterior
or interior of, or immediately adjacent to, facilities, including retail
stores, owned or operated by Licensee (collectively, "Facilities"), in
connection with the Business; (ii) Combination Marks and Licensed Domain Names
in connection with the services of promoting, advertising, distributing, and
selling the Third Party Industrial Goods and in connection with promoting,
advertising and providing the Industrial Services; and (iii) Combination Marks
on and in connection with the promotion, advertising, distribution, and sale
of Licensee Goods ((i), (ii) and (iii) collectively, the "Licensed Goods and
Services"), provided, that, the Licensed Marks, when used as part of the
Combination Marks pursuant to the licenses granted in this Section 1(a), will
be in standard characters which are either (x) red in color or (y) white
outlined against a red background; provided further, that Licensee's use of
the Combination Marks, in substantially the same manner in which Licensee used
such Combination Marks during the twelve (12) month period immediately prior
to the Closing Date, shall be deemed licensed hereunder. For the avoidance of
doubt, the license grant in Section 1(a)(ii) permits Licensee to use the
Combination Marks on packaging, boxes and packaging tape used by Licensee in
connection with the distribution of Third Party Industrial Goods (but not on
the Third Party Industrial Goods themselves) and the license grant in Section
1(a)(iii) permits Licensee to include the Combination Marks on packaging,
boxes and packaging tape used by Licensee in connection with the distribution
of the Licensee Goods as well on the Licensee Goods themselves.



(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, subject to
Licensee's covenant pursuant to Section 3 to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to phase out use of the Licensed Marks, Licensee is permitted to
continue to use the Licensed Marks as follows to the extent such use is
outside the scope of the applicable license grant in Section 1(a):



(i) during the Term, to sell off any inventory of Licensee Goods that exists
as of the Closing Date and on which the Licensed Mark is affixed;



(ii) during the Term, to continue to display, in connection with the
Business, existing signage that is located, as of the Closing Date, (x) on the
exterior or interior of, or immediately adjacent to, the Facilities, and (y)
on motor and commercial vehicles (including trucks), in each case, on which
the Licensed Mark is affixed;



(iii) during the Term, to continue to use packaging, boxes and packaging tape
that exists as of the Closing Date and on which the Licensed Mark is affixed,
in

 connection with the distribution of Third Party Industrial Goods and Licensee
Goods, until such existing packaging, boxes and packaging tape is exhausted;



(iv) for ninety (90) calendar days following the Closing Date, to continue to
use the advertising and marketing materials that exist as of the Closing Date
and on which the Licensed Mark is affixed;



(v) during the Term, to continue to provide, to Licensee's employees, apparel
that exists as of the Closing Date and on which the Licensed Mark is affixed,
until the existing inventory of such apparel is exhausted;



(vi) for ninety (90) calendar days following the Closing Date, to continue to
use the Licensed Mark on Licensee's company website and intranet site in the
same manner undertaken by Licensee as of the Closing Date; and



(vii) for ninety (90) calendar days following the Closing Date, to continue to
use the Licensed Mark as part of the name PEAK KAMAN in the same way
undertaken by Licensee as of the Closing Date.



(c) Licensee shall not use the Combination Marks or Licensed Domain Names
except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, except as expressly permitted in this Agreement,
no Licensee shall use the Licensed Marks, Combination Marks or Licensed Domain
Names as a portion of, or in combination with, any other trademarks, service
marks, trade names, works, letters, logos or other graphic elements; provided,
however, that Licensee may use the Combination Marks with the new trademarks
adopted by the Licensee to replace the Licensed Marks on notices to its
customers alerting its customers to the change in name of the Licensee so long
as the Combination Marks and the new trademarks are not set out in the notice
in a manner that suggests the creation of a new combination mark. Within sixty
(60) calendar days following the Closing Date, Licensee must file (or causing
to be filed) the appropriate submissions with the applicable Governmental
Authority to effectuate the removal of Kaman from its corporate name.



2. Reservation of Rights. Licensor hereby reserves all rights not expressly granted to Licensee under this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement are subject to Licensor's and its Affiliates' reserved rights to use the Licensed Marks, Combination Marks and Licensed Domain Names in their own respective businesses, including, without limitation, in connection with the manufacture, promotion, advertising, distribution, and sale of any products and services that are the same as, similar to, or otherwise competitive with any Licensed Goods and Services or the Business, anywhere in the world, including, without limitation, the Licensed Territory. 



3\. Term. Unless sooner terminated by any Party in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, the term of this Agreement and the licenses
granted hereby shall commence as of the Closing Date and shall expire five (5)
years after the Closing Date (the "Term"), provided, however, that Licensee
covenants and agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to phase out
the use of the Licensed Marks and Licensed Domain Names as soon as is
reasonably practicable prior to the expiration of the Term. No rights shall
extend to Licensee beyond the expiration or termination of this Agreement.
Licensee is not entitled to any compensatory payment during the Term of this
Agreement or after the expiration or termination of this Agreement.



 4\. Licensed Territory. This Agreement and the licenses granted herein shall
apply within North America, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Caribbean (collectively, the "Licensed Territory").



5\. Quality Control. Licensee acknowledges that uniform and high standards of
quality are necessary to maintain the public image, reputation, widespread
acceptance, and substantial goodwill represented by and associated with the
Licensed Marks and Licensed Domain Names. Licensee shall use the Licensed
Marks and Licensed Domain Names in accordance with the guidelines attached
hereto as Schedule D and any other trademark usage guidelines that Licensor
may furnish to Licensees from time to time, each of which may be revised from
time to time by Licensor, provided, that, Licensor shall provide Licensee with
at least one hundred eighty (180) days' notice of such revisions before
Licensee shall implement such revisions; and provided further, that Licensor
will not provide to Licensee any such notice during the two (2) year period
after the Closing Date. The quality of the Licensed Goods and Services under
this Agreement shall be at least of equal quality to the Licensed Goods and
Services provided by Licensee prior to the Closing Date. Licensee shall comply
with all applicable national, state, regional, provincial, and local laws and
regulations in its performance of this Agreement and the licenses granted
herein. Upon Licensor's request, within five (5) Business Days after such
request, Licensee shall submit to Licensor for Licensor's prior approval (a)
representative samples of use of the Combination Marks or Licensed Domain
Names on or in connection with the Licensed Goods and Services and (b) all
advertising and marketing materials in which any of the Combination Marks or
Licensed Domain Names are used; provided, that, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Licensee may continue to use during the Term all
advertising and marketing materials in existence as of the Closing Date on the
condition that such advertising and marketing materials are compliant with the
scope of the license grant in Section 1(a). If Licensor fails to notify such
Licensee in writing of the disapproval of any such samples or materials within
thirty (30) calendar days after Licensor's receipt, Licensor shall be deemed
to have approved such samples or materials, as applicable. Upon Licensor's
request, within five (5) Business Days after such request, Licensee shall also
submit to Licensor then-current samples of each use of the Combination Marks
or Licensed Domain Names, so that Licensor may assure itself of the
maintenance of quality standards. Where appropriate, Licensee shall cause to
appear on all advertising and marketing materials, and in connection with the
Licensed Goods and Services themselves, a notice sufficient to inform
consumers that the Licensed Marks, as part of the Combination Marks, and
Licensed Domain Names are owned by Licensor (provided, that Licensee shall not
be required to insert notices onto any marketing and promotional materials,
letterhead, business cards and any other similar administrative materials
bearing any of the Combination Marks or Licensed Domain Names existing as of
the Closing Date, on the condition that such materials are compliant with the
scope of the license grant in Section 1(a)).



6\. Intellectual Property Ownership Rights.



(a) Acknowledgement of Licensor's Ownership. Licensee recognizes and
acknowledges Licensor's ownership of all right, title and interest in and to
Licensed Marks and Licensed Domain Names. Licensee further acknowledges,
represents and warrants that it has not acquired, and shall not acquire, any
ownership interest in or to the Licensed Marks or Licensed Domain Names.
Should any such ownership interest become vested in Licensee, by operation of
law or otherwise, such Licensee agrees to assign, and hereby assigns, all such
ownership interest to Licensor without any requirement of further
consideration or documentation. All use by Licensee of the Licensed Marks and
Licensed Domain Names, and all goodwill and benefit arising from such use,
hereby inures to the sole and exclusive benefit of Licensor.

 (b) Cooperation with Licensor. Licensee shall cooperate, at Licensor's cost,
with Licensor in the filing and prosecution of any applications that Licensor
may desire to file with respect to the Licensed Marks or Licensed Domain
Names, and for that purpose, such Licensee shall supply to Licensor from time
to time, and without charge, such samples and materials as may be reasonably
required. Licensee shall execute and deliver to Licensor, at Licensor's cost,
at any time whether during or after the Term of this Agreement, and without
any requirement of further consideration or documentation, such documents as
Licensor may reasonably request in connection with the Licensed Marks and
Licensed Domain Names, including, without limitation, to confirm or record
Licensor's ownership rights therein. Should Licensee fail or refuse to provide
and/or execute any such document, Licensee hereby irrevocably appoints
Licensor, whose power is coupled with an interest, as Licensee's attorney-in-
fact to prepare and/or execute such document in Licensee's name and on
Licensee's behalf, and to institute and prosecute any proceedings as Licensor
may deem necessary or appropriate to secure, protect, or enforce such
intellectual property, including such applications and registrations
therefore. The Parties expressly agree that upon expiration or termination of
this Agreement, all documents filed or recorded with a trademark office or
other authority relating to the licenses granted by this Agreement may be
terminated, cancelled, nullified, and/or withdrawn by Licensor alone and
Licensee hereby agrees and consents to such termination, cancellation,
nullification, and/or withdrawal. Licensee shall not, during the Term of this
Agreement, do anything which would in any way damage, injure, or impair the
validity and subsistence of the Licensed Marks or Licensed Domain Names, nor
shall any Licensee attack, dispute, or challenge, nor aid others to do so,
Licensor's right, title, and interest in and to the Licensed Marks or Licensed
Domain Names, or the validity of this Agreement.



(c) Cessation of Use of Licensed Intellectual Property. Upon expiration or
termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall immediately cease all use of the
Licensed Marks and Licensed Domain Names, and shall, at Licensor's request,
take all steps and actions as may be necessary to reflect or confirm the
expiration, termination, assignment, and/or surrender of Licensee's rights to
use same.



(d) Enforcement. Licensee shall inform Licensor promptly if such Licensee
learns of any products or activities which appear to infringe the Licensed
Marks or Licensed Domain Names. Licensee shall provide, at Licensor's expense,
complete information, cooperation, and assistance to Licensor concerning such
infringements. Upon learning of such infringements, Licensor shall have the
right, but not the obligation, at its sole discretion, to take such action as
Licensor considers necessary or appropriate to enforce Licensor's rights,
including, without limitation, legal action to suppress or eliminate the
infringements. Licensor shall also be entitled to seek and recover all costs,
expenses, and damages resulting from such infringements, including, without
limitation, sums which might otherwise be due to Licensee by operation of law
or otherwise. Licensee has no authority to enforce the rights of Licensor,
including, without limitation, any rights in any Licensed Marks or Licensed
Domain Names, nor shall any Licensee have any right to demand or control
action by Licensor to enforce such rights.



(e) Expenses for Intellectual Property Protection. To the extent that Licensor
engages in clearance, application, registration, recordal, opposition,
cancellation, or similar activities in the Licensed Territory for any of the
Licensed Marks or Licensed Domain Names, Licensor shall pay for such
activities. Licensor shall further pay for any fees, costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorney's fees) in connection with registering,
renewing, or otherwise maintaining any Licensed Domain Names.



7\. Confidential Information. The Parties acknowledge that Licensor and
Licensee will have access to confidential and proprietary information
concerning the other Party, its customers, employees, Affiliates and its
business, which information is not readily available to the public.



(a)Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential
Information" of a Party means information, ideas, materials or other subject
matter of such Party, whether disclosed orally, in writing, electronically or
otherwise, that is provided under circumstances reasonably indicating that it
is confidential or proprietary. "Confidential Information" of a Party will
include any and all trade secrets, processes, techniques, drawings, models,
customer-related information and data, brand standards, computer programs,
databases, business plans, technical data, product ideas, marketing data and
plans, contracts and financial information disclosed or otherwise provided by
the disclosing Party ("Disclosing Party") to the receiving Party ("Receiving
Party"). Confidential Information will not include any information or material
that: (i) is or becomes part of public knowledge other than as a result of any
action or inaction of the Receiving Party; (ii) is disclosed to the Receiving
Party without confidential or proprietary restriction by a third party who
rightfully possesses the information (without confidential or proprietary
restriction); or (iii) is independently developed by the Receiving Party
without reference to the Confidential Information and as evidenced by the
records of the Receiving Party, or (iv) is properly known by the Receiving
Party before receipt thereof from the Disclosing Party; provided, however,
that the foregoing subsection (iv) will not apply to the Confidential
Information of Licensee known to Licensor prior to the Closing Date, or the
Confidential Information of Licensor known to Licensee prior to the Closing
Date.

(b)Restrictions on Use. Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party will
not be used for any purpose other than as expressly permitted under this
Agreement, and will not be disclosed to any third party without the prior
written consent of the Disclosing Party. Each Party agrees to limit access to
the other Party's Confidential Information to those of its Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, contractors and other representatives who: (i)
have a need to know such Confidential Information for purposes of such Party
performing its obligations hereunder; and (ii) are obligated to protect the
confidentiality of such Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall
treat the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party with at least the
same degree of care and protection as it would use with respect to its own
confidential and proprietary information (and in no event less than a
reasonable degree of care). Subject to Section 9(d), the Receiving Party shall
be responsible and liable to the Disclosing Party for any breach of this
Section 7 by the Receiving Party's employees or other third parties receiving
access to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information through or on behalf
of the Receiving Party.

(c)Exclusions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement will not prevent
the Receiving Party from disclosing Confidential Information of the Disclosing
Party to the extent required by a judicial order or other legal obligation;
provided, that, in such event, the Receiving Party shall promptly notify the
Disclosing Party in writing to allow intervention (and shall cooperate with
the Disclosing Party) to contest or minimize the scope of the disclosure
(including application for a protective order). Further, each Party may
disclose the terms and conditions of this Agreement (i) as required by the
applicable securities laws or self-regulatory bodies or the rules, regulations
or policies of any United States or foreign securities exchange, including
requirements to file a copy of this Agreement (redacted to the extent
reasonably permitted by applicable law) or to disclose information regarding
the provisions hereof or performance hereunder to applicable regulatory
authorities, (ii) in confidence, to legal counsel, (iii) in confidence, to
accountants, banks and financing sources and their advisors, and (iv) in
connection with the enforcement of this Agreement or any rights hereunder.

 8\. Expiration or Termination.



(a) Termination for Breach. If either Licensor, on the one hand, or Licensee,
on the other hand, fails to perform or otherwise materially breaches any of
its obligations under this Agreement, the non-breaching Party shall have the
right, without prejudice to any other rights it may have, to terminate this
Agreement by giving ninety (90) calendar days' notice to such breaching Party,
and this notice shall automatically become effective unless the breaching
Party completely remedies the breach within the said ninety (90) calendar day
period.



(b) Termination for Insolvency. If Licensee commences or becomes the subject
of any case or proceeding under the bankruptcy, insolvency, or equivalent laws
of the United States of America or another country, or if a court appoints a
receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, custodian, sequestrator, or other
similar official for Licensee or for any substantial part of Licensee's
property, or if Licensee makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or
if Licensee defaults on any obligation which is secured by a security
interest, in whole or in part, in the Licensed Goods and Services, or if
Licensee fails generally to pay its debts as such debts become due, or if
Licensee takes corporate action in furtherance of any of the foregoing,
Licensee shall give notice of the event immediately to Licensor. Whether or
not such notice is given, Licensor shall have the right upon the occurrence of
any of the foregoing, without prejudice to any other rights Licensor may have,
to terminate this Agreement solely with respect to Licensee by giving written
notice to Licensee, effective immediately.

(c) [Intentionally Omitted]



(d) Termination Resulting from Breach of an Additional Licensee Agreement. In
the event that an Additional Licensee is in breach of one or more of the
provisions in the applicable Additional License Agreement, the effect of
which, after giving effect to any cure period in the Additional License
Agreement, is to cause or permit Licensor to exercise available remedies
(including, without limitation, seeking damages and terminating the Additional
License Agreement), and, at the time of the breach by the Additional Licensee,
Licensee is an Affiliate or Subsidiary of such Additional Licensee, then (i)
Licensee shall be jointly and severally liable for any damages arising under
the Additional License Agreement and (ii) in the event Licensor terminates the
Additional License Agreement, Licensor has the right, at its sole discretion,
to terminate this Agreement by providing Licensee with twenty (20) Business
Days prior written notice, and such termination shall become effective upon
the expiration of such twenty (20) Business Days.



(e) No Further Use of Intellectual Property Upon Termination. Upon the
expiration or termination of this Agreement, all rights in the Licensed Marks
and Licensed Domain Names shall automatically revert to Licensor, and Licensee
immediately shall cease, and thereafter refrain from, all use of the Licensed
Marks and Licensed Domain Names. Upon the expiration or termination of this
Agreement, Licensee shall, at Licensor's discretion and such Licensee's sole
expense, either transfer to Licensor or destroy any remaining materials
bearing the Licensed Marks or Licensed Domain Names, and if destroyed, within
twenty (20) Business Days after such destruction, such Licensee shall certify
in writing to Licensor that all such materials have been destroyed. In the
event of a termination or expiration of this Agreement with respect to any
Licensee, this Agreement shall terminate or expire as to all other Licensees.



 (f) Survival. Sections 6(a), 6(b), 7, 8(e), 8(f), 9(d), and 10 shall survive
the expiration or termination of this Agreement.



9\. Representations and Warranties; Indemnity; Disclaimers and Limitations of
Liability.



(a) Licensor. Licensor represents and warrants that (i) Licensor has the full
right, power, and authority to enter into this Agreement, (ii) that the person
signing this Agreement on behalf of Licensor has been duly authorized to do
so, and (iii) that this Agreement does not conflict with any other agreements
to which Licensor is a party, provided, that, the Additional License
Agreements are excluded from this Section 9(a)(iii).

right, power, and authority to enter into this Agreement, that the person
signing this Agreement on behalf of such Licensee has been duly authorized to
do so, and that this Agreement does not conflict with any other agreements to
which such Licensee is a party. Licensee shall indemnify and hold harmless
Licensor against any and all third party claims, suits, causes of action,
losses, damages, costs, fees, and other expenses (including without limitation
reasonable attorney's fees) arising out of or relating to (a) such Licensee's
(i) breach of its representations and warranties, (ii) performance of its
obligations under this Agreement, or (iii) use of the Licensed Marks or
Licensed Domain Names (other than third party claims which allege that
Licensee's use of the Licensed Marks or Licensed Domain Names, as permitted
under this Agreement, constitutes an infringement of a third party's trademark
rights) or (b) any Additional License Agreements.



(c) DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT,
LICENSOR MAKES NO, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL, REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, WHETHER
EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED MARKS OR LICENSED
DOMAIN NAMES, INCLUDING WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO MERCHANTABILITY, OR
SUITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY
WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR TRADE
USAGE.



(d) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY
CONTAINED HEREIN, THE LIABILITY OF LICENSOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
($20,000.00). TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE
LIABLE UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, OR

 Agreement will be construed against any Party by reason of such role in the
drafting of this Agreement and any other agreement contemplated hereby.



(b) Relationships of the Parties. The Parties are and will remain independent
contractors and not employees or agents of each other. Except as expressly
granted by a Party in writing, neither of Licensor nor any Licensee will have
any authority, express or implied, to act as an agent of such other Party or

partnership, joint venture, fiduciary relationship or employment relationship
among or between the Parties (including their respective officers, employees,
agents or representatives).



(c) Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Purchase Agreement, and, with
respect to Section 8(d), the Additional License Agreements, constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written,

in the case of an amendment, by each Party, or in the case of a waiver, by the

waiver thereof nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege.



(g) Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement will be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their successors and
permitted assigns, except that (a) neither Party may assign, delegate or

or purchaser in the event of any merger, Change of Control, acquisition,
consolidation or restructuring of Licensor or a sale of all or substantially
all of its assets and (b) in the event of a merger or Change of Control of

consent of Licensor shall be required in the event of any merger or Change of
Control of Licensee and all Additional Licensees collectively (x) to one or
