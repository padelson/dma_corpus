2.6 _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) _Post-Closing Estimates_. Within one-hundred twenty (120) days after the

Representative a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth
Purchasers calculation of (i) the Net Working Capital as of the close of
business on the last Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date
(other than Company Transaction Expenses which shall be calculated as of the
Closing and the Closing Employees Bonuses which shall be calculated based on
the amounts listed in column (i) of _Schedule 7.3(a)_ and the amount of
payroll taxes payable thereon) (the " _Actual Working Capital_ "), and (ii)
the Actual Debt, in each case along with reasonable supporting detail to
evidence the calculation of such amounts. The Closing Statement shall be

 



      
 

 



 

prepared in accordance with the definitions of " _Net Working Capital_ ", "
_Cash and Cash Equivalents_ ", " _Indebtedness_ " and " _Company Transaction
Expenses_ " as set forth in this Agreement. The Equityholders Representative
shall have sixty (60) days following his receipt of the Closing Statement (the
" _Review Period_ ") to review the same. On or before the expiration of the
Review Period, the Equityholders Representative shall deliver to Purchaser a
written statement accepting or objecting (with specific reference to, and
supporting calculations, for each item for which he is objecting) to the
Closing Statement (the " _Closing Statement Response Notice_ "). If the
Closing Statement Response Notice is not received by Purchaser prior to the
expiration of the Review Period, the Closing Statement shall be deemed
accepted for all purposes hereunder.

 



 

(b) _Disputes_. In the event that the Equityholders Representative objects to
all or any portion of the Closing Statement within the Review Period,
Purchaser and the Equityholders Representative shall promptly meet and in
good faith attempt to resolve such objections. Any such objections which
cannot be resolved between Purchaser and the Equityholders Representative
within thirty (30) days following Purchasers receipt of the Closing Statement
Response Notice shall be resolved in accordance with this _Section 2.6(b)_.
Should the Equityholders Representative and Purchaser not be able to resolve
such objections set forth in the Closing Statement Response Notice within the
thirty (30) day period described above, the Equityholders Representative and
Purchaser shall within ten (10) days thereafter submit the matter to an
accounting firm mutually acceptable to Purchaser and the Equityholders
Representative (the " _Accounting Referee_ ") for review and resolution, with
instructions to complete the same as promptly as practicable, but in any event
within thirty (30) days of its engagement, and to resolve any objections
consistent with the terms of this Agreement, including making the calculations
in accordance with the definition of " _Net Working Capital_ ", " _Cash and
Cash Equivalents_ ", " _Indebtedness_ " and " _Company Transaction Expenses_ "
as set forth in this Agreement. The Accounting Referee shall only have
authority to make determinations in respect of those specific items for which
an objection has been raised in the Closing Statement Response Notice, and all
determinations shall be based solely on the presentations of Purchaser and the
Equityholders Representative and their respective representatives, and not by
independent review. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Referee:
(i) shall be bound by the principles set forth in this _Section 2.6_ and (ii)
shall not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either the Equityholders Representative or Purchaser or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Equityholders
Representative or Purchaser. The Accounting Referee shall deliver a statement
setting forth its resolution of the dispute within thirty (30) days of the
submission of the dispute to such firm, which resolution, absent manifest
error, shall be binding and conclusive on the parties and not subject to
appeal. The Closing Statement shall be modified if necessary to reflect such
determination by the Accounting Referee. The fees and costs of the Accounting
Referee, if one is required, shall be payable by Purchaser, on the one hand,
and the Equityholders Representative (on behalf of the Equityholders), on the
other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested
amount not awarded to each party bears to the amounts actually contested by
Purchaser and the Equityholders Representative (on behalf of the
Equityholders), as determined by the Accounting Referee.

 



 

(c) _Determinations; Adjustments_.

 



 

(i) If the Actual Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.6_ is less than the Target Working Capital, Purchaser shall be
entitled to such shortfall in accordance with _Section 2.6(d)_. If the Actual
Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.6_ is
greater than the Target Working Capital, the US Equityholders shall be
entitled to such excess in accordance with _Section 2.6(d)_.

 



 

(ii) If the Actual Debt as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.6_
is greater than the Estimated Debt, Purchaser shall be entitled to such excess
in accordance with _Section 2.6(d)_. If the Actual Debt as finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 2.6_ is less than the

 



      
 

 



 

Estimated Debt, the US Equityholders shall be entitled to such shortfall in
accordance with _Section 2.6(d)_.

 



 

(iii) Any amounts payable to the US Equityholders or to Purchaser pursuant to
clauses (i) and (ii) above, if any, shall be aggregated and paid in accordance
with _Section 2.6(d)_ after offsetting any such payments.

 



 

(d) _Payments_. The amount (if any) owed to the US Equityholders, on the one
hand, or to Purchaser, on the other hand, pursuant to _Section 2.6(c)_ above
shall be referred to as the " _Final Closing Adjustment_." In the event that
the Final Closing Adjustment is owed to Purchaser, then an amount in cash
equal to the Final Closing Adjustment may, in the sole discretion of
Purchaser, be paid from the Holdback Amount to Purchaser (and the Holdback
Amount shall thereafter be reduced by such amount) or set-off against any
Anniversary Payments or any 18-Month Payment payable to the US Equityholders
as the same becomes due hereunder through a reduction to the Anniversary
Purchase Price, the 18-Month Purchase Price or directly from the US
Equityholders based on their respective US Pro Rata Portion of such excess. In
the event the Final Closing Adjustment is owed by Purchaser to the US
Equityholders, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay to the US
Equityholders an amount in cash equal to the Final Closing Adjustment, which
amount shall be paid to each US Equityholder based on his, her or its US Pro
Rata Portion in accordance with the instructions of the Equityholders
Representative. Any payment required under this _Section 2.6(d)_ shall be
made within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of the Final
Closing Adjustment.

 



 

2.7 _Holdback_. At the Closing, Purchaser shall withhold the Holdback
Amount from the Anniversary Purchase Price in a separate bank account opened
for purposes of withholding such amount. The Holdback Amount shall be held by
Purchaser in such separate account solely for the purposes set forth in this
Agreement for a period ending on the date that is twelve (12) months following
the Closing Date (the " _Holdback Expiration Date_ "), and shall be available
as one source (and not the exclusive source) to settle certain contingencies
as provided in _Sections 2.6_ and/or _9.2_ ; _provided_ that on the Holdback
Expiration Date, Purchaser shall continue to withhold any portion of the
Holdback Amount which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have, in good faith,
asserted in any unresolved Claim Notices. Each US Equityholders US Pro Rata
Portion of any portion of the Holdback Amount which is not issued or set aside
for the satisfaction of such contingencies will be distributable to the US
Equityholders based on his, her or its US Pro Rata Portion as provided for
herein.

 



 

2.8 _Section 338 Elections; Tax Treatment_.

 



 

(a) At the Purchasers option, subject to the Purchaser and the Equityholders
Representative agreeing on the Tax Adjustment as provided for in _Section
2.8(c)_, the US Company and the US Equityholders shall join with Purchaser in
making an election under Code Section 338(h)(10) (and any corresponding
election under state, local, and foreign Tax Law) with respect to the purchase
and sale of the Common Shares hereunder (collectively, the " _Section
338(h)(10) Election_"). If a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made, the US
Equityholders shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction, or other tax
item resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election on their respective Tax
Returns to the extent required by applicable Law. The Purchaser shall at its
election make an election under Code Section 338(g) with respect to the Indian
Shares. If a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made, then Purchaser shall pay the
Tax Adjustment (as determined pursuant to _Section 2.8(c)_) to the
Equityholders Representative for further distribution to the US
Equityholders.

 



 

(b) If the Purchaser and the Equityholders Representative agree on the Tax
Adjustment as provided for in _Section 2.8(c)_, the US Equityholders, the
Company and Purchaser shall cooperate fully with each other in the making of
the Section 338(h)(10) Election. Following the determination that the

 



      
 

 



 

Section 338(h)(10) Election will be made, each US Equityholder shall deliver
to Purchaser an executed IRS Form 8023 ("Elections Under Section 338 for
Corporations Making Qualified Stock Purchases") and any corresponding forms
identified by Purchaser under applicable state or local Law with respect to
each such election, in each case duly executed by each US Equityholder, and at
any later time reasonably requested by Purchaser, any other documents and
forms identified by Purchaser under applicable Law with respect to each such
election. The Equityholders Representative shall cause the Indian
Equityholders to cooperate fully with the Purchaser in the making of the
election under Section 338(g) at Purchasers request.

 



 

(c) In the event that Purchaser chooses to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election,
the Purchaser shall (i) notify the Equityholders Representative of its
intention to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election and (ii) within one-hundred
fifty (150) days following the Closing, provide to the Equityholders
Representative a written notice setting forth (A) the allocation of the US
Purchase Price for income Tax purposes among the assets of the US Company and
(B) a computation of the Tax Adjustment (the " _Estimated Tax Adjustment_ ").
If requested by Purchaser, each US Equityholder will promptly provide any
information applicable to Purchasers calculation of the Estimated Tax
Adjustment. In the event that the Equityholders Representative disagrees with
the Purchasers computation of the Estimated Tax Adjustment, the
Equityholders Representative shall provide to the Purchaser, within thirty
(30) days of delivery of the Estimated Tax Adjustment, written notice of such
disagreement with an alternative computation of the Tax Adjustment; _provided_
, that if such written notice is not provided within such thirty (30) day
period, the Estimated Tax Adjustment shall be deemed to be the Tax Adjustment.
The Purchaser and the Equityholders Representative shall work together in
good faith to arrive at an agreeable computation of the Tax Adjustment if such
a disagreement notice is delivered within thirty (30) days of delivery of the
notice of disagreement. If Purchaser and the Equityholders Representative
cannot resolve any such disagreement with respect to the Tax Adjustment in
good faith prior to the date that the Section 338(h)(10) Election is due, the
Purchaser shall not make the Section 338(h)(10) Election.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this Agreement, if
the Section 338(h)(10) Election is later invalidated or rejected by a Taxing
authority, each US Equityholder shall promptly (and in any event, within five
(5) Business Days) pay to Purchaser, upon Purchasers request, an amount equal
to his, her or its US Pro Rata Portion of the Tax Adjustment by wire transfer
of immediately available funds.

 



 

(e) As promptly as practicable following the Closing, and in any event within
sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, the US Equityholders shall use
reasonable best efforts to take all actions required so that for all dates
since the US Companys incorporation until the Closing Date, the US Company
has qualified as a "small business corporation" within the meaning of Section
1361(b)(1) of the Code. The US Equityholders will keep Purchaser informed
regarding all developments and correspondence with the IRS regarding such
actions and an opportunity to consult regarding any responses to, and
participate in any discussions with, the IRS.

 



 

2.9 _Designated Purchasers_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, with respect to the Indian Shares to be purchased from the Indian
Equityholders, upon prior written notice to the Company, Purchaser shall
designate one or more Affiliates of Purchaser (whether or not existing as of
the date hereof) as a designated purchaser hereunder (each such designee, a "
_Designated Purchaser_ "). The designation contemplated hereby shall set forth
the name of the Designated Purchaser and the Indian Shares such Designated
Purchaser is to acquire at the Closing. Upon the designation contemplated
hereby, each Designated Purchaser shall be deemed a Purchaser for purposes of
this Agreement in connection with the acquisition of the applicable Indian
Shares (and any reference to Purchaser herein in connection therewith shall
automatically be deemed to be a reference to such Designated Purchaser) and
such Designated Purchaser shall automatically be assigned the rights and
obligations under this Agreement necessary in connection with such
designation; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall remain liable and
responsible for

 



       
 

 



 

any and all obligations and liabilities of Purchaser hereunder, including all
payment obligations of Purchaser, as if such designation did not occur. Unless
Purchaser otherwise provides written notice of a change to the Designated
Purchaser, the Designated Purchaser shall be Virtusa Consulting Services
Private Limited and Virtusa Software Services Private Limited for all Indian
Shares.

Person in respect of which such withholding was made.

duly licensed or qualified to do business as a foreign corporation under the
Laws of each jurisdiction listed on _Schedule 4.1(a)_ and each other
jurisdiction in which the ownership, operation or leasing of its properties or
assets or in which the transaction of its business makes such qualification
necessary, except such jurisdictions where the failure to be so licensed or

Material Adverse Effect. The Companys Organizational Documents, current and
effective copies of which have been made available to Purchaser or the
Designated Purchaser, as the case may be, are complete and correct, and no
amendments thereto are pending. The minute books (containing the records of

thereby. Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Purchaser and the Equityholders, this Agreement and each of the
Related Agreements constitutes or will constitute a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors
rights generally and by general equitable principles (regardless of whether

arrangement" (as such term is defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA), and neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever
incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA that has not been paid in full.

to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (" _Equityholder Prepared Returns_ ") on a basis
consistent with prior practice unless otherwise not permitted by applicable
Law. The Equityholders Representative shall provide a draft of any such Tax
Return and related workpapers, in each case that could reasonably be expected

Closing Date, to Purchaser for its review and comment at least (15) Business
Days prior to the respective due date of such Tax Return. The Equityholders
Representative shall consider in good faith any changes reasonably requested

file or shall cause to be prepared and filed all other Tax Returns required to
be filed by the Company and any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date for

unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) _Tax Contests_. Purchaser shall promptly notify the Equityholders
Representative in writing upon receipt by Purchaser, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of notice in writing of any audit or other administrative
proceeding or inquiry or judicial proceeding involving Taxes that could give
rise to a claim for indemnification under _Section 9.2_ (a " _Tax Contest_
"); _provided_ _,_ that the failure of the notified party to give any other
party notice as provided herein shall not relieve such other party of its
indemnification obligations under _Article IX_ except to the extent that such
other party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. Purchaser shall
have the exclusive right to control, conduct and settle any such Tax Contest,
shall keep the Equityholders Representative reasonably informed of all

Equityholders Representative copies of any written material correspondence
received from the Taxing authority related to such Tax Contest as reasonably
requested by the Equityholders Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that

solely to an Equityholder Prepared Return; _provided_ , _further_ , that
Purchaser shall be entitled to participate in any such Tax Contest at its sole
cost and expense and the Equityholders Representatives shall not be entitled
to settle or compromise any such matter with respect to an Equityholder
Prepared Return without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which such
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the
event of any conflict or overlap between the provisions of this _Section
7.4(b)_ and _Section 9.4_, the provisions of this _Section 7.4(b)_ shall
control.

 



 

(c) _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of this Agreement, in order to apportion
appropriately any Taxes relating to a Straddle Period, the portion of any
Taxes that are allocable to the Straddle Period shall be (i) in the case of
income Taxes and all other Taxes that are not imposed on a periodic

 



      
 

 



 

basis, the amount that would be payable if the taxable year or period ended on
the Closing Date based on an interim closing of the books (and for such
purpose, the Tax period of any controlled foreign corporation, partnership or
other pass-through entity in which the Company holds a beneficial interest
shall be deemed to terminate at such time) and (ii) in the case of any Taxes
that are imposed on a periodic basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
relevant period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the
number of days from the beginning of the period up to and including the
Closing Date and the denominator of which shall be the number of days in the
entire period.

 



 

(d) _Tax Cooperation_. Purchaser, the US Company, its Subsidiaries and the
Equityholders Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other parties hereto, in connection with the
filing, preparation and review of Tax Returns, and any Tax audits, Tax
proceedings or other Tax-related claims (including claims under this
Agreement). Such cooperation shall include providing records and information
that are reasonably relevant to any such matters and in their possession (or
if not in their possession, if reasonably able to obtain), making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information,
and explaining any materials provided pursuant to this _Section 7.4(d)_.
Purchaser, the US Company, its Subsidiaries and the Equityholders
Representative shall not destroy or dispose of any Tax workpapers, schedules
or other materials and documents in their possession or under their control
supporting Tax Returns of the US Company for Pre-Closing Tax Periods until the
seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date.

 



 

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use, transfer, value added, goods and
services, gross receipts, excise, conveyance and documentary, stamp,
recording, registration, conveyance and similar Taxes and fees incurred in

applicable Law to file any Tax Return with respect to Transfer Taxes shall do
so in the time and manner prescribed by applicable Law.

 



 

7.5 _Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event prior to the date that
is twenty one (21) days following the Closing Date (the " _Financial Statement
Completion Date_ "), the US Equityholders and the US Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and
delivered to Purchaser, and the US Equityholders shall cause the Indian
Equityholders to cooperate in the preparation of, the historical financial
information, which Purchaser reasonably determines is required to be audited
in accordance with US Generally Accepted Auditing Standards as consistently
applied by Purchaser (" _GAAS_ ") or reviewed in the case of interim
financials and filed by Purchaser with the SEC pursuant to Item 9.01 of the
Current Report on Form 8-K as contemplated by the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder as such required financial information
is modified by any relief granted to Purchaser by the SEC with respect to the
scope of financial information required to be filed together with an audit
opinion or review report thereon, as applicable, from the Audit Accountants
(as defined herein) in the form required by the SEC and applicable stock
exchange (the " _Historical Financial Information_ "). The Historical
Financial Information will be prepared in accordance with GAAP as of the dates
and for the periods indicated. The US Equityholders will, and will cause the
Indian Equityholders to, also cooperate in all reasonable respects with S.R.
Batliboi and Associates LLP (the " _Audit Accountant_ ") in connection with this
audit of the Historical Financial Information in accordance with GAAS.

 



 

(b) The US Equityholders will, and will cause the Indian Equityholders to,
cooperate in all reasonable respects with Purchaser in Purchasers preparation
of the pro forma financial information relating to the acquisition required
pursuant to Item 9.01 of the Current Report on Form 8-K as contemplated by the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Pro
Forma Financial Information_ ", and together with the Historical Financial
Information, the " _Required Financial Information_ "), and will generally
cooperate with Purchasers reasonable requests in order to facilitate such
preparation.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The parties further acknowledge that the foregoing financial information
must be filed by Purchaser with the SEC under cover of an amendment to a
Current Report on Form 8-K not less than seventy-one (71) calendar days after
the initial filing of such Current Report on Form 8-K (the " _Required Filing
Date_ "), which initial filing must be filed by Purchaser with the SEC not
less than four (4) days (as calculated under the SECs rules and regulations)
after the Closing Date. Accordingly, time is of the essence with respect to
the observance of this _Section 7.5_. The parties also acknowledge that any
Purchaser filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, that require
the Required Financial Information also necessitate timely cooperation,
including cooperation in the performance of incremental audit procedures
necessary, by the US Company and the US Equityholders to facilitate the
execution and filing of the Audit Accountants Consent.

Date, the US Equityholders agree, on a joint and several basis, to pay
Purchaser $1.5 million in liquidated damages (the " _Penalty Fee_ ").

 



 

(e) Prior to the signing of this Agreement, the Company and the Equityholders
Representative have made available to the Purchaser and its representatives,
and the Purchaser shall continue to have access to such information during the
Pre-Closing Period and following the Closing, the Equityholders
Representative shall continue to make available to the Purchaser and its
representatives (including the Audit Accountant), all information required to
prepare and deliver the Required Financial Information.

GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR
SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

 



 

(c) Releasor understands the significance of this release of unknown claims
and waiver of statutory protection against a release of unknown claims, and
acknowledges and agrees that this waiver is essential and material
consideration in exchange for the entry of Purchaser into this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Releasor represents and acknowledges that it, he or she has read this
release and understands its terms and has been given an opportunity to ask
questions of the Companys representatives, and to consult with independent
legal counsel of its, his or her own choosing. Releasor further represents
that in signing this release it, he or she does not rely, and has not relied,
on any representation or statement not set forth in this release made by any
representative of the Company or anyone else with regard to the subject
matter, basis or effect of this release or otherwise.

 



 

(e) Releasor hereby acknowledges and agrees that neither the release provided
hereunder nor the furnishing of the consideration for the release given
hereunder will be deemed or construed at any time to be an admission by any
Released Party or Releasor of any improper or unlawful conduct.

 



 

(f) Releasor hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly or
indirectly, asserting any claim, or commencing, instituting or causing to be
commenced, any action, Proceeding, charge, complaint, or investigation of any
kind against any of the Released Parties, in any forum whatsoever (including
any administrative agency), that is based upon any Claim purported to be
released hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
in this release, it is understood and agreed that the release given herein
does not prohibit Releasor from filing an administrative charge with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission or similar equal employment
opportunity/anti-discrimination administrative agency (federal, state or
local). The Releasor, however, waives any right to monetary or other recovery
in connection with any such charge and/or in the event any such federal, state
or local administrative agency pursues any claims on the Releasors behalf or
otherwise in connection with any such charge or relating to the Releasors
employment with Purchaser, the Company or any Affiliate, successor or assign.

 



       
 

 



 

(g) This release may be pleaded by the Released Parties as a full and complete
defense regarding any matter purported to be released hereby and may be used
as the basis for an injunction against any action at law or equity instituted
or maintained against them regarding such matter in violation of this _Section
7.6_. In the event any Claim is brought or maintained by a Releasor against
any Released Party in violation of this Agreement, the applicable Releasor
shall be responsible for all costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees, incurred by the Released Parties in defending same.

 



 

7.7 _Restrictive Covenants_. For a period of three (3) years following the
Closing Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "): (a) Aniruddha Gadre shall not
directly or indirectly, through an Affiliate or otherwise, anywhere in the
Restricted Territory, whether as owner, partner, shareholder, director,
manager, consultant, agent, employee, co-venturer or otherwise, engage,
participate or invest in any business activity (including in respect of
developing, manufacturing or marketing any product or the performance of any
service) that is competitive with the products or services of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the forgoing shall not prohibit any possible investment in publicly traded
stock of a Person representing less than two percent (2%) of the outstanding
stock of such Person so long as Aniruddha Gadre shall not, directly or
indirectly, through an Affiliate or otherwise, anywhere in the Restricted
Territory have active participation in the management of such Person.
Aniruddha Gadre may request the Purchasers prior written consent to be
employed by or act as an employee, consultant or independent contractor during
the Restricted Period of an entity that engages, _inter alia ¸_ in a business
that competes with the Companys business if Aniruddha Gadre is (and continues
to be), during the Restricted Period, employed or assigned as an employee,
consultant or independent contractor solely in a division or other segment of
such entity that does not (during the Restricted Period) engage in a business
that competes with the Companys business and Aniruddha Gadre otherwise
complies with this _Section 7.7_, which Purchaser consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; (b) Aniruddha Gadre shall not
directly or indirectly, through an Affiliate or otherwise, other than for the
benefit of the Company, Purchaser or their respective Subsidiaries, call upon,
solicit, divert, take away, accept or conduct any business from or with any of
the suppliers or customers or prospective customers of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or cause any such suppliers or customers to terminate or
adversely affect or materially reduce their business relationship with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (c) no US Equityholder, either alone or
in conjunction with any of his Affiliates, shall directly or indirectly
solicit, entice, attempt to persuade any employee, independent contractor or
consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to leave for any reason
or otherwise participate in or facilitate the hire, directly or through
another entity, of any person who is employed or engaged by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or who was employed or engaged by the Company, Purchaser
or their respective Subsidiaries within twelve (12) months of any attempt to
hire such Person. Each US Equityholder acknowledges and agrees that the length
of the covenants set forth in this _Section 7.7_ are reasonable and narrowly
drawn to impose no greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (after giving effect to the consummation
of the Purchase). The Restricted Period shall be extended by each day the
Restricted Party is in breach of this _Section 7.7_. No breach by the
Company, Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries of their
Contractual or other legal obligations to a US Equityholder shall constitute a
defense to enforcement of this _Section 7.7_. Each US Equityholder
acknowledges and agrees that Purchasers failure to receive the entire
goodwill and confidential information of the Company and its Subsidiaries
would have the effect of substantially reducing the value of the Company to
Purchaser, and this _Section 7.7_ is necessary for the protection of such
goodwill and confidential information and thus is a condition to Purchaser
entering into this Agreement.

 



 

7.8 _Termination of Agreements_. Except for this Agreement, the Related
Agreements, the Key Employee Offer Documents and those agreements set forth on
_Schedule 7.8_, unless otherwise instructed in writing by Purchaser prior to
the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall terminate all Contracts
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and one or
more Interested Parties, on the other hand, prior to the Closing, in each case
without any remaining Liability of any kind on the part of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries, Purchaser or its Affiliates as a result of or in connection
with such

 



      
 

 



 

termination or such Contract. Each such termination agreement shall be in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser.

 



 

7.9 _Further Assurances; Integration Assistance_. Except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts before and after the Closing Date to take or cause to be
taken all action, to do or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other party hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as the
other party hereto may reasonably require in order to carry out the intent of
this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Aniruddha Gadre agrees to
provide (a) twenty (20) hours per week during the ninety (90) day period
following the Closing Date and (b) as needed (but not to exceed twenty (20)
hours per month) for the period starting the ninetieth (90th) day following
the Closing Date until one hundred equity (180) days following the Closing
Date, in each case for purposes of integration of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries with the business of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries and
other advisory services, including assistance in the preparation of the
Required Financial Information.

due (after a final determination of the amount of Losses, through mutual
agreement, court or otherwise) prior to the payment of the Anniversary
Payments or the 18-Month Payments to the US Equityholders, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties may set-off the amount of such Losses with respect to such
claim against any Anniversary Payments or any 18-Month Payments payable to the
US Equityholders as the same becomes due hereunder through a reduction to the
Anniversary Purchase Price; and (B) to the extent the Anniversary Payments or
the 18-Month Payments have been paid or the remaining Anniversary Payments and
the 18-Month Payments to be paid are insufficient (together with any portion
of the Holdback Amount that remains withheld) to cover the entire amount of
such indemnifiable Losses, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may thereafter
seek recovery directly from the US Equityholders based on its, his or her US
Pro Rata Portion. Subject to the foregoing, if a US Equityholder is obligated
to indemnify or reimburse any Purchaser Indemnified Party for any
indemnification claim hereunder, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may set-off
the amount of Losses with respect to such claim (after a final determination
of the amount of Losses owed to such Purchaser Indemnified Party, through
mutual agreement, court or otherwise) against any amounts payable by Purchaser
or its Affiliates to such US Equityholder as the same becomes due; _provided_
, that the Holdback Amount may be held by the Purchaser pending the final
resolution of a claim as provided for in _Section 2.7_.

 



 

(h) If payment is to be made to a Purchaser Indemnified Party from the
Holdback Amount (with a corresponding reduction to the Holdback Amount),
Purchaser and the Equityholders Representative shall take all actions
required to release from the Holdback Amount to the applicable Purchaser
Indemnified Party the amount of cash so payable. If payment is to be made to a
US Equityholder from the Holdback Amount, Purchaser and the Equityholders
Representative shall take all actions required to release from the Holdback
Amount to the Equityholders Representative for further distribution to the US
Equityholders based on its, his or her US Pro Rata Portion of the amount of
cash so payable.

 



 

(i) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries for
purposes of this _Section 9.2_ and shall have the right to enforce the
provisions hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

9.3 _Purchaser Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Article IX_, from and after the
Closing, Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the US Equityholders
from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse the US Equityholders for,
all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by the US Equityholders, or any of
them, arising under or as a result of any of the following:

 



 

(i) any breach (or an allegation that would amount to a breach in the case of
a third party claim) of a representation or warranty contained in _Article
VI_, or any certificate delivered by or on behalf of Purchaser in connection
herewith;

 



 

(ii) any failure by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries to perform or comply
with any covenant or agreement applicable to Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries contained in this Agreement; and

 



 

(iii) any fraud, intentional misrepresentation or, with respect to covenants,
willful breach of this Agreement, the Indian Equity Purchase Agreement or any
certificate delivered by or on behalf of Purchaser in connection herewith or
therewith by Purchaser, any of its Subsidiaries or any authorized
representative thereof.

 



 

(b) For the purpose of this _Section 9.3_, (i) when determining whether a
breach has occurred of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
given or made by Purchaser that is qualified or limited in scope as to
material, material adverse effect, Purchaser Material Adverse Effect or any
other materiality qualifications or limitations, account shall be taken of
such qualifications and/or limitations; and (ii) following the occurrence of a
breach, when determining the amount of any Losses resulting or arising from
such breach, such qualifications and/or limitations shall be ignored.

 



 

(c) Purchaser hereby agrees that the US Equityholders rights to
indemnification, compensation and reimbursement contained in this _Article
IX_ relating to the representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of
Purchaser are part of the basis of the bargain contemplated by this Agreement
and the Related Agreements; and such representations, warranties, covenants
and obligations, and the rights and remedies that may be exercised by the US
Equityholders with respect thereto, shall not be waived, limited or otherwise
affected by or as a result of (and the US Equityholders shall be deemed to
have relied upon such representations, warranties, covenants or obligations
notwithstanding) any knowledge on the part of any of the US Equityholders or
any of their representatives (regardless of whether obtained through any
investigation by any US Equityholder or any representative of any US
Equityholder or through disclosure by Purchaser or any other Person, and
regardless of whether such knowledge was obtained before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement) or by reason of the fact that a US
Equityholder or any of its representatives knew or should have known that any
representation or warranty is or might be inaccurate or untrue. For purposes
of this Agreement, each statement or other item of information set forth in
the Schedules delivered by Purchaser or any US Equityholder shall be deemed to
qualify the representations and warranties made by Purchaser in this
Agreement.

 



 

(d) The US Equityholders indemnification rights pursuant to _Section 9.3_
shall be limited as follows:

 



 

(i) The US Equityholders shall not be entitled to any recovery resulting from
_Section 9.3(a)(i)_ until such time (if at all) as the total amount of all
Losses that have been suffered or incurred by any one or more of the US
Equityholders with respect to such matters exceeds the Basket; and in such
event, US Equityholders shall, subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 9.3(d)(ii)_, be entitled to be indemnified against and compensated
and reimbursed for all

 



       
 

 



 

Losses that have been suffered or incurred by the US Equityholders, from the
first dollar of Losses, including the Basket; _provided_ , that the limitation
set forth in this _Section 9.3(d)(i)_ shall not apply to any indemnification
claims for (i) any fraud, intentional misrepresentation or, with respect to
covenants, willful breach or (ii) any breach (or alleged breach) of the
Fundamental Representations.

 



 

(ii) The maximum amount that the US Equityholders may recover from Purchaser
for any Losses that have been suffered or incurred by the US Equityholders:

 



 

(A) under _Section 9.3(a)(i)_ shall be limited to the General Cap; _provided_
, that (i) in the case of any breach, alleged breach or inaccuracy of the
Fundamental Representations of Purchaser, the maximum amount that the US
Equityholders may recover from Purchaser shall be limited to the aggregate
Consideration received by all US Equityholders pursuant to this Agreement and
the Indian Equity Purchase Agreement (including any amounts received under
_Section 2.1(d)_ following the Closing) (not including indemnifiable amounts
under this _Section 9.3_), in each case, except as provided for under
_Section 9.3(d)(ii)(C)_;

 



 

(B) under _Section 9.3(a)_ (other than _Section 9.3(a)(i)_) shall be limited
to the aggregate Consideration received by all Equityholders pursuant to this
Agreement and the Indian Equity Purchase Agreement (including any amounts
received under _Section 2.1(d)_ following the Closing) (not including
indemnifiable amounts under this _Section 9.3_), in each case, except as
provided for under _Section 9.3(d)(ii)(C)_; and

 



 

(C) in the case of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or, with respect to
covenants, willful breach, there shall be no limit on the amount recoverable
by the US Equityholders.

 



 

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, if and solely to the extent the amount of a
Loss is recovered by a US Equityholder through the actual payment of a payable
claim hereunder to such US Equityholder, the same amount of such Loss shall
not be recovered again by such US Equityholder by reason of such Loss being
subject to indemnification under more than one provision of this Agreement,
but, in the case of the immediately preceding clauses, the amount, if any, of
Loss that exceeds the amount already recovered under such clause shall be
recoverable on and subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article IX_.

 



 

9.4 _Notice; Defense of Claims_. Any Indemnified Party may make claims for
indemnification hereunder by giving prompt written notice thereof to the
Equityholders Representative, in the case of claims made by a Purchaser
Indemnified Party, or to Purchaser, in the case of claims made by a US
Equityholder. If indemnification is sought for a claim by or in respect of any
third party, the Indemnified Party shall also give the Equityholders
Representative or Purchaser, as the applicable Indemnifying Party, a Claim
Notice as to which such Indemnified Party may request indemnification
hereunder or as to which the Basket may be applied as soon as is practicable
and in any event within twenty (20) days of the time that such Indemnified
Party learns of such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to do so
shall not relieve the Indemnified Party from any Liability except to the
extent that it is materially prejudiced by the failure or delay in giving such
notice. In the case of any third party claim, the Equityholders
Representative or Purchaser, as or on behalf of the applicable Indemnifying
Parties, shall have the right to direct, through counsel reasonably determined
by it, the defense or settlement of any such claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that prior to the Indemnifying Party assuming control of such defense, it
shall first verify in writing to the Indemnified Party that such Indemnifying
Party shall be fully responsible (with no reservation of any rights) for all
Liabilities relating to such third party claim and that it shall provide full
indemnification (subject to the limitations on the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnifying Partys obligations to provide indemnification as may be set
forth herein) to the Indemnified Party with respect to such third party claim
by paying any resulting Losses directly to the parties entitled thereto upon
resolution of such claims; _provided further_ that the Indemnifying Party
shall not have the right to assume control of such defense and shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if
and to the extent the Indemnifying Party is determined to have to pay Losses
to the Indemnified Party, if the third party claim which the Indemnifying
Party seeks to assume control: (i) seeks non-monetary relief or, in the case
of a Governmental Body, the imposition of a fine or other disciplinary remedy,
(ii) involves criminal or quasi-criminal allegations, (iii) involves a
Customer or Supplier or (iv) involves a claim which the Indemnifying Party
failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend. If the Equityholders
Representative or Purchaser, as or on behalf of the applicable Indemnifying
Parties, elects to assume the defense of any such claim, the Equityholders
Representative or Purchaser, as applicable, shall consult with the Indemnified
Party for the purpose of allowing the Indemnified Party to participate in such
defense. If the Equityholders Representative or Purchaser, as or on behalf of
the applicable Indemnifying Parties, elects not to defend or if, after
commencing or undertaking any such defense, the Equityholders Representative
or Purchaser, as applicable, fails to diligently prosecute or withdraws from
such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the
defense. If the Equityholders Representative or Purchaser, as or on behalf of
the applicable Indemnifying Parties, does not so assume control of such
defense, the Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The Non-controlling
Party may participate therein at its own expense, which expense shall not be
recoverable as part of any indemnification claim. The Non-controlling Party
shall provide, and shall cause Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries or
the US Equityholders to provide, as applicable, the Controlling Party and its
counsel with access to its records and personnel relating to any such third
party claim during normal business hours and shall otherwise cooperate with
the Controlling Party in the defense or settlement thereof. If the Controlling
Party elects to direct the defense of any such claim, the Non-controlling
Party shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of any claim or demand
arising from such asserted liability unless Controlling Party consents in
writing to such payment. If the Controlling Party assumes the defense of any
such claim and proposes to settle such claim prior to a final judgment
thereon, then the Controlling Party shall give the Non-controlling Party
prompt written notice thereof, and the Non-controlling Party shall have the
right to approve (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) the settlement of such Proceeding; provided, that in the case
where the Controlling Party is Purchaser, Purchaser may settle any such claim
without the approval of the Equityholders Representative or any other Person,
but such settlement of any such claim shall not be determinative of the amount
of Losses relating to such matter except to the extent the settlement reduces
the amount of the Losses.

 



 

9.5 _Remedies Exclusive_. This _Article IX_ shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy after the Closing for recovery of Losses by any Indemnified
Party as a result of breaches of representations and warranties by any party
contained in this Agreement, and any covenant, obligation or agreement to be
performed by a party after the Closing under this Agreement; _provided_ , that
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement
shall limit the rights or remedies of any Indemnified Party (a) in the case of
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or, with respect to covenants, willful
breach (except as provided for in _Section 9.2(f)(ii)(C)_), or (b) with
respect to specific performance, injunctive and other equitable relief.

 



 

9.6 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Except as required by applicable Laws,
all payments made pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be treated as
adjustments to the Consideration for Tax purposes and such agreed treatment
shall govern for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

9.7 _Offsets_. The Purchaser Indemnified Parties right to indemnification
pursuant to this _Article IX_ on account of any Losses will be reduced by all
insurance proceeds actually received by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
under any Insurance Tails or other third party indemnification or contribution
proceeds actually received by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under
Contracts to which the Company or one of its

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries is a party as of the Closing Date, in each case in respect of
those Losses, net of applicable costs and expenses involved in seeking such
recovery (including increases in premiums relating thereto). Purchaser shall
use good faith efforts to seek such recovery from such insurance providers or
third party indemnities as if this _Article IX_ did not exist.

 



 

9.8 _Mitigation_. Each party hereto shall use, and shall cause its respective
Affiliates (and their respective officers, directors, managers, partners,
employees, agents and representatives) to use, all commercially reasonable
steps to mitigate any Losses upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance
that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise to any Losses.

Representative_. A majority in interest of the US Equityholders (measured by a
majority of the US Pro Rata Portions of the Equityholders) shall have the
right at any time to remove the then-acting Equityholders Representative and
to appoint a successor Equityholders Representative; _provided_ , _however_ ,

Affiliates (including the US Company) as collateral security.

 



 

11.4 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue
in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the
intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void
or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; (b) reference to any

Related Agreement and any other agreement contemplated hereby.

 



 

11.7 _Choice of Law/Consent to Jurisdiction_. All disputes, claims or
controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its rules of conflict of
laws. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts of the
State of Delaware and of the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ ") for any Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance

 



      
 

 



 

of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to
commence any Proceeding relating thereto except in such courts), waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any such Proceeding in the Chosen Courts
and agrees not to plead or claim in any Chosen Court that such Proceeding
brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each of the
parties hereto agrees, (a) to the extent such party is not otherwise subject
to service of process in the State of Delaware (pursuant to clause (b) below
or otherwise), to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of Delaware as
such partys agent for acceptance of legal process and (b) that service of
process may also be made on such party by prepaid certified mail with a proof
of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal Service constituting
evidence of valid service. Service made pursuant to clauses (a) or (b) above
shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such party
personally within the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing,
the calculations made in the Closing Statement shall be resolved in accordance
with the provisions of _Section 2.6_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 



 

11.8 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended only by a written instrument
executed by the Equityholders Representative and Purchaser.

 



 

11.9 _No Agreement Until Executed_. Irrespective of negotiations among the
parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement shall
not constitute or be deemed to evidence a contract, agreement, arrangement or
understanding among the parties hereto unless and until this Agreement is
executed and delivered by the parties hereto.

 



 

11.10 _Mutual Drafting_. The parties hereto are sophisticated and have been
represented by attorneys throughout the transactions contemplated hereby who
have carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a consequence, the parties
do not intend that the presumptions of laws or rules relating to the
interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any particular clause
should be applied to this Agreement or any agreement or instrument executed in
connection herewith, and therefore waive their effects.

 



 

11.11 _Specific Performance_. Each party agrees that in the event of a breach
of this Agreement by such party, money damages may be inadequate and the other
party may have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, each party agrees that
the other party shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and
remedies existing in its favor, to enforce its rights and the other partys
obligations hereunder not only by an action or actions for damages but also by
an action or actions for equitable relief, including injunction and specific
performance. If any such action is brought by a party to enforce this
Agreement, the other party hereby waives the defense that there is an adequate
remedy at law or the requirement for the posting of any bond or similar
security.

 



 

11.12 _Miscellaneous_. This Agreement, together with the Schedules and
Exhibits hereto, and any documents executed by the parties simultaneously
herewith or pursuant thereto, constitute the entire agreement of the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, including that certain Letter of Intent
dated October 23, 2017. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefits of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns
and, except as expressly set forth herein, is not intended to confer upon any
other Person any rights or remedies hereunder. This Agreement may be executed
in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any signature
page delivered electronically or by facsimile (including transmission by
