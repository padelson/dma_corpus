If Seller disagrees with Purchaser&#146;s Allocation, Seller may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of Purchaser&#146;s

days immediately following such delivery, use commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts
in order to determine the allocation of the Purchase Price (and other relevant amounts), which allocation shall incorporate, reflect
and be consistent with the Allocation Principles. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly
thereafter cause the Independent Accounting Firm to resolve any remaining disputes. Any allocation of the Purchase Price (and other
relevant amounts) determined pursuant to the decision of the Independent Accounting Firm shall incorporate, reflect and be consistent
with the Allocation Principles. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Independent Accounting
Firm shall be borne equally by Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand. The allocation of the Purchase Price
(and other relevant amounts), as prepared by Purchaser if no Seller&#146;s Allocation Notice has been given, or as adjusted pursuant
to any agreement between Seller and Purchaser or as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm (the &#147;<U>Allocation</U>&#148;)
shall be conclusive and binding on all Parties. The Allocation shall be adjusted, as necessary, to reflect any subsequent adjustments

respective Affiliates) to prepare and file all relevant federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns (including, without limitation,
the Section 338(h)(10) Forms) in accordance with the Allocation. None of Seller or Purchaser shall (and each shall cause its Affiliates
not to) take any position inconsistent with the Allocation on any Tax Return or in any Tax Proceeding, in each case, except to
the extent otherwise required pursuant to a &#147;determination&#148; within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any

the FMC Marks, and (a)&nbsp;neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the members of the Alkali

Alkali Group), and (c)&nbsp;neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the members of the Alkali
Group) shall (i) use, register or seek to use or register in any jurisdiction any of the FMC Marks or (ii) contest the use, ownership,

to the contrary set forth in this <U>Section 5.15</U>, (x) the members of the Alkali Group may continue to use the Railcar Marks
on railcars, so long as such railcars are leased or subleased from a member of the Seller Group (the &#147;<U>Permitted Railcar

the Alkali Group or in any existing tangible materials or software acquired by Purchaser under this Agreement in the same manner
as used by the members of the Alkali Group prior to the Closing Date, in the case of clause (y) only, solely as necessary to wind
down the use of, and transition away from, such FMC Marks. For the avoidance of doubt, during the Phase-out Period, Purchaser shall
not (and shall cause its Affiliates, including, after the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group, not to) print, copy or create
any tangible materials (including printed materials and electronic materials) bearing or incorporating the FMC Marks (other than
for the Permitted Railcar Use). At the end of such Phase-out Period, Purchaser shall (and shall cause its Affiliates, including,
after the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group, to) have used their best efforts to have re-labelled, destroyed or exhausted
all materials bearing or incorporating the FMC Marks (other than the Railcar Marks used in the Permitted Railcar Use), including
signage, advertising, promotional materials, software, packaging, inventory, electronic materials, collateral goods, stationery,
business cards, websites, and other materials, and have made all filings with any office, agency or body to effect the elimination
of any use of the FMC Marks (other than the Railcar Marks used in the Permitted Railcar Use) in the Business (including in the
respective corporate or other legal names of the members of the Alkali Group), so as to bring Purchaser and its Affiliates, including,
after the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group, into compliance with this <U>Section 5.15</U>. Following the end of the Phase-out

Seller, Purchaser shall or shall cause its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group), as applicable,
to promptly destroy or re-label the relevant materials incorporating the FMC Marks and shall certify (pursuant to a certificate
signed by an authorized officer of Purchaser) the completion of such destruction or re-labelling. After the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates, including, after the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group, not to) represent that

this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated <FONT STYLE="background-color: white">so

</FONT><U>Specific Performance</U>. The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would
not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform any provision of this Agreement in accordance
with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Parties shall
be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
in Law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance
is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond
or other security in connection with such order or injunction. The foregoing is in addition to any other remedy to which any Party
is entitled at law, in equity or otherwise. The Parties further agree that nothing set forth in this <U>Section 11.11</U> shall
require any Party to institute any Action for (or limit any Party&#146;s right to institute any Action for) specific performance
under this <U>Section 11.11</U> prior to or as a condition to exercising any termination right under <U>Article IX</U> (and pursuing
damages after such termination). If any Party brings any Action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
hereof by any other Party, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (x) the amount of time during which such action
is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days or (y) such other time period established by the court presiding over such action. The
Parties agree that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall be entitled to specific performance (or any other
equitable relief) to cause Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event
shall Seller be entitled to seek any remedy of specific performance or other equitable remedies directly against any Debt Financing
Source.</P>

</FONT>Parent, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the full and
timely payment and performance of the obligations of Purchaser (the &#147;<U>Guaranteed Obligations</U>&#148;) when due and payable
or required to be performed, as applicable, in accordance with this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. This is a guarantee
of payment and performance, and not of collectability. The obligations of the Parent under this <U>Section 11.15(a)</U> are absolute
and unconditional in respect of satisfying the Guaranteed Obligations and shall be enforceable against Parent to the same extent
as if Parent were the primary obligor (and not merely a surety) under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. It shall not
be necessary for Seller (and Parent hereby waives any rights which Parent may have to require Seller), in order to enforce the
obligations of Parent hereunder, first to (a) institute suit or exhaust its remedies against Purchaser or any other Person, (b)
join Purchaser or any other Person in any action seeking to enforce any such agreement or (c) resort to any other means of obtaining
payment or enforcement of the obligations of Purchaser; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any defenses or counterclaims
that would be available to Purchaser shall be available to Parent hereunder (other than to the extent expressly waived in this
<U>Section 11.15(a)</U> or otherwise arising from any insolvency, bankruptcy, arrangement, adjustment, composition or liquidation
of Purchaser). Seller shall not be required to take any action to reduce, collect or enforce the obligations of Purchaser when
due under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. Parent waives notice of protest, proof of non-payment, default or breach by
Purchaser, promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance of this guarantee and of the Guaranteed Obligations, presentment, demand
for payment, notice of any Guaranteed Obligations incurred, all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay,
moratorium Law or other similar Law now or hereafter in effect. Parent agrees to each of the following, and agrees that its obligations
under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements as a result of this <U>Section 11.15(a)</U> shall not be released, diminished,
impaired, reduced or adversely affected by any of the following, and waives any common law, equitable, statutory or other rights
(including rights to notice except for notices required to be given by Seller to Purchaser or Parent pursuant to this Agreement)
which Parent might otherwise have as a result of or in connection with (i) any renewal, extension, increase, modification, alteration
or rearrangement of all or any part of the obligations of Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, (ii)
any insolvency, bankruptcy, arrangement, adjustment, composition, liquidation, disability, dissolution, asset sale or transfer
or change of structure, ownership or organization of any Person, (iii) any full or partial release by Seller of the liability of
Purchaser, or any part thereof, with respect to Purchaser or any of its assets, (iv) the failure or delay on the part of Seller
to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Purchaser or (v) the adequacy of any other means the Seller
may have of obtaining payment related to any of the Guaranteed Obligations. Parent acknowledges that it will receive substantial
direct and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Parent shall be
subrogated to all rights of Seller against Purchaser in respect of any amounts paid by Parent to Seller pursuant to the provisions
of this <U>Section 11.15(a)</U> in respect of any obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, but
only after payment in full in cash of all the Guaranteed Obligations. The guarantee set forth in this <U>Section 11.15(a) </U>is
a continuing and absolute guarantee, and it and the Guaranteed Obligations will not be discharged, and will remain in full force
and effect, until the full payment and performance of all amounts required to be paid and performed by Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Parent hereby makes all of the representations and warranties set forth in <U>Sections
4.1</U> (except that the reference to the &#147;State of Delaware&#148; shall be deemed to be replaced by &#147;Commonwealth
of Australia&#148;), <U>4.2</U> and <U>4.3</U>, with references therein to &#147;Purchaser&#148; deemed to be replaced by &#147;Parent&#148;.
