2.8   _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Seller and Purchaser agree
to (and agree to cause their respective Affiliates to) allocate the Purchase
Price, any liabilities assumed and any other amounts treated as consideration
for U.S. federal income Tax purposes among the Transferred Assets and the

Elections for U.S. federal income Tax purposes in accordance with Sections
338 and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Allocation Principles_ ") and the following procedures. No
later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to
Seller a proposed allocation of the Purchase Price (and other relevant
amounts) as of the Closing Date determined in a manner consistent with the
Allocation Principles (the " _Purchaser s Allocation_"). If Seller disagrees
with Purchasers Allocation, Seller may, within thirty (30) days after
delivery of Purchasers Allocation, deliver a notice (the " _Seller s
Allocation Notice_") to Purchaser to such effect, specifying those items as
to which Seller disagrees and setting forth Sellers proposed allocation of
the Purchase Price (and other relevant amounts). If the Sellers Allocation
Notice is duly delivered, Seller and Purchaser shall, during the twenty
(20) days immediately following such delivery, use commercially reasonable
efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to
determine the allocation of the Purchase Price (and other relevant amounts),
which allocation shall incorporate, reflect and be consistent with the
Allocation Principles. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to reach such
agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause the Independent Accounting
Firm to resolve any remaining disputes. Any allocation of the Purchase Price
(and other relevant amounts) determined pursuant to the decision of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall incorporate, reflect and be consistent with
the Allocation Principles. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any,
to be performed by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by
Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand. The allocation of
the Purchase Price (and other relevant amounts), as prepared by Purchaser if
no Sellers Allocation Notice has been given, or as adjusted pursuant to any
agreement between Seller and Purchaser or as determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm (the " _Allocation_ ") shall be conclusive and binding on all
Parties. The Allocation shall be adjusted, as necessary, to reflect any
subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.13_ or
_Section 7.9_. Seller and Purchaser agree (and agree to cause
their respective Affiliates) to prepare and file all relevant federal, state,
local and foreign Tax Returns (including, without limitation, the Section
338(h)(10) Forms) in accordance with the Allocation. None of Seller or
Purchaser shall (and each shall cause its Affiliates not to) take any
position inconsistent with the Allocation on any Tax Return or in any Tax
Proceeding, in each case, except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to
a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or
any similar provision of applicable state, local or foreign Law).

waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions at that time) are satisfied or waived or at such other place, time

2.11   _Post-Closing Statements_.

  



  

(a)  Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall

(b)  During the forty-five (45)-day period immediately following
Sellers receipt of the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement (the "
_Review Period_ "), Seller and its representatives will be permitted to review
Purchasers books and records and work papers relating to the Initial Post-
Closing Adjustment Statement. Purchaser will, and will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its accountants to, cooperate with and

and work papers and making available personnel to the extent reasonably
required.

  



  

(c)  Purchaser agrees that, following the Closing through the date that
the Final Post-Closing Adjustment Statement becomes final and binding, it
will not take or permit to be taken, any actions with respect to any
accounting books, records, policies or procedures on which the Financial
Statements or the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement is based, or on
which the Final Post-Closing Adjustment Statement is to be based, that are
inconsistent with the Transaction Accounting Principles or that would
reasonably be expected to materially impede or delay the determination of the
amount of the Initial Closing Working Capital, the Initial Closing Adjustment
Amount or the preparation of any Notice of Disagreement or the Final Post-
Closing Adjustment Statement in the manner and utilizing the methods provided
by this Agreement.

  



  

2.12   _Reconciliation of Post-Closing Statements_.

  



  

(a)  Seller shall notify Purchaser in writing prior to the expiration of
the Review Period if Seller believes the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment
Statement contains errors or was not prepared in accordance with _Section

Disagreement is received by Purchaser prior to the expiration of the Review
Period, then the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement shall be deemed to
have been accepted by Seller and shall become final and binding upon the
Parties in accordance with _Section 2.12(c)_ , absent manifest error or
fraud.

  



  

(b)  During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of a
Notice of Disagreement (if any) (the " _Resolution Period_ "), Seller and

proceedings between the Parties, including any proceedings before or with the

(c)  If, at the end of the Resolution Period, Seller and Purchaser have
been unable to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Purchaser shall
submit all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the Notice of
Disagreement (along with a copy of the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment
Statement marked to indicate those line items that are not in dispute, which
line items shall be deemed final and binding on the Parties) to
an independent certified public accounting firm in the United States of good
national reputation mutually acceptable to Seller and Purchaser (the "
_Independent Accounting Firm_ "). Within thirty (30) days after the __
Independent Accounting Firms selection, the Independent Accounting Firm
(acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator) shall make a final,
written determination, binding on the Parties to this Agreement, of the
appropriate amount of each of the line items in the Initial Post-
Closing Adjustment Statement which remain in dispute, as indicated in the
Notice of Disagreement which Seller and Purchaser have submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm shall calculate,
based solely on (x) a single set of written submissions of Purchaser, on the
one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, made within fifteen (15) days after
the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm and shared with the other
Party, and (y) a single written response submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm within five (5) days after receipt of each such
submission (which the Independent Accounting Firm shall share with the other
Party), and not by independent investigation, the Initial Closing Adjustment
Amount. During the review by the Independent Accounting Firm, Purchaser and
Seller and their respective accountants will each make available to the
Independent Accounting Firm interviews with such personnel, and such
information, books and records and work papers, as may be reasonably required
by the Independent Accounting Firm to fulfill its obligations under this
_Section 2.12(c)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that the accountants of Seller
or Purchaser shall not be obliged to make any work papers available to the
Independent Accounting Firm, except in accordance with such accountants
normal disclosure procedures and then only after such firm has signed a
customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall be instructed that its calculation (i) must be made in
accordance with the Transaction Accounting Principles and the
other definitions and applicable provisions of this Agreement, and (ii) with
respect to each item in dispute, such determination shall not be in excess of
the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by Seller in the
Notice of Disagreement or by Purchaser in the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment
Statement with respect to such disputed line item. The statement of the
Initial Closing Adjustment Amount as determined either through agreement of
the Parties pursuant to _Section 2.12(a)_ or _2.12(b)_  or through the action
of the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section 2.12(c)_ shall be
final and binding on the Parties and is referred to as the " _Final Post-
Closing Adjustment Statement_ ," and the Initial Closing Adjustment Amount
set forth therein as the " _Final Adjustment Amount_."

  



  

(d)  All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed
by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by Seller, on the one hand,
and Purchaser, on the other hand, in proportion to the differences between the
Initial Closing Adjustment Amount as determined by the Independent Accounting
Firm and the Initial Closing Adjustment Amount set forth in the Notice of
Disagreement and the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement, respectively.

2.13   _Post-Closing Adjustment_. The " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ "
shall be equal to (a) the Final Adjustment Amount _less_ (b) the Closing
Adjustment. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive amount, then
Purchaser shall pay in cash to Seller (or one or more Affiliates of Seller
designated by Seller) the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated
by Seller prior to the Closing. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative
amount, then Seller (or an Affiliate designated by Seller) shall pay in cash
to Purchaser the absolute value of the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts
designated by Purchaser prior to the Closing. Any such payment shall be made
within five (5) Business Days after the Final Post-Closing
Adjustment Statement is delivered. The Purchase Price shall equal the Pre-
Adjustment Amount, (x) _plus_ the Final Adjustment Amount, if the Final
Adjustment Amount is positive, or (y) _less_ the absolute value of the Final
Adjustment Amount, if the Final Adjustment Amount is negative.

  



  

2.14   _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Purchaser and the members of the Alkali Group shall be entitled
to withhold and deduct from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as Purchaser or the members of the Alkali Group
are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law;
_provided_ , that Purchaser shall provide Seller with reasonable notice prior
to withholding any amounts pursuant to this _Section 2.14_ and the parties
shall cooperate to minimize or eliminate any withholding; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that so long as Seller delivers the certificate described in
_Section 2.9(a)(iii)_ , Purchaser does not expect it or any member of the
Alkali Group to withhold any amounts in respect of Taxes pursuant to this
_Section 2.14_ under current Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Tax authority, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

  



  

Article III 
  
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER 
  
 

  



  

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered to Purchaser prior

alone basis; and, as a result, the Financial Statements are not

and cash flows of the Business will be in the future.

Article IV 
  
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
 OF PURCHASER

  



  

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered to Seller prior to
the execution of this Agreement (the " _Purchaser Disclosure Schedule_ ") (
_provided_ that disclosure in any section of the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule (other than _Sections 4.1_ , _4.2_ and _4.3_ of the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule, which matters shall be disclosed only by specific
disclosure in the respective section of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule)
shall apply to any other section to the extent that the relevance of such
disclosure to such other section is reasonably apparent), Purchaser
represents and warrants to Seller as follows:

  



  

4.1   _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Purchaser
is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
the State of Delaware, and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
being conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a
foreign Person in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation
of its properties or assets or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
would not and would not reasonably be expected to impair in any material
respect the ability of Purchaser to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Sale.

  



  

4.2   _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Purchaser has all
necessary power and authority, and has taken all action necessary, to
authorize, execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and each Ancillary
Agreement to which it is party and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. This Agreement has
been, and each of the Ancillary Agreements to which Purchaser is party when
executed will be, duly and validly executed and delivered by Purchaser and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Seller or the
applicable member of the Seller Group of this Agreement and each Ancillary
Agreement to which each such Person is party, constitutes (or, in the case of
the Ancillary Agreements, will constitute) a valid, legal and binding
agreement of Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with its
terms, subject to the effect of any applicable Laws relating to bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential
transfers, or similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights
generally and subject, as to enforceability, to the effect of general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding at equity or at Law).

  



   

-38- 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

4.3   _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. No filing with or
notice to, and no permit, authorization, registration, consent or approval
of, any Governmental Entity is required on the part of Purchaser for the
execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser of this Agreement or the
consummation by Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement, except compliance with the applicable
requirements of the HSR Act and any non-U.S. Antitrust Laws listed on _Section
4.3_  of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule. Assuming compliance with the
items described in the preceding sentence, and except as would not impair in
any material respect the ability of Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be,
to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Sale, neither
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement (if applicable) by Purchaser nor the consummation by Purchaser of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement
will (i) conflict with or result in any breach, violation or infringement of
any provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws (or similar
Organizational Documents) of Purchaser, (ii) result in a breach, violation or
infringement of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or
both) a default (or give rise to the creation of any Lien, except for
Permitted Liens, or any right of termination, amendment, cancellation
or acceleration) under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
material Contract to which Purchaser is a party or by which it or any of its
properties or assets may be bound or (iii) violate or infringe any Law
applicable to Purchaser or any of its properties or assets, except, in the
case of each of _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ , for violations or infringements
that would not and would not reasonably be expected to impair in any material
respect the ability of Purchaser to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Sale.

  



  

4.4   _Financing_.

  



  

(a)  Purchaser has received and accepted executed and binding commitment
letters dated February 3, 2015 (the " _Debt Commitment Letters_ ") from UBS
Securities LLC, UBS AG, Stamford Branch, Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse
Securities (USA) LLC, Royal Bank of Canada and RBC Capital Markets
(collectively, the " _Lenders_ "), relating to the commitment of the
Lenders to provide, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the full
amount of the debt financing stated therein (the " _Debt Financing_ ").

  



  

(b)  Purchaser has delivered to Seller true, complete and correct copies
of the executed Debt Commitment Letters, attached hereto as _Exhibit F_
(including, the exhibits and annexes thereto), and any fee letters (the " _Fee
Letters_ ") related thereto (with only fee amounts, dates and certain other
economic terms, including in respect of the "market flex" and "securities
demand" provisions, redacted) (none of which would adversely affect the amount
or availability of the Debt Financing).

  



  

(c)  Except as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters, there are no
conditions precedent to the obligations of the Lenders to provide the Debt
Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Lenders to reduce the
total amount of the Debt Financing. Other than the Debt Commitment Letters
and the Fee Letters, there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts
or arrangements (except for customary engagement letters) relating to the
funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Debt Financing.

  



   

-39- 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

(d)  The Debt Financing, when funded in accordance with the Debt
Commitment Letters, together with available cash on hand (taking into account
any restrictions on use and costs of repatriation), will provide Purchaser
with cash proceeds on the Closing Date in an amount sufficient to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms contemplated
hereby, including the payment of the Purchase Price, and to pay related fees
and expenses.

  



  

(e)  Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions in _Sections 8.1_ and
_8.2_ , to the Knowledge of Purchaser, there is no fact or occurrence as of
the date hereof that would cause the conditions to funding of the Debt
Financing not to be satisfied at or before the Closing, and Purchaser has no
reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term
or condition of the Closing to be satisfied by it contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters.

  



  

(f)  The Debt Commitment Letters are valid, binding and enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws
affecting creditors rights generally and general principles of equity), and
are in full force and effect, and no event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a
default or breach or a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part
of Purchaser under the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letters. As
of the date of this Agreement, no Debt Commitment Letter or Fee Letter has
been amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived, and the respective
commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn,
modified or rescinded. Purchaser has paid in full any and all commitment fees
or other fees or expenses required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the
Debt Commitment Letters on or before the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(g)  In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or
financing by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any other financing or
other transactions be a condition to any of Purchasers obligations hereunder.

  



  

4.5   _Solvency_. Assuming the accuracy of _Section 3.5(b)_ ,
immediately after giving effect to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, will be Solvent. For purposes of this _Section 4.5_ , " _Solvent_ "
means, with respect to Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, that:

  



  

(a)  The fair value of the assets of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, shall be greater than the total amount of the liabilities,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole;

  



  

(b)  The present fair saleable value of the property of Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is greater than the amount that will be
required to pay Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, probable
liability of debts and other liabilities, subordinated, contingent or
otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities become absolute and matured;

  



   

-40- 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

(c)  Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are able to pay
their debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such
liabilities become absolute and matured; and

  



  

(d)  Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are not engaged
in, and are not about to engage in, business for which they have unreasonably
small capital.

  



  

4.6   _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, (a) there is
no Action pending, or to the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened, against
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries which would reasonably be expected to
prevent, hinder or delay any of the transactions contemplated hereby and (b)
neither Purchaser nor any Subsidiary thereof is subject to any outstanding
Order, writ or injunction that would reasonably be expected to prevent,
hinder or delay any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

4.7   _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled
to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which Seller would be
responsible based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Purchaser.

  



  

4.8   _Acquisition of Shares for Investment_. Purchaser has such
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as is required for
evaluating the merits and risks of its purchase of the Shares and is capable
of such evaluation. Purchaser confirms that Seller has made available to
Purchaser and Purchasers agents and representatives the opportunity to ask
questions of the officers and management and employees of Seller and of the
members of the Alkali Group as well as access to the documents, information
and records of Seller and the members of the Alkali Group and to acquire
additional information about the business and financial condition of the
Business, and Purchaser confirms that it has made an independent
investigation, analysis and evaluation of members of the Alkali Group and
their properties, assets, business, financial condition, prospects, documents,
information and records. Purchaser is acquiring the Shares for investment and
not with a view toward or for sale in connection with any
distribution thereof, or with any present intention of distributing or
selling the Shares. Purchaser acknowledges that the Shares have not
been registered under the Securities Act or any state or foreign securities
Laws, and agrees that the Shares may not be sold, transferred, offered for
sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration
under the Securities Act, except pursuant to an exemption from such
registration available under the Securities Act, and without compliance with
foreign securities Laws, in each case, to the extent applicable.

  



  

4.9   _Inspections; Limitation of Seller s Warranties_. Except as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, Purchaser acknowledges that
the Shares, the Transferred Assets, the Business and the businesses and
properties of the members of the Alkali Group are furnished "AS IS, WHERE
IS," AND, SUBJECT TO THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN
_ARTICLE III_ , WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT ANY OTHER REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, AND
IN PARTICULAR, WITHOUT ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION AS TO CONDITION,
MERCHANTABILITY OR SUITABILITY AS TO ANY OF THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS OR ANY OF
THE ASSETS OR PROPERTIES OF THE MEMBERS OF THE ALKALI GROUP.

  



   

-41- 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

4.10   _No Regulatory Impediment_. To the Knowledge of Purchaser,
there is no fact relating to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates respective
businesses, operations, financial condition or legal status, including any
officers, directors or current employees status, that would reasonably be
expected to impair the ability of the Parties to this Agreement to obtain,
on a timely basis, any authorization, consent, Order, declaration or approval
of, or ability to contract with, any U.S. Governmental Entity necessary for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

4.11   _ERISA_. Purchaser is not an "employee benefit plan" as
defined in ERISA, whether or not subject to ERISA, or a "plan" as defined in
Section 4975 of the Code, and none of Purchasers assets constitutes (or is
deemed to constitute for purposes of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or
any substantially similar federal, state or municipal Law) "plan assets" for
purposes of 29 CFR Section 2510.3-101, as amended by Section 3(42) of ERISA,
or otherwise for purposes of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

the members of the Alkali Group, in each case, during normal business hours,
upon reasonable notice and in accordance with reasonable procedures
established by Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) neither any member of

(b)  Purchaser agrees that any permitted investigation undertaken by
Purchaser pursuant to the access granted under _Section 5.1(a)_ shall be
conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation

and its representatives shall not communicate with any of the directors,
officers or other employees of Seller or the members of the Alkali Group
(other than, subject to the restrictions of _Section 5.1(a),_  the Business
Employees) without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, neither Seller nor any member of the Alkali Group shall be

of counsel, such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of such party or contravene any applicable Laws.

  



  

(c)  At and after the Closing to the date that is five (5) years from
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
afford Seller and its representatives, during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice, access to the books, records (including employee and

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that Seller may retain copies of any
Transferred Books and Records, Alkali Contracts or any other documents or
materials transferred to Purchaser as part of the Transferred Assets or the
Shares and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall have the right to use such

of the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, neither Purchaser nor any member of the
Purchaser Group shall be required to provide access to or disclose

5.2   _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a)  The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are incorporated into
this Agreement by reference and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Purchasers confidentiality obligations shall terminate as
of the Closing solely in respect of that portion of the Confidential
Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to the extent
relating to the Business. If, for any reason, the Sale is not
consummated, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Purchaser acknowledges that the Enterprise Resource Planning System
to be transferred to Purchaser and/or its Affiliates pursuant to this
Agreement contains confidential information with respect to businesses other
than the Business, including the Peroxygens Business previously sold by
Seller, and Purchaser hereby agrees that, until the fifth (5th) anniversary of
the Closing Date, (x) Purchaser shall (and shall cause its employees and
Affiliates, including, after the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group and
their respective employees, to) keep such information confidential and to not
disclose or use such information for any purpose whatsoever other than as
required by applicable Law (in which case, Purchaser shall provide prompt
written notice to Seller, which to the extent legally permissible shall be
prior to disclosing any such information, and Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate with any attempt by Seller to protect against any such disclosure,
including the obtaining of a protective order or confidential treatment) and
(y) at the Closing, Purchaser shall enter into a confidentiality agreement
with PeroxyChem Holdings, L.P. with respect to the confidential information
of the Peroxygens Business, substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit D_ (the " _Peroxygens Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  



  

(b)  For five (5) years after the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, hold, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its or their respective representatives to hold, in confidence, and
Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to, use for the
benefit of Seller or any of its Affiliates, any and all information, whether
written or oral, to the extent relating to the Business, the Transferred
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, except to the extent that such information
(i) is generally available to or known by the public through no fault of
Seller, any of its Affiliates or their respective representatives; (ii) is
lawfully acquired by Seller, any of its Affiliates or their respective
representatives from and after the Closing from sources which, to the
Knowledge of Seller, are not prohibited from disclosing such information by a
legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation; (iii) was lawfully acquired by
Seller, any of its Affiliates or their respective representatives prior to
the Closing from sources (other than Seller or any of its Subsidiaries) which,

5.3   _Efforts_.

  



  

(a)  Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided (including
_Sections 5.5_ and _5.14)_ , each of Purchaser and Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all actions

proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Law as soon as
possible.

or other Person, give the other Party and/or its counsel the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings and telephone calls; and (iv) permit
the other Party and/or its counsel to review in advance any submission,
filing or communication (and documents submitted therewith) intended to be

Only Material." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the

including defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in
any court with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private
party; and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any

order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such
businesses, product lines or assets of Purchaser and/or the members of the

committing to take actions that after the Closing would limit Purchasers
and/or its Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or its or their
ability to operate and/or retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines
or assets of Purchaser and/or the members of the Alkali Group or any of the
Transferred Assets, and (z) agreeing to divest, sell, dispose of, hold
separate, or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its
freedom of action with respect to, or Purchasers or Purchasers
Subsidiaries ability to operate or retain, any of the businesses, product
lines or assets of Purchaser and/or the members of the Alkali Group or any of
the Transferred Assets; _provided_ , _however_ , that any action

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(d)  Without limiting any other obligation under this Agreement, during
the period from the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, each of

practicable and, in any event, within three (3) Business Days of a request
from Seller or any such Governmental Entity. Whether or not the Sale is
consummated, Purchaser shall be responsible for all filing fees and payments

by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, Wyoming Office of State
Lands and/or the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in order for Purchaser to

compliance with applicable Law and Permits. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Seller Indemnified Party against any and all Losses incurred or
suffered by any of the Seller Indemnified Parties arising by reason of or
resulting from any acts performed pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 5.3(f)_
shall be construed to require Seller to engage in the Business after the
Closing Date, violate applicable Law or Permits or engage in any act or
activity to the extent such act or activity would interfere with Sellers
business or operations.

5.5   _Third Party Consents_.

  



  

(a) From the date of this Agreement to the six (6) month anniversary of
the Closing Date (such period, the " _Transfer Period_ "), Seller and
Purchaser shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other in
obtaining) any consents or approvals required from third parties (other than
Governmental Approvals, which shall be governed by _Section 5.3_ , and
Indemnified Guarantees, which shall be governed by _Section 5.8_ ) to assign,
convey or transfer the Transferred Assets in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such required consents,
the " _Third-Party Consents_ "); _provided_ that Seller will not be obligated
to pay any amounts or provide other consideration in connection with
obtaining or seeking to obtain any Third-Party Consent, and Seller shall have
no liability whatsoever for failure to obtain any Third-Party Consent.
Purchaser shall bear all the costs and expenses of obtaining the Third-
Party Consents and agree to accept any commercially reasonable modifications
or changes to any material contract terms, to the extent necessary to obtain
any Third-Party Consent.

  



  

(b)  If any Third-Party Consent is not obtained prior to Closing with
respect to a Transferred Asset (a " _Specified Asset_ "), (i) Purchaser shall
pay the full Purchase Price at the Closing without the transfer, conveyance,
assignment or delivery of such Specified Asset; (ii) the Closing shall
proceed without the transfer, conveyance, assignment or delivery of such
Specified Asset; and (iii) nothing herein shall constitute a transfer,
conveyance, assignment or delivery or attempted transfer, conveyance,
assignment or delivery of such Specified Asset.

  



  

(c)  In the event the Closing proceeds without the transfer, conveyance,
assignment or delivery of any Specified Asset then, during the Transfer
Period, Seller and Purchaser shall each continue to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain (and shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate with each other in obtaining) promptly such Third-Party Consent
(provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, Seller will not be obligated to
pay any amounts or provide other consideration in connection with
obtaining or seeking to obtain any Third-Party Consent, Seller shall have no
liability whatsoever for failure to obtain any Third-Party Consent and
Purchaser shall bear all the costs and expenses of obtaining the Third-Party
Consents). Pending the receipt of such Third-Party Consent, (i) the Parties
shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to) cooperate with each
other to maintain good relations with any obligees or other counterparties in
connection with such Specified Asset and (ii) effective as of the Closing, (1)
Purchaser shall provide servicing to the counterparty to such Specified Asset
on the terms required under any Contract related thereto and (2) Purchaser
shall bear all Liabilities and obtain all claims, rights and benefits with
respect to such Specified Asset that would accrue to Purchaser pursuant to
Article II if the requisite Third-Party Consent were obtained prior to the
Closing, and the parties shall reasonably cooperate to enter into subleasing,
sublicensing, subcontracting or other arrangements in furtherance of the
foregoing (1) and (2). Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, any
Liabilities relating to or arising in connection with such Specified Asset or
the pursuit of or failure to obtain any Third-Party Consent shall be Assumed
Liabilities for all purposes hereunder from and after the Closing; _provided_
that to the extent (i) any asset that would otherwise constitute a Transferred
Asset is deemed a Specified Asset and (ii) an alternate arrangement has not
been entered into by the Parties pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, such asset shall be deemed an Excluded Asset and all Liabilities
directly relating thereto shall be deemed Excluded Liabilities for so long as
the consent, approval or action relating thereto shall not have been obtained
or taken, as applicable, _provided_ _further_ that such Excluded Assets and
Excluded Liabilities shall not be considered Excluded Assets and Excluded
Liabilities for the purpose of the indemnification obligations under _Article
X_.

--- 

    

  

(d)  The Parties agree to reasonably cooperate to preserve each others
rights with respect to third parties in connection with any servicing
agreement entered into in connection with this _Section 5.5_. To the extent
that any such Specified Asset cannot be transferred to Purchaser during the
Transfer Period, the obligations of the parties pursuant to this _Section 5.5_
 shall continue until the termination of the obligations of any member of the
Seller Group (including any post-termination servicing obligations) with
respect to such Specified Asset.

  



  

(e)  When the requisite Third-Party Consent is obtained, the applicable
Specified Asset shall be deemed to have been automatically assigned and
transferred to Purchaser on the terms set forth in this Agreement for no
additional consideration and without the requirement of any further action of
any other Person, as of the Closing, except to the extent the date of such
Third-Party Consent is deemed by applicable Law to have occurred on another
date, in which case, as of such date.

  



  

(f)  From the Closing Date until the one (1)-year anniversary of the
Closing Date, Purchaser will use its reasonable best efforts to execute a
license agreement (including renegotiating the material terms of the
applicable licenses) with each of Microsoft Corporation and SAP America, Inc.
that will enable Seller to assign Sellers licenses with such Person
exclusively related to the Business to Alkali HoldCo, it being understood
that if Purchaser does not execute such agreements with such Person enabling
such transfer without cost to Seller prior to the one (1)-year anniversary of
the Closing Date, Seller shall have no obligation or Liability whatsoever to
Purchaser with respect to the transfer of any licenses with such Person.

  



  

5.6   _Public Announcements_. No Party to this Agreement nor any
Affiliate or representative of such Party shall issue or cause the
publication of the initial press release or public announcement or any
subsequent press release or public announcement in respect of this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement without the prior written consent of the other
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except as may be required by applicable Law or stock exchange
rules, in which case the Party required to publish such press release or
public announcement shall use reasonable efforts to provide the other Party a
reasonable opportunity to comment on such press release or public
announcement in advance of such publication and shall consider such comments
in good faith; _provided_ that each Party may make internal announcements to
its employees that are consistent with such Partys prior public
disclosures regarding this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby without such consent.

5.7   _Intercompany Accounts_. On or prior to the Closing Date, all
intercompany accounts except for those accounts and Contracts listed on
_Section 5.7_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule between any member of the
Seller Group, on the one hand, and any member of the Alkali Group, on the
other hand, shall be settled or otherwise eliminated in such a manner as
Seller shall determine in its sole discretion (including by Seller or any of
its Affiliates removing from any member of the Alkali Group all cash and cash
equivalents or funds from cash pools by means of dividends, distributions, the
creation or repayment of intercompany debt, increasing or decreasing of cash
pool balances or paid-in capital or otherwise). For the avoidance of doubt,
intercompany accounts between and among any member of the Alkali Group shall
not be affected by this provision. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that at or prior to the Closing,
Seller may capitalize intercompany loans between Seller, on the one hand, and
any member of the Alkali Group, on the other hand, by means of an increase of
the amount of paid-in capital of Seller with respect to such member of the
Alkali Group and a cancellation of existing Indebtedness under such
intercompany loans as consideration therefor.

  



  

5.8   _Guarantees; Commitments_.

  



  

(a)  From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall and shall cause the
members of the Alkali Group to, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold
harmless each member of the Seller Group and their respective managers,
officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents, successors and
assigns (collectively, " _Seller Guarantors_ ") against any and all Losses
that any Seller Guarantor suffers, incurs or is liable for by reason of or
arising out of or in consequence of any Seller Guarantor being an issuer with
respect to, making payment under, being required to pay or reimburse the
issuer of, or being a party to, any guarantee, indemnity, surety bond, letter
of credit, bank guarantee, keepwell agreement, consumer financing
arrangements, or other similar commitment, understanding, agreement or
obligation arising from the Assumed Liabilities, the Business or any member of
the Alkali Group and listed on _Section 5.8(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule (which list may be supplemented by Seller after the date hereof and
at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date to include any such
guarantee, indemnity, surety bond, letter of credit, bank guarantee, keepwell
agreement, consumer financing arrangements, or other similar commitment,
understanding, agreement or obligation primarily relating to the Assumed
Liabilities, the Business or any member of the Alkali Group after the date
hereof in the ordinary course of business or in furtherance of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Guarantees_ "); (ii) any claim or demand for payment made on any
Seller Guarantor with respect to any of the Indemnified Guarantees; or (iii)
any Action, claim or proceeding by any Person who is or claims to be entitled
to the benefit of or claims to be entitled to payment, reimbursement or
indemnity with respect to any Indemnified Guarantees.

  



   

-52-

--- 

    

  

(b)  Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts
(including renegotiating the material terms of the Indemnified Guarantees) to
cause itself or the members of the Alkali Group to be substituted in all
respects for each applicable member of the Seller Group, and for each such
member of the Seller Group to be released, effective as of the Closing or (if
such substitution and release cannot be effected as of the Closing) as soon
as possible after the Closing, in respect of all obligations of each such
member of the Seller Group under each of the Indemnified Guarantees. For any
Indemnified Guarantees for which Purchaser or the members of the Alkali
Group, as applicable, is not substituted in all respects for each applicable
member of the Seller Group (or for which each such member of the Seller Group
is not released) effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall continue to
use reasonable best efforts and shall cause the members of the Alkali Group
to use reasonable best efforts to effect such substitution and release as
promptly as practicable after the Closing, and Seller shall continue to
reasonably cooperate in Purchasers efforts. Purchaser further agrees that,
to the extent the beneficiary or counterparty under any Indemnified Guarantee
does not accept any such substitute arrangement proffered by Purchaser or an
Affiliate of Purchaser or to the extent each member of the Seller Group is
not fully and irrevocably released and discharged, Purchaser shall reimburse
each member of the Seller Group for, any and all amounts paid, including
costs or expenses in connection with such Indemnified Guarantee, including
expenses in maintaining such Indemnified Guarantee, whether or not any such
Indemnified Guarantee is drawn upon or required to be performed, and shall in
any event promptly reimburse each member of the Seller Group to the extent any
Indemnified Guarantee is called upon and any member of the Seller Group makes
any payment or is obligated to reimburse the Party issuing such Indemnified
Guarantee.

  



  

(c)  Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.8(b)_ , at or prior
to the Closing, Purchaser shall either (i) (A) assume and agree to be bound
by, fulfill, perform and discharge all of Sellers reimbursement obligations
and other liabilities, duties and covenants under any letter of credit
reimbursement agreement or other arrangement with any issuing bank party
thereto, which reimbursement agreement or arrangement was entered into by
Seller and such issuing bank in connection with the issuance of a letter of
credit in favor of the State of Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality,
Land Quality Division (the " _Wyoming DEQ_ "), as beneficiary, in order to
cause the Wyoming DEQ to accept such letter of credit as substitute credit
support in exchange for the Wyoming DEQs release of certain guaranties by
Seller of FMC Wyoming Corporations self-bonding obligations in favor of the
Wyoming DEQ, including with respect to Permit No. 335-TFN 6 6/067, Permit No.
454-TFN 6 1/068 and Permit No. 554-TFN 6 2/068 (the " _Self-Bonding
Obligation Guaranties_ "), and (B) cause such issuing bank to release
and forever discharge Seller as well as its stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives from all
Liabilities whatsoever arising out of, or in any way connected to performance
under, such reimbursement agreement or arrangement, or (ii) in the event that
the Self-Bonding Obligation Guaranties have not been previously released as
contemplated by _clause (i)_ of this _Section 5.8(c)_ , Purchaser shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Wyoming DEQ, as beneficiary of the Self-
Bonding Obligation Guaranties, to accept, effective as of the Closing, a
substitute guarantee or such other form of assurance or collateral as may be
reasonably requested by the Wyoming DEQ and to deliver to Seller at Closing
releases of the Self-Bonding Obligation Guaranties in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Seller. Seller shall reasonably cooperate with
Purchaser in connection with the release of such Self-Bonding Obligation
Guaranties.

(d)  To the extent, if any, that any member of the Seller Group directly
or indirectly retains, remains liable for, or has any credit exposure with
respect to, any material obligation of any member of the Alkali Group,
Purchaser shall, (i) upon Sellers request, promptly and as soon as available
furnish to Seller such annual, quarterly and monthly financial statements of
Purchaser and members of the Alkali Group, including consolidated balance
sheets, statements of income, cash flows and stockholders equity, for the
applicable period, all in reasonable detail, and any other financial
information or assurances as Seller may from time to time reasonably request,
(ii) permit Seller to participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding
any material term of any contract or agreement related to any Indemnified
Guarantee for so long as any member of the Seller Group retains or
remains directly or indirectly liable for, or has any credit exposure with
respect to, such Indemnified Guarantee and (iii) during the period beginning
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date and ending on the date on which Seller
no longer directly or indirectly retains, remains liable for or has any
credit exposure with respect to any Indemnified Guarantee, pay Seller, on a
monthly basis (promptly following the end of each month), the Interest Rate
on the aggregate outstanding amount of the Indemnified Guarantees that Seller
directly or indirectly retains, remains liable for or has any credit exposure
with respect to.

  



  

5.9   _Insurance_. From and after the Closing Date, the members of
the Alkali Group shall cease to be insured by the insurance policies held by
Seller or any member of the Seller Group, or by any of their self-insured
programs, and neither Purchaser nor its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the members of the Alkali Group) shall have any access, right, title
or interest to or in any such insurance policies (including to all claims and
rights to make claims and all rights to proceeds) to cover any assets of the
members of the Alkali Group or any Liability arising from the operation of the
Business (except to the extent the applicable access, right, title or
interest is included in the Purchased Assets, and, in such event, Purchaser
agrees to be responsible for preparing and filing claims and taking such
other actions reasonably required in connection with receiving such access,
right, title or interest included in the Purchased Assets). Without limiting
the foregoing, Seller and its Affiliates may, to be effective as of the
Closing, amend any insurance policies in the manner it deems appropriate to
give effect to this _Section 5.9_. From and after the Closing, Purchaser
shall be responsible for securing all insurance it considers appropriate for
its operation of the Alkali Group and the Business. Purchaser further
covenants and agrees not to seek to assert or to exercise any rights or
claims of any member of the Alkali Group or the Business under or in respect
of any past or current insurance policy of Seller under which any member of
the Alkali Group or Affiliate thereof or the Business is an additional
insured.

  



  

5.10   _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as Seller
or Purchaser, as applicable, is prosecuting, contesting or defending any
legal proceeding, Action, investigation, charge, claim, or demand by a third
party in connection with (a) any transactions contemplated under this
Agreement, or (b) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition,
activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to
act, or transaction relating to, in connection with or arising from the
Transferred Assets, the Excluded Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the
Excluded Liabilities, the Business or the members of the Alkali Group, the
other Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including
with respect to the Purchaser after the Closing, the members of the Alkali
Group) and its and their respective directors, officers and employees to,
cooperate with such first Party and its counsel in such prosecution, contest
or defenses, including making available its personnel, and providing such
testimony and access to its books and records as shall be reasonably
necessary in connection with such prosecution, contest or defense.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser hereby
agrees, following the Closing, to (to the extent applicable) move for
substitution or take similar actions under applicable Law for Purchaser or one
of its Affiliates to be substituted for Seller in any and all Actions
exclusively related to the Business (other than the Excluded Claims), and for
Seller to be released from any and all such Actions effective as of the
Closing in a manner consistent with _Sections 2.4_ and _2.5_. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser hereby agrees to take any
and all actions required under applicable Law for Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates to substitute for Seller (to the extent applicable) in the ANSAC
Brazil Matter as of the Closing and cause Seller to be released from any and
all Liabilities related to the ANSAC Brazil Matter as of the Closing. In the
event of any conflict between this _Section 5.10_ and _Article X_ , then
_Article X_ shall govern.

sole cost and expense, for all applicable recordations and perfection of the
assignment of the Transferred Assets, including the Transferred Patents, the
Transferred Trademarks and the Transferred Vehicles from the title owner of
each such Transferred Asset to Alkali HoldCo or its Affiliates, and to use
reasonable best efforts to complete any requisite recordation or perfection
of the assignment of the Transferred Assets within six (6) months following
the Closing.

  



  

5.12   _Non-Solicitation; Non-Competition_.

  



  

(a)  For a period of one (1) year from the Closing Date, Seller shall
cause the Restricted Parties not to solicit for employment (whether as an
employee, consultant or otherwise) any officer, or other member of management,
who was an employee (with an annual salary exceeding $175,000) of any member
of the Alkali Group immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ that the
Restricted Parties shall not be precluded from soliciting or hiring any such
employee who (i) has been terminated by Purchaser or its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group)
prior to the solicitation not otherwise permitted hereunder or (ii) responds
to a general or public solicitation (including by a _bona fide_ search firm)
not targeted at employees of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, including,
after the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Restricted Parties shall not be restricted from engaging in
general or public solicitations or advertising not targeted at any such
employee of any member of the Purchaser Group.

  



  

(b)  For a period of one (1) year from the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
not (and shall cause its Affiliates, including, after the Closing, the
members of the Alkali Group, not to) solicit for employment (whether as an
employee, consultant or otherwise) any officer, or other member of
management, who was an employee (with an annual salary exceeding $175,000) of
any member of the Seller Group immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_
that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not be precluded from soliciting or
hiring any such employee who (i) has been terminated by any member of the
Seller Group prior to the solicitation not otherwise permitted hereunder or
(ii) responds to a general or public solicitation (including by a _bona_
_fide_ search firm) not targeted at employees of Seller or any of its
Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall be restricted from engaging in general or public
solicitations or advertising not targeted at any such employee of any
member of the Seller Group.

(c)  For a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date, Seller shall
cause the Restricted Parties not to engage in a Restricted Business anywhere
in the world. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the following shall be a
breach of this _Section 5.12_ : (i) the purchase or ownership by a Restricted
Party of a Person or business that derives less than the greater of (A)
ten percent (10%) of its total annual revenues and (B) $15,000,000 in annual
revenues from the Restricted Business, measured for the fiscal year ended
immediately prior to the date of such purchase, (ii) the purchase or ownership
by a Restricted Party of a Person or business that derives an amount equal to
or greater than the greater of (x) ten percent (10%) or more of its total
annual revenues and (y) $15,000,000 in annual revenues from the Restricted
Business measured for the fiscal year ended immediately prior to the date of
such purchase, as long as that Restricted Party shall commit to, and shall,
divest to an unaffiliated third party all of the Restricted Business operated
by such acquired or owned Person or business or reduce the Restricted Business
operated by such acquired or owned Person or business in size to constitute
less than $15,000,000 in annual revenues as soon as reasonably
practicable, in each case and in any event not later than six (6) months
following the acquisition of such ownership or interest ( _provided_ , 
_however_ , that such six (6)-month period shall be extended to the date on
which all approvals from a Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Law
required to complete the divestiture are received (but no later than the first
(1st) anniversary following the acquisition of such Person or business) if
such approvals are not received by the six (6)-month anniversary
following the acquisition of such Person or business), (iii) the direct or
indirect ownership for passive investment purposes by Restricted Parties of
publicly traded interests in or securities of any Person engaged in the
Restricted Business to the extent that such investment does not, directly or
indirectly, confer on the Restricted Parties more than four and nine-tenths
percent (4.9%) of the total voting power of such Person and (iv) the
investment in any fund in which no Restricted Party have any discretion
with respect to the investment strategy or selection of such fund.

  



  

5.13   _Directors and Officers_.

  



  

(a)  Purchaser agrees that all rights to indemnification under the
Alkali Groups officers and directors liability insurance for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Closing now existing in favor of the current
or former directors, managers or officers of any member of the Alkali Group,
who is also a Transferred Employee (collectively, the " _Covered Persons_ ")
as provided in the Organizational Documents of the applicable member of the
Alkali Group, indemnity or indemnification agreements or as provided pursuant
to a resolution of the board of directors (or similar governing body) of such
member of the Alkali Group and Seller Group (as applicable) shall survive the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms for a
period of not less than six (6) years from the Closing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, for a period of not less than six (6) years from
the Closing, Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any member of the
Alkali Group to, amend, modify or terminate any Organizational Document,
Contract or resolution regarding or related to such indemnification matters.
At or prior to the Closing, Alkali HoldCo shall obtain (or if it cannot,
Purchaser shall obtain), at Purchasers sole cost and expense, and for a
period of not less than six (6) years after the Closing Date, shall maintain
(or shall obtain a six (6)-year "tail" policy providing for) liability
insurance covering the Covered Persons with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Closing Date, with such policies providing aggregate annual
coverage of at least $75 million and containing terms and conditions that are,
in the aggregate, not less advantageous to the Covered Persons than Sellers
current directors and officers liability insurance policies covering
the Covered Persons (including coverage under any applicable member of the
Seller Group (as a result of such Covered Persons former service to such
member of the Seller Group in respect of the Business)); _provided_ that in no
event shall Alkali HoldCo (or Purchaser, as applicable) be required to expend
for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in
excess of 250% of the annual premiums currently paid by Seller for such
insurance (or, in the case of a "tail" policy, 400% of the annual premiums
currently paid by Seller for such insurance). If such "tail" policy has been
obtained by Alkali HoldCo prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall cause Alkali
HoldCo to maintain such policy in full force and effect, for its full term,
and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by Alkali HoldCo, and no
other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for
insurance hereunder.

(b)  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Purchaser shall,
and shall cause each member of the Alkali Group to, honor all obligations of
such member of the Alkali Group to indemnify (including any obligations to
advance funds for expenses to, _provided_ that any Person to whom expenses
are advanced undertakes to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to such indemnification) the
Covered Persons for acts or omissions by such Covered Persons occurring prior
to the Closing to the extent that such obligations of such member of the
Alkali Group exist on the date of this Agreement, whether pursuant to
Organizational Documents, indemnity or indemnification agreements, board (or
similar governing body) resolution or otherwise, and such obligations shall
survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with the terms of the Organizational Documents of such member of the Alkali
Group or such board (or similar governing body) resolutions or indemnity or
indemnification agreements from the Closing until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations with respect to any claims against such
Covered Persons arising out of such acts or omissions.

  



  

(c)  From and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, Purchaser shall, and shall cause each member of the Alkali
Group to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Covered Persons against all
damages, losses, charges, liabilities, claims, demands, actions, suits,
judgments, settlements, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and disbursements) (" _Covered Losses_ "), as incurred (payable monthly
upon written request, which request shall include reasonable evidence of the
Covered Losses set forth therein), to the extent arising from, relating to, or
otherwise in respect of, any actual or threatened Action in respect of
actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing in connection with
such Covered Persons duties as an officer, director or manager (or persons
holding similar positions) of such member of the Alkali Group or any
member of the Seller Group (as a result of such Covered Persons former
service to such member of the Seller Group in respect of the Business);
_provided_ that any Person to whom expenses are advanced undertakes to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled
to such indemnification.

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if any Covered
Person is entitled to be reimbursed or indemnified by any Person (including
any member of the Seller Group) other than Purchaser or a member of the Alkali
Group, such Covered Person shall not be required to recover from or be
indemnified by, or to seek such recovery or indemnification from, any such
other Person prior to or as a condition to being indemnified as described in
this _Section 5.13_ (Purchaser hereby acknowledging and agreeing that
indemnification as described in this _Section 5.13_ , including payments from
the insurance proceeds under the insurance policy required by _Section
5.13(a)_ , shall be the first recourse of the Covered Persons for Covered
Losses relating to the subject matter of this _Section 5.13_ ) and (ii) in
the event that any member of the Seller Group is subject to any
indemnification, reimbursement or similar liabilities with respect to any
Covered Person or otherwise incurs any Covered Losses with respect to the
subject matter of this _Section 5.13_ (including Covered Losses in respect of
contribution), Purchaser shall indemnify each such Person from, against and
with respect to any Covered Losses arising out of, resulting from or otherwise
in respect of such Liabilities or Covered Losses.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of
this _Section 5.13_ are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Covered Person, it being expressly agreed that such
Persons shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.13_ , and (ii)
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or
otherwise. If Alkali HoldCo (or Purchaser, if applicable) or its
successors or assigns (x) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (y) shall transfer all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Alkali HoldCo
(or Purchaser, if applicable) shall assume all of the obligations of Alkali
HoldCo (or Purchaser, if applicable) under this _Section 5.13_.

  



  

5.14   _Shared Contracts_. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller is a
party to certain Contracts that relate both to the Business and one or more
of Sellers other businesses with the vendors listed on _Section 5.14_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule (each, a " _Shared Contract_ "). Prior to the
Closing, Seller will, at Purchasers request, use commercially reasonable
efforts (at Purchasers cost and expense) to cause a member of the Alkali
Group to enter into a new Contract with respect to each such Shared Contract
(each, a " _Replacement Contract_ ") on terms that have been approved in
writing in advance by Purchaser (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). From the Closing Date, until the six (6)
month anniversary thereof, Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to enter
into any Replacement Contract not previously entered into prior to the
Closing. If Seller is unable to enter into any Replacement Contract prior to
the Closing, until the earlier of such time as such Replacement Contract is
entered into and six (6) months following the Closing Date, Seller will, at
Purchasers request, if practicable, use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with Purchaser (at Purchasers cost and expense) in any arrangement
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller intended to provide Purchaser
with services under such Shared Contract and for Purchaser to assume the
Liabilities related thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, from and after six
(6) months following the Closing, Purchaser shall have no right to receive
any claims, rights or benefits under any Shared Contract.

5.15   _FMC Marks_. Purchaser, for itself and its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group), acknowledges
and agrees that Purchaser is not purchasing, acquiring or otherwise obtaining
any right, title or interest in or to the FMC Marks, and (a) neither
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the members
of the Alkali Group) shall have any rights in or to the FMC Marks, (b) on the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the members of the Alkali Group to cease
any and all use of the FMC Marks (including in the respective corporate or
other legal names of the members of the Alkali Group), and (c) neither
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the members
of the Alkali Group) shall (i) use, register or seek to use or register in
any jurisdiction any of the FMC Marks or (ii) contest the use,
ownership, validity or enforceability of any rights of Seller or any of its
Affiliates in or to any of the FMC Marks. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this _Section 5.15_ , (x) the members of the Alkali
Group may continue to use the Railcar Marks on railcars, so long as such
railcars are leased or subleased from a member of the Seller Group (the "
_Permitted Railcar Use_ ") and (y) for a phase-out period not to exceed six
(6) months immediately following the Closing Date or such shorter period as
required by applicable Law or Order (the " _Phase-out Period_ "), the Alkali
Group may continue to use any FMC Marks to the extent such FMC Marks appear
on or are incorporated in the corporate or other legal name of any member
of the Alkali Group or in any existing tangible materials or software
acquired by Purchaser under this Agreement in the same manner as used by the
members of the Alkali Group prior to the Closing Date, in the case of clause
(y) only, solely as necessary to wind down the use of, and transition away
from, such FMC Marks. For the avoidance of doubt, during the Phase-out Period,
Purchaser shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates, including, after the
Closing, the members of the Alkali Group, not to) print, copy or create any
tangible materials (including printed materials and electronic materials)
bearing or incorporating the FMC Marks (other than for the Permitted Railcar
Use). At the end of such Phase-out Period, Purchaser shall (and shall cause
its Affiliates, including, after the Closing, the members of the Alkali
Group, to) have used their best efforts to have re-labelled, destroyed or
exhausted all materials bearing or incorporating the FMC Marks (other than
the Railcar Marks used in the Permitted Railcar Use), including signage,
advertising, promotional materials, software, packaging, inventory, electronic
materials, collateral goods, stationery, business cards, websites, and other
materials, and have made all filings with any office, agency or body to effect
the elimination of any use of the FMC Marks (other than the Railcar Marks
used in the Permitted Railcar Use) in the Business (including in
the respective corporate or other legal names of the members of the Alkali
Group), so as to bring Purchaser and its Affiliates, including, after the
Closing, the members of the Alkali Group, into compliance with this _Section
5.15_. Following the end of the Phase-out Period, if Seller or any of its
Affiliates discover any incident of usage of the FMC Marks by Purchaser or its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group) in
violation of this _Section 5.15_ , promptly upon receipt of notice
from Seller, Purchaser shall or shall cause its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group), as applicable, to promptly
destroy or re-label the relevant materials incorporating the FMC Marks and
shall certify (pursuant to a certificate signed by an authorized officer of
Purchaser) the completion of such destruction or re-labelling. After the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates, including,
after the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group, not to) represent that it
has authority to bind Seller or any of its Affiliates.

5.16   _Tax-Exempt Financing_.

  



  

(a)  Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the facilities set
forth on _Section 5.16(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _Exempt
Facilities_ ") have been financed, and refinanced, in whole or in part, with
the proceeds of the issuance and sale by Sweetwater County, Wyoming, of its
Solid Waste Disposal Bonds (FMC Corporation Project) Series 2005 in the
presently outstanding aggregate principal amount of $90 million (the "
_Revenue Bonds_ "), the interest on which, with certain exceptions, is
excluded from gross income for purposes of U.S. federal income taxation under
the Code and Seller is the economic obligor in respect of the Revenue Bonds;
(ii) the basis for such exclusion is the use of the Exempt Facilities for the
purpose of the disposal of solid waste; (iii) the use of the Exempt Facilities
for a purpose other than a qualifying purpose indicated in clause (ii) above
could impair (A) such exclusion from gross income of the interest on the
Revenue Bonds or (B) the deductibility of Sellers payment of interest based
on the restrictions in Section 150(b) of the Code; and (iv) any breach by
Purchaser of its obligations under this _Section 5.16_ could result in the
incurrence by Seller and its Affiliates of additional costs and expenses,
including increased interest costs, loss of the interest deduction for tax
purposes and transaction costs relating to any refinancing redemption or
defeasance of all or part of the Revenue Bonds, and Purchaser shall be liable
to Seller and its Affiliates for such additional costs and expenses.

  



  

(b)  Purchaser (i) shall not use, or permit the use of, the Exempt
Facilities for any purpose other than the collection, storage, treatment,
utilization, processing or final disposal of solid waste, all as contemplated
by Section 142(a)(6) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, or unless Purchaser has obtained, at its own expense, an opinion
addressed to Seller of nationally recognized bond counsel reasonably
acceptable to Seller (the " _Bond Counsel_ ") that such use will not impair
(x) the exclusion from gross income of the interest on any issue of Revenue
Bonds for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (y) the deductibility of
Sellers payments of interest based on the restrictions in Section 150(b) of
the Code and (ii) represents and warrants to Seller that Purchaser reasonably
expects, as of the date of this Agreement, that the Exempt Facilities will
continue to be used for the qualifying purposes set forth in clause (i) above,
and for no other purpose, for the remainder of their useful lives.

  



  

(c)  No provision hereof is intended to, nor shall, prohibit Purchaser
from suspending the operation of the Exempt Facilities on a temporary basis,
or from terminating the operation of the Exempt Facilities on a permanent
basis and shutting down, retiring, abandoning or decommissioning the Exempt
Facilities; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Exempt Facilities, in whole
or in part, are dismantled and sold, including any sale for scrap, and if the
operation of the trona mining and soda ash manufacturing facilities at the
Businesss plant near Green River, Wyoming, shall not theretofore have been,
and are not then being, terminated on a permanent basis, then the proceeds of
such sale of the Exempt Facilities shall, within six (6) months after the date
of such sale, be expended to acquire replacement property to be used for the
same qualifying purpose as the Exempt Facilities so sold, unless Purchaser
has obtained, at its own expense, an opinion addressed to Seller of Bond
Counsel that the failure to take this action will not impair (x) the
exclusion from gross income of the interest on any issue of Revenue Bonds for
U.S. federal income tax purposes or (y) the deductibility of Sellers
payments of interest based on the restrictions in Section 150(b) of the Code.

(d)  Purchaser shall not issue, or have issued on its behalf, any tax-
exempt bonds to finance or refinance its acquisition of the Exempt
Facilities; _provided_ that this _Section 5.16(d)_ shall not prohibit the use
of tax-exempt bonds to finance or refinance any improvement to the Exempt
Facilities made after the Closing Date or to any assets purchased hereunder
other than the Exempt Facilities.

  



  

(e)  Purchaser shall give Seller at least one hundred eighty (180) days
prior written notice of any suspension or termination of the operation of the
Exempt Facilities, or any part thereof, and of any sale, exchange, transfer or
other disposition of the Exempt Facilities, or any part thereof, including a
sale for scrap.

  



  

(f)  If Seller shall desire to refund the Revenue Bonds, Purchaser
shall cooperate with Seller and with Sellers counsel with respect to the
refunding bonds and shall provide, upon request, any representations,
agreements or covenants that are reasonably requested concerning its
compliance to such date or in the future with the representations, agreements
and covenants set forth in this _Section 5.16_.

  



  

(g)  If Purchaser shall sell, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of
the Exempt Facilities to a third party, Purchaser shall cause to be included
in the documentation relating to such transaction representations, agreements
and covenants on the part of such third party substantially identical to
those of Purchaser set forth in this _Section 5.16_.

  



  

(h)  The representations, agreements and covenants of Purchaser
contained in this _Section 5.16_ shall continue in effect for so long as the
Revenue Bonds, including any refunding bonds issued hereafter to refund the
Revenue Bonds, shall remain outstanding. Seller shall notify Purchaser upon
there being no Revenue Bonds outstanding.

  



  

(i)  For so long as the representations, agreements and covenants of
Purchaser set forth in this _Section 5.16_ shall continue in effect, Seller
shall have the right to inspect the Exempt Facilities during normal business
hours upon prior written notice to Purchaser for the purpose of verifying
compliance with such representations, agreements and covenants, and Purchaser
shall give Seller or its authorized agents access to the Exempt Facilities to
conduct such inspections.

  



  

5.17   _Misallocated Assets_. If, following the Closing, any right,
property or asset not forming part of the Business is found to have been
transferred to Purchaser in error, either directly or indirectly (including
pursuant to the Pre-Closing Reorganization), Purchaser shall (i) transfer, or
shall cause its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the members of the
Alkali Group) to transfer, at no cost to Seller or the other members of the
Seller Group, such right, property or asset (and any related Liability) as
soon as practicable to one or more members of the Seller Group indicated by
Seller and (ii) ensure that the member of the Purchaser Group shall where
permitted by the terms on which such member has the right to such asset, hold
the asset (or part thereof), and any monies, goods or other benefits arising
after the Closing by virtue of it, as agent of and trustee for Seller and
allow the Seller Group from and after the Closing to have full enjoyment and
use of such asset and Seller shall bear all burdens relating to such asset.
If, following the Closing, any right, property or asset forming part of the
Business is found to have been retained by Seller or any other member of the
Seller Group in error, either directly or indirectly (including pursuant to
Pre-Closing Reorganization), Seller shall (i) transfer, or shall cause the
other members of the Seller Group to transfer, at no cost to Purchaser, such
right, property or asset (and any related Liability) as soon as practicable
to Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser (including a member of the Alkali
Group) indicated by Purchaser and (ii) ensure that the member of the Seller
Group shall where permitted by the terms on which such member has the right
to such asset, hold the asset (or part thereof), and any monies, goods or
other benefits arising after the Closing by virtue of it, as agent of and
trustee for Purchaser and allow the Purchaser Group from and after the
Closing to have full enjoyment and use of such asset and Purchaser shall bear
all burdens relating to such asset. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties
understand and agree that the Excluded Assets are not intended to, and shall
not, be transferred to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group) and the Seller Group shall
retain such rights, properties and assets.

5.18   _Mineral Rights_. Purchaser acknowledges that it and its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group)
will be subject to certain requirements and will need to obtain certain
approvals under applicable Law and the terms of the Mineral Rights to acquire
or become a holder of the Mineral Rights.

5.20   _Restrictions on Use of Certain Real Property_. Purchaser
acknowledges that the Restricted Site is subject to a restrictive covenant as
set forth in the form of Declaration of Restrictive Covenants set forth in
_Schedule III_ that prohibits any form of digging or subsurface invasions on
the Restricted Site, and Purchaser hereby agrees that it shall (and shall
cause its employees and Affiliates, including, after the Closing, the members
of the Alkali Group to) comply with such restrictive covenant in
all respects. If Purchaser or its successors or assigns (x) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (y) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, Purchaser or its successors or
assigns shall require that the definitive documentation for such

Purchaser set forth in this _Section 5.20_.

  



  

5.21   _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to obtain and to consummate the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters (including the flex
provisions), subject to any amendments or modifications thereto permitted by
this _Section 5.21_ , including using its reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letters and the financing commitments
thereunder (the " _Financing Commitments_ "), subject to any amendments or
modifications thereto permitted by Section 5.21(b), (ii) negotiate, execute
and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Financing Commitments on
terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) contained therein,
subject to any amendments or modifications thereto permitted by
_Section 5.21(b)_ , (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions that are
applicable to Purchaser contained in the Financing Commitments, including the
payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fees required as a
condition to the Debt Financing and due and payable by Purchaser, (iv)
enforce its rights under the Financing Commitments, (v) comply with
its obligations under the Financing Commitments and (vi) consummate the Debt
Financing at or prior to the Closing, including drawing on any interim or
bridge financing under the Financing Commitments. Purchaser shall provide such
information as shall be necessary to keep Seller informed on a reasonable
basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Debt Financing. In the event Purchaser becomes aware that all or any portion
of the Debt Financing has become unavailable, Purchaser shall promptly notify
Seller and shall, in consultation with Seller, use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange as promptly as practicable any such portion from
alternative sources on terms and conditions no less favorable to Purchaser
and to Seller than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters and that would not have any of the effects specified in _Section
5.21(b)_ (any such alternative financing, " _Alternative Financing_ "). If an
Alternative Financing is required in accordance with this _Section 5.21(a)_ ,
Purchaser shall obtain, and when obtained, provide Seller with a copy of, a
new financing commitment that provides for such Alternative Financing,
and Purchaser shall comply with its covenants in this _Section 5.21(a)_ and
_Section 5.21(b)_ with respect to such new financing commitment (as if such
financing commitment were the Debt Commitment Letter). Purchaser shall give
Seller prompt notice of (A) subject to any amendments or modifications
permitted by _Section 5.21(b)_ , the expiration or termination of all or any
portion of the Financing Commitments (including pursuant to any Alternative
Financing) or any definitive documentation relating to the foregoing; (B) for
any reason, all or any portion of the Debt Financing (including pursuant
to any Alternative Financing or definitive documents relating to any of the
foregoing) becoming unavailable; or (C) a breach or repudiation by any party
to the Debt Commitment Letters or Alternative Financing (including any
definitive documents relating to any of the foregoing) of which Purchaser
becomes aware.

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller, agree to or
permit any amendment, replacements, supplement or other modification of, or
waive any of its rights or remedies under the Debt Commitment Letters or Fee
Letters; _provided_ that Purchaser may (i) amend, replace, supplement, modify
or waive any provision of the Debt Commitment Letters or related Fee Letters
if such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver does not
(w) add new (or adversely modify any existing) conditions to the consummation
of the Debt Financing as compared to those in the Debt Commitment Letters and
Fee Letters as of the date hereof, (x) adversely affect the ability of
Purchaser to timely consummate the Sale and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (including, by making the conditions therein less likely
to be satisfied or materially delaying, materially impeding, or preventing the
Closing), (y) adversely affect the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letters or Fee Letters as in
effect on the date hereof or in any definitive agreements executed in
connection herewith or (z) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing contemplated thereunder and (ii) amend the Debt Commitment Letters
to add lenders, lead arrangers, book runners, syndication agents or similar
entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date of
this Agreement, so long as any such addition would not reasonably be expected
to prevent, materially hinder or materially delay the consummation of the Debt
Financing or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
availability of the Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment Letters.
Purchaser shall promptly deliver to Seller copies (redacted only as to fee
amounts, dates and certain other economic terms, including in respect of
"market flex" and "securities demand" provisions, in the case of the Fee
Letters) of any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification
or waiver of the Debt Commitment Letter or Fee Letters.

  



  

(c)  Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to,
and cause the members of the Alkali Group and their respective officers,
employees and advisors, including financial and accounting advisors, of Seller
and the members of the Alkali Group to, provide such cooperation as is
reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with the Debt Financing (
_provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of Seller and its Subsidiaries), including
(i) participating in a reasonable number of lender meetings and calls,
drafting sessions, rating agency presentations, due diligence sessions
(including accounting due diligence sessions) and sessions with prospective
lenders, investors and ratings agencies, in each case at mutually agreed
times; (ii) assisting Purchaser in the preparation of (A) a customary offering

Debt Financing; and (v) participation by the senior management team of the
Business in the marketing activities undertaken in connection with the
marketing of the Debt Financing, including (A) assisting in the preparation of

providing customary authorization and/or representation letters in connection
with the distribution of the bank information memoranda contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letters to prospective lenders and identifying any portion of
the information therein that constitutes material non-public information
regarding the Business, Seller or its Subsidiaries; provided that such
letters and confirmations expressly state that (x) Seller shall not have any
liability of any kind or nature resulting from the use of information in
connection with their cooperation with arranging the Debt Financing and (y)
the recipient of such letters of authorization shall be entitled to rely only
on the representations and warranties contained in the Debt Financing
documents; (vii) facilitating the execution and delivery by the appropriate
officers of Alkali Holdco. of loan agreements, pledge and security documents
and other definitive documents and/or certificates contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters; (viii) cooperating in the replacement or backstop of any
outstanding letters of credit issued for the account of the Business or any

U.S. PATRIOT Act to the extent requested not less than 10 Business Days prior
to the Closing Date; and (x) consenting to the use of the logos of the
Business so long as such use is not reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Business or its reputation, goodwill, products, services, offerings or
intellectual property rights; _provided_ that (v) neither Seller nor any of
its Affiliates shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee,
provide any security, make any representations, provide any
indemnification or incur any other Liability in connection with the Debt
Financing (w) the effectiveness of any documentation executed by Seller with
respect to the Debt Financing shall be subject to the consummation of the
Closing, (x) neither any Persons who are directors of the Seller or any of

resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the
Debt Financing Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to deliver
(1) any financial information in a form not customarily prepared by the
Seller or its Affiliates or (2) any financial information with respect to a
fiscal period that has not yet ended, and (z) Purchaser shall promptly, upon
request by Seller, reimburse and indemnify Seller for all costs or Liabilities
incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with the Debt
Financing (including any Alternative Financing), any such
cooperation pursuant to this Section 5.21 or any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than historical information relating to the
Business provided by Seller and or its Subsidiaries in writing for the purpose
of arranging the Debt Financing), except to the extent such costs or
Liabilities are the direct result of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or other representatives
(acting in their capacity as such) . The obligations of Purchaser in the
foregoing clause (z) shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Any
information provided to Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 5.21(c)_  shall

5.22   _Railcar Lease Option_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall
consult with Purchaser regarding whether to exercise the lease option or the
purchase option under the Railcar Lease Option, it being understood that,
prior to the Closing, Seller may elect to exercise the purchase option or the
lease option in its sole discretion (or may decline to exercise either
option). If Seller elects to exercise such lease option or the purchase
option, once Purchaser or any of its Affiliates takes delivery of a railcar

reimburse Seller for any advance payment made by Seller or any of its
Affiliates prior to the Closing in respect of the Railcar Lease Option.

or indemnities, shall not be expanded beyond what is otherwise expressly
provided elsewhere in this Agreement with respect to Real Property.

at or prior to the Closing the employment of each (i) Business Employee who
is not employed by a member of the Alkali Group to a member of the Alkali
Group, and (ii) employee who is not a Business Employee and who is employed
by a member of the Alkali Group from such member of the Alkali Group to Seller
or any of its Affiliates (other than a member of the Alkali Group), as
designated by Seller. Any Business Employee who is an employee of a member of
the Alkali Group as of the Closing shall be referred to as a " _Transferred
Employee_ ".

  



   

-65- 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

(b)  Effective as of the Closing, each Business Employee shall cease to
participate in and accrue benefits under all Seller Benefit Plans; provided,
however, that at Purchasers election, made no later than five days prior to
Closing, Seller shall allow the Transferred Employees to continue to
participate in Sellers health and welfare benefit plans (excluding any
retiree health and welfare benefits) until no later than ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date, subject to and in accordance with the terms of
the Transition Service Agreement. From and after the Closing, each member of
the Alkali Group shall, and Purchaser shall cause such members of the Alkali
Group to, (i) honor all Business Employee Plans in all material respects in
accordance with their terms as in effect as of the date hereof and (ii)
comply with any additional obligations or standards arising under applicable
Laws or agreements governing the terms and conditions of the Transferred
Employees employment or severance of employment in connection with the Sale
or otherwise. Until June 30, 2016, Purchaser shall provide, or shall cause to
be provided, to each Transferred Employee (A) base compensation and bonus
opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable than were provided to
the Transferred Employee immediately before the Closing (it being understood
that Purchaser shall honor any increases required by the Sellers calendar
year 2015 salary plan previously provided to Purchaser) and (B) employee
benefits (other than non-union defined benefit pension (qualified and non-
qualified) and non-union retiree welfare) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those that were provided to the Transferred
Employee immediately before the Closing. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, until June 30, 2016, Purchaser shall, or
shall cause the members of the Alkali Group to, provide to each Transferred
Employee who is terminated or receives notice of termination on or prior to
June 30, 2016, severance benefits equal to the severance benefits for which
such Transferred Employee was eligible as of immediately prior to the
Closing determined without taking into account any reduction after the
Closing in compensation paid to such Transferred Employee.

  



  

(c)  For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Transferred Employees
after the Closing, including the Business Employee Plans (the " _New Plans_
"), each Transferred Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with Seller and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors
before the Closing, to the same extent as such Transferred Employee was
entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar
Benefit Plan in which such Transferred Employee participated or was eligible
to participate immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ that the foregoing
shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) each Transferred Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Benefit Plan in which such
Transferred Employee participated immediately before the Closing (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Transferred Employee, Purchaser shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would
not have been waived under the comparable plans of Seller or its
Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the
Closing, and Purchaser shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plans ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents
for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance
with such New Plan.

6.2   _WARN and Corresponding State Laws_. Provided that Seller
provides Purchaser with a true and correct list, by date and location, of
each employee of the Business terminated in the ninety (90) days preceding the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume and be solely responsible for and agrees
to indemnify, hold harmless and, at the option of Seller, to defend Seller or
any of its Affiliates from and against any Liability under WARN on or after
the Closing Date as a result of Purchasers actions or Purchasers failure to
serve sufficient notice pursuant to WARN. Seller shall assume and be solely
responsible for and agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and, at the option of
Purchaser, to defend Purchaser or any of its Affiliates from any Liability
arising under WARN due to (i) Sellers actions or omissions occurring prior
to or on the Closing Date or (ii) any inaccuracy in the information required
to be provided pursuant to this _Section_ _6.2_.

6.4   _Workers  Compensation_. Seller and its Affiliates shall
be solely responsible for workers compensation claims by or with respect to
any Transferred Employee that are incurred prior to the Closing Date and
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for workers
compensation claims by or with respect to any Transferred Employee that are
incurred on or after the Closing Date. For purposes of this _Section 6.4_ , a
workers compensation claim shall be considered incurred before the Closing
Date if the injury or condition giving rise to the claim occurs before the
Closing Date. Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser on the other, shall
provide access to all applicable records with respect to such workers
compensation claims to allow the other Party (or its Affiliates) to perform
its obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.4_.

  



  

6.5   _Defined Contribution Pension Plan_. Seller shall fully
vest all non-union Transferred Employees in their accounts under Sellers tax
qualified defined contribution plan and, with respect to such Transferred
Employees employment service rendered prior to the Closing Date, shall make
all required employer contributions. From and after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall cause a Purchaser tax-qualified defined contribution plan ("
_Purchaser DC Plan_ ") to accept rollover contributions, in cash, of the
"eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of
the Code) of the Transferred Employees from any tax-qualified defined
contribution plan of Seller or its Affiliates qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code.

  



  

6.6   _Flexible Spending Accounts_. Seller and Purchaser shall
take all actions necessary or appropriate so that, effective as of the date
that Transferred Employees cease to participate in Sellers health and welfare
plans(the " _FSA End Date_ "), (a) the account balances (whether positive or
negative) (the " _Transferred Account Balances_ ") under the FMC Flexible
Benefits Plan (" _Seller s Flex Plan_") of the Transferred Employees who are
participants in Sellers Flex Plan (the " _Covered Flex Plan Employees_ ")
shall be transferred to one or more comparable plans of Purchaser
(collectively, the " _Purchaser s Flex Plan_"); (b) the elections,
contribution levels and coverage levels of the Covered Flex Plan Employees
shall apply under the Purchasers Flex Plan in the same manner as under the
Sellers Flex Plan; and (c) the Covered Flex Plan Employees shall be
reimbursed from the Purchasers Flex Plan for claims incurred at any time
during the plan year of the Sellers Flex Plan in which the FSA End Date
occurs submitted to the Purchasers Flex Plan from and after the FSA End Date
on the same basis and the same terms and conditions as under the Sellers
Flex Plan. As soon as practicable after the FSA End Date, and in any event
within ten (10) Business Days after the amount of the Transferred Account
Balances is determined, Seller shall pay Purchaser the net aggregate amount of
the Transferred Account Balances, if such amount is positive, and Purchaser
shall pay Seller the net aggregate amount of the Transferred Account
Balances, if such amount is negative.

6.7   _Collective Bargaining Agreement_. Effective as of the
Closing, (a) Purchaser shall assume the CBA (including the obligation to
honor the terms and conditions thereof and any obligations thereunder
requiring a successor to recognize a particular labor union as authorized
representative and bargaining agent of an employee group or for any other
purpose) from Seller and Alkali HoldCo, (b) Purchaser shall be the "Employer"
for purposes of the CBA, (c) Purchaser shall have sole responsibility for all
Liabilities arising under the CBA (excluding, for purposes of clarity,
Liabilities arising under any Seller Benefit Plans that are earned or accrued
prior to the Closing), and (d) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless
Seller and its Affiliates with respect to the Liabilities described in the
immediately preceding  _clause (c)_. Following the Closing, Purchaser shall
provide any employee benefit required to be provided to any Business Employee
covered by the CBA pursuant to an employee benefit plan maintained by Seller
or any of its Affiliates to instead be provided pursuant to an employee
benefit plan maintained by Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries. Purchaser
agrees that it shall execute all agreements and other documents necessary to
effect the assumption of the CBA.

  



  

6.8  Defined Benefit Plans.

  



  

(a)  Seller shall provide any Transferred Employee who participates in
the FMC Corporation Employees Retirement Program - Part I - Salaried and
Nonunion Hourly Employees Retirement Plan (the " _Seller Non-Union DB Plan_
"), who has reached at least the age of 50 and has at least 10 years of
service as of the Closing Date, and who remains employed by Purchaser
following the Closing until at least age 55 with the early retirement subsidy
under the Seller Non-Union DB Plan that such Transferred Employee would have
been entitled to had he or she remained employed by Seller until at least age
55.

  



  

(b)  For all Business Employees who participate in the FMC Corporation
Employees Retirement Program - Part II - Union Hourly Employees Retirement
Plan (the " _Seller Union DB Plan_ "), service with Purchaser shall
be counted for purposes of vesting in the accrued, frozen benefit under the
Seller Union DB Plan.

  



  

(c)  Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall adopt a defined
benefit pension plan effective as of the Closing Date (the " _Purchaser DB
Plan_ ") and a related funding arrangement which is intended to be qualified
and tax-exempt under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code.
The Purchaser DB Plan shall be established as a mirror plan to the Seller
Union DB Plan and shall comply with all requirements under the CBA previously
established between Seller and the United Steelworkers of America, Local No.
13214 (including the Memorandum of Agreement Collective Bargaining Agreement
Extension dated October 23, 2014). The Purchaser will cause the Purchaser DB
Plan to expressly provide that any Transferred Employees (who are covered by
the CBA and who were participants in the Seller Union DB Plan immediately
prior to the Closing) will become participants (" _Transferred Union DB Plan
Participants_ ") in the Purchaser DB Plan as of the Closing Date, and that all
Transferred Union DB Plan Participants will have their service which is
recognized under the Seller Union DB Plan for purposes of
eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual, determination of eligibility for early
retirement and other subsidized benefits and all other purposes taken into
account under the Purchaser DB Plan for similar purposes.

(d)  The accrued benefit of each Transferred Union DB Plan Participant
under the Purchaser DB Plan as of the Closing Date (taking into account
service as described in _Section 6.8(b)_ above but not taking into account the
benefit offset described in the last sentence of this _Section 6.8(d)_ ) will
be at least as great as the accrued benefit of such Transferred Union DB
Plan Participant under the Seller Union DB Plan immediately prior to the
Closing Date. The accrued benefit of each Transferred Union DB Plan
Participant under the Purchaser DB Plan shall be reduced by the accrued
benefit of such person under the Seller DB Plan.

  



  

(e)  Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the Seller DB
Plan to be amended to provide that (i) the accrued benefit thereunder of each
Transferred Union DB Plan Participant shall be frozen as of the Closing Date,
and shall not be adjusted following the Closing Date on account of service
with the Purchaser, increases in the monthly pension benefit rate multiplier
following the Closing, or any other reason, and (ii) service with the
Purchaser following the Closing shall continue to be counted
thereunder solely for purposes of vesting of the accrued benefit earned under
the Seller DB Plan. Upon Sellers written request, Purchaser promptly shall
confirm any Transferred Employees years of service with Purchaser and its
Affiliates.

  



  

(f)  Purchaser shall timely submit the Purchaser DB Plan to the
Internal Revenue Service for a determination that the Purchaser DB Plan and
its related trust are qualified and tax-exempt under Sections 401(a) and
501(a), respectively, of the Code. Seller shall take such actions as may be
necessary to cause the Seller DB Plan and its related trust to continue to be
qualified and tax-exempt under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code,
respectively.

  



  

(g)  Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in making such filings with
the Internal Revenue Service, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and
any other governmental authority which is required to implement the provisions
of this _Section 6.8_ or otherwise comply with applicable law related
thereto.

  



  

6.9   _Employment Confirmation_. Until the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall (a)
provide written notice of the termination of the employment with Purchaser or
its Affiliates of any Transferred Employee and (b) from time to time, as
requested by Seller, provide confirmation (in writing, if requested by
Seller) of the fact whether any any Transferred Employee remains employed with
Purchaser or its Affiliates, together with such other information as Seller
may reasonably require for the administration of its Benefit Plans.

6.10   _Annual Bonuses_. Seller or its applicable Affiliate shall
pay an annual bonus for the year in which the Closing occurs prorated through
the Closing (which shall be based upon target performance) to each Transferred
Employee who is or would be eligible to receive an annual bonus under any
Seller Benefit Plan pursuant to the terms thereof. Without limiting the
generality of _Section _  _6.1(b)_ , following the Closing (and no later
than March 2016), Purchaser shall pay an annual bonus for the year in
which the Closing occurs prorated from and including the Closing Date through
and including December 31, 2015 (the amount of which shall be determined by
Purchaser, using the performance measures and targets established by Seller
for 2015).

its Affiliates will assume or retain, as the case may be, and be solely
responsible for and will fully perform, pay and discharge, in accordance with
their terms, all Liabilities in respect of Business Employees (including the
Transferred Employees) and former employees of the Business (and claims by or
relating to such Persons) with respect to Seller Equity Awards, which Seller
Equity Awards shall be subject to the same vesting requirements and dates and
other terms and conditions as were applicable to such Seller Equity Awards
immediately prior to the Closing, _provided_  that (a) a Business Employees
continued employment or service with Purchaser and its Affiliates (including
any member of the Alkali Group) from and after the Closing shall be treated
as employment or service with Seller and its Affiliates for purposes of
satisfying any service-based vesting requirements with respect to such Seller
Equity Awards that are stock options, and (b) on the Closing Date Seller will
accelerate the vesting of a pro rata portion of the Seller Equity Awards that
are restricted stock units held by each Business Employee, with such pro
ration based on (i) the portion of the service period from the

be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). At Sellers
request, Purchaser shall file, or cause to be filed, amended Pre-Closing
Separate Tax Returns. Purchaser shall promptly provide (or cause to be
provided) to Seller any information reasonably requested by Seller to

be prepared such Tax Return in a manner consistent with past practices of the
relevant member of the Alkali Group (except to the extent otherwise required
by a change in Law). Purchaser shall deliver to Seller for its review, comment
and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) a copy of such Straddle Period Separate Tax Returns at

any extensions). Seller shall provide any comments to Purchaser within ten
(10) days of receipt of any such Straddle Period Separate Tax Return and

Tax Item.

  



  

(b)  Seller shall be entitled to (i) any refunds or credits of or against
any Taxes for which Seller is responsible under _Section 7.1_ , and (ii) any
refunds or credits to which Seller is entitled under _Section 7.5(a)_ or _(c)_
; _provided_  that Seller shall not be entitled to any refunds to the extent
such refunds were reflected as an asset in Working Capital on the Final Post-
Closing Adjustment Statement. Purchaser shall be entitled to any refunds or
credits of any member of the Alkali Group of or against any Taxes of such
member other than refunds or credits to which Seller is entitled pursuant to
the foregoing sentence. Any refunds or credits of or against Taxes of the

any Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between Seller and
Purchaser in accordance with the principles set forth in _Section 7.3_ and
the first sentence of this _Section 7.5(b)_. Each Party shall pay, or cause

or credit) in readily available funds within fifteen (15) days of the actual
receipt of such refund or credit or the application of such refund or credit
or against amounts otherwise payable.

after the Closing Date, if a carry back of such Subsequent Loss into any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date could relate to or affect
any Tax for which Seller is responsible pursuant to _Section 7.1_ or
otherwise. If any such Subsequent Loss is not permitted by applicable Law to
be carried forward or carried back into any taxable period beginning after
the Closing Date, Seller shall be entitled to any refund of, or credit
against, Taxes resulting from any carry back of such Subsequent Loss into any
taxable period beginning on or before the Closing Date.

the basis for such Tax Claim and shall include a copy of the relevant portion
of any correspondence received from the Tax Authority.

authorization, consent, approval, expiration or termination in order for the
Parties to consummate the Sale shall have denied such grant in a manner that
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_
and such denial shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 9.1(b)(iii)_ shall have complied in all material respects with
its obligations under _Section 5.3_ ;

  



  

(c)  by Seller if Purchaser shall have breached or failed to perform any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained
in this Agreement, and such breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise
to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 8.3(a)_ or _Section
8.3(b)_ and (B) (x) cannot be cured prior to the Outside Date or (y) has
not been cured or waived prior to the date that is thirty (30) days from the

has not been cured or waived prior to the date that is thirty (30) days from

(e)  by Seller if (i) all the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ and
_8.2_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that, by
their nature, can only be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but which would
be capable of being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such
termination) and (ii) Purchaser fails to consummate the Closing by the
date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.9_ , subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, within five (5) Business Days
following the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.9_

any termination of this Agreement and nothing in this Agreement shall relieve
either Party hereto from liability for failure to perform the
obligations thereunder, and (b) nothing in this Agreement shall relieve
either Party hereto from liability for any fraud or intentional breach of
this Agreement. The obligation of the Parties under the Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement unchanged.

either Seller or Purchaser may (a) extend the time for performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies

Parties liable for such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in

give rise to a right of indemnification under such agreement (including a
pending or threatened Action, Order, claim or demand asserted by a third
Party against the Indemnified Party, such claim being a " _Third Party Claim_
"), describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect
to the subject matter of such claim or demand; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party
from any of its obligations under this _Article X_ except to the extent that

(b)  Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim for indemnity from
an Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_  or _Section 10.3(a)_ ,
the Indemnifying Party will be entitled, by notice to the Indemnified Party
delivered within twenty (20) Business Days of the receipt of notice of such
Third Party Claim, to assume the defense and control of such Third Party
Claim (at the expense of such Indemnifying Party); _provided_ that, if the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense and control of such Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim (but not
control or make decisions related thereto) with its own counsel and at its own
expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense and control of
any Third Party Claim pursuant to this _Section 10.4(b)_ , the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to assume and control such defense; _provided_ that
the Indemnifying Party may nonetheless participate in the defense of such
Third Party Claim (but not control or make decisions related thereto) with its
own counsel and at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense and control of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
shall select counsel, contractors and consultants of recognized standing and
competence and shall use commercially reasonable efforts in the defense or
settlement of such Third Party Claim. Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be,
shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates and representatives to,
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any Third
Party Claim, including by furnishing books and records, personnel and
witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense and control of a Third Party Claim,
it shall be authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, in its sole discretion and
without the consent of any Indemnified Party; _provided_ that (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such
settlement or judgment involves any injunctive relief binding on any of the
Indemnified Parties or any finding or admission of any violation of Law or
admission of any wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party, and (ii) the
Indemnifying Party shall (A) pay or cause to be paid all amounts in such
settlement or judgment (other than to the extent that such liabilities would
constitute Losses to which the De Minimis Amount, Deductible or Cap would be
applicable in accordance with the applicable provisions of _Sections 10.2(b)_
and _10.3(c)_ or _Sections 10.3(b)_ and _10.3(c)_ , as applicable) and (B)
obtain, as a condition of any settlement or other resolution, a complete and
unconditional release of the Indemnified Parties potentially affected by such
Third Party Claim. No Indemnified Party will consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to a Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to pay or settle any such claim if it irrevocably waives in a
writing delivered to the Indemnifying Party any right to indemnity therefor
under this Agreement.

  



  

10.5   _Exclusive Remedy and Release_. Except in the case of fraud
and except with respect to (a) the matters covered by _Section 2.4_ , _2.11_
, _2.12_ , _2.13_ , or _11.11_ , (b) the Ancillary Agreements and (c) with
respect to any matter relating to Taxes (which shall be governed exclusively
by _Article VII_ ), Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and agree
that, following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of _Sections
10.2_ and _10.3_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Seller and
Purchaser, respectively, and their respective Affiliates, including with
respect to Purchaser after the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group, for
any Losses (including any Losses from claims for breach of contract, warranty,
tortious conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated
on common law, statute, strict liability or otherwise) that each Party may at
any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of, or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Sale,
including any breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement by
any Party, or any failure by any Party to perform or comply with any covenant
or agreement that, by its terms, was to have been performed, or complied
with, under this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive any right of rescission they or
their respective Affiliates may otherwise have or to which they may become
entitled.

10.6   _Additional Indemnification Provisions_. With respect to each
indemnification obligation contained in this _Article X_ , all Losses shall
be net of any third-party insurance and indemnity proceeds that are actually
recovered by the Indemnified Party in connection with the facts giving rise
to the right of indemnification (it being agreed that if third-party insurance
or indemnification proceeds in respect of such facts are recovered by the
Indemnified Party subsequent to the Indemnifying Partys making of an
indemnification payment in satisfaction of its applicable indemnification
obligation, such proceeds shall be promptly remitted to the Indemnifying
Party to the extent of the indemnification payment made). Upon making any
payment to the Indemnified Party for any indemnification claim pursuant to
this _Article X_ , the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the
extent of such payment, to any and all rights that the Indemnified Party may
have against any third parties with respect to the subject matter underlying
such indemnification claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assign any and all
such rights to the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding any other provision to
the contrary, for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, or the amount of any Loss
related to any such breach or inaccuracy, under _Section_ _10.2(a)(i)_  or
_Section 10.3(a)(i)_ , the representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement and in any certificate furnished pursuant to this Agreement shall
be considered without giving effect to any materiality limitation or
qualification (including the terms "material" or "Material Adverse Effect")
(other than references to "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" (x) solely
with respect to the standard that must be met to create an obligation to
include items in a list set forth in a Disclosure Schedule or (y) contained
within the definitions of "Permitted Lien" and "Environmental Permit");
_provided_ , that this sentence shall not apply to the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 3.5(a)_ , _3.5(b)_ , the last sentence of
_Section 3.6_ or _Section 3.14(a)(ii)_.

  



  

10.7   _Limitation of Liability_. In no event shall any Indemnifying
Party have liability to any Indemnified Party for any consequential, special,
incidental, indirect or punitive damages, including actual or potential lost
profits; _provided_ that, in each case, such limitation shall not limit
recovery to the extent any such damages are payable to a Third Party as part
of a Third Party Claim against an Indemnified Party that is indemnifiable
hereunder. Any Liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined
without duplication of recovery by reason of state of facts giving rise to
such Liability constituting a breach of more than one representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement.

hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Action in
any such court, (iv) that a final judgment in any such Action shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law, (v) that the Laws of the State of New
York shall govern any such Action and (vi) to irrevocably waive and hereby
waives any right to a trial by jury in any such action to the same extent such

11.4   _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the
Ancillary Agreements and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto and
the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the
Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes
any prior discussion, correspondence, negotiation, proposed term sheet,
agreement, understanding or arrangement, written or oral, and there are no
agreements, understandings, representations or warranties between the
Parties other than those set forth or referred to in this Agreement. In the
case of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Contribution
Agreement, on the one hand, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on
the other hand, this Agreement shall govern and control.

  



  

11.5   _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for (i) _Sections
5.13_ , _10.2_ and _10.3_ , which are intended to benefit, and to be

Section _11.5_ , the last sentence of Section _11.8_ , Section _11.9_ , the
last sentence of _Section __ 11.11_ and _Section 11.16_ , which are intended

the Alkali Group in connection with seeking consents and approvals required
pursuant to _Section 5.3_ , _5.5_ or _5.14_ of this Agreement shall be borne

11.8   _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement and their
respective successors and assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party to
this Agreement may directly or indirectly assign any or all of its rights or
delegate any or all of its obligations under this Agreement without the
express prior written consent of the other Party to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary included in the preceding sentence,
Purchaser may, without the consent of Seller, collaterally assign this
Agreement, in whole or in part, to any Debt Financing Source as
collateral security.

  



  

11.9   _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be modified
or amended except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by the
Party against whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment is
sought. Either Party to this Agreement may, only by an instrument in writing,
waive compliance by the other Party to this Agreement with any term or
provision of this Agreement on the part of such other Party to this Agreement
to be performed or complied with. The waiver by any Party to this Agreement
of a breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall not be construed
as a waiver of any subsequent breach. No failure or delay by any party in
exercising any right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof,
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
_Section 11.3(d),_ Section _11.5_ , the last sentence of Section _11.8_ , the
last sentence of _Section 11.11_ , _Section 11.16_ and this Section _11.9_ and
(and any other provision of this Agreement to the extent a modification,
waiver or termination of such provision that would modify the substance of
such Sections) may not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified
in any manner that impacts or is otherwise adverse in any respect to the Debt
Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing
Sources.

  



  

11.10   _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated
so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon
such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

  



  

11.11   _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform any
provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled in Law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy at
Law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at Law or in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with such order or injunction. The
foregoing is in addition to any other remedy to which any Party is entitled
at law, in equity or otherwise. The Parties further agree that nothing set
forth in this _Section 11.11_ shall require any Party to institute any Action
for (or limit any Partys right to institute any Action for) specific
performance under this _Section 11.11_ prior to or as a condition to
exercising any termination right under _Article IX_ (and pursuing damages
after such termination). If any Party brings any Action to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other
Party, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (x) the amount of
time during which such action is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days or
(y) such other time period established by the court presiding over such
action. The Parties agree that, notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Seller shall be entitled to specific performance (or any
other equitable relief) to cause Purchaser to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Seller be
entitled to seek any remedy of specific performance or other equitable
remedies directly against any Debt Financing Source.

11.12   _Bulk Sale Laws_. Purchaser hereby waives compliance by Seller
and the other members of the Seller Group, in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, with the provisions of any applicable bulk
sales or bulk transfer or similar Law.

  



  

11.13   _No Admission_. Nothing herein shall be deemed an admission by
Seller or any of its Affiliates, in any Action or proceeding involving a
third party, that Seller or any of its Affiliates or any such third party is
or is not in breach or violation of, or in default in, the performance or
observance of any term or provisions of any Contract.

  



  

11.14   _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by either of the Parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile shall be as
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

  



  

11.15   _Parent Guarantee_.

  



  

(a)  Parent, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, absolutely,
irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the full and timely payment and
performance of the obligations of Purchaser (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ ")
when due and payable or required to be performed, as applicable, in
accordance with this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. This is a
guarantee of payment and performance, and not of collectability. The
obligations of the Parent under this _Section 11.15(a)_ are absolute and
unconditional in respect of satisfying the Guaranteed Obligations and shall be
enforceable against Parent to the same extent as if Parent were the primary
obligor (and not merely a surety) under this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements. It shall not be necessary for Seller (and Parent hereby waives
any rights which Parent may have to require Seller), in order to enforce
the obligations of Parent hereunder, first to (a) institute suit or exhaust
its remedies against Purchaser or any other Person, (b) join Purchaser or any
other Person in any action seeking to enforce any such agreement or (c) resort
to any other means of obtaining payment or enforcement of the obligations of
Purchaser; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any defenses or
counterclaims that would be available to Purchaser shall be available to
Parent hereunder (other than to the extent expressly waived in this  _Section
11.15(a)_ or otherwise arising from any insolvency, bankruptcy, arrangement,
adjustment, composition or liquidation of Purchaser). Seller shall not be
required to take any action to reduce, collect or enforce the obligations of
Purchaser when due under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. Parent
waives notice of protest, proof of non-payment, default or breach
by Purchaser, promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance of this guarantee
and of the Guaranteed Obligations, presentment, demand for payment, notice of
any Guaranteed Obligations incurred, all defenses which may be available by
virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium Law or other similar Law now or
hereafter in effect. Parent agrees to each of the following, and agrees that
its obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements as a result
of this _Section 11.15(a)_ shall not be released, diminished, impaired,
reduced or adversely affected by any of the following, and waives any common
law, equitable, statutory or other rights (including rights to notice except
for notices required to be given by Seller to Purchaser or Parent pursuant to
this Agreement) which Parent might otherwise have as a result of or in
connection with (i) any renewal, extension, increase, modification,
alteration or rearrangement of all or any part of the obligations of
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, (ii) any
insolvency, bankruptcy, arrangement, adjustment, composition, liquidation,
disability, dissolution, asset sale or transfer or change of structure,
ownership or organization of any Person, (iii) any full or partial release by
Seller of the liability of Purchaser, or any part thereof, with respect to
Purchaser or any of its assets, (iv) the failure or delay on the part of
Seller to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy
against Purchaser or (v) the adequacy of any other means the Seller may have
of obtaining payment related to any of the Guaranteed Obligations. Parent
acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements. Parent shall be subrogated to all rights of Seller against
Purchaser in respect of any amounts paid by Parent to Seller pursuant to the
provisions of this _Section 11.15(a)_ in respect of any obligations of
Purchaser under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, but only after
payment in full in cash of all the Guaranteed Obligations. The guarantee set
forth in this _Section 11.15(a)_ is a continuing and absolute guarantee, and
it and the Guaranteed Obligations will not be discharged, and will remain in
full force and effect, until the full payment and performance of all amounts
required to be paid and performed by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements. Parent hereby makes all of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Sections 4.1_ (except that the reference to the
"State of Delaware" shall be deemed to be replaced by "Commonwealth of
Australia"), _4.2_ and _4.3_ , with references therein to "Purchaser" deemed
to be replaced by "Parent". Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees to be bound
by all of the provisions of _Article XI_ of this Agreement.

(b)  Parent hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Purchaser (in such
capacity, the " _Process Agent_ ") as its authorized agent to accept and
acknowledge on its behalf, in the manner provided for notices to Purchaser, as
the Purchaser, in _Section 11.7_ of this Agreement, service of any and all
process which may be served in any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and hereby consents to process being served upon the Process Agent
in any such Action. Purchaser hereby accepts the foregoing appointment.
Parent irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, all claim
of error by reason of any such service and agrees that such service shall be
deemed in every respect effective service of process upon it in any such
Action and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, be taken and held
to be valid and personal service upon and personal delivery to it. If
Purchaser ceases to act as Process Agent at any time, Parent covenants and
agrees to designate irrevocably and appoint without delay another such agent
domiciled in the U.S. reasonably satisfactory to Seller and to deliver
promptly to Seller evidence in writing of such other agents acceptance of
such appointment.

  



  

11.16   _Exculpation of Debt Financing Sources_

  



  

(a)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
member of the Seller Group shall have any rights or claims against any Debt
Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise; _provided_ that, the foregoing will not limit
the rights of the Purchaser in respect of the Debt Financing under any
commitment letter related thereto. Seller (i) agrees on behalf of the Seller
Group that no member of the Seller Group shall have the right to seek or
obtain money damages or expense reimbursement (whether at law or in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise) from any Debt Financing Source, (ii) waives
any and all claims against each Debt Financing Source and (iii) hereby agrees
that in no event shall any Debt Financing Source have any liability or
obligation to the Seller or any member of the Seller Group relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing, any commitment letter
related thereto or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(b)  Without limiting the foregoing, no Debt Financing Source shall be
subject to any special, consequential, punitive or indirect damages or
damages of a tortious nature.

  



  

(c)  Solely for purposes of _Section 11.16(a)_ , "Seller Group" shall be
deemed to include each of the Seller Groups respective controlled affiliates
and their and their respective controlled affiliates stockholders,
partners, members, officers, directors, employees, controlling persons,
agents and representatives.
