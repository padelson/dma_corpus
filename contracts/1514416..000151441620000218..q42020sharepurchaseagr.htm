Bandwidth Class A Common Stock as at Closing (the Consideration Shares), and

Shares as a result of such cap being the Excess Amount.

3.4 The Purchase Price Adjustment shall be calculated after Closing in

Sellers and the Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser the shortfall equal to the
negative amount in their Purchase Price Adjustment Proportions in the five
Business Day period referred to in this clause 3.7; or

Page 4

allocation of the Initial Consideration amongst the Sellers or for any failure
by a Seller or any other person to allocate such sum amongst the Sellers.

3.10 The Stichting hereby:

(a) agrees to a deduction from the payment of the Stichting's portion of the
Closing Payment of an amount equal to the aggregate amount owed and
outstanding at Closing (including principal and interest thereon) (each an

Employee (as borrower) (each an Employee Loan and together the Employee
Loans), as notified by the Sellers' Representative to the Purchaser in
accordance with clause 5.9(a)(v); and

(b) directs the Purchaser to deduct from the payment of the Stichting's
portion of the Closing Payment and to transfer on behalf of the relevant Loan
Employees to the relevant Target Companies, at Closing, an amount equal to the

obligations of each Loan Employee under each relevant Employee Loan and (ii)
the obligation of the Purchaser to pay such amount of the Stichting's portion

Amounts.

3.11 The Stichting acknowledges and agrees that the payment by the Purchaser
to the Stichting of the Closing Payment in accordance with clauses 3.3, 3.9
and 3.10 constitutes full and final discharge of any obligation to pay any
amount of the Initial Consideration to the Loan Employees and the holders of
depositary receipts in the Stichting, and no Loan Employee and, without
prejudice to the rights of the Stichting under clause 3.7, no holder of
depositary receipts in the Stichting shall have any claim against any member

accepted as full and final discharge of the obligation to repay the LNs held

3.13 Any payment made by a Seller to the Purchaser (or vice versa) in
satisfaction of a liability arising from a breach of this Agreement or the
Management Warranty Deed or pursuant to an indemnity or covenant to pay under
this Agreement shall, if and to the extent permitted by Law, be treated as an
adjustment of the Final Consideration.

and the right to examine and copy or photograph at the expense of the relevant

accounting, filing, reporting, audit, on-going litigation and compliance
requirements (or any other legal or regulatory requirement) with respect to
the Target Companies, subject to such Seller or such member of the Sellers'
Group agreeing in such form as the Purchaser may reasonably require to keep
all such information confidential, as applicable.

9.2 The Sellers shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Voice Topco
promptly following Closing, all records, correspondence, documents, files,
memoranda and other papers (in whatever form) belonging to Voice Topco and all
other Target Companies, as well as any branches, permanent establishments and
places of business of a Target Company.

Restrictions on the Sellers

9.3 Voicebox undertakes to the Purchaser and each member of the Purchaser
Group that, except with the prior written consent of the Purchaser, it shall
not (and it shall procure that each member of its Sellers' Group shall not),
at any time during the period of three years beginning with the Effective
Closing Time, offer employment to, enter into a contract for the services of,
or attempt to entice away from any of the Target Companies, any Key Employee,
whether or not such person would commit a breach of contract by reason of
leaving such employment or engagement (except a person who responds, without
any form of approach or solicitation by or on behalf of any member of
Voicebox's Sellers' Group, to a general public advertisement not specifically
targeted at such person, or otherwise makes an unsolicited approach to a
member of Voicebox's Sellers' Group) or procure or facilitate the making of
any such attempt by any other person.

9.4 Each of the Management Sellers undertakes to the Purchaser and each member
of the Purchaser Group that, without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser, he shall not:

(a) at any time during the Restricted Period:

(i) carry on, or be concerned, engaged or interested in any business in the
United Kingdom, Belgium, the USA, El Salvador, Panama and Turkey which is, or
has a documented intention to be, in competition with, the Business as
conducted by the Target Group as at the Closing Date or assist any other
person to do any of the foregoing things;

(ii) offer employment to, enter into a contract for the services of, or
attempt to entice away from any of the Target Companies, any Key Employee,
whether or not such person would commit a breach of contract by reason of
leaving such employment or engagement (except a person who responds, without
any form of approach or solicitation by or on behalf of any Management Seller,
to a general public advertisement not specifically targeted at such person, or
a person who makes an unsolicited approach to a Management Seller) or procure
or facilitate the making of any such attempt by any other person;

Page 25

AMS6540051 168372-0004 Project Beaker - SPA





(iii) deal with or canvass, solicit or seek to solicit, in competition with
the Target Companies, the custom of any person who has been a customer of any
of the Target Companies at any time within the 12 months immediately prior to
Closing and with which that Management Seller had business dealings during
that same 12-month period; or

(iv) solicit or entice away from any of the Target Companies any supplier who
had supplied goods and/or services to any of the Target Companies at any time
during the 12 months immediately prior to Closing if that solicitation or
enticement causes or could cause such supplier to cease supplying, or
materially reduce its supply of, those goods and/or services to any of the
Target Companies; or

(b) at any time after Closing, use in the course of trade or in any business:
(other than the Business itself)

(i) the words "voxbone", "voxdid", "voxout", "vox" and "inum";

(ii) any trade or service mark, business or domain name, design or logo which,
at Closing, was or had been used by any of the Target Companies; or

(iii) anything which is, in the reasonable opinion of the Purchaser, capable
of confusion with such words, mark, name, design or logo;

(c) at any time from the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement or
arrangement or binding understanding with any member of Voicebox's Sellers'
Group with financial repercussions on, or leading to liability on the part of,
any party to such agreement or arrangement (whether at the time such agreement
or arrangement or binding understanding is entered into or in the future).

9.5 Nothing contained in clause 9.4 shall prevent any of the Management
Sellers from being employed or engaged by any Target Company or, for so long
as they remain employed or engaged by any Target Company, restrict them from
duly carrying out their duties as employees, consultants, service providers
and/or directors of any Target Company.

9.6 The undertakings in clauses 9.3 and 9.4 are intended for the benefit of
the Purchaser and the Purchaser Group and apply to actions carried out by the
applicable Seller, or, with respect to clause 9.3, Voicebox's Sellers' Group,
in any capacity whatsoever and whether directly or indirectly, on such
Seller's or such member of its Sellers' Group's own behalf, on behalf of any
other person or jointly with any other person.

9.7 The undertakings contained in clauses 9.3 and 9.4 are reasonable and
necessary for the protection of the Purchaser's legitimate interests in the
goodwill of the Target Group and to confer upon the Purchaser the full benefit
of the business and goodwill of the Target Group, and shall be construed as
separate and independent undertakings. If any such undertaking is held to be
void or

Page 26

AMS6540051 168372-0004 Project Beaker - SPA





unenforceable, the validity of the remaining undertakings shall not be
affected, and if any such undertaking is found to be void or unenforceable but
would be valid and enforceable if some part or parts of the undertaking were
deleted, such undertaking shall apply with such modification as may be
necessary to make it valid and enforceable.

9.8 Without prejudice to clause 9.7, if any undertaking in this clause 9 is
found by any court or other competent authority to be void or unenforceable,
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to replace such void or
unenforceable undertaking with a valid provision which, as far as possible,
has the same commercial effect as the provision which it replaces.

9.9 Save in the case of fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, each Seller
undertakes to the Purchaser that it:

4.has no rights against (and waives any rights it may have against); and

5.shall not make any claim against (and waives any claim it may have against),

any Target Company or any of its directors or officers (a Covered Person) or
its employees or consultants provided that this clause shall (i) not have any
effect on any rights or claims that any of the Management Sellers could have
against any Target Company in connection with or arising out of the
relationship that exists between such Target Company and Management Seller
under such Management Seller's consultancy agreement or employment contract
(as applicable), and (ii) not apply to claims against a member of the
Purchaser Group for breach of this Agreement.

Directors

9.10 Following Closing, the Purchaser shall ensure that any indemnity and/or
immunity provisions contained in the memorandum and articles of association
(or similar constitutional documents) of each Target Company of which a
Covered Person was an officer or director immediately prior to Closing are not
amended, repealed or modified in any manner that would affect the rights of
any such Covered Person in an adverse manner.

9.11 For six years from Closing, the Purchaser shall ensure that each Target
Company maintains in force such "run-off" directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies as will enable each Covered Person to, subject to the terms
of such insurance policies, make claims arising out of any matter, cause or
event occurring before Closing under those policies on terms and conditions
that are no less advantageous to such Covered Person than the terms and
conditions of cover for such Covered Person contained in the directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Target Companies as
at the date of this Agreement.

9.12 The Purchaser shall:

(a) procure that the directors, managers and members of the executive
committee (or local equivalents) of Voxbone who hold office at Closing or held
office prior to Closing (together, Voice Directors) are granted

Page 27

AMS6540051 168372-0004 Project Beaker - SPA





unconditional and irrevocable discharge for the performance of their duties as
director, manager or member of the executive committee (or local equivalents)
of Voxbone up until Closing, at the next relevant annual shareholders'
meetings (or other relevant corporate body meeting) of Voxbone; and

(b) not initiate legal proceedings against any Voice Director (or its
permanent representative) in connection with the Proposed Transaction (save in
the case of fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation or as may be agreed between
the Purchaser on one hand and any Voice Director on the other hand).

10.Sellers Warranties

10.1 Each of the Sellers warrants to the Purchaser that each of the statements
set out in Schedule 1 (the Sellers Warranties), in so far as it relates to
that individual Seller, is true and accurate on the date of this Agreement,
and shall be true and accurate on the Closing Date by reference to the facts
and circumstances then existing, subject to the provisions of this Agreement
(including the limitations set out in Schedule 2 and in clause 13).

10.2 The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that:

(a) other than the warranties given by the Management Sellers in the
Management Warranty Deed, the Sellers Warranties are the only warranties of
any kind given by or on behalf of the Sellers or any other member of a
Sellers' Group or their Representatives (and on which the Purchaser may rely
in entering into this Agreement);

(b) no other representation, warranty, statement, estimate, forecast, opinion,
projection or promise made by or on behalf of any Seller, any member of any
Sellers' Group, their Representatives or the Target Companies may form the
basis of, or be pleaded in connection with, any claim by any member of the
Purchaser Group under or in connection with any Transaction Document; and

(c) without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the Sellers do not
give any warranty or make any representation as to the accuracy of any
forecasts, estimates, projections, statements of intent or opinion provided to
any member of the Purchaser Group or its Representatives (including in the
Data Rooms).

10.3 The Sellers acknowledge that the Purchaser is entering into this
Agreement on the basis of and in express reliance on the Sellers Warranties.

11.Warranty Insurance Policy

11.1 The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that:

(a) neither any failure on the part of the Purchaser Group to enter into, or
to comply with the terms of, the Warranty Insurance Policy, nor any
unavailability of the Warranty Insurance Policy or of recourse thereunder for
whatever reason, shall create or increase any of the Sellers' liability

Page 28

AMS6540051 168372-0004 Project Beaker - SPA





pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement beyond the express terms of
this Agreement (including the limitations set out in Schedule 2 and in clause
13);

(b) at the date of this Agreement, it shall deliver to the Sellers'
Representative evidence that (i) the Warranty Insurance Policy has been duly
and validly entered into and the coverage under the Warranty Insurance Policy
is effective as at the date of this Agreement, and (ii) the Warranty Insurance
Policy includes an express waiver from the WandI Insurer of any rights of
subrogation that it may have against the Sellers (except in the case of fraud
or fraudulent misrepresentation by a Seller, but in respect of such Seller
only);

(c) it shall not waive or agree to amend and shall procure that there is no
waiver or amendment of the provisions of the Warranty Insurance Policy
(including of the provisions pursuant to which the WandI Insurer waives any
rights of subrogation it may have against (any of) the Sellers), without the
prior written consent of the Sellers (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); and

(d) it shall not novate or otherwise assign its rights under the Warranty
Insurance Policy (or do anything which has a similar effect) except, to the
extent permitted under the Warranty Insurance Policy, to a member of the
Purchaser Group, or do anything which causes any right under the Warranty
Insurance Policy not to have full force or effect.

11.2 If there is any conflict or inconsistency between this clause 11 and any
other provision of any Transaction Document or the Warranty Insurance Policy,
this clause 11 shall prevail.

12.Purchaser warranties

The Purchaser warrants to each and all of the Sellers that each of the
statements set out in Schedule 3 is true and accurate on the date of this
Agreement, and shall be true and accurate on the Closing Date (by reference to
the facts and circumstances then existing).

13.Allocation of the Sellers\' liability

13.1 The Purchaser expressly acknowledges and agrees that the liability of
each Seller under or in connection with any Transaction Document, shall be
several (and not joint or joint and several). The failure by a Seller to
perform any of its obligations shall not affect the obligations of the other
Sellers towards any other Party, nor shall a Seller be liable for the failure
of any other Seller to perform such obligations.

13.2 Each of the Sellers makes the Sellers Warranties (insofar as applicable
to it) individually for itself and with respect to the Securities sold by it
and the LNs held by it, and the other Sellers cannot be held liable for a
breach of such Sellers Warranties.

13.3 The liability of each Seller for each Purchaser Claim (excluding claims
for breach of the Sellers Warranties) shall be limited to such Seller's
Liability

Page 29

AMS6540051 168372-0004 Project Beaker - SPA





Percentage of such Purchaser Claim (excluding claims for breach of the Sellers
Warranties), or where fewer than all the Sellers are liable in respect of such
Purchaser Claim (excluding claims for breach of the Sellers Warranties), such
Sellers shall be severally and proportionately liable hereunder in the
respective proportions that each such Seller's Liability Percentage bears to
the aggregate Liability Percentages of all such Sellers who are liable in
respect of such Purchaser Claim (excluding claims for breach of the Sellers
Warranties).

13.4 In each case, the liability of the Sellers shall be subject to the
limitations set out in Schedule 2, as applicable.

14.Announcements

14.1 Notwithstanding clause 15, neither the Sellers nor the Purchaser (or any
member of the Purchaser Group) shall make any announcement in connection with
the existence or subject matter of the Transaction Documents or the Proposed
Transaction, without the prior written approval of the other Parties on the
making of an announcement, its timing and its content (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

this Agreement in a manner required by applicable Law;

(b) prohibit Voicebox from referring to the existence and/or subject matter of
this Agreement (or any other Transaction Document):

permitted by Law, the other Parties of its intention to do so; or

(ii) in connection with any filing to be made with, or any clearance,
exemption or consent to be obtained from, any stock exchange, securities
regulator (which for the avoidance of doubt shall include the SEC) or any

on written request by the Sellers' Representative (i) return to the Sellers'
Representative all Confidential Information provided to the Purchaser (or its
Representatives or auditors) without keeping any copies thereof, or, at the
option of the Purchaser, destroy such Confidential Information, and (ii) so
far as it is practicable to do so, expunge such Confidential Information from

16.5 All sums payable under or pursuant to this Agreement are (unless
expressly stated otherwise) exclusive of any applicable VAT. Where, under or
pursuant to this Agreement, any party (the Supplier) makes a supply to any
other party (the Recipient) for VAT purposes and the Supplier or an Affiliate
of the Supplier is required to account for VAT in respect of that supply to a
Tax Authority, the Recipient shall, subject to the receipt of a valid VAT
invoice, pay to the Supplier an amount equal to such VAT in addition to any
other consideration for that supply. Such payment shall be made within 10
Business Days of demand or, if later, at the same time as any such
consideration is payable.

16.6 If any party (the Paying Party) is required by this Agreement to
reimburse another party (the Payee Party) for any Loss, the Paying Party shall
also reimburse the Payee Party for any VAT incurred by the Payee Party (or any

successors of each of the Parties to this Agreement.

16.8 If an assignment is made in accordance with this clause 16, the
liabilities of the Parties shall be no greater or less than such liabilities
would have been if the assignment had not occurred.

16.9 Except as provided for in this clause 16, or as the Sellers'
Representative and the Purchaser specifically agree in writing, no person
shall assign, transfer, charge or otherwise deal with all or any of its rights
under this Agreement nor grant, declare, create or dispose of any right or
interest in it. Any purported assignment in contravention of this clause 16.9
shall be void.

16.10 The Purchaser may assign the benefit of this Agreement and/or any other
Transaction Document to which it is a party, in whole or in part, to, and it
may be enforced by, any wholly-owned member of the Purchaser Group, and any
such member of the Purchaser Group to whom an assignment is made under this
clause 16.10 may itself make such an assignment as if it were the Purchaser
under this clause 16.10.

16.11 Any assignment made pursuant to this clause 16 shall be on the basis
that:

(a) the Sellers may discharge their obligations under this Agreement to the
assignor until it receives notice of the assignment;

(b) the liability of the Sellers to any assignee shall not be greater than
their liability to the Purchaser;

(c) the Purchaser will remain liable for any obligations under this Agreement;
and

Group, the Purchaser shall procure that the assignee assigns

Page 34

the benefit of this Agreement and/or the relevant Transaction Documents to the
Purchaser or another wholly-owned member of the Purchaser Group.

Further assurances

16.12 Each of the Parties shall, at its own cost, for a period of 12 months
from the Closing Date, execute and deliver, or procure the execution and

the Transaction Documents, being, in the case of the Sellers, the transfer of
the legal and beneficial ownership of the Securities to the Purchaser.

16.13 Each of the Parties shall procure, so far as is reasonably practicable,
that its Representatives comply with all obligations under the Transaction
Documents that are expressed to apply to any such Representatives.

16.14 Any notice or other communication to be given in connection with this
Agreement shall be in writing in English, and signed by or on behalf of the
party giving it. It shall be delivered by hand, email or registered post. A
notice shall be effective upon receipt, and shall be deemed to have been
received (i) at the time of delivery when left at the address set out in
clause 16.15, if delivered by hand or registered post or (ii) at the time of
transmission if delivered by email, provided that in either case, where
delivery occurs outside Working Hours, notice shall be deemed to have been

16.15 The addresses and email addresses of the Parties for the purpose of
clause 16.14 are set out in Schedule 10. Each Party shall notify the other
Parties in writing of a change to its details in Schedule 10 from time to

specified in such notice or five Business Days after the notice is given,
whichever is later.

Whole agreement

16.16 The Transaction Documents together set out the whole agreement between
the Parties in respect of the Proposed Transaction, and supersede any previous
draft, arrangement or understanding, whether in writing or not, relating to
the Proposed Transaction. It is agreed that:

(a) no Party shall have any claim or remedy in respect of any statement,
representation, warranty or undertaking made by or on behalf of the other
Party (or any of its Connected Persons or Representatives) in relation to the
Proposed Transaction which is not expressly set out in this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document;

(b) any terms or conditions implied by Law in any jurisdiction in relation to
the Proposed Transaction are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by Law
or, if incapable of exclusion, any right, or remedies in relation to them are
irrevocably waived;

Page 35

AMS6540051 168372-0004 Project Beaker - SPA





(c) the only right or remedy of a Party in relation to any statement,
representation, warranty or undertaking set out in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document shall be for breach of this Agreement or the relevant
Transaction Document and/or injunction or other equitable relief to the
exclusion of all other rights and remedies (including those in tort or arising
under statute); and

(d) except for any liability in respect of a breach of this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document, no Party (or any of its Connected Persons or
Representatives) shall owe any duty of care or have any liability in tort or
otherwise to the other parties (or their respective Connected Persons or
Representatives) in relation to the Proposed Transaction,

provided that this clause 16.16 shall not exclude any liability for (or remedy
in respect of) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation. Each Party agrees to the
terms of this clause 16.16 on its own behalf and as agent for each of its
Connected Persons and Representatives.

Waivers, variations and invalidity

16.17 Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, no failure or delay by
any Party in exercising any right or remedy relating to this Agreement shall
affect or operate as a waiver or variation of that right or remedy, or
preclude its exercise at any subsequent time. No single or partial exercise of
any such right or remedy shall preclude any further exercise of it or the
exercise of any other remedy.

16.18 A waiver of any right or remedy relating to this Agreement shall only be
effective if given in writing and shall not be deemed a waiver of any
subsequent breach or default.

16.19 No amendment of this Agreement shall be valid, unless it is in writing
and duly executed on behalf of the Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser.
Unless expressly agreed, no amendment shall constitute a general waiver of any
provision of this Agreement, nor shall it affect any rights or obligations
under or pursuant to this Agreement which have already accrued up to the date
of amendment and the rights and obligations under or pursuant to this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect except and only to the extent
that they are amended.

16.20 Each of the provisions of this Agreement is severable. If any such
provision is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable under the Law of any
jurisdiction, the Parties shall use all reasonable efforts to replace it with
a valid and enforceable substitute provision the effect of which is as close
to its intended effect as possible.

Withholdings and set-off

16.22 All sums payable by the Parties under this Agreement or any of the
Transaction Documents or for breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement
or any of the Transaction Documents shall be paid free and clear of all
deductions or withholdings whatsoever, save only as provided in this Agreement
or as required by applicable Law.

16.23 If any Party is required by Law to make a deduction or withholding in
respect of any sum payable under this Agreement (other than the payment of the
Initial Consideration under clause 3.2, the payment of any Purchase Price
Adjustment, the payment of the Holdback Amount or the repayment of the
Employee Loans), it shall, at the same time as the sum which is the subject of
the deduction or withholding is payable, make a payment to the other Party of
such additional amount as shall be required to ensure that the net amount
received by that other Party will equal the full amount which would have been
received by them had no such deduction or withholding been required to be
made. Any Party that determines that an amount is required to be deducted and
withheld by Law, shall provide the payee with (i) commercially reasonable
notice of such Party's intent to deduct and withhold, which shall include a
copy of the calculation of the amount to be deducted and withheld and (ii) a
reasonable opportunity for the payee to provide forms or other evidence that
would exempt such amounts from withholding (or reduce such withholding).

16.24 If any sum paid by any Party (other than the payment of the Initial
Consideration under clause 3.2, the payment of any Purchase Price Adjustment,
the payment of the Holdback Amount or the repayment of the Employee Loans) is
required by Law to be brought into charge to Tax by the other Party (or would
be but for any Relief) then, except in relation to interest, the paying Party
shall pay such additional amount as shall be required to ensure that the total
amount paid, less the Tax chargeable on such amount (or that would be
chargeable but for such Relief), is equal to the amount that would otherwise
be payable.

16.25 Each Party waives and relinquishes any right of set-off or counterclaim,
deduction or retention which it might otherwise have out of any payments which
it may be obliged to make (or procure to be made) to any other Party pursuant
to this Agreement or otherwise.

Counterparts

16.26 This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and by
each Party on separate counterparts. Each counterpart is an original, but all
counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery
of a counterpart of this Agreement by e-mail attachment shall be an effective
mode of delivery.

16.27 The Parties acknowledge and agree that all columns other than those
headed "Liability Percentage" and "Purchase Price Adjustment Proportion" of
the Allocation Table shall be redacted in full for the purposes of any
disclosure to the Stichting or any of the Management Sellers, save with
respect to the information set out against such Seller's name in the
Allocation Table, and the

Stichting and each of the Management Sellers acknowledge the provisions of
clauses 2.4 and 5.9(b) of this Agreement.

Third party enforcement rights

16.28 Except as provided for in clause 16.29, a person who is not a party to
this Agreement shall have no right under the Contracts (Rights of Third
Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any of its terms.

Target Companies) and any of their respective directors, officers, employees
or agents (including advisers), and the Covered Persons, may enforce the terms
which are stated to be for their benefit subject to and in accordance with the
provisions of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

16.30 Each Party represents to the other that their respective rights to
terminate, rescind or agree any amendment, variation, waiver or settlement
under this Agreement are not subject to the consent of any person that is not
a party to this Agreement other than the Spouse Consents.

Conflict with other agreements

16.31 If there is any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any
other agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Shareholders'
Agreement), this Agreement shall prevail (as between the parties to this
Agreement and as between any of their Affiliates) unless the Parties to this
Agreement:

(a) are also parties to that other agreement and such other agreement
expressly states that it overrides this Agreement in the relevant respect; or

(b) expressly agree in writing that such other agreement shall override this
Agreement in that respect.

16.32 Each of the Sellers acknowledges and agrees, for the benefit of each
other Seller that the entry into the Transaction Documents and the completion
of the Proposed Transaction is approved for all purposes under the
Shareholders' Agreement and the Articles of Association, and no Seller shall
assert any claim against any other Seller or a Target Company pursuant to the
Shareholders' Agreement or Articles of Association in respect of any action
contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

16.33 To the extent permitted by Law, where any provision of this Agreement
conflicts with any of the Articles of Association, each of the relevant
Sellers undertakes to exercise its voting rights in respect of such Target
Company to procure that the relevant Articles of Association are amended so as
to ensure that they are consistent with the terms of this Agreement.

1.1 The Sellers shall not be liable in respect of any Non-Tax Claim, if and to
the extent that the fact, matter, event or circumstance giving rise to it:

have been reduced) but for a change after Closing (i) to the Tax or corporate
structure of any Target Company, (ii) to the date on which any Target Company

of accounting of any Target Company, unless such changes are required to
remedy such Target Company's non-compliance with applicable Laws or generally

(e) would not have arisen (or would have been reduced) but for any act,
omission or transaction carried out (i) before Closing at the written request

2. Claim notice

2.1 Any notice of a Purchaser Claim shall be given by the Purchaser to the
Sellers' Representative as soon as reasonably practicable after, and in any
event within 30 Business Days of the date on which, the Purchaser becomes
actually aware of the fact, matter, event or circumstance reasonably likely to
give rise to such Purchaser Claim (it being understood that no notice may be
given prior to Closing). A failure by the Purchaser to give timely notice as
contemplated by this paragraph shall not prejudice the Purchaser's right to
bring a Purchaser Claim for Loss, other than to the extent that such failure

contingent liability, nine months after such liability becomes an actual
liability. No new Purchaser Claim may be made in respect of the facts,
matters, events or circumstances giving rise to any such withdrawn Purchaser
Claim.

3. Time limitations

Sellers Warranties unless the Sellers' Representative receives from the
Purchaser written notice in accordance with paragraph 2 (Claim Notice) at the
latest seven years after the Closing Date.

3.2 The Sellers shall not be liable for any Non-Tax Claim, other than a

the latest 18 months after the Closing Date.

3.3 Other than in respect of Specific Tax Indemnities, the Sellers shall not
be liable for any Purchaser Claim under the Tax Covenant unless the Sellers'

Closing Date.

exceed, an amount equal to the aggregate of:

(a) the aggregate consideration paid to the relevant Management Seller or the
Stichting (as the case may be) at Closing pursuant to this Agreement
(disregarding, for these purposes, any reduction, or deemed reduction, made or
to be made to such consideration pursuant to clause 3.13); plus

(b) the amount of the LN Redemption Amount repaid to the relevant Management
Seller or the Stichting (as the case may be); less,

payable by such Management Seller or the Stichting (or, in relation to the

Page 43

AMS6540051 168372-0004 Project Beaker - SPA





Stichting, the holders of depository receipts in the Stichting) with respect
to the amounts referred to in paragraph 4.1(a) and 4.1(b) above.

under the Specific Tax Indemnities shall never exceed the amount equal to the

Price Adjustment Proportion. The maximum aggregate liability of each Seller
for all Purchaser Claims under paragraph 2.1(f) of Schedule 7 (Tax Covenant)
(or under paragraph 2.1(h) of Schedule 7 (Tax Covenant) to the extent that the
Actual Tax Liability that would have arisen but for the use or set off of the
relevant Purchaser's Relief would have fallen within the scope of paragraph
2.1(f) of Schedule 7 (Tax Covenant)) shall never exceed, in the aggregate, the
product of: (i) EUR 2,100,000; and (ii) the relevant Seller's Purchase Price
Adjustment Proportion. The Parties acknowledge that a Purchaser Claim under
the Specific Tax Indemnities and satisfied by way of the Tax Escrow Amount
shall serve as the sole recourse for the Purchaser in respect of any claims
against the Sellers in connection with the Specific Tax Indemnities.

4.5 The Parties acknowledge that the WandI Insurance Policy will provide
coverage to the Purchaser in relation to any Purchaser Claims in respect of
the Sellers Warranties, the Tax Covenant (other than a Purchaser Claim under
the Specific Tax Indemnities) and claims under the Management Warranty Deed
only. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees with the Sellers that the
Purchaser's sole and exclusive source of remedy in respect of any Purchaser
Claim in respect of a Sellers Warranty or the Tax Covenant (other than a
Purchaser Claim under the Specific Tax Indemnities) under this Agreement and
in respect of any claim under the Management Warranty Deed will be against the
WandI Insurer under the WandI Insurance Policy, except to the extent that such
Purchaser Claim or claim under the Management Warranty Deed arises from the
fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation of a Seller (and then only to the extent
that such Purchaser Claim or claim under the Management Warranty Deed relates
to such Seller's fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation).

5. Recovery and savings

5.1 Where the Sellers have made a payment to the Purchaser in relation to any
Purchaser Claim, and the Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser Group is
subsequently entitled to recover (whether by insurance, payment, discount,

Page 44

AMS6540051 168372-0004 Project Beaker - SPA





credit, deduction, exemption or set-off (including in respect of any Tax or
relevant to the computation of any income, profits or gains for the purposes
of any Tax), or any right to or actual repayment of or saving of Tax or
otherwise) from a third party (other than the WandI Insurer) a sum which
indemnifies or compensates the Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser Group
(in whole or in part) in respect of Loss which is the subject of a Purchaser
Claim, then the Purchaser or the relevant member of the Purchaser Group shall
(i) promptly notify the Sellers of the fact, and provide such information (to
the extent known to the Purchaser at such time) as the Sellers may reasonably
require, (ii) take all reasonable steps or proceedings as the Sellers may
reasonably require to enforce such right, and (iii) if any amount is actually
recovered from such third party, pay to the Sellers (as soon as reasonably
practicable after receipt) an amount equal to the amount recovered from the
third party (less all reasonable costs and expenses of recovery and less any
Tax suffered on the amount so recovered) up to the amount actually paid by the
Sellers to the Purchaser.

5.2 The Sellers shall not be liable in respect of any Purchaser Claim to the
extent that the amount of such Purchaser Claim is covered by a policy of
insurance held by a Target Company as at Closing.

5.3 The Sellers shall not be liable to satisfy any Purchaser Claim to the
extent of any corresponding saving by, any payment by a third party (subject
to paragraph 5.1) to, or net quantifiable financial benefit to, the Purchaser
or any member of the Purchaser Group arising from the matter giving rise to
such Purchaser Claim (including the amount by which any Tax for which the
Purchaser, any member of the Purchaser Group or any Target Company would
otherwise have been accountable or liable to be assessed is or could
reasonably be expected to be reduced or extinguished (in the year in which the
corresponding Loss has actually taken place or in the subsequent 12 months) as
a result of the matters giving rise to the Purchaser Claim).

6. Duty to mitigate, right to remedy, contingent liabilities

6.1 If a breach of the Sellers Warranties or of this Agreement by the Sellers,
or a Purchaser Claim under the Tax Covenant, is capable of remedy, the
Purchaser shall only be entitled to compensation if it gives the Sellers'
Representative written notice of the breach and the breach is not remedied, to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Purchaser, within 30 days after the date on
which the notice referred to in paragraph 2.1 is served on the Sellers'
Representative. The Purchaser shall, or shall procure that any relevant member
of the Purchaser Group shall, provide all reasonable assistance to the Sellers
to remedy any such breach.

6.2 Other than in relation to the Tax Covenant, the Purchaser shall, and shall
procure that the relevant member of the Purchaser Group shall, take all
reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss which it may suffer in consequence of
any breach by the Sellers of this Agreement, or, upon or after becoming aware
of any fact, matter, event or circumstance reasonably likely to give rise to a
Purchaser Claim.

6.3 If any Non-Tax Claim is based upon a liability which is, at the time of
notice to the Sellers' Representative, contingent only, the Sellers shall not
be liable unless and until such contingent liability becomes an actual
liability, provided that this

Page 45

AMS6540051 168372-0004 Project Beaker - SPA





paragraph 6.3 does not preclude the Purchaser giving notice of a Purchaser
Claim pursuant to this Schedule 2.

7. No double recovery

The Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover damages or obtain payment,
reimbursement, restitutions or indemnities more than once in respect of the
same Loss under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

8. Non-application of limitations

The liability exclusions and limitations set out in paragraphs 3 (Time
limitations) and 4 (Financial limits) of this Schedule 2 shall not apply in
respect of a Seller in case of fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation by such
Seller.

against the Relevant Target Companies or their directors, officers or
employees in respect of any cause, matter or thing (including, but not limited
to, breach of contract, compensation for loss of office or retirement or
unfair or wrongful dismissal) in respect of my resignation or my service as
[director/manager/member of the executive committee] [and as chairman of the
board of directors/managing director]. No arrangement is outstanding under
which a Relevant Target Company or any of its officers or employees have or
may have any obligation to me. To the extent that any such claim or obligation
exists or may exist, I hereby irrevocably waive such claim and hereby release
the Relevant Target Companies and their officers and employees from any
liability whatsoever in respect thereof, subject always to any existing right
of indemnity under the articles of association or equivalent constitutional
documents of each Relevant Target Company or any other arrangement, including
any terms of engagement and the provision of any applicable DandO insurance, for

Upon my resignation taking effect, please arrange for notification of my
resignation to be forwarded to Companies House and to the relevant registers

is required to be reported and/or published.

Rosenfeld and Mr Stefaan Konings, only apply in relation to their resignation

the Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative pursuant to paragraph 1.3) or
where the Sellers' Representative fails to serve a valid Disagreement Notice

determine the final Closing Statement and the Sellers' Representative and its
accountants shall have the right to take copies of any documents that they
reasonably require and shall have access to the relevant personnel of the
Target Group as they reasonably require in order to enable them to determine

accountants shall each promptly (and in any event within 10 Business Days of a
relevant appointment) submit a written statement on the matters in dispute
(together with relevant supporting documents) to the Reporting Accountants for
determination and deliver a copy of such written statement and supporting
documents to the other party;

(b) following delivery of their respective submissions, the Purchaser and the
Sellers' Representative shall have the opportunity to comment once only
(provided that nothing in this paragraph 2.3(b) shall prevent the Parties from
responding to any requests from the Reporting Accountants) on the other
party's submissions by written comment delivered to the Reporting Accountants
not later than 10 Business Days after the written statement was first
submitted to the Reporting Accountants and copied to the other Party pursuant
to paragraph 2.3(a);

(c) the Reporting Accountants shall base their decision solely upon the
presentations submitted by the Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative and
upon any materials made available by either Party and not upon independent
review;

(d) the Reporting Accountants shall resolve each item that remains in dispute
based solely on the definitions and other applicable provisions of this
Agreement by choosing a value equal to or between the value proposed by the
Purchaser in its presentation (which shall not be more favourable to the
Purchaser than the value proposed by the Purchaser in the Draft Closing
Statement) or by the Sellers' Representative in its presentation (which shall
not be more favourable to the Sellers' Representative than the value proposed
by the Sellers' Representative in the Disagreement Notice);

(e) the Reporting Accountants shall make their determination pursuant to
paragraph 2.3(f) within 20 Business Days of the expiry of the 10 Business Day
period referred to in paragraph 2.3(b) or as soon thereafter as is reasonably

and the Reporting Accountants shall send a signed copy of the determination
report to the Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser at their respective
addresses set forth in clause 16.15;

(f) the Reporting Accountants shall act as experts (and not as arbitrators) in
making their determination and their determination of any matter falling

their determination shall be void and the matter shall be resubmitted to the
Reporting Accountants by either the Purchaser or the Sellers' Representative
for correction as soon as reasonably practicable);

their own jurisdiction; and

shall be borne as follows: any associated engagement fees shall be initially

that such fees shall ultimately be borne by the Purchaser and the Sellers in
the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the items unsuccessfully
disputed by such Party (as determined by the Reporting Accountants) bears to
the total disputed amount of items submitted to the Reporting Accountants.

2.4 Any determination of the Reporting Accountants, as applicable, under
paragraph 2.3(f) shall be deemed to be incorporated into the Draft Closing
Statement as adjusted, as the case may be, to reflect any changes agreed
between the Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser pursuant to paragraph
1.2 which, as adjusted by the alterations so determined by the Reporting
Accountants, as applicable and if any, shall become the Closing Statement and
be final and binding on the Sellers and the Purchaser.

Accountants access to any information or document which is protected by legal
professional privilege, or which has been prepared by the other Party or its
accountants and other professional advisers with a view to assessing the
merits of any claim or argument, provided that a Party shall not be entitled
by reason of this paragraph 2.5 to refuse to supply such part or parts of
documents as contain only the facts on which the relevant claim or argument is
based. Where a Party or the Reporting Accountants seeks access under this
paragraph 2 to information or documents which are subject to a confidentiality
obligation entered into with a third party, the disclosing party may make
access to such information or documents conditional upon the entry by the
proposed recipient into a confidentiality undertaking in respect of such
information or documents on terms reasonably acceptable to the disclosing
party.

2.6 Each Party shall, and shall procure that its accountants and other
advisers shall, and shall instruct the Reporting Accountants, as applicable,
to, keep all information and documents provided to them pursuant to this
paragraph 2 confidential and shall not use them for any purpose, except for
disclosure or use in connection with the preparation of the Closing Statement,
the proceedings of the Reporting Accountants or any other matter arising out
of this Agreement or

Schedule 6

Closing Statement

Part A Specific Accounting Principles

The following Specific Accounting Principles shall apply in the preparation of
the Closing Statement:

1.Net Working Capital shall be prepared based on the general ledger of the
Target Group on a consolidated basis as at the Effective Time, subject to the
Accounting Principles.

2.Consideration shall only be given to information, facts, circumstances, and
events as of the Effective Time, provided, that, notwithstanding any
requirements of IFRS, all effects arising from the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
and occurring within the period from the Effective Time until the Closing
Statement is prepared, including the effects of any purchase accounting, as
well as any act, decision, change in circumstance, development or event
arising or occurring after the Effective Time, including but not limited to,
transactions outside the ordinary course of business that are taken by the
Purchaser or at the direction of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, will
be disregarded for the purpose of making any determination as of the Effective
Time. From and after Closing and prior to the determination of Net Working
Capital, the Purchaser shall not take, or permit the Target Companies to take,
any action with respect to the accounting books and records on which the Net
Working Capital is to be based, that is inconsistent with the definitions of
Cash and Net Working Capital and this Schedule.

3.Net Working Capital shall be determined on the basis that each of the Target
Companies is a going concern and, except as required elsewhere in this
Agreement or paragraph 2 above, shall exclude the effect of change of control
or ownership of the Target Companies and will not take into account the
effects of any post-Closing reorganisations or the post-Closing intentions or
obligations of the Purchaser.

4.The Closing Statement will be prepared in Euros. For purposes of determining
Cash, Debt and Net Working Capital, any amounts stated in a currency other
than Euros shall be converted into Euros at the Conversion Rate on the
Business Day prior to the date on which the Effective Time falls.

5.Net Working Capital shall be limited to the general ledger line items
identified in Part B of this Schedule 6. No provision or asset shall be
included in Estimated Net Working Capital or Net Working Capital in respect of
any matter other than those provided for in the audited consolidated balance
sheet as set out in the Accounts (the Accounts Balance Sheet). Additionally,
there shall be no additional provision or accrual or increase in any existing
provision or accrual (and similarly no reduced provision or accrual or
decrease in any existing provision or accrual) included in the Accounts
Balance Sheet except to the extent new facts or events have arisen on or
before the Effective Time that, applying the same management judgment,
policies, procedures, methods,

Page 59

AMS6540051 168372-0004 Project Beaker - SPA





assumptions and estimation methodologies would justify such a provision,
accrual, increase or decrease.

6.No liabilities shall be reflected in Net Working Capital pertaining to
losses or liabilities that are recoverable from other parties, whether or not
such losses or liabilities have been recovered as of the Effective Time. No
assets should be reflected in Net Working Capital pertaining to settlements,
refunds or assets that, in each case, are payable to other parties as of the
Effective Time.

7.For the avoidance of doubt, Net Working Capital will exclude the following
items, regardless of whether such items represent current assets or current
liabilities under IFRS:

(a) Cash;

(b) Debt; and

(c) any intercompany indebtedness and other balances between or among the
Target Companies.

8.For the purposes of determining Net Working Capital, the trade receivable
reserves shall be calculated in a manner consistent with the financial
reporting processes and accounting principles, practices, procedures,
policies, and methods, classifications, judgments, assumptions, techniques,
elections, inclusions, exclusions and valuation and estimation methodologies
used in the illustrative calculation of Net Working Capital set out in Part B
of this Schedule 6.

9.No items may be included more than once in the Closing Statement.

10.Items included within the definition of Debt which are quantified with a
fixed EUR amount shall not be amended in the preparation of the Closing
Statement.

11.The current and non-current IFRS 16 lease liabilities will not be included
in Debt nor in Net Working Capital.

12.The Closing Statement will exclude, for the purposes of Debt and Net
Working Capital, all accruals or liabilities in relation to, and Cash will be
calculated without giving effect to any cash paid out prior to Closing in
respect of, third party fees, expenses and other costs associated with
preparation and review of the consolidated financial statements of Voice Topco
prepared as at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2019 and the September
Financial Statements under IFRS under AICPA auditing standards in accordance
with clause 5.4.

13.Debt will exclude in all cases any obligation in respect of:

(a) guarantees and letters of credit, in each case to the extent undrawn;

(b) depositary bank guarantees;

(c) non-cancellable purchase commitments incurred in the ordinary course of
business;

(d) trade payables and current liabilities;

(e) any amounts that are reflected in Net Working Capital;

(f) intercompany indebtedness and other balances between or among the Target
Companies;

Page 60

AMS6540051 168372-0004 Project Beaker - SPA





(g) any debt financing of the Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser Group;

(h) any accrued and unpaid bonuses to be paid to any employee, director,
manager or consultant of any Target Company for fiscal year 2020 (including
any Taxes payable thereon (to the extent such amount is not recovered or
recoverable from such employee, director, manager or consultant);

(i) any unfunded or underfunded defined benefit pension liabilities except for
the fixed amount of EUR 194,000 set out in item (l) in the definition of Debt;

Authority;

agent may comment within 10 Business Days of its receipt of any such ST

matter that could give rise to a liability under the Specific Tax Indemnities;

Representative or its duly authorised agents reasonable information and
assistance which may reasonably be required to review the draft ST
Communications provided under paragraph 7.3(a) above.

Demand or matter (including reasonably sufficient details of the Demand or
matter, the due date for any payment and the time limits for any appeal) as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Purchaser or the relevant Target
Company becomes aware of the Demand and in any event not more than 10 Business
Days after the Purchaser or the relevant Target Company becomes aware of the
Demand or matter (but for the avoidance of doubt, the giving of such notice
shall not be a condition precedent to the liability of the relevant Seller

right to a claim under this Schedule 7);

reasonable costs properly incurred in connection with any action referred to
in paragraph 7.4(b).

7.6 Subject to paragraph 7.7, the Purchaser must procure that no matter
relating to the Demand referred to in paragraph 7.4 is settled or otherwise
compromised without the Sellers' Representative's prior written consent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

as mentioned in paragraph 7.4(b) within 10 Business Days of receipt of notice
by the Sellers' Representative under paragraph 7.4(a);

respond to any request by the Purchaser for consent to take any action under
this paragraph 7 within 10 Business Days,

the Purchaser shall be free to satisfy or settle the relevant liability on
such terms as it may in its absolute discretion think fit.

7.8 For the avoidance of doubt where any matter relating to Tax gives rise (or
could give rise) to a Demand to which the provisions of this paragraph 7
apply, the provisions of this paragraph 7 shall in the event of a conflict
