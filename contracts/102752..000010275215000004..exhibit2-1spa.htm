2.2.4.2 _Review of Closing Statements_. Sellers\' Representative, upon
receipt of the Closing Statements, shall (a) review the Closing Statements and
(b) to the extent Sellers\' Representative may deem necessary, make reasonable
inquiry of Buyer and its accountants (if any are used) in respect of the
preparation of the Closing Statements. In connection with such inquiry,
Sellers\' Representative and its advisers shall have access as promptly as
reasonably practicable upon prior notice and during normal business hours to
each Company\'s books, papers and records and accountants (if any are used)
relating to the preparation of the Closing Statements, including worksheets
and other computations. The Closing Statements shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon, and deemed accepted by, Sellers unless Sellers\'
Representative shall have, within 45 days after its receipt of the Closing
Statements, notified Buyer in writing of any objections thereto, identifying
in reasonable detail the specific items involved and the dollar amount of each
disagreement (the "Seller Objection"). After the end of the above-referenced
45-day period, neither Buyer, Sellers\' Representative nor any other Party may
introduce additional disagreements with respect to any item in the Closing
Statements or increase the amount of any disagreement, and any item not so
identified shall be deemed to be agreed to by Buyer and Sellers\'
Representative and will be final, binding and conclusive upon all of the
Parties.

  

2.2.4.3 _Disputes_. If a Seller Objection is provided to Buyer pursuant to
Section 2.2.4.2, within 20 days thereafter Buyer shall review and respond to
such Seller Objection, and Buyer and Sellers\' Representative shall attempt to
resolve the differences set forth in the Seller Objection within 20 days
following Buyer\'s receipt of the Seller Objection. Any disputes between
Buyer and Sellers\' Representative regarding the Seller Objection that are not
resolved by them within such 20-day period shall be referred no later than the
third Business Day after such 20th day for decision to an independent
accounting firm or valuation firm of national reputation mutually acceptable
to Buyer and Sellers\' Representative (the "Arbiter") who shall act as
arbitrator and determine whether and to what extent, if any, the Closing
Statements require adjustment, based solely on presentations by Sellers\'
Representative and Buyer, together with their respective advisers, and only
with respect to the remaining differences so submitted. If Buyer and
Sellers\' Representative cannot agree upon the selection of the Arbiter within
five Business Days, BDO USA LLP shall serve as the Arbiter hereunder. The
Arbiter shall deliver to Buyer and Sellers\' Representative the Arbiter\'s
written determination as to whether and to what extent, if any, either of the
CNWC Statements, the GEA Statement, the Timken Statement, the APS Facility
Renovation Expense Statement or the Closing Cash Statement requires
adjustments in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth herein
no later than the 30th day after the remaining differences underlying the
Seller Objection are referred to the Arbiter, or such longer period of time as
the Arbiter determines is necessary. The Arbiter\'s determination pursuant to
this Section 2.2.4.3 shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the Parties
absent manifest error in the factual basis or application of the relevant or
controlling accounting principles. Buyer on one hand and Sellers on the other
hand shall each pay 50% of the fees and expenses of the Arbiter. Buyer and
Sellers\' Representative shall cooperate with the Arbiter during the term of
its engagement pursuant to this Section 2.2.4.3 and, to the extent in their
possession or custody, make reasonably available to the Arbiter all relevant
information, books and records and any work papers relating to the Closing
Statements and all other items reasonably requested by the Arbiter. In no
event may the Arbiter\'s resolution of any difference be for an amount that is
outside the range of Buyer\'s and Sellers\' Representative\'s disagreement.

  

    

2.2.4.4 _Final Closing Statements_. Each of the Closing Statements shall
become final, conclusive and binding upon the Parties upon the earliest of (a)
Sellers\' Representative\'s failure to provide a Seller Objection within the
period permitted under Section 2.2.4.2, (b) the agreement between Buyer and
Sellers\' Representative with respect thereto and (c) the decision by the
Arbiter with respect to any disputes under Section 2.2.4.3. The Closing
Statements (a) as submitted to Sellers\' Representative with its failure to
object thereto within the period permitted under Section 2.2.4.2, (b) as
adjusted pursuant to the agreement of Buyer and Sellers\' Representative or
(c) the decision of the Arbiter, shall constitute the final, conclusive and
binding Closing Statements referred to herein as the "Final Closing
Statements."

Reimbursement_.

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the US Purchase Price
shall be adjusted as follows:

(ii) if the US CNWC is greater than the Estimated US CNWC, the US Purchase
Price shall be increased by the amount by which the US CNWC is greater than

Price as a result of the foregoing calculation and any increase in the US
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.2.3.2 result in an aggregate increase to
the US Purchase price of more than $5,000,000.

  

(b) Sellers\' Representative, on behalf of Sellers based on their Percentage
Ownership, shall, pursuant to Section 2.2.5.1(b), reimburse Buyer in the

(c) The US Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount of Cash reflected
in the Closing Date Cash Statement, as described in Section 2.2.5.1(c).

  

2.2.4.6 _PTH Purchase Price Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the PTH Purchase Price shall be decreased as follows:

decreased pursuant to Section 2.2.5.2 by the amount by which the PTH CNWC
(which may be a negative number) is less than $3,390,000;

  

(b) if the amount of the GEA Asset Valuation is less than $1,600,000, the PTH

(c) if the amount of the Timken Asset Valuation is less than $3,043,000, the
PTH Purchase Price shall be decreased pursuant to Section 2.2.5.2 by the
amount by which the amount of the Timken Valuation is less than $3,043,000;

  

(d) if the amount of the PT Special Receivables Distribution is less than

(e) in no event shall the PTH Purchase Price be increased as a result of (A)
the PTH CNWC exceeding $3,390,000; (B) the GEA Valuation exceeding $1,600,000;
(C) the Timken Valuation exceeding $3,043,000; or (D) the PT Special
Receivables Distribution exceeding $374,901.

Companies has executed or filed any agreement extending the period of
assessment or collection of any Taxes other than as a result of extension of
time to file the relevant Tax return obtained in the Ordinary Course of

Person has been authorized by Sellers or the Companies to make any
representation or warranty relating to the Companies, the businesses of the
Companies or otherwise in connection with the Transactions except as set forth
in the Seller Reps and, if made, such representations or warranties must not
be relied upon as having been authorized by the Companies and Sellers. In
connection with the investigation of the Companies by Buyer, Buyer Cdn or
Buyer\'s Parent, such entities have received from or on behalf of Sellers and
the Companies certain projections, including projected statements of income,
operating revenues and costs of the Companies. Buyer, Buyer Cdn and Buyer\'s
Parent each acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting
to make such projections, estimates and other forecasts, that they are
familiar with such uncertainties, that they are taking full responsibility for
making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all projections,
estimates and other forecasts so furnished to them (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such projections, estimates and
other forecasts), and that they shall have no claim hereunder against Sellers
or the Companies with respect thereto. Accordingly, Sellers and the Companies
make no representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to such
projections, estimates and other forecasts (including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying such projections, estimates and other forecasts).

  

    

(d) The following additional conditions shall apply to Section 3.15 Claims or
any claims for indemnification that could be brought as Section 3.15 Claims:
(i) Buyer, Buyer Cdn, Buyer\'s Parent and the Companies shall promptly deliver
to Sellers\' Representative copies of all final reports, studies,
investigations, surveys, test data, assessments and cost estimates supporting
such actual or potential Section 3.15 Claim; (ii) upon reasonable advance
notice of at least 10 Business Days, Buyer, Buyer Cdn, Buyer\'s Parent and the
Companies shall permit Sellers\' Representative (including its advisers and
consultants) to enter any property for which a potential or actual Section
3.15 Claim has been asserted, for the purpose of conducting such inspections
as Sellers\' Representative may reasonably desire with respect to such
potential or actual Section 3.15 Claim (such inspections shall be conducted in
a manner that minimizes interference with the ongoing operations at the
subject property); (iii) unless required to do so by Applicable Laws in
connection with enforcing its rights hereunder, Buyer, Buyer Cdn, Buyer\'s
Parent and the Companies shall not give notice to any Governmental Entity of
any event or of the existence of any condition or alleged state of facts that
may give rise to an actual Section 3.15 claim without prior notice to
Sellers\' Representative; (iv) if Buyer, Buyer Cdn, Buyer\'s Parent or the
Companies, or any of their respective representatives intends to engage in any
material communications with any Governmental Entity relating to any such
actual or potential claim, Buyer, Buyer Cdn, Buyer\'s Parent or the Companies
shall provide, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, reasonable prior
notice to Sellers\' Representative; and (vi) in responding to any Section 3.15
Claim, Buyer, Buyer Cdn, Buyer\'s Parent and the Companies will use
commercially reasonable efforts to make available their employees and
equipment at the affected property without cost to assist in the remediation
work, and all such work shall be done in a manner to comply with applicable
standards but not for the purpose of bettering or improving the property at
which such remediation work is being done.

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Party will be entitled
to indemnification or reimbursement hereunder for any amount to the extent
such Party has been indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any other
provision of this Agreement or any other document executed in connection with
this Agreement or otherwise. Furthermore, no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnification under this Section 6.3 for any Losses for which
Buyer or Buyer\'s

  

    

Parent was previously compensated as a result of such Losses having been
included as a Company Liability or otherwise applicable a deduction (for
example, as a contra-asset item) in determining US CNWC, PTH CNWC or PTGH CNWC
pursuant to Section 2.2.3 or 2.2.4. If any Losses related to a claim by Buyer
or Buyer Cdn are covered by insurance, Buyer and Buyer Cdn shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery under such insurance
(excluding litigation and arbitration) and Buyer and Buyer Cdn will not be
entitled to recover from Sellers (and shall refund amounts received up to the
amount of indemnification actually received) under this Section 6.3 with
respect to such Losses to the extent Buyer and Buyer Cdn actually recovers the
insurance payment in respect thereof specified in the policy, in each case
giving effect to deductibles or self-insured or co-insurance payments made and
net of the present value of any reasonably probable increase in insurance
premiums or other reasonable charges paid or to be paid by, subject to the
related circumstances, Buyer and Buyer Cdn resulting from such Losses and all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Buyer and Buyer Cdn in recovering
such proceeds from its insurers.

  

(f) Each Party agrees to use reasonable commercial efforts to mitigate any
Loss that forms the basis of a claim hereunder; provided, however, that such
Parties\' "commercially reasonable efforts" shall expressly include pursuing
any recovery or other settlement against any applicable customer of the
Operating Companies of the type and kind against whom the Operating Companies
have pursued recovery and settlement in the past and in a manner consistent
with the past practices of the Operating Companies in pursuing such particular
recovery or settlement; provided, that the Operating Companies shall not be
required to take any action that would be reasonably expected to have a
material and adverse impact on the respective Operating Companies\'
relationships with one or more of their material customers. Except as
otherwise provided in this Section 6.3.5(f), the obligations under this
Section 6.3.5(f) exclude pursuing any claim, settlement or payment by
litigation or other proceedings.

  

6.3.6 _Indemnification Claims Periods and Escrow Release_

  

(a) Except for Section 3.15 Claims, Fundamental Representation Claims, Section
6.7.1 Claims, Indemnification Claims based on any breach of any covenant,
agreement or obligation herein that is required to be performed simultaneously
with or after the Closing, and Indemnification Claims based on any Seller\'s
intentional misconduct or fraud, any Indemnification Claim in respect of a
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach of, (i) any Seller Rep, (ii) any
representation or warranty in Article 4 or (iii) any covenant, agreement or
obligation herein that is required to be performed prior to the Closing, must
be made by a Notice of Claim before the 184th day after the first anniversary
of the Closing Date. Any Section 3.15 Claim must be made by a Notice of Claim
before the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date. Any Fundamental
Representation Claim, Section 6.7.1 Claim, Indemnification Claims based on any
breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation herein that is required to be
performed simultaneously with or after the Closing, and Indemnification Claim
based on any Seller\'s intentional misconduct or fraud must be made by a
Notice of Claim before the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
for the respective claims plus 60 days or, in the case of any such Claim
involving Canadian federal, provincial or other Canadian Governmental Taxes,
60 days after the date after which the applicable Canadian Governmental Entity
may no longer for any reason issue a notice of assessment or reassessment;
provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing, any Fundamental Representation
Claim (i) in respect of a breach of the representations and warranties in
Section 3.25 must be made by a Notice of Claim before the third anniversary of
the Closing Date and (ii) in respect of a breach of the representations and
warranties in Section 3.33 must be made by a Notice of Claim before the 184th
day after the first anniversary of the Closing Date.

  

    

(b) Any Buyer Indemnified Party entitled to payment for an Indemnification
Claim or Section 6.7.1 Claim shall be entitled to such payment from the Escrow
Amount in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, provided, that as of 5:00 p.m.
on the 183rd day after the first Closing Date Anniversary, the amount by
which, if any, the remaining balance of the Escrow Amount, exceeds the
aggregate amount of all pending Indemnification Claims and Section 6.7.1
Claims of one or more Buyer Indemnified Parties, shall be disbursed and
released to Sellers\' Representative, on behalf of Sellers based on their
Percentage Ownership, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

  

6.3.7 _Subrogation_. Upon making an indemnity payment pursuant to this
Section 6.3, the Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such payment, be
subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party against any third Person in
respect of the Losses to which the payment is related. Without limiting the
generality of any other provision hereof, each such Indemnified Party and
Indemnifying Party will promptly execute upon request all instruments
reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the above described subrogation
rights.

  

6.3.8 _Exclusive Remedies_. The remedies provided in this Section 6.3 shall
be, except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.3.8 or in Sections 6.7,
6.12 and 9.1, the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties and their
respective officers, managers, directors, employees, agents, representatives,
successors and assigns after the Closing related to Losses arising out of or
related to this Agreement (excluding the Exhibits), and each Party irrevocably
hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws, the right
to assert any and all such rights, claims and causes of action; provided,
however, that nothing herein is intended to waive any claims for intentional
misconduct or fraud or waive any equitable remedies to which a Party may be
entitled.

  

6.3.9 _Right of Setoff_. Buyer, Buyer Cdn or Buyer\'s Parent may offset any
amounts to which any Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled under this Section
6.3 for a Fundamental Representation Claim against any amounts otherwise
payable hereunder by Buyer, Buyer Cdn or Buyer\'s Parent to any one or more
Sellers or Sellers\' Representative on behalf of Sellers, including Post-
Closing Payments and any and all other payments pursuant to Sections 2.2; 2.3
or 2.4 provided, that the ability of Buyer\'s, Buyer Cdn\'s and Buyer\'s
Parent to exercise such right of offset (a) shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of Section 6.3 in respect of Fundamental Representation Claims and
(b) may only be pursued to the extent the then Escrow Amount is otherwise
insufficient to satisfy the aggregate amount of all pending Indemnification
Claims and Section 6.7.1 Claims (the amount of the shortfall in the Escrow
Amount hereinafter the "Setoff Amount"). If Buyer, Buyer Cdn or Buyer\'s
Parent wishes to exercise the rights provided in this Section 6.3.9, (a)
Buyer, Buyer Cdn or Buyer\'s Parent shall deliver to the Sellers
Representative a notice (a "Setoff Notice") specifying in reasonable detail
the nature and dollar amount of the Fundamental Representation Claim and the
Setoff Amount and (b) to the extent of the claims set forth in the Setoff
Notice are finally resolved in any Seller\'s favor (whether by mutual
agreement of Buyer and Sellers\' Representative or by final non-appealable
order of a court of competent jurisdiction), Buyer, Buyer Cdn or Buyer\'s
Parent, as the case may be, shall within five Business Days thereafter pay the
portion of the Setoff Amount resolved in Sellers favor to the Sellers,
together with interest thereon in accordance with this Agreement.

  

    

6.3.10 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments Between the Parties_. Unless
otherwise required by Applicable Laws, all indemnification payments hereunder
shall constitute adjustments (a) to the US Purchase Price in respect of
breaches of obligations or Seller Reps regarding any of the Companies other
than PT, PTH, PTG and PTGH, (b) to the PTH Purchase Price in respect of
breaches of the obligations or Seller Reps regarding PT or PTH, and (c) to the
PTGH Purchase Price in respect of breaches of obligations or Seller Reps
regarding PTG or PTGH, in any event for all Tax purposes, and no Party shall
take any position inconsistent with such characterization.

  

6.3.11 _Application of Indemnification Obligations_. Section 6.3, including
all indemnification rights, benefits, obligations, limitations and covenants
set forth in Section 6.3, shall apply not only to Third Party Claims, but also
to "inter-party" claims.

  

6.4 _Access and Information_. Each Company shall afford to Buyer, Buyer Cdn
and Buyer\'s Parent and their respective officers, employees, accountants,
counsel and other authorized representatives and advisers access, during
regular business hours, throughout the Pre-Closing Period, to the Company\'s
offices, properties, books and records, and shall use reasonable efforts to
cause the Company\'s representatives and independent public accountants to
furnish to Buyer, Buyer Cdn and Buyer\'s Parent such additional financial and
operating data and other information as to the Company\'s businesses,
customers, vendors and properties as Buyer, Buyer Cdn or Buyer\'s Parent may
from time to time reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all
visits to any Company office or other Company facility will be coordinated and
conducted so as to not be disruptive to the Company\'s operations and to
preserve the confidentiality of the Transactions. In addition, with prior
consent of Sellers\' Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), Buyer and Buyer Cdn shall be permitted to meet with
the significant customers of the Operating Companies.

  

6.5 _Public Disclosure and Confidentiality_. Except as otherwise required by
Applicable Laws, none of the Companies nor any Seller shall announce or
disclose to any other Person the existence or any of the terms or conditions
of this Agreement or the Transactions without the prior consent of Buyer\'s
Parent; provided further that the foregoing shall not apply to any information
that is publicly available other than as a result of disclosure by any Company
or Seller in breach hereof. Except as disclosure may be required by
Applicable Laws or the applicable rules, regulations or policies of any
national securities exchange, any press release or other public disclosure of
information regarding the Transactions (including the negotiations with
respect to the Transactions and the terms, conditions and existence of this
Agreement) shall be developed and approved by Buyer\'s Parent, provided that
the initial press release and Current Reports on Form 8-K under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act"), including amendments of such
Current Reports, of Buyer\'s Parent regarding the Transactions shall be
subject to review and comment by Sellers\' Representative and Buyer shall
reasonably consider such comments.

  

    

6.6 _Further Assurances_

  

6.6.1 _Generally_. Subject to terms and conditions hereof and to the
fiduciary duties of the board of directors, managers and officers, or
representatives of any Party, each of the Parties agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
Applicable Laws to consummate and make effective this Agreement and the
Transactions. In case at any time after the Closing Date the Parties
determine that any further action, including the obtaining of any required
Governmental Entity approvals, and waivers and consents under any Contracts
and the execution and delivery of any licenses or sublicenses for any
software, is necessary, proper or advisable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, the proper managers, officers and directors or representatives of
each Party are hereby directed and authorized to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to effectuate all required action.

  

6.6.2 _Consents_. Each Party agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the Consents before the Closing, and further agrees to
provide all documentation necessary to obtain each Consent, including all
instruments, certifications, requests, legal opinions, audited financial
statements, and other documents required or appropriated to obtain Consents.
In particular and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Companies shall continue to communicate with responsible officers of the
United States Government from time to time prior to the Closing as may be
appropriate and permissible, to request timely action on any and all requests
for the Consents. Buyer, Buyer Cdn and Buyer\'s Parent acknowledge that
certain consents to the Transactions are required from parties to Contracts,
leases, licenses or other agreements to which one or more Companies are a
party (including the Company Contracts) and that such Consents have not been
obtained and may not be obtained. Buyer, Buyer Cdn and Buyer\'s Parent each
agrees that Sellers shall not have any Liability hereunder to (and no Buyer
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assert any claims hereunder) arising
out of or relating to the failure to obtain any Consents listed on Schedule
7.2.4, except to the extent, if any, such failure constitutes a breach of any
Seller Rep that is subject to one or more Indemnification Claims. At the
request of Buyer, Buyer Cdn and Buyer\'s Parent prior to the Closing, the
Companies shall cooperate with Buyer, Buyer Cdn and Buyer\'s Parent in any
reasonable manner in connection with obtaining any such Consents; provided,
that such cooperation shall not include any requirement to commence any
litigation or offer or grant any material accommodation (financial or
otherwise) to any third Person.

  

    

6.7 _Tax Matters_.

  

6.7.1 _Tax Indemnification_. For the avoidance of doubt, except as otherwise
provided in Section 6.7.4, each Seller shall severally, but not jointly,
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties and hold them harmless from and
against any Losses attributable (a) to any Taxes (or the non-payment thereof)
of any of the Companies) for all taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any
taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (the "Pre-
Closing Tax Period"); (b) any and all Taxes of any member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which any of the Companies (or any
predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the
Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulations §1.1502-6 or any
analogous or similar state, local or foreign law or regulation; and (c) any
and all Taxes of any Person (other than the Companies) imposed on any of the
Companies as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law,
rule or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring
before the Closing, provided that, Sellers shall have no obligation to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties against any Losses consisting of, or
relating to, income Taxes resulting from (i) a Code Section 338 election with
respect to the purchase by Buyer or Buyer Cdn, as the case may be, of the
Shares hereunder; (ii) any transactions occurring on the Closing Date after
the Closing outside the Ordinary Course of Business (other than as explicitly
contemplated by this Agreement); or (iii) any breach by Buyer or Buyer Cdn of
Section 6.7.8; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (a), (b) and (c)
above, Sellers shall be liable only to the extent that such Taxes are in
excess of the amount, if any, reserved for such Taxes (excluding any reserve
for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and
Tax income) on the face of the Closing Balance Sheets (rather than in any
notes thereto), set forth in the Final Closing Statements and taken into
account in determining adjustments, if any, to the US Purchase Price, PTH
Purchase Price, or PTGH Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to
Section 2.2.4. Sellers shall reimburse Buyer or Buyer Cdn, as applicable, for
any Taxes of the Companies that are the responsibility of Sellers pursuant to
this Section 6.7.1 within 15 Business Days after payment of such Taxes by
Buyer, Buyer Cdn or the Companies.

  

6.7.2 _Straddle Period_. If any taxable period includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of any Taxes imposed upon
any Company upon or measured by income or receipts of a Company allocable to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period and any non-periodic Tax items shall be determined
using the interim closing of the books method whereby the books of the
applicable Company will be deemed to be closed as of the close of business on
the Closing Date. The amount of all other Taxes imposed upon a Company and
any depreciation and amortization allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be equal to the amount of such Taxes or depreciation or amortization for
the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days during the Straddle Period up to and including the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Straddle
Period. In the case of sales, use, value-added, withholding and similar
transaction-based Taxes (other than transfer Taxes allocated under Section
6.7.7), such Taxes shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period in
which the relevant transaction occurred.

  

    

6.7.3 _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_.

  

(a) Sellers\' Representative shall, for each Company and at Sellers\' expense,
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all required Tax
returns of such Company for Tax periods that end on or before the Closing Date
and that are filed after the Closing Date, such returns to be prepared in a
manner consistent with the past practice and custom of the Company except as
otherwise required by Applicable Laws. For each such return, Sellers\'
Representative shall furnish a draft thereof to Buyer\'s Parent at least 25
Business Days before the anticipated filing date for such return and consider
in good faith comments by Buyer\'s Parent provided that such revisions are
requested no later than five Business Days before such anticipated filing
date. Buyer\'s Parent shall authorize the applicable Company\'s officers to
cooperate in filing all such Tax returns.

  

(b) Buyer\'s Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or
cause to be timely filed any Tax return for a Straddle Period on a basis
consistent with the last previous similar Tax return ("Straddle Period
Returns") except to the extent otherwise required by Applicable Laws.
Buyer\'s Parent shall provide a copy to the Sellers\' Representative of all
such proposed Tax returns (including copies of all workpapers related thereto)
and such other additional information regarding such Tax returns as may
reasonably be requested by the Sellers\' Representative at least 25 Business
Days prior to the anticipated filing date such Tax Return, except that in the
case of a Tax return due within 90 days following the Closing Date, the copy
shall be provided to the Sellers\' Representative within 20 Business Days
prior to the anticipated filing date and in the case of a Tax return that is
not an income Tax return as early as is practical. Buyer\'s Parent shall
consider in good faith comments by Sellers\' Representative on such Straddle
Period Returns, provided that such comments are received at least five
Business Days before the anticipated filing date of the applicable Straddle
Period Return. Buyer\'s Parent shall also deliver to the Sellers\'
Representative an allocation between the pre-Closing and post-Closing portions
of the Straddle Period (consistent with pre-Closing Straddle Period
allocations described in Section 6.7.2) of any Taxes shown to be due on such
Straddle Period Returns at least 25 days prior to the anticipated filing date
of the applicable Straddle Period Return for review and approval of the
Sellers\' Representative. If Sellers\' Representative and Buyer\'s Parent are
unable to resolve any dispute with respect to the allocation of Taxes in any
Straddle Period, the procedure for resolving disagreements set forth in
Section 2.2.4.3 shall be followed. The fees and expenses of the Arbiter shall
be borne equally by the Buyer\'s Parent on the one hand, and the Sellers, on
the other

  

6.7.4 _Section 338 Election_. Sellers shall provide such cooperation and
assistance as Buyer may reasonably request, from time to time, with respect to
Buyer Cdn making an election under Code Section 338(g) (and any corresponding
election under U.S. state or local law) (collectively, a "Section 338
Election") with respect to the purchase by Buyer Cdn of the capital stock of
PTH or PTGH hereunder. If Buyer Cdn makes such Section 338 Election, Buyer
shall pay to each Seller the amount of consideration, if any, necessary to
cause such Seller\'s net proceeds from the sale of the capital stock of PTH or
PTGH hereunder, as the case may be, to be equal to the after-Tax net proceeds
that such Seller would have received had such Section 338 Election not been
made, taking into account all appropriate federal, state, local and foreign
Tax implications (the "Tax Adjustment"). Sellers\' Representative shall
provide Buyer with a schedule computing the amount of the Tax Adjustment
within 20 days after Buyer has informed it in writing that Buyer Cdn has made
such Section 338 Election. In making such calculations, the highest
applicable federal, state, local or foreign income tax rates applicable to
each Seller based on (a) such Seller\'s character (e.g., natural person,
corporation, etc.), (b) county and state or province of residence, and (c)
character of the income recognized, shall be used. Buyer shall have 15
Business Days to consider such schedule and, if it disagrees with the
calculation, the procedure for resolving disagreements set forth at Section
2.2.4.3 shall be followed. Buyer shall pay to Sellers\' Representative on
behalf of the respective Sellers the aggregate amount of the Tax Adjustment
for each Seller within 15 Business Days after the Tax Adjustment for all
Sellers has been finally determined. For the avoidance of doubt, no election
under Code Section 338 or any similar election under state, local or non-US
law, shall be made with respect to the acquisition of AAI and APH under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of Sellers\' Representative, which
consent may be withheld in Sellers\' Representative\'s sole and absolute
discretion.

  

    

6.7.5 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_

  

(a) Buyer, Buyer Cdn, the Companies and Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the
filing of Tax returns (including any amended Tax returns) pursuant to this
Section 6.7 and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the execution of any powers of
attorney, the retention and (upon the other Party\'s request) the provision of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The Companies and Sellers agree (i) to retain
all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Companies
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer
or Buyer Cdn, as applicable, or Sellers, any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii) to give the other Party
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records and, if the other Party so requests, the Companies and
Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the other Party to take possession of
such books and records.

  

(b) Buyer and Buyer Cdn, as applicable, and Sellers further agree, upon
request, to use their best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with
respect to the Transactions).

  

    

(c) Buyer and Buyer Cdn, as applicable, and Sellers further agree, upon
request, to provide the other Party with all information that either Party may
be required to report pursuant to Code Section 6043, or Code Section 6043A,
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder or analogous or similar provisions
of non-US law.

  

6.7.6 _Tax-Sharing Agreements_. All income Tax-sharing Agreements shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, none of the
Companies shall be bound thereby or have any Liability thereunder.

  

6.7.7 _Certain Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges
and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
respect of the Transactions shall be paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by Sellers,
severally, but not jointly.

  

6.7.8 _Amended Returns and Retroactive Elections_. Subject to Section 6.7.4,
neither Buyer nor Buyer Cdn shall, or cause or permit the Companies to, (a)
amend any Tax returns filed with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or (b)
make any Tax election that has retroactive effect to any such year, in each
such case without the prior consent of the Sellers\' Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

6.7.9 _Tax Refunds_. Any Tax refunds (including interest thereon) of, and
only of, any of APH, APS, AAI, KAI and CTA attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period that are received by any such Company, Buyer, or any Affiliate thereof
(other than any of Buyer Cdn, PTH, PT, PTGH and PTG), and any credits against
Tax that are attributable to any such Company for such Pre-Closing Tax Period
to which Buyer, any such Company or any Affiliate (other than any of Buyer
Cdn, PTH, PT, PTGH and PTG) thereof become entitled, shall be for the account
of Sellers (excluding, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.7.11(b) with
respect to Transaction Tax Deductions that arise in a Straddle Period, (a) any
refund or credit attributable to any loss in a taxable year (or portion of a
Straddle Period) beginning after the Closing Date applied (e.g., as a
carryback) to income in a taxable year (or portion of a Straddle Period ending
on or before the Closing Date), and (b) for avoidance of doubt, any tax
savings from a loss attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that is carried
forward to offset any income or gain in any taxable year (or portion of a
Straddle Period) beginning after the Closing Date)), and Buyer shall pay (or
cause to be paid) to the Sellers\' Representative (for the account of Sellers)
any such refund or the amount of any such credit actually received in cash by
Buyer, any such Company or any Affiliate thereof (other than any of Buyer Cdn,
PTH, PT, PTGH or PTG)within 15 Business Days after the receipt thereof;
provided, however, that this Section 6.7.9 shall not apply to any such refund
or credit to the extent that the cumulative amount thereof is less than the
cumulative amount of any Tax assets (excluding any deferred Tax asset
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set
forth on the face of the Final Closing Statements (rather than in any notes
thereto) and taken into account in determining adjustments, if any, to the US
Purchase Price, as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.2.4. For the
avoidance of doubt, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, any net
operating loss (including a net operating loss attributable to or arising from
the Transaction Tax Deductions), credit or other similar Tax attribute of such
Company attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of any such Company shall
first be carried back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Company, and to the
extent such net operating loss, credit or other similar Tax attribute is
carried back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Company and produces a Tax
refund for such Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period such refund
shall be for the account of Sellers in accordance with this Section 6.7.9;
provided, however, that the preparation of any such returns, claims for refund
or other documents related to such carrybacks or refunds shall be governed by
Section 6.7.3(a) (including that the preparation and filing of such documents
shall be at Sellers\' expense) and none of Buyer, Buyer Parent, any Affiliate
thereof, or any Company shall be required to initiate or participate in any
administrative or judicial proceeding in connection therewith except at the
request of Sellers\' Representative and at Sellers\' expense.

  

    

6.7.10 _Consolidated Returns_. To the extent permitted by Applicable Laws,
Buyer shall include or cause to be included APH, AAI and any eligible
subsidiaries thereof, if any, in the U.S. federal consolidated group of which
Buyer is a member and any analogous state consolidated, combined or unitary
group during the period immediately following the Closing Date.

  

6.7.11 _Certain Deductions_.

  

(a) All deductions and other expenses (including any Transaction Tax
Deductions) of a Company resulting from the payment or accrual of an amount in
a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be treated as occurring or allocable to the day
of or prior to the Closing Date for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall be
reported consistently with such treatment, and Buyer or any Affiliate thereof
shall not nor shall it cause any of its Affiliates to treat such deductions
(or a portion thereof) as occurring after the Closing Date under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b) (or any similar provision of state, local or
non-U.S. Applicable Laws).

  

(b) If Transaction Tax Deductions of, but only of, any of APH, APS, AAI, KAI
or CTA arise in a Straddle Period, any reduction in Taxes of such Company in
such Straddle Period shall be for the benefit of Sellers, determined as
follows:

  

(i) the income of such Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Period portion of the
Straddle Period shall be determined but the Transaction Tax Deductions shall
be treated as the last deductions so applied in such Pre-Closing Tax Period;

  

(ii) if such Transaction Tax Deductions are not fully absorbed in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period portion of the Straddle Period pursuant to clause (i) of
this Section 6.7.11(b), the amount not so absorbed shall be applied against
the income of such Company for the Post-Closing Tax Period portion of the
Straddle Period. To the extent that the Transaction Tax Deductions so applied
to such Post-Closing Tax Period reduce the Taxes of such Company with respect
to such period (determined by treating the Transaction Tax Deductions as the
last deductions taken after deducting all other deductible items attributable
to such period), such reduction shall be for the account of Sellers and paid
in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.7.9;

  

    

(iii) if there is a loss in the Straddle Period that is attributable to such
Transaction Tax Deductions (determined by treating the Transaction Tax
Deductions as the last deductions taken) and such loss may, under Applicable
Law, be carried back to prior Pre-Closing Tax Periods, of such Company, any
refund obtained on such carry backs attributable to the Transaction Tax
Deductions or other loss attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period portion of
the Straddle Period (determined by treating the Transaction Tax Deductions and
other losses attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period portion of the
Straddle Period as being utilized first, followed by the utilization of any
loss otherwise attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period portion of the
Straddle Period) shall be for the account of Sellers, and shall be paid in
accordance with the provisions of Section 6.7.9, with the costs of pursuing
such carrybacks to be apportioned between Sellers and the applicable Company
in proportion to their respective shares of the claimed refund amounts; and

  

(iv) notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall have no entitlement to any
Tax benefit arising from any carry forward of a loss in a Straddle Period,
whether attributable to Transaction Tax Deductions or not, to a Post-Closing
Tax Period beginning after the Closing Date.

  

6.7.12 _Tax Proceedings_

  

(a) If a Party receives notice from any Tax authority of any proposed audit,
claim, assessment or other dispute ("Tax Proceeding") concerning an amount of
Taxes with respect to which another Party may incur Liability hereunder, such
Party shall promptly notify such other Party of such matter. Such notice shall
contain factual information (to the extent known) describing any asserted Tax
Liability in reasonable detail and shall be accompanied by copies of any
notice or other documents received from any Tax authority with respect to such
matter. If a Party receives written notice of an asserted Tax Liability with
respect to a matter for which it has a right to indemnification hereunder (and
the other Party does not have knowledge of the asserted Tax Liability) and
fails to provide the other Party with prompt notice thereof in the manner
described in the preceding sentence and as a result such other Party is
materially prejudiced by such failure, then such other (indemnifying) Party
shall be relieved of its indemnification obligations with respect to such
asserted Tax Liability, but only to the extent of such material prejudice.

  

(b) At its election, Sellers\' Representative shall control any Tax Proceeding
relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than Straddle Periods) provided
that Sellers\' Representative must control such Tax Proceeding in good faith
and with reasonable diligence thereafter to preserve its rights in this
regard. Buyer or Buyer Cdn, as the case may be, shall be entitled to fully
participate in any such Tax Proceeding and shall have the right to consent to
the settlement of any such Tax Proceeding (provided such consent cannot be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). In the case that Buyer or
Buyer Cdn controls such Tax Proceeding, Sellers\' Representative shall be
entitled to fully participate in any such Tax Proceeding and shall have the
right to consent to the settlement of any such Tax Proceeding (provided such
consent cannot be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Sellers\'
Representative and Buyer or Buyer Cdn, as the case may be, shall jointly
control in good faith any Tax Proceeding related to Taxes of a Company in
respect of a Straddle Period and neither Sellers\' Representative nor Buyer
(or Buyer Cdn), as the case may be, shall settle such Tax Proceeding without
the consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned by any Party.

  

    

(c) Without limiting or otherwise restricting any Party\'s indemnification and
other rights under Section 6.3, each of Buyer and Buyer Cdn shall bear its
expenses incurred in connection with Tax Proceedings relating to Taxes of a
Company and Sellers shall bear their expenses incurred in connection with such
Tax Proceedings provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if Buyer or
Buyer Cdn controls any Tax Proceeding relating to a Pre-Closing Period (other
than a Straddle Period), as contemplated by Section 6.7.12(b), Sellers shall
bear the expenses that Buyer and Buyer Cdn incurred in connection with such
Tax Proceeding.

  

6.7.13 _Ineligible Property_. Each Seller agrees that, after the Closing,
such Seller will not, and will not cause any other Person to, take any action,
enter into any transactions or acquire any property that would directly or
indirectly cause, PT\'s Interests or PTG\'s Share to be or become "ineligible
property" within the meaning of paragraph 88(1)(c) of the Tax Act.

  

6.7.14 _Tax Provisions Control_. To the extent of any inconsistencies between
any provision of this Section 6.7 and Section 6.3, the provisions of this
Section 6.7 shall control.

  

6.8 _Release_. Subject to, and effective as of, consummation of the Closing,
each Seller hereby remises, releases and forever discharges each Company and
its successors and assigns of and from any and all manner of action and
actions, cause and causes of actions, suits, debts, dues, sums of money,
accounts, reckonings, bonds, bills, specialties, covenants, contracts,
controversies, executions, claims and demands of any kind and nature
whatsoever in law or in equity known or unknown against the Company that any
Seller ever had, may have up until immediately preceding the Closing or may
thereafter have, including any claims to any change of control or retention
rights in respect of the Closing or other Transactions, commissions or any
portion of the revenue or profits of the Company or any equity interest in the
Company, except to the extent of any obligation of the Company to Seller (a)
under this Agreement or any other documents, including employment agreements,
executed in connection with the Closing and contemplated hereby, (b) for
unpaid accrued salaries and reimbursable out of pocket expenses incurred on
the Company\'s behalf, subject to the Company\'s related policies and
supporting documentation, to the extent reflected as a Current Liability on
the face of the Closing Balance Sheets, (c) pursuant to rights, including
amounts payable, under Company Plans that do not constitute a breach of any
Seller Rep, including Section 3.13, and (d) except in respect of any breach by
any one or more Companies or Sellers or Sellers\' Representative of any
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or agreements contained
herein, any and all indemnification and other rights, benefits and claims of
Sellers under the Organizational Documents.

  

    

6.9 _Regulatory Filings_.

  

6.9.1 _In General_. During the Pre-Closing Period, each of the Parties shall
coordinate and cooperate with one another and shall each use commercially
reasonable efforts to comply with, and shall refrain from taking any action
that would impede compliance with, all Applicable Laws, and, as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, each of the Parties shall make all filings,
notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions or information,
application or submission of other documents required by any Government Entity
in connection with the Transactions, including any filing or registration
necessary to obtain any material consent, authorization or approval or
otherwise required or advisable to consummate the Transactions. Each Party
shall cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with any
Government Entity under this Section 6.9 to comply in all material respects
with all Applicable Laws.

  

6.9.2 _HSR Act_

  

(a) Buyer, Buyer Cdn, Buyer\'s Parent and Sellers undertake and agree to file
within three Business Days after the date hereof, a Notification and Report
Form and documentary materials in respect of the Transactions that
substantially comply with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), and the rules thereunder, with the United
States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice (and shall file as soon as practicable any form
or report required by any other Governmental Entity relating to antitrust or

termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, (iv) make any
further filings or information submissions pursuant thereto that may be

any clearance under the HSR Act or to resolve any objections that may be
asserted by the applicable Governmental Entity, in each case as promptly as
practicable, including by executing agreements, defending through litigation
on the merits any claim asserted in any court, including appeals, and
submitting to judicial or administrative orders to hold separate any business
or assets of any Seller, any Company, Buyer, Buyer Cdn or Buyer\'s Parent or
their respective Affiliates; provided, however, that nothing contained in this
Agreement shall require any Seller, Buyer, Buyer Cdn, Buyer\'s Parent or their
respective Affiliates to take any such action if the taking of such action
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
business, assets, results of operations or financial condition of any Company,
Buyer, Buyer Cdn or Buyer\'s Parent, or that of any of their respective
Affiliates, or require Buyer, Buyer Cdn, Buyer\'s Parent or any Company or any
of their respective Affiliates to dispose of any material portion of its
business.

  

    

(c) Buyer, Buyer Cdn and Buyer\'s Parent on one hand and Sellers\'
Representative on the other hand shall (i) promptly notify the other
Party(ies) of any written communication to that Party or its Affiliates from
any Governmental Entity and, subject to Applicable Laws, permit the other
Party to review in advance any proposed written communication to any of the
foregoing, (ii) not agree to participate, or to permit its Affiliates to
participate, in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning the

extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat, and (iii) to the extent
permitted under Applicable Laws, furnish the other Party with copies of all
correspondence, filings, and communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between such Party and its Affiliates and their respective
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions (unless the
furnishing of such information would (A) violate any Applicable Laws
(including those relating to security clearance or export controls) or any
confidentiality agreement or (B) cause the loss of the attorney-client
privilege with respect thereto); provided, that each such Party shall use its,
his or her commercially reasonable efforts to promptly communicate to the
other Party the substance of any such communication, whether by redacting
parts of such material communication or otherwise, so that such communication
would not violate Applicable Laws or cause the loss of the attorney-client
privilege with respect thereto.

  

(d) Except as otherwise provided herein, the obligations of the Parties under
this Section 6.9 shall not include any requirement of any Party to expend
money (other than normal legal and professional fees or filing fees), commence
or participate in any litigation or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third Person. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, Buyer\'s Parent on one hand and Sellers on the other hand
shall each pay 50% of all filing fees in respect of the filing under the HSR
Act referenced in Section 6.9.2(a) in respect of the Transactions.

  

6.10 _Exchange Information_. During the Pre-Closing Period, each of the
Parties shall promptly supply the other Parties with any information that may
be required to effectuate any filings or application pursuant to Sections 6.9
or 6.11. Except where prohibited by Applicable Laws, each of the Parties
shall consult with the other Parties prior to taking a position with respect
to any such filing, shall permit the other to review and discuss in advance,
and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, white papers,

Agreement or the Transactions (including under any antitrust or fair trade
Applicable Laws), coordinate with the other in preparing and exchanging such
information and promptly provide the other (and its counsel) with copies of
all filings, presentations or submissions (and a summary of any oral
presentations) made by such party with any Governmental Entity in connection
with this Agreement or the Transactions; provided that, with respect to any
such filing, presentation or submission, no Party need supply the other (or
its counsel) with copies (or, in case of oral presentations, a summary) to the
extent that Applicable Laws require such Party to restrict or prohibit access
to any such properties or information.

  

    

6.11 _Notification_. During the Pre-Closing Period, each of the Parties will
notify the other promptly upon the receipt of: (a) any material comments from
any officials of any Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made
pursuant hereto, and (b) any request by any officials of any Governmental
Entity for material amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant to,
or information provided to comply in all material respects with, any
Applicable Laws. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to Section 6.9, the
respective Party will promptly inform the other Party of such occurrence and
reasonably cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Entity such
amendment or supplement.

  

6.12 _Certain Post-Closing Covenants_

  

6.12.1 _Confidentiality_. Each Seller agrees that during the Restricted
Period, such Seller will not disclose or use in any manner that is adverse to
the interests of Buyer, Buyer Cdn, Buyer\'s Parent or any Company, directly or
indirectly, any Confidential Information, except in connection with the
pursuit or defense of claims under this Agreement or any other agreement or
document in connection with the Transactions or pursuant to a subpoena, order
or request issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by another
Government Entity, or as otherwise required by Applicable Laws. Any Seller
may, however, use any Confidential Information in the preparation of Tax
returns with respect to periods prior to and including the Closing Date. If
this Agreement terminates without the Closing occurring, each Party agrees
that during the period commencing with the date of such termination and ending
on the third anniversary thereof such Party shall not, except to the extent
otherwise required by Applicable Laws, directly or indirectly disclose or use
any Confidential Information obtained from the other Parties pursuant to this
Agreement or prior to the execution of this Agreement, in the course of
negotiating and evaluating the Transactions. If a receiving Party becomes
legally compelled to disclose any of the Confidential Information, such Party
will, if permitted, provide the disclosing Party with prompt notice so that
the disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy
or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.12.1. If such
protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or the disclosing Party
waives compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.12.1, the receiving
Party will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that, in
the judgment of its counsel, is legally required and will exercise reasonable
efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the
Confidential Information.

  

    

6.12.2 _Use of Certain Name_. Except as an officer or employee of a Company,
each Seller agrees not to, directly or indirectly, engage in or pursue
business under, the names "Air Parts and Supply," "Kansas Aviation," "CT
Aerospace," "Prime Turbines," or "Avatas Aerospace" or any derivation of any
of the preceding names or terms after the Closing Date.

  

6.12.3 _Injunctive Relief for Breach_. Each Seller\'s obligations under this
Section 6.12 are of a unique character that gives Seller particular value, and
a breach of any of such obligations may result in irreparable and continuing
damage to the Companies, Buyer, Buyer Cdn and Buyer\'s Parent for which there
may be no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, without limiting any Seller\'s
obligations under Section 6.3, in the event of such breach, each Seller agrees
that any Company, Buyer, Buyer Cdn and Buyer\'s Parent will be entitled to
seek injunctive relief and a decree for specific performance, and such other
and further relief as may be proper (including monetary damages if
appropriate).

  

6.13 _Termination of Shareholders Agreements_. Upon execution and delivery of
this Agreement by all Sellers, (a) the Shareholders\' Agreement, dated as of
December 6, 2012 among APH and Sellers as APH shareholders, as amended, and
(b) the Shareholders\' Agreement dated March 30, 2007 among AAI and Sellers as
AAI shareholders, as amended, shall automatically terminate and be null and
void and neither APH nor AAI shall have any Liability in respect of such
Shareholder Agreements. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence,
APH, AAI and each Seller agree that if this Agreement terminates without the
Closing having occurred for any reason, each Seller will execute the documents
required to reinstate the above-referenced Shareholder Agreements in the same
form as the original agreement as of the date hereof.

  

6.14 _Financing_.

  

6.14.1 _Consummation of Financing_. Each of Buyer\'s Parent, Buyer and Buyer
Cdn shall exercise reasonable commercial efforts to consummate, as of the
Closing Date, the borrowing transactions in respect of the Closing

Bank, National Association and Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, including the
Summary of Terms and Conditions annexed thereto, and executed and accepted by
Buyer\'s Parent (together with any alternative or supplemental financing for
the Transaction, the "Financing").

  

6.14.2 _Financing Cooperation_. Each Seller and Company agrees to provide and
will cause the appropriate officers and employees of Sellers and the Companies
to provide, at Buyer\'s expense, reasonable cooperation in connection with the
arrangement and consummation of the Financing in connection with the
Transactions, which cooperation shall include (a) participating in a
reasonable number of meetings, lender presentations, road shows, drafting
sessions, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions, and session with
prospective lenders and rating agencies in connection with the Financing, (b)
providing information reasonably necessary in connection with the preparation
of customary offering documents and materials, including private placement
memoranda, information memoranda and packages, lender and investor
presentations, rating agency presentations, and similar documents and
materials, connection with the Financing, (c) using reasonable efforts to
obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations and instruments which may be
reasonably requested by Buyer\'s Parent in connection with the Financing and
collateral arrangements, including customary payoff letters, lien releases,
instruments of termination or discharge and landlord consents, waivers and
access agreements, (d) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of
Buyer\'s Parent and its financing sources for any debt to be raised to
complete the Transactions, (e) facilitating the pledging of collateral and
perfection of liens (which would be effective only at or after the Closing),
(f) permitting officers and directors of the Companies who will be officers or
directors of the Companies after the Closing Date to execute and deliver any
pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents,
resolutions, written consents or other certificates or documents as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer\'s Parent (including a certificate of the chief
executive officer or chief financial officer of the Companies with respect to
solvency matters; provided, however, that no obligation of any Company under
any such certificate, document or instrument to which any of Company is a
party shall be effective until the Closing Date and none of Sellers or their
Affiliates (other than the Companies) shall have any obligations in connection
therewith after Closing, (g) using reasonable commercial efforts to cooperate
by providing information necessary for negotiation of Buyer\'s Parent of
definitive financing documentation and any other document required in
connection therewith and (h) otherwise reasonably cooperating with Buyer\'s
Parent, Buyer and Buyer Cdn in satisfying the conditions precedent set forth
in the Financing commitment letter or any definitive document related to the
Financing, to the extent within the control of Sellers, provided that, with
respect to each of the foregoing, (1) no such letters, agreements,
registration statements, documents and certificates shall be executed and
delivered except at the Closing and (2) the effectiveness thereof shall be
conditioned upon, or become operative after, the occurrence of the Closing.

  

    

6.15 _Non-Competition_. Each Seller whose Percentage Ownership is 4.7% or
more hereby agrees to enter into a Non-Competition Agreement with Buyer\'s
Parent, Buyer and Buyer Cdn at the Closing pursuant to Section 7.2.18.

  

6.16 _Payment of WFS Fees and Expenses_. Sellers agree (a) to satisfy all of
the Companies\' obligations under the WFS Agreement, including the Companies\'
obligations to pay WFS\'s fees in respect of the consummation of the Closing
and other Transactions and reimburse WFS\'s expenses as required by the WFS
Agreement, so that none of the Companies, as of and after the Closing, shall
have any payment obligation or other Liabilities thereunder and (b) to take no
action that would result in any Company having any payment obligation or other
Liability under the Indemnity Agreement referenced in the WFS Agreement.

  

6.17 _Release of APH\'s and APS\' AP Acquisition Agreement Obligations_.
Subject to, and effective as of, consummation of Closing, and without
restricting the application of the release provisions set forth in Section
6.8, Seller Charene G. Murray ("CGM") hereby remises, releases and forever
discharges APH and APS and each of their successors and assigns of and from
any and all Liabilities under or otherwise in respect of (a) the Acquisition
Agreement dated as of December 28, 2012 between CGM as "Vendor" and APH as
"Purchaser," (and any and all amendments thereto) pursuant to which, among
other things, APH purchased all of APS\' outstanding capital stock, including
any and all payment and other obligations of APS thereunder, including earnout
payments under section 2.5 of such Acquisition Agreement for three 12-month
periods, with the second of which ends on December 31, 2014 and the third (and
last) of which ends on December 31, 2015, and (b) the agreement made on or
about December 12, 2014 among CGM, APH and KLP, pursuant to which, among other
things, the Acquisition Agreement referenced in the preceding clause (a) of
this 6.17 will be terminated as of the Closing and KLP will thereafter be
obligated to make certain payments to CGM if certain conditions are satisfied.

  

    

6.18 _Full Satisfaction of Certain Seller Indebtedness to AAI_. Before or
concurrently with consummation of the Closing each of the Sellers Jeffrey A.
Lavine, Miramar Family Investments, Inc., Paul Goffredi, Russell Starr,
Stephen Donegan and Thomas Williams will fully satisfy and extinguish such
Seller\'s Indebtedness to AAI referenced in Schedule 6.18.

  

6.19 _Certain Insurance_. Sellers will at or before the Closing, take all
action necessary to cause, at their expense, Buyer and Buyer\'s Parent to be
named as additional insured parties under an insurance policy providing $5
million insurance coverage on terms substantially the same as those in place
pursuant to policy number 37313299 currently in effect as of the date hereof,
such policy to have a term of five years from the Closing Date.

  

6.20 _Right of First Refusal_.

  

(a) If, on or before October 31, 2015, Turbine Engine Specialists Holding Inc.
("TESH") or any one or more Sellers holding more than 50% of the equity of
TESH propose to sell, convert, exchange or otherwise transfer, whether by
sale, merger, consolidation, recapitalization or otherwise, before October 31,
2015, TESH or Turbine Engine Specialists Inc. ("TES") or more than 50% of the
capital stock, or all or substantially all of the business or assets, of TESH
or TES (for purposes of this Section 6.20, a "Selling Shareholder"), such one
or more Selling Shareholders or Sellers\' Representative shall give at least
60 days\' prior notice to Buyer, which notice (for purposes of this Section
6.20, the "Sale Notice") shall identify whether TESH or TES or the business,
assets or capital stock of TESH or TES is proposed to be sold, converted,
exchanged or otherwise transferred, describe in reasonable detail the terms
and conditions of such proposed transfer, and identify each prospective
transferee(s), each of which shall be bona fide. Buyer shall be entitled to
ask questions and receive such information as it shall reasonably request
concerning such proposed transfer.

  

(b) (i) Not later than 30 days after the date of the Sale Notice is delivered
to Buyer, Buyer may elect to purchase TESH, TES or, as the case may be, all
but not less than all of the business, assets or capital stock to be
transferred, upon the same terms and conditions as those set forth in the Sale
Notice by delivering notice to the one or more Selling Shareholders or
Sellers\' Representative (a "Purchase Notice"). The closing of the purchase
and sale by Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.20(b) shall take place within 20
Business Days after the date on which Buyer delivered its Purchase Notice in
accordance with this Section 6.20(b), and Buyer shall provide notice of such
date and the place of such closing to the one or more Selling Shareholders or
Sellers\' Representative.

  

    

(ii) If Buyer does not elect to purchase any or all of TESH, TES or, as the
case may be, the business, assets or capital stock specified in the Sale
Notice pursuant to Section 6.20(a) and (b), the one or more Selling
Shareholders may, during the 60-day period beginning on the day immediately
following the 60th day after the delivery of the Sale Notice, subject to
transfer TESH, TES or, as the case may be, all of the business, assets or
capital stock specified in the Sale Notice to the transferee(s) specified in
the Sale Notice, in either case, at a price and on terms and conditions no
more favorable to the transferee(s) thereof than those specified in the Sale
Notice. Any such business, assets or shares that are not transferred in
compliance with the proceeding sentence within such 60-day period will again
be subject to this Section 6.20 upon any subsequent proposed transfer on or
before October 31, 2015.

  

6.21 _Special Receivables_. During the period commencing on the Closing Date
and ending on the 183 day after the first anniversary thereof, Buyer and the
Operating Companies that own the respective Special Receivables will cooperate
with Sellers\' Representative, and use commercially reasonable efforts to
collect the Special Receivables (including at least the efforts that such one
or more Operating Companies have used in the past to collect its receivables).
Any such Special Receivables actually collected (net of reasonable out of
pocket costs, which shall include any related unpaid accrued collection costs,
and resulting Taxes of the one or more Operating Companies as of the Closing,
in each case to the extent not reflected in the Final Closing Statements),
before the 183rd day after the first anniversary of the Closing Date will in
respect of the Special Receivables of APS, CTA and KAI be paid to Sellers\'
Representative, on behalf of Sellers based on their Percentage Ownership, as
additional US Purchase Price or, as the case may be in respect of Special
Receivables of PT or PTG, form part of the PTH Purchase Price or PTGH Purchase
Price, as applicable, as provided in Sections 2.2.4.6(e) and 2.2.4.7(c),
respectively. All income Tax obligations in connection with the Special
Receivables are the obligations of Sellers and no payment made by Buyer or any
Operating Company pursuant to this Section shall increase either the US
Purchase Price, the PTH Purchase Price or the PTGH Purchase Price. Sellers
acknowledge they have no independent remedy against Buyer, Buyers\' Parent or
any Operating Company, and Buyer, Buyer\'s Parent and the Operating Companies
have no obligations to Sellers, with respect to the collection of the Special
Receivables, except as set forth in this Section 6.21.

  

6.22 _WARN_. In any termination or layoff of (a) any employee of any
Operating Company on the Closing Date as a result of the Transactions, or (b)
any employee of any Operating Company after the Closing, Buyer, Buyer Cdn,
Buyer\'s Parent and the Companies will comply fully, if applicable, with the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 ("WARN") and all
other applicable foreign, federal state and local laws, including those
prohibiting discrimination and requiring notice to employees. Buyer, Buyer
Cdn, Buyer\'s Parent and the Companies shall not, at any time on or after the
Closing and prior to 60 days after the Closing Date, effectuate a "plant
closing" or "mass layoff" as those terms are defined in WARN affecting in
whole or in part any facility, site of employment, operating unit or employee
of the Companies without complying fully with the requirements of WARN.

  

    

6.23 _D andO Indemnification_. During the period commencing on the Closing Date
and ending on the sixth anniversary thereof, Buyer and the Companies agree to
cause all rights to indemnification of all former and current officers,
directors and managers of the Companies existing immediately prior to the
Closing pursuant to the Organizational Documents of the Companies to continue
for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, and Buyer
shall not, and shall not permit the Companies to, amend, repeal or modify any
provision in the Companies\' Organizational Documents relating to the
exculpation or indemnification of former officers, directors and managers as
in effect immediately prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer, Buyer Cdn and Buyer\'s Parent shall be entitled to consummate the
transactions contemplated by Section (g)(iii) of Schedule 2.2.2(b) provided
that the above-referenced indemnifications rights remain, in the aggregate,
substantially unchanged.

  

6.24 _Certain Insurance Matters_. On and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause
the Operating Companies to obtain and maintain, for a period ending no earlier
than the second anniversary of the Closing Date, occurrence-based products
liability insurance coverage, with no deductible, on a basis generally
consistent with the coverage existing as of the date hereof for the Operating
Companies, but with policy limits of not less than $100,000,000, and each of
the Persons listed on Schedule 6.24 shall be named as additional insureds
thereunder. Such insurance shall be primary, and non-contributory, to other
insurance held by each of the Persons listed on Schedule 6.24 and Buyer shall
cause the existing Companies to remain covered entities under the existing
products liability insurance coverage covering the existing Companies with
respect to occurrences prior to the Closing. Each such party shall have their
respective products liability insurance coverage endorsed to acknowledge the
indemnity obligations set forth in Section 6.3.

  

6.25 _Certain New Exit Event Agreements_. If Sellers or Affiliates of
Sellers, other than the Companies, intend before the Closing to enter into

Sellers\' Representative. Sellers\' Representative may consult with legal
counsel, independent public accountants and other experts selected by
Sellers\' Representative. Sellers\' Representative shall not have any duty to
Sellers to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any
of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or of the Escrow

reimburse Sellers\' Representative from and against such Seller\'s ratable
share of any and all Losses suffered or incurred by the Sellers\'
Representative in connection with or related to Sellers\' Representative
performance of its duties under this Agreement, except where such losses are
caused by Sellers\' Representative\'s bad faith or willful misconduct.

  

    

9.10 _Tax Withholdings_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, and
provided that Sellers provide such properly completed Forms W-8 or W-9 as
Buyer reasonably requests and except to the extent otherwise required by any
change in Applicable Laws (including by legislation, regulation, notice,
ruling or judicial decision) or as a result of notice that a FIRPTA Affidavit
delivered to Buyer or Buyer Cdn pursuant to Section 7.2.10 is inaccurate or
incomplete, Buyer, Buyer Cdn and Buyer\'s Parent shall not be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amount payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant
to this Agreement any amounts of Canadian or U.S. federal, state, local or
provincial taxation, except for (a) withholding Tax on interest imputed or
otherwise on any deferred payments hereunder; (b) any amounts required to be
deducted and withheld under the backup withholding provisions of the Code; (c)
any amounts of withholding Taxes on amounts properly treated as compensation
hereunder; and (d) any other amounts otherwise payable hereunder as determined
by Buyer, Buyer Cdn or Buyer\'s Parent in good faith that are required to be
withheld, provided that in each case Sellers\' Representative shall have the
opportunity to review Buyer\'s, Buyer Cdn\'s or Buyer\'s Parent\'s
determination of the withholding Taxes contemplated to be withheld under this
clause (d) of this Section 9.10 and if Sellers\' Representative disagrees with
such determination, such disagreement shall be referred to, and subject to
resolution by, the Arbiter pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section
2.2.4.3.

  

9.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which together shall constitute one and the same
Agreement.

  

9.12 _Waiver_. The rights and remedies of the Parties hereunder are
cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any
Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will
operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other
or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by
Applicable Laws, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement can be
discharged by one Party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of
the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other Party, (b) no waiver
that may be given by a Party will be applicable except in the specific
instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one Party
will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such Party or of the right
of the Party giving such notice or demand to take further action without
notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in
this Agreement.

SCHEDULE 1 
  
  
  CERTAIN MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION AND DEFINITIONS

  

1.1. _Construction of this Agreement and Certain Terms and Phrases_

  

(a) Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, (i) words of any
gender include each other gender; (ii) words using the singular or plural
number also include the plural or singular number, respectively; (iii) the
terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and derivative or similar
words refer to this entire Agreement and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement; and (iv) the terms "Article," "Section," "Schedule " and
"Exhibit" without any reference to a specified document refer to the specified
Article, Section, Schedule and Exhibit, respectively, of this Agreement.

  

(b) The words "including," "include" and "includes" are not exclusive and
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation"; if exclusion
is intended, the word "comprising" is used instead.

  

(c) Unless the context clearly prohibits such construction, the word "or"
shall be construed to mean "and/or" and the words "neither," "nor," "any,"
"either" and "or" shall not be exclusive.

  

(d) Whenever this Agreement refers to a number of days, such number shall
refer to calendar days unless Business Days are specified.

  

(e) Whenever this Agreement refers to any payment to be made to Sellers\'
Representative, such payment shall be made to an account designated by
Sellers\' Representative, which may include an escrow account designated by
Sellers\' Representative in trust for Sellers with disbursements to be made
according to instructions from Sellers\' Representative.

  

(f) All accounting terms used herein and not expressly defined herein shall
have the meanings given to them under GAAP.

  

(g) Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law,
including any one or more sections thereof, shall be deemed also to refer to,
unless the context requires otherwise, all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, including U.S. Treasury Regulations.

  

(h) Any representation or warranty contained herein as to the enforceability
of a contract, including this Agreement, shall be subject to the effect of any
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar law
currently or hereafter in effect affecting the enforcement of creditors\'
rights generally and to general equitable principles (regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

  

(i) In interpreting the representations and warranties herein, the principle
that the specific governs and controls the general shall apply. Accordingly,
by way of example but not by way of limitation, if there is a representation
and warranty on the absence of infringement by the Companies of the
intellectual property rights of third Persons qualified by "the Companies\'
Knowledge" and "Sellers\' Knowledge," then the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall
have no right to indemnification (and there shall be no liability) for
infringement by the Companies that was not to the Companies\' Knowledge nor
Sellers\' Knowledge, notwithstanding the presence of a general representation
on the absence of undisclosed liabilities that is not knowledge qualified.   

(j) For the purposes of Articles 3 and 3A, the words "delivered," "provided,"
"furnished," and "made available" and words of similar import will be
construed to mean that the applicable document or other item has been (x)
posted, and continuously available, to Buyer or Buyer\'s Parent at least three
Business Days prior to the Closing Date or (y) otherwise delivered to Buyer or
Buyer\'s Parent prior to the Closing Date.

  

(k) The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties
and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions hereof.

  

(l) The Disclosure Schedules are a material part of this Agreement as if fully
set forth within this Agreement. Each section of the Disclosure Schedules
shall relate solely to the Section in Articles 3 and 3A to which its expressly
relate and not to any other Sections in this Agreement except that any
disclosure set forth in any section of a Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
set forth for purposes of any other section of the Disclosure Schedules to
which such disclosure is relevant, to the extent, if any, that it is readily
apparent that such disclosure is applicable to such other section of the
Disclosure Schedules. The inclusion of information in the Disclosure
Schedules shall not be construed as an admission that such information is
material to any of the Companies. In addition, matters reflected in the
Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by this
Agreement to be reflected in the Disclosure Schedules. Such additional
matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily
include other matters of a similar nature. Neither the specifications of any
dollar amount in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Disclosure Schedules
is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item
so included or other items, are or are not material, and no Party shall use
the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such
item in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the Disclosure
Schedules is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Further,
neither the specification of any item or matter in any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any
specific item in the Disclosure Schedules is intended to imply that such item
or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the Ordinary Course of
Business, and no Party shall use the fact of setting forth or the inclusion of
any such items or matter in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as
to whether any obligation, item or matter not described in this Agreement or
included in the Disclosure Schedules is or is not in the Ordinary Course of
Business for purposes of this Agreement   

(m) The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" as used in this Agreement
means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends and such phrase
does not simply mean "if."

  

(n) No provision of this Agreement is to be construed to require, directly or
indirectly, any Person to take any action, or to omit to take any action, to
the extent such action or omission would violate Applicable Laws.

  

(o) Any reference to time refers to United States Eastern Time.

behalf of Sellers based on their Percentage Ownership, on and subject to the
applicable terms and conditions set forth above in this Agreement, including
the following terms and conditions:

  

(a) In respect of the First Post-Closing Year, the Post-Closing Payment, if
any, shall be calculated as follows:

  

(i) $20,000,000 shall be payable if the EBITDA for the First Post-Closing Year
exceeds $23,128,205 (the "Maximum Target for the First Post-Closing Year");

  

(ii) nill shall be payable if the EBITDA for the First Post-Closing Year is
less than $18,000,000 (the "Minimum Target for the First Post-Closing Year");
or

  

(iii) if the EBITDA for the First Post-Closing Year is between the Minimum
Target for the First Post-Closing Year and the Maximum Target for the First
Post-Closing Year, the amount payable shall be the amount by which EBITDA for
the First Post-Closing Year exceeds the Minimum Target for the First Post-
Closing Year multiplied by 3.9.

  

(b) In respect of the Second Post-Closing Year (together with the First Post-
Closing Year, the "Adjustment Years"), the Post-Closing Payment, if any, shall
be calculated as follows:

  

(i) $20,000,000 shall be payable if the EBITDA for the Second Post-Closing
Year exceeds $26,028,205 (the "Maximum Target for the Second Post-Closing
Year");

  

(ii) nill shall be payable if the EBITDA for the Second Post-Closing Year is
less than $20,900,000 (the "Minimum Target for the Second Post-Closing Year");
or

  

(iii) if the EBITDA for the Second Post-Closing Year is between the Minimum
Target for the Second Post-Closing Year and the Maximum Target for the Second
Post-Closing Year, the amount payable shall be the amount by which EBITDA for
the Second Post-Closing Year exceeds the Minimum Target for the Second Post-
Closing Year multiplied by 3.9.

  

(c) In addition to any Post-Closing Payment payable pursuant to Sections (a)
and (b) of this Schedule 2.2.2(b), a Post-Closing Payment of $5,000,000 shall
be payable within 60 days after the end of the first period, if any, of 12
consecutive calendar months entirely within the period commencing on January
1, 2014 and ending on December 31, 2015 (the "12-Month Period") for which the
EBITDA for such 12-Month Period totaled at least $18,000,000 (the "Minimum
Target" for such first 12-Month Period).   

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) payment of the Post-
Closing Payments will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Third
Amended and Restated Business Loan and Security Agreement and (ii) any amount
of the $45,000,000 in Post-Closing Payments that does not become payable under
this Schedule 2.2.2(b) shall constitute a reduction in the US Purchase Price
and Buyer will not be obligated to pay Sellers\' Representative, on behalf of
Sellers based on their Percentage Ownership, the amount of any such reduction.

  

(e) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Schedule 2.2.2(b), each Post-
Closing Payment payable hereunder shall be calculated and paid to Sellers\'
Representative, on behalf of Sellers based on the Percentage Ownership, within
90 days after the end of the Adjustment Year or, as the case may be, within 60
days after the end of the first 12-Month Period for which it was earned. No
Post-Closing Payment shall be payable hereunder in respect of an Adjustment
Year or any 12-Month Period if the EBITDA for such Adjustment Year or 12-Month
Period is less than its respective Minimum Target set forth in Section (a) of
this Schedule 2.2.2(b). Buyer and Buyer\'s Parent shall provide to Sellers\'
Representative, in reasonable detail, (i) within 90 days after the last day of
the First Post-Closing Year, a statement of the EBITDA for the First Post-
Closing Year and, if any, a statement of the Post-Closing Payment for such
Adjustment Year; (ii) within 90 days after the last day of the Second Post-
Closing Year, a statement of the EBITDA for the Second Post-Closing Year and,
if any, of the Post-Closing Payment for such Adjustment Year; (iii) within 30
days after the end of each month during the period commencing on December 1,
2014 and ending on December 31, 2015 a statement of the EBITDA for such month,
provided that the Post-Closing Payment referenced in Section (c) of this
Schedule 2.2.2(b) has not been previously paid and Buyer has not notified
Sellers\' Representative that such Post-Closing Payment is payable in respect
of a previous 12-Month Period; and (iv) within 60 days after the last day of
the first 12-Month Period, if any, for which the EBITDA for such period
totaled at least $18 million, a statement of the EBITDA for such period.

  

(f) (i) Before the 46th day after the earlier of the date a Post-Closing
Payment was due or paid pursuant to this Schedule 2.2.2(b), Sellers\'
Representative and its advisers (1) shall have access upon prior notice and
during normal business hours to the books, papers and records of the Post-
Closing Payment Companies and their accountants (if any are used) relating to
the calculation of the Post-Closing Payment for the preceding Adjustment Year
or, in respect of Section (c) of this Schedule 2.2.2(b), 12-Month Period and
(2) may conduct at Sellers\' expense an examination of any Post-Closing
Payment Company\'s books and records in respect of the calculation of the
Post-Closing Payment for the preceding Adjustment Year, month or, as the case
may be, 12-Month Period.

  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the rights of access and
examination set forth in Section (f)(i) of this Schedule 2.2.2(b) shall
terminate in respect of any Post-Closing Payment paid or payable pursuant to
this Schedule 2.2.2 (b) on the 46th day after the earlier of the date such
Post-Closing Payment was due or paid pursuant to this Schedule 2.2.2(b) except
to the extent a Sellers\' Objection has been provided pursuant to Section
(g)(i) of this Schedule 2.2.2(b) and the disagreement set forth therein has
not yet been resolved.   

(g) (i) The amount of or any Post-Closing Payment shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon, and deemed accepted by, Sellers unless Sellers\'
Representative shall before the termination under Section (f) of this Schedule
2.2.2(b) of its rights of access and examination in respect of the Post-
Closing Payment pursuant to Section (f)(i) of this Schedule 2.2.2(b), have
notified Buyer\'s Parent in reasonable detail of any objections thereto,
identifying the specific items involved and the dollar amount of each
disagreement (the "Sellers\' Objection"). After the later of (1) the 45th day
after date on which Buyer\'s Parent has delivered its calculation of the
respective EBITDA and Post-Closing Payment to Sellers\' Representative and (2)
the date of termination of the respective access and audit period in Section
(f)(i) of this Schedule 2.2.2(b) in respect of the EBITDA and Post-Closing
Payment, neither Buyer\'s Parent, Buyer nor Sellers\' Representative may
introduce additional disagreements with respect to the respective EBITDA or
Post-Closing Payment or increase the amount of the disagreement, and any item
not so identified shall be deemed to be agreed to by Buyer\'s Parent, Buyer
and Sellers\' Representative and will be final, binding and conclusive upon
the Parties.

  

(ii) If a Sellers\' Objection is provided pursuant to Section (g)(i) of this
Schedule 2.2.2(b), Buyer\'s Parent shall have 20 days to review and respond to
such Sellers\' Objection, and Buyer\'s Parent, Buyer and Sellers\'
Representative shall attempt to resolve the differences set forth in the
Sellers\' Objection within 20 days following receipt of the Sellers\'
Objection by Buyer\'s Parent. Disputes between Buyer\'s Parent and Sellers\'
Representative that are not resolved by them within such 20-day period shall
be referred no later than such 20th day for decision to (1) the Arbiter, if
any, selected pursuant to Section 2.2.4.3 and, (2) if no such Arbiter had been
selected, an independent accounting firm or valuation firm of national
reputation mutually acceptable to Buyer\'s Parent and Sellers\' Representative
(whether pursuant to clause (1) or (2), the "Post-Closing Payment Arbiter"),
who shall act as arbitrator and determine, whether and to what extent, if any,
the respective Post-Closing Payment requires adjustment, based solely on
presentations by Sellers\' Representative and Buyer\'s Parent and only with
respect to the remaining differences so submitted. If Buyer\'s Parent and
Sellers\' Representative cannot agree upon the selection of the Post-Closing
Payment Arbiter within five Business Days, BDO USA LLP shall serve as the
Post-Closing Payment Arbiter hereunder. The Post-Closing Payment Arbiter
shall deliver to Buyer\'s Parent and Sellers\' Representative its written
determination as to whether and to what extent, if any, the respective Post-
Closing Payment requires adjustment no later than the 30th day after the
remaining differences underlying the Sellers\' Objection are referred to the
Post-Closing Payment Arbiter, or such longer period of time as the Post-
Closing Payment Arbiter determines is necessary. The Post-Closing Payment
Arbiter\'s determination pursuant to this Section (g)(ii) shall be final,
conclusive and binding upon the Parties, absent manifest error in the factual
basis or application of the relevant or controlling accounting principles.
Buyer\'s Parent on one hand and Sellers on the other hand shall each pay 50%
of the fees and expenses of the Post-Closing Payment Arbiter. Buyer and
Sellers\' Representative shall make readily available to the Post-Closing
Payment Arbiter all relevant information, books and records and any work
papers relating to the Post-Closing Payment in dispute and all other items
reasonably requested by the Post-Closing Payment Arbiter. In no event may the
Post-Closing Payment Arbiter\'s resolution of any difference be for an amount
that is outside the range of Buyer\'s and Sellers\' Representative\'s
disagreement in respect to the Post-Closing Payment.   

(iii) Each Post-Closing Payment shall become final, conclusive and binding
upon the Parties upon the earliest of (1) Sellers\' Representative\'s failure
to provide a Sellers\' Objection in respect of the Post-Closing Payment on or
before the 45th day after the earlier of the date such Post-Closing Payment
was due or paid pursuant to this Schedule 2.2.2(b), (2) the agreement between
Buyer and Sellers\' Representative with respect thereto, and (3) the decision
by the Post-Closing Payment Arbiter with respect to any disputes under this
Section (d).

  

(h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (1) if a Change of
Control occurs during the First Post-Closing Year, the Post-Closing Payment
payable in respect of the First Post-Closing Year and in respect of the Second
Post-Closing Year, pursuant to Sections (a) and (b) of this Schedule 2.2.2(b)
shall be the maximum $20,000,000 for each of the two Adjustment Years plus the
$5,000,000 payable pursuant to Section (c) of this Schedule 2.2.2(b), or
$45,000,000 in the aggregate, and (2) if a Change of Control occurs during the
Second Post-Closing Year, the Post-Closing Payment payable pursuant to Section
(b) of this Schedule 2.2.2(b) with respect to the Second Post-Closing Year
shall be the $20,000,000 maximum payment, and in either event the required
Post-Closing Payment(s) shall be paid within 10 Business Days after the date
on which the Change of Control occurs. Upon making the applicable Post-
Closing Payments referenced in the immediately preceding sentence, all of
Buyer\'s obligations under Section 2.2.2(b) and this Schedule 2.2.2(b) in
respect of Post-Closing Payments shall terminate and be null and void.

  

(i) For all purposes of this Schedule 2.2.2(b):

  

(i) "Change of Control" means the occurrence of: (1) a sale, exchange,
conversion or other transfer of voting securities of one or more of Post-
Closing Payment Companies, a merger, consolidation or amalgamation of one or
more of Post-Closing Payment Companies or a recapitalization of one or more of
Post-Closing Payment Companies, whereby upon consummation of any such
transaction, Buyer\'s Parent and its wholly owned Subsidiaries, including
Buyer, together do not beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 50%
of the outstanding voting securities of one or more Post-Closing Payment
Companies; or (2) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of one or
more Post-Closing Payment Companies to any Person, other than Buyer\'s Parent,
Buyer or one or more wholly owned Subsidiaries of Buyer\'s Parent, in one
transaction or series of related transactions that require under the
applicable corporation laws or limited liability company laws the approval of
the shareholders or members of the respective Post-Closing Payment Companies
selling their assets.

  

(ii) "Closing Month" means the month in which the Closing occurs.

  

(iii) "EBITDA" means, in respect of the referenced Adjustment Year or, in
respect of Section (c) of this Schedule 2.2.2(b), consecutive 12-month period,
the aggregate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
of the Post-Closing Payment Companies on a consolidated basis, as determined
by Buyer\'s Parent (subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including Section (g) of this Section 2.2.2(b)) in a manner consistent with
the way in which each Post-Closing Payment Company\'s earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization has historically been
calculated, to the extent in accordance with GAAP, on an accrual basis,
provided, that each Post-Closing Payment Company\'s financial results used in
the calculation of EBITDA shall exclude (1) all Transaction Expenses; (2) with
respect to expenses of a nature that the Post-Closing Payment Company incurs
in the Ordinary Course of Business prior to the Closing, expenses imposed on
the Post-Closing Payment Company by Buyer that are in excess, in proportion to
associated revenue, of the expenses that have historically been incurred by
the Post-Closing Payment Company in the Ordinary Course of Business prior to
the Closing (provided that all employment agreements,   

amendments of employment agreements and other compensatory arrangements
entered into or otherwise effective as of the Closing for any officers,
managers or other employees of any Post-Closing Payment Company shall be
deemed to be in the Ordinary Course of Business of such Post-Closing Payment
Company; (3) expenses of the Post-Closing Payment Company caused by
utilization of the Post-Closing Payment Company\'s resources by Buyer\'s
Parent or Buyer for its activities unrelated to the Post-Closing Payment
Company\'s business; and (4) with respect to expenses of a nature that the
Post-Closing Payment Company did not incur in the Ordinary Course of Business
prior to Closing, expenses not reasonably incurred in and directly
attributable to efforts to generate new revenue for the Post-Closing Payment
Company (including allocations of headquarter office expenses of Buyer or
Buyer\'s Parent and travel of Post-Closing Payment Company personnel to and
from such headquarter office(s). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the audit fees, legal fees (except to the extent relating to the
performance of services directly to or otherwise on behalf of Post-Closing
Payment Company in respect of legal issues of such Person) and product
liability insurance expenses used in determining EBITDA during either
Adjustment Year shall be deemed to be substantially consistent with such
expenses incurred by the Post-Closing Payment Companies during the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2014.   

(iv) "First Post Closing Year" means (A) if the Closing Date occurs on or
before the 23rd day of the Closing Month, the 12-month period commencing on
the first day of the Closing Month, provided, that in such event,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the EBITDA for the period
commencing on the first day of the Closing Month and ending on the Closing
Date shall be deemed to be, for all purposes hereof, an amount equal to (x)
the average daily EBITDA for the period commencing on the first day after the
Closing Date and ending on the last day of the Closing Month (y) multiplied by
the number of Business Days during the period commencing on the first day of
the Closing Month and ending on the Closing Date; and (B) if the Closing
occurs during, but after the 23rd day of, the Closing Month, the 12‑month
period commencing on the first day of the month immediately following the
Closing Month.

  

(v) "Second Post-Closing Year" means the 12-month period commencing on the
first day after the end of the First Post-Closing Year.   

(vi) "Post-Closing Payment Companies" means KAI, CTA, APS, AAI and APH and any
one or more successors to one or more of the foregoing entities contemplated
by Section (j)(iii) of this Schedule 2.2.2(b).

  

(j) Subject to Section (h) of this Schedule 2.2.2(b), during the period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the last day of the Second Post-
Closing Year:

  

(i) Buyer\'s Parent and Buyer shall maintain a financial reporting system that
separately accounts for each Post-Closing Payment Company\'s revenues and
expenses, or if one or more transactions contemplated by clause (iii) below
occurs, for the combined or consolidated Post-Closing Payment Companies, and
facilitate the determination of EBITDA during the Adjustment Years.

  

(ii) Buyer\'s Parent and Buyer shall cause each Post-Closing Payment Company
to operate such Company\'s business in a manner substantially consistent with
the Post-Closing Payment Company\'s past practices, but taking into account
the acquisition of the Post-Closing Payment Company by Buyer as a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Buyer, changes in the administrative operations of the Post-
Closing Payment Company as a result of being acquired by Buyer, and other
changes reasonably related to the Post-Closing Payment Company\'s being a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Buyer which, in the aggregate, do not cause a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither Buyer\'s Parent nor Buyer shall,
except as contemplated by clause (iii) below, transfer to any other Affiliate
of Buyer\'s Parent or Buyer any significant sales of products or services that
traditionally have been provided by any Post-Closing Payment Company.

  

(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, and without
constituting a "Change of Control" hereunder, Buyer\'s Parent and Buyer shall
be entitled, as of the Closing or at any time thereafter (including before,
during or after the Adjustment Years) to consolidate or combine, including by
merger into each other, one or more of the Post-Closing Payment Companies,
whether on an operational basis, or more formally, including by statutory
mergers or consolidations under applicable law, provided that Sellers\' rights
to Post-Closing Payments pursuant to the Definitive Agreement shall not be
adversely affected.

  

(iv) Buyer\'s Parent and Buyer shall cause the Post-Closing Payment Companies
to remain in material compliance with all Applicable Laws.

  

(v) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall
create a fiduciary duty on Buyer\'s Parent, Buyer, any Post-Closing Payment
Company or any other Subsidiary of Buyer\'s Parent to or for the benefit of
Sellers in respect of the Post-Closing Payments. Buyer\'s Parent and Buyer
will exercise reasonable commercial efforts to operate the Post-Closing
Payment Companies in good faith to achieve the Minimum Targets during the
Adjustment Years and shall not take any action without a commercially
reasonable business justification to avoid the achievement of any Minimum
Target or Buyer\'s obligation to pay any Post-Closing Payment. In exercising
such reasonable commercial efforts, Buyer\'s Parent and Buyer will cause the
Post-Closing Payment Companies to use such Companies\' funds available from
net income as working capital and investments in other assets as is
commercially reasonably to achieve the growth opportunities available to the
Post-Closing Payment Companies and shall not   

permit the Post-Closing Payment Companies to engage in any act that would
reasonably be expected to distort unfairly the financial results of the Post-
Closing Payment Companies during the Post-Closing Payment Period, including,
any revenue or expense shifting between fiscal periods for the purpose of
avoiding the achievement of any Minimum Target or Buyer\'s obligation to pay
any Post-Closing Payment. Further, if Sellers Representative notifies Buyer
of an opportunity not in the Ordinary Course of Business of one or more Post-
Closing Payment Companies to acquire inventory or potential inventory for a
purchase price in excess of such one or more Companies\' then available cash
for such purchase, without being obligated hereunder to fund any such
purchases, Buyer will in good faith consider the funding of such excess
available cash opportunities.

  

(k) Buyer\'s obligations to make Post-Closing Payments under this Schedule
2.2.2(b) shall not be conditioned on or otherwise subject to any one or more
Sellers being employees of Buyer\'s Parent, Buyer, any Post-Closing Payment
Company or any other Subsidiary of Buyer\'s Parent.
