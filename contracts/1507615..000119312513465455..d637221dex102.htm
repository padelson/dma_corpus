 _ARTICLE II_

 

COVENANTS AND INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS RELATED TO THE

 

BP PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT

 

Section 2.1 _No Amendment_. TRMC agrees that it will not amend or waive any
provision of the BP Purchase and Sale Agreement, if such amendment or waiver
would reasonably be expected to be adverse to the Partnership Groups interest
in the Assets, without the prior written consent of the Operating Company.

 

Section 2.2 _Post-Closing Compliance_. The Operating Company agrees to comply
with the "Post-Closing Covenants" of TRMC contained in Article 12 of the BP
Purchase and Sale Agreement as if the Operating Company were a party thereto
to the extent such covenants apply to the Assets and to the extent that the
Operating Company is allowed to comply with respect to Assets it does not own
pursuant to the operating agreements and subleases executed in connection with
the Tranche 2 Contribution Agreement. TRMC hereby agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure the Sellers comply with their obligations with
respect to the Assets under the terms of Article 12 of the BP Purchase and
Sale Agreement, and TRMC further agrees that, in the event TRMC receives the
benefit of any actions taken by the Sellers in satisfaction of
such covenants, TRMC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
the Operating Company receives the benefit of such actions.

 

Section 2.3 _Benefit of BP Representations_. In addition to the assignment of
rights under the BP Purchase and Sale Agreement as part of the Assets, TRMC
agrees that, as between TRMC and the Operating Company, the Operating Company
shall have the benefit of all of Sellers representations, warranties,
covenants and indemnities in the BP Purchase and Sale Agreement relating to
the Assets as if the Operating Company was a party thereto; provided, however,
that the Operating Company may coordinate through TRMC for any claim with
respect thereto as set forth herein. Section 2.4 _Losses_. Upon a Loss incurred by any Partnership Indemnified
Party on or after the BP Closing Date with respect to the Assets arising out
of (i) a breach of a representation or warranty made by the Sellers under the
BP Purchase and Sale Agreement, (ii) a Third Party Environmental Claim filed
in state or federal court or first identified in any order, notice or request
issued by, or any investigation initiated by a Governmental Authority within
two years of the BP Closing Date, (iii) a breach of a covenant of the Sellers
under the BP Purchase and Sale Agreement, or (iv) the BP Retained
Liabilities, the Operating Company shall promptly notify TRMC thereof with
sufficient detail to enable TRMC to take action as set forth below. Based on
the assignment of rights under the BP Purchase and Sale Agreement as part of
the Assets, the Operating Company may make a direct claim against the Sellers
with respect to applicable claims. In addition, if requested by the Operating
Company, upon receipt of any such notice from, and discussion with, the
Operating Company, TRMC shall promptly make an indemnification claim against
the Sellers with respect to such Loss in accordance with the terms of the BP
Purchase and Sale Agreement. In connection with any such claim for
indemnification, TRMC shall take direction from the Operating Company with
respect to the conduct and resolution of any such claim, and agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such instructions from the
Operating Company. It is the intent of this provision that no Partnership
Indemnified Party have any direct claims against TRMC with respect to any
Losses arising out of clauses (i) through (iv) of this _Section 2.4_, but it
is intended that the Partnership Indemnified Parties benefit with respect to
any such claims as if they were parties to the BP Purchase and Sale Agreement.
Upon any recovery by TRMC from the Sellers for indemnification claims made on
behalf of any Partnership Indemnified Party due to Losses arising out of
clauses (iii) and (iv) of this _Section 2.4_, TRMC shall promptly pay the
full amount of such recoveries to the applicable Partnership Indemnified
Party. Upon any recovery by TRMC from the Sellers for indemnification claims
made on behalf of any Partnership Indemnified Party due to Losses arising out
of clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section 2.4_ or any indemnification claims
made on behalf of any Buyer Indemnified Party arising out of similar claims
thereto under the BP Purchase and Sale Agreement (which for clarity for both
the Partnership Indemnified Parties and the Buyer Indemnified Parties are the
Warranty Claims and Third Party Environmental Indemnity Claims described in
_Section 2.7_), TRMC and the Operating Company agree to allocate such
recoveries pursuant to _Section 2.7_. The Operating Company shall pay the
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by TRMC in making such claim on behalf
of the Operating Company. The Operating Company, on behalf of the Partnership
Indemnified Parties, acknowledges and agrees that the procedures for
indemnification in this _Section 2.4_ are the exclusive remedies of the
Partnership Indemnified Parties for Losses arising out clauses (i) through
(iv) of this _Section 2.4_.

Section 2.5  _Indemnity by Operating Company_.

(a) The Operating Company agrees to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party for
any Losses incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party on or after the BP Closing
Date due to a claim for indemnification made by a Seller Indemnified Party
arising out of any obligation assumed by the Operating Company with respect to
the Assets pursuant to the Contribution Agreements.

(b) The Operating Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Buyer
Indemnified Party from and against any Losses suffered or incurred by a Buyer
Indemnified Party by reason of a third party claim arising from or relating to
the ownership, use and/or operation of the Tranche 1 Assets after the BP
Closing Date or the ownership, use and/or operation of the Tranche 2 Assets
after the Execution Date. (c) Upon any Buyer Indemnified Party being made aware of such a claim, TRMC
shall promptly make a claim for indemnification against the Operating
Company, and the Operating Company and TRMC, on behalf of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, agree to conduct and resolve such a claim in accordance
with the procedures provided in Section 3.6 of the Second Amended and
Restated Omnibus Agreement. TRMC, on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties,
acknowledges and agrees that the procedures for indemnification in this
_Section 2.5_ are the exclusive remedies of the Buyer Indemnified Parties
for Losses pursuant to this _Section 2.5_.

Section 2.6 _Environmental Indemnity by TRMC_.

 

(a) TRMC shall be responsible for and shall perform Remedial Work arising from
or relating to the ownership, use and/or operation of the Tranche 1 Assets
prior to the BP Closing Date, including the Remedial Work listed on _Schedule
2.6_ , and Remedial Work arising from or relating to the ownership, use and/or
operation of the Tranche 2 Assets prior to the Execution Date (collectively,
the " _TRMC Remedial Work_ "). The Operating Company shall be responsible for
and bear any and all costs associated with operating the Tranche 1 Assets
after the BP Closing Date and the Tranche 2 Assets after the Execution Date
in compliance with any order, "Environmental Permit" (as defined in the BP
Purchase and Sale Agreement) or request of any Governmental Authority.

 

(b) TRMC shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Partnership, the
Operating Company, their Affiliates, their respective successors and each of
their respective officers (or persons in any similar capacity if such person
is not a corporation), employees, consultants and agents of the Partnership,
the Operating Company, their Affiliates and their respective successors (each,
a " _Partnership Indemnified Party_ ") from and against any Losses suffered
or incurred by a Partnership Indemnified Party by reason of or arising out of
the TRMC Remedial Work, including any failure by TRMC to perform such TRMC
Remedial Work.

(c) TRMC shall also indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Partnership
Indemnified Party from and against any Losses suffered or incurred by a
Partnership Indemnified Party by reason of a Third Party Environmental Claim
arising from or relating to the ownership, use and/or operation of the Tranche
2 Assets between the BP Closing Date and the Execution Date, that (i)
is filed in state or federal court within two years of the BP Closing Date or
(ii) first identified in any order, notice or request issued by, or any
investigation initiated by a Governmental Authority pursuant to Environmental
Law within two years of the BP Closing Date.

(d) Except as set forth in _Sections 2.6(b)_ and _2.6(c)_ , in no event shall
TRMC have any direct responsibility to the Partnership or the Operating
Company for Third Party Environmental Claims or any BP Retained Liabilities
relating to the Assets. (e) Any Hazardous Substances (as defined in the BP Purchase and Sale
Agreement) first discovered outside the physical boundaries of any Asset
shall be conclusively presumed to be the result of a Release (as defined in
the BP Purchase and Sale Agreement) subsequent to the Execution Date if such
Hazardous Substances (i) are first discovered more than five (5) years after
the BP Closing Date and (ii) do not relate to, or arise out of, the ownership
or operation of Terminal 2 (as defined in Exhibit A). For any Hazardous
Substances that are outside the physical boundaries of Terminal 2 but have or
are alleged to have arisen from or be related to ownership or operation of
Terminal 2, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such Hazardous
Substances are the result of a Release prior to the Execution Date if
such Hazardous Substances are first discovered within ten (10) years after
the Execution Date; and if such Hazardous Substances are first discovered
after ten (10) years past the Execution Date, there shall be no presumption,
but the provisions of _Section 2.6(f)_ shall apply.

(f) In the event of any dispute between TRMC, on one hand, and the Partnership
and the Operating Company, on the other, whether any event, condition or
environmental matter occurred before or after the BP Closing Date or before or
after the Execution Date, the dispute shall be referred to a third-party
qualified environmental consulting firm mutually agreeable to TRMC, the
Partnership and the Operating Company who shall evaluate responsibility, and
where appropriate, allocate percentage responsibility and liability. The third
party consultant shall consider all information submitted to it by TRMC, the
Partnership and the Operating Company to make the final determination, but
shall not perform additional on-site studies or evaluations unless agreed to
by the TRMC, the Partnership and the Operating Company. The following
additional procedures shall apply to any such dispute:

(i) TRMC, on one hand, and the Partnership and the Operating Company, on the
other, shall provide the other with copies of the relevant records and provide
reasonable access to its personnel as necessary to verify the accuracy of the
applicable issue;

 

(ii) within thirty (30) days of the selection of the consulting firm, TRMC, on
one hand, and the Partnership and the Operating Company, on the other, shall
each submit to the consulting firm (with a copy to the other party) their
respective proposals with respect to the determination of the applicable
issue;

 

(iii) the consulting firm shall schedule a hearing at a site mutually
agreeable to TRMC, the Partnership and the Operating Company not later than
twenty (20) days after receipt of the last proposal;

(iv) no less than seven (7) days prior to the hearing, each party may submit
additional information and arguments in response to the proposal offered by
the other side;

 

(v) TRMC, on one hand, and the Partnership and the Operating Company, on the
other, shall each pay fifty percent (50%) of the costs of the consulting firm
and shall each pay their own costs and expenses related to the hearing;

(vi) within fifteen (15) days after the hearing, the consulting firm shall
issue an interim determination in writing as to responsibility, and where
appropriate, its determination of the allocation of percentage responsibility
and liability; (vii) within ten (10) days of the consulting firms issuance of the interim
determination, TRMC, on one hand, and the Partnership and the Operating
Company, on the other, may submit suggested corrective language to the
consulting firm, which the consulting firm shall determine whether or not to
include in its final determination; and

(viii) within ten (10) days of the expiration of the period in _Section
2.6(f)(vii)_, the consulting firm shall make a final determination in writing
as to responsibility and where appropriate, its determination of the
allocation of percentage responsibility and liability, which determination
shall be final and binding.

 

(g) In the event any Partnership Indemnified Party desires to make an
indemnification claim against TRMC pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_ or _Section
2.6(c)_, it may do so pursuant to the procedures for making indemnification
claims provided in Section 3.6 of the Second Amended and Restated Omnibus
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no other article or section of the
Second Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement shall apply to this _Section
2.6_.

Section 2.7 _Provisions Regarding Limitations of Liability in the BP Purchase
and Sale Agreement_.

(a) Until the Sellers have paid an aggregate $150 million (the " _Cap_ ") for
indemnification claims pursuant to Section 15.2.1 of the BP Purchase and Sale
Agreement (" _Warranty Claims_ ") and with respect to Third Party
Environmental Claims (the " _Third Party Environmental Indemnity Claims_ ",

applicable, TRMC, on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, agrees to pay
the amounts it receives from the Sellers with respect to the Indemnity Claims
to the Indemnified Parties, as applicable, and (z) if applicable, the
Indemnified Parties shall direct the Sellers to pay such claims so that the

__(i) to the Buyer Indemnified Parties, in an amount equal to (A) the product
of (x) the total amount paid by Sellers with respect to Indemnity Claims and
(y) the total amount of Indemnity Claims made by the Buyer Indemnified Parties
accepted by Sellers in accordance with terms of the BP Purchase and Sale
Agreement _divided by_ the aggregate amount of all Indemnity Claims made by

Purchase and Sale Agreement, _minus_ (B) the amount any amounts previously
received by the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to Indemnity Claims;
__

(ii) to the Partnership Indemnified Parties, in an amount equal to (A)

Claims and (y) the total amount of Indemnity Claims made by the Partnership
Indemnified Parties, and by TRMC on behalf thereof, pursuant to _Section

Indemnified Parties accepted by Sellers in accordance with terms of the BP
Purchase and Sale Agreement, _minus_ (B) the amount any recoveries previously
received by the Partnership Indemnified Parties; and (iii) if (A) the total amount of Indemnity Claims made by the

and by TRMC on behalf thereof pursuant to _Section 2.4_, and accepted
by Sellers in accordance with the terms of the BP Purchase and Sale Agreement

(1) a positive amount, that amount shall be paid to the Partnership
Indemnified Parties instead of the Buyer Indemnified Parties (and if the
amount to be paid by Sellers in the applicable payment is not sufficient upon
the reallocation to take into account this amount, the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall pay that insufficiency to the Partnership Indemnified Parties);
or

 

(2) a negative amount, the difference between zero and that negative amount
shall be paid to the Buyer Indemnified Parties instead of the Partnership
Indemnified Parties (and if the amount to be paid by Sellers in the applicable

amount, the Partnership Indemnified Parties shall pay that insufficiency to
the Buyer Indemnified Parties).

(b) For any Indemnity Claims that would have resulted in a recovery by either
Indemnified Party, as determined pursuant to _Sections 2.7(d)_ and _(e)_ ,
but for the Cap:

(i) first, the Indemnified Parties shall recalculate the amounts receivable

Indemnity Claims made by the Buyer Indemnified Parties accepted by Sellers in

Purchase and Sale Agreement and those determined to be valid pursuant to
_Sections 2.7(d)_ and _(e)_ ; and (2) for the Partnership Indemnified Parties, in an amount equal to the

respect thereto as follows:

amount of all Warranty Claims made by the Indemnified Parties accepted by
Sellers in accordance with terms of the BP Purchase and Sale Agreement and
those determined to be valid pursuant to _Sections 2.7(d)_ and _(e)_ ;

 

(iii) if the amount recalculated in _Section 2.7(b)(i)(1)_ plus the amount
recalculated in  _Section 2.7(b)(ii)(1)_ is more than the amount actually
received by Buyer Indemnified Parties, the Partnership Indemnified Parties
shall pay to the Buyer Indemnified Parties the amount of such difference;

 

(iv) if the amount recalculated in _Section 2.7(b)(i)(2)_ plus the amount
recalculated in  _Section 2.7(b)(ii)(2)_ is more than the amount actually
received by Partnership Indemnified Parties, the Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall pay to the Partnership Indemnified Parties the amount of such
difference; and (v) further, if, by the operation of all of the prior provisions of this 
_Section 2.7(b)_, the amount of the Indemnity Claims made by the Partnership

Warranty Claims up to $4 million (if Warranty Claims exist), then the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall pay to the Partnership Indemnified Parties all
amounts constituting that excess.

 

(c) Prior to allowing any Buyer Indemnified Party or Partnership Indemnified
Party to receive a recovery pursuant to Section 15 of the BP Purchase
Agreement for an Indemnity Claim, TRMC and the Operating Company,
respectively, shall obtain an agreement from any such party to comply with the
procedures set forth in this _Section 2.7_. TRMC and the Operating Company
shall control the procedures set forth in this _Section 2.7_ on behalf of
the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Partnership Indemnified Parties.

 

(d) After Sellers have paid to the Indemnified Parties an amount equal to the
Cap pursuant to Section 15 of the BP Purchase and Sale Agreement, if an
Indemnified Party believes it would have an Indemnity Claim but for the Cap,
TRMC, on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, or the Operating Company, on
behalf of the Partnership Indemnified Parties, as applicable, shall
give notice to the other of the existence of such Indemnity Claim together
with a reasonable description thereof and any applicable backing
documentation. TRMC and the Operating Company shall have thirty (30) days to
agree whether that Indemnity Claim would have been valid under the BP
Purchase and Sale Agreement. Upon agreement as to a valid claim, the amount of
that Indemnity Claim shall be included in the calculations made pursuant to
_Section 2.7(b)_.

 

(e) In the event TRMC and the Operating Company are unable to come to a
resolution pursuant to _Section 2.7(d)_ (a " _Disputed Claim_ "):

(i) either TRMC or the Operating Company may submit the Disputed Claim to an
agreed upon third party qualified environmental consultant, in the case of a
Third Party Environmental Indemnity Claim, or a nationally recognized
independent accounting firm, in the case of a Warranty Claim (in either case,

Claim;

pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)_;

(viii) TRMC and the Operating Company shall each pay fifty percent (50%) of
the costs of the Dispute Resolution Firm and shall each pay their own costs
and expenses related to the hearing; and

 

(ix) the Dispute Resolution Firms decision shall be final and binding.

(b) On or before April 30th of each year, TRMC shall submit to the Partnership
and the Operating Company TRMCs calculation of its Total Equity Balance as
of the end of the prior calendar year. Such calculation may be accompanied by
(i) financial Schedules of Assets, Liabilities And Equity of TRMC as of
December 31 of the prior calendar year and (ii) a Schedule of Revenue of
TRMC, which may be unaudited, so long as they are certified as being true and
correct in all material respects and with amounts determined in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States,
consistently applied, by the Treasurer or Chief Financial Officer of TRMC, to
such persons actual knowledge. (c) In the event that the calculation of TRMCs Total Equity Balance submitted
pursuant to  _Section 2.8(b)_ is less than the Indemnity Coverage Minimum,
TRMC shall provide alternative surety within thirty (30) days, of a nature
acceptable to the Partnership and the Operating Company, with consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, for the full amount of the Indemnity Coverage
Minimum until such time as TRMC delivers pursuant to _Section 2.8(b)_ a
calculation of its Total Equity Balance that is equal to or greater than the
Indemnity Coverage Minimum. TRMC, the Partnership and the Operating Company
agree that alternative surety that may be used by TRMC to meet its obligations
under this _Section 2.8(c)_ include, but are not limited to, (i) insurance,
(ii) an irrevocable letter of credit and (iii) surety bond.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 2.8_ shall extend until the earlier of
ten (10) years from the BP Closing Date or a Partnership Change of Control
(as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement).

 

(e) TRMC hereby represents and warrants to the other Parties as of the date
hereof that its Total Equity Balance is greater than or equal to the
Indemnity Coverage Minimum.

Section 2.9 _Operating Company s Right to Perform TRMC Remedial Work_. From
and after the BP Closing Date, should TRMC default in any obligation under
this Agreement to perform TRMC Remedial Work, and if, as a consequence, a
Governmental Authority or third party shall notify the Partnership or the
Operating Company that either of them must perform any TRMC Remedial Work
with respect to the Assets, the Partnership or the Operating Company, as
applicable, shall notify TRMC of the same, TRMC shall promptly undertake the
same, and TRMC shall immediately notify the relevant Governmental Authority
or third party that TRMC shall respond to such notice in the place of the
Partnership or the Operating Company, as applicable. However, if the
Partnership or the Operating Company is compelled to undertake or pursue
TRMC Remedial Work with respect to the Assets, or threatened with penalties
or other adverse consequences (including damages, litigation, indemnification
obligations, attorneys fees, etc.), then the Operating Company shall have the
right and authority, but not the obligation, to conduct the TRMC Remedial
Work with respect to the Assets at TRMCs sole expense. The Operating Company
shall have the right to install, maintain, operate, store, use and remove
equipment, including monitoring wells, recovery wells and other assessment or
remediation equipment, to remove, remediate, store and test soils and
groundwater therefrom and thereon and to otherwise take all actions required
to comply with Environmental Law. The Operating Company shall provide TRMC,
within thirty (30) days of TRMCs written request, copies of all
correspondence between the Operating Company and a Governmental Authority or
third party regarding the Operating Companys activities with respect to the
Assets where the TRMC Remedial Work is to be performed. TRMC shall not
interfere with the Operating Companys actions taken pursuant to this _Section
2.9_, and shall cooperate with the Operating Company in obtaining any
permits, consents or approvals necessary for the Operating Company to perform
its actions taken with respect to the Assets. In the event the Operating
Company undertakes to perform TRMC Remedial Work pursuant to this  _Section
2.9_, the Operating Company may seek any remedies available to it under this
Agreement to immediately seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief for
specific performance by TRMC of its obligation to perform TRMC Remedial
Work, in addition to any other rights and remedies available to the Operating
Company under this _Section 2.9_, at law or in equity. _ARTICLE III_

 

REIMBURSEMENT AND ADDITIONAL INDEMNITY

 

Section 3.1 _Repair Reimbursement_. TRMC will reimburse the Operating Company
on a dollar-for-dollar basis, without duplication, for expenses incurred by
the Operating Company for repairs and maintenance to storage tanks and
pipelines included as part of the Assets, and expenses that are made solely in
order to comply with current minimum standards under (a) the U.S. Department
of Transportations Pipeline Integrity Management Rule 49 CFR 195.452 or (b)
the API Standard 653 for Aboveground Storage Tanks, but only if and to the
extent that such repairs and maintenance are identified, and such expenses
are incurred, before, during or as a result of the first scheduled API 653
inspections, internal line inspections or tests, as applicable, that occur
prior to the second anniversary of the Execution Date. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, TRMC shall have the right to review the tank repair scope and
the API 653 inspection reports, as applicable, and shall have no obligation to
reimburse the Operating Company for repairs, maintenance or expenses to the
extent TRMC concludes, in its reasonable discretion, that such repairs,
maintenance or expenses were unnecessary.

Section 3.2  _Indemnification Regarding Ownership_. With respect to the
Tranche 2 Assets, TRMC shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Partnership Indemnified Parties from and against any Losses suffered or
incurred by the Partnership Indemnified Parties by reason of or arising out
of the failure of TRMC to transfer to the General Partner good and valid title
to the Tranche 2 Assets as of the Execution Date, free and clear of any
encumbrances, other than Permitted Liens (as defined in the Tranche 2
Contribution Agreement) as of the Execution Date, and such failure renders any
of the Partnership Indemnified Parties liable to a third party or unable to
use or operate the Tranche 2 Assets in substantially the same manner that
the Tranche 2 Assets were used and operated by TRMC or its Affiliates
immediately prior to the Execution Date, to the extent that TRMC is notified
in writing of any of the foregoing prior to the fifth anniversary of the
Execution Date or if a Partnership Change of Control has occurred, the
earlier of (a) the second anniversary of the Execution Date and (b) the date
of the occurrence of a Partnership Change of Control.

 

Section 3.3 _Additional Indemnification by TRMC_. TRMC shall indemnify,
defend, and hold harmless the Partnership Indemnified Parties from and
against any Losses suffered or incurred by the Partnership Indemnified Parties
by reason of or arising out of (a) events and conditions associated with the
ownership or operation of the Tranche 2 Assets that occur after the
BP Closing Date but on or before the Execution Date (other than Losses
provided for under _Sections 2.4_ , _2.6_ and _Section 3.2_) to the extent
that TRMC is notified in writing of any of the foregoing prior to the tenth
anniversary of the Execution Date, (b) any pending legal actions against
Tesoro and its Affiliates as of the Execution Date set forth on _Schedule III_
to the Second Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement, (c) events and
conditions associated with the Retained Assets (as defined in the Second
Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement), whether occurring before or after the
Execution Date, and (d) all federal, state and local income tax liabilities
attributable to the ownership or operation of the Tranche 2 Assets after the
BP Closing Date but on or before the Execution Date, including under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state or local law). _ARTICLE IV_

 

APPLICABILITY OF INDEMNITY PROVISIONS OF THE SECOND AMENDED AND

 

RESTATED OMNIBUS AGREEMENT

 

Except as otherwise provided in _Sections 2.5(c)_ or _2.6(g)_ , (a) the
environmental indemnity provisions of Article III of the Second Amended and
Restated Omnibus Agreement, (b) Section 3.2 of the Second Amended and Restated
Omnibus Agreement, and (c) Section 3.5 of the Second Amended and Restated
Omnibus Agreement, shall not apply to the Assets. Neither TRMC nor the
General Partner have provided any representation or warranty to the
Partnership or the Operating Company regarding title to the Assets other than
as set forth in the Tranche 2 Contribution Agreement.

thereto, but rather shall be deemed to refer to all other items or matters

Section 5.3 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns

Section 5.4 _No Third Party Rights_. Except with respect to the
Indemnified Parties, the provisions of this Agreement are intended to bind

construed together and shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 

Section 5.6 _Applicable Law; Forum, Venue and Jurisdiction_. This Agreement
shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State
of Texas, without regard to the principles of conflicts of law. Each of the
Parties (a) irrevocably agrees that any claims, suits, actions or proceedings
arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement shall be exclusively
brought in any federal court of competent jurisdiction situated in the United
States District Court for the Western District of Texas, San Antonio Division,
or if such federal court declines to exercise or does not have jurisdiction,
in the district court of Bexar County, Texas, in each case regardless of

fraud or otherwise, are based on common law, statutory, equitable, legal or
other grounds, or are derivative or direct claims, (b) irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Western
District of Texas, San Antonio Division, or if such federal court declines to
exercise or does not have jurisdiction, of the district court of Bexar
County, Texas in connection with any such claim, suit, action or proceeding,
(c) agrees not to, and waives any right to, assert in any such claim, suit,
action or proceeding that (i) it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Western District of
Texas, San Antonio Division, or the district court of Bexar County, Texas, or
of any other court to which proceedings in such courts may be appealed, (ii)
such claim, suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, or
(iii) the venue of such claim, suit, action or proceeding is improper, (d)
expressly waives any requirement for the posting of a bond by a party
bringing such claim, suit, action or proceeding and (e) consents to process

certified mail, return receipt requested, a copy thereof to such party at
the address in effect for notices hereunder or by personal service within or
without the State of Texas, and agrees that service in such forms shall
constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof;
provided, however, that nothing in clause (e) hereof shall affect or limit
any right to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

Section 5.7  _Severability_. If any of the provisions of this Agreement are
held by any court of competent jurisdiction to contravene, or to be invalid
under, the laws of any political body having jurisdiction over the subject
matter hereof, such contravention or invalidity shall not invalidate the
entire Agreement. Instead, this Agreement shall be construed as if it did not
contain the particular provision or provisions held to be invalid and an
equitable adjustment shall be made and necessary provision added so as to
give effect to the intention of the Parties as expressed in this Agreement at
the time of execution of this Agreement.

 

Section 5.8 _Amendment or Modification_. This Agreement may be amended or
modified from time to time only by the written agreement of all the Parties.
Each such instrument shall be reduced to writing and shall be designated on
its face as an amendment to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in the
foregoing to the contrary, any amendment executed by the Partnership or any
of its subsidiaries shall not be effective unless and until the execution of
such amendment has been approved by the conflicts committee of the General
Partners board of directors. Section 5.9 _Integration_. This Agreement, together with the Schedules
and Exhibits referenced herein, constitutes the entire agreement among the
Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings of the Parties in connection therewith. The
Parties acknowledge that they have executed other agreements as of the BP
Closing Date and the Execution Date. In the event of conflict with regard to
the subject matter hereof between such agreements and this Agreement (together
with the Schedules and Exhibits hereto), this Agreement (together with the
Schedules and Exhibits hereto) shall control.

Section 5.10 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that money damages may
not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement and that in
addition to any other remedy available at law or equity, the Parties shall be
entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive or other equitable
relief as a remedy for any Partys breach of this Agreement. The Parties agree
that no bond shall be required for any injunctive relief in connection with a
breach of this Agreement.
