</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Each of the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Co., Acquisition Co. and
Company has approved, and declared it advisable and in the best interests of its stockholders or
shareholders, as the case may be, to consummate the business combination transaction and other

&#147;<U>Merger</U>&#148;), in accordance with the laws of their respective states of incorporation,
including the California Corporations Code (the &#147;<U>CCC</U>&#148;), and upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Parent and Company intend the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section&nbsp;368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations

</DIV>

the outstanding shares of the capital stock of Company (on an as-converted to Company Common Stock
basis), have entered into a voting agreement, dated as of the date hereof, with Parent (each, a
&#147;<U>Voting Agreement</U>&#148;), pursuant to which, upon the terms set forth therein, such shareholders
have agreed to vote their shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, as
applicable, in favor of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

or at such time thereafter as is agreed upon in writing by Parent and Company and provided in the
First Agreement of Merger (the &#147;<U>Effective Time</U>&#148;). Subject to the provisions of this

Article&nbsp;V (excluding conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), unless another time or date is agreed to
in writing by the parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Oppenheimer Wolff &#038;
Donnelly LLP, 3300 Plaza VII, 45 South Seventh Street, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402, unless another
place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. For the purposes of this Agreement,

Corporation</U>&#148;) shall be merged with and into Acquisition Co. and the separate existence of the
First Surviving Corporation shall cease and Acquisition Co. shall continue as the surviving
corporation in the Merger. The Merger will have the effects set forth in the CCC. As used in this
Agreement, &#147;<U>Constituent Corporations</U>&#148; shall mean each of Merger Co., Acquisition Co. and
Company, and &#147;<U>Surviving Corporation</U>&#148; shall mean Acquisition Co., at and after the Second
Effective Time, as the surviving corporation in the Merger and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent. The parties intend the Merger (i.e., the Reverse Merger and the Forward Merger taken
together as a single integrated transaction) to be treated as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to
Section&nbsp;368(a)(2)(D) of the Code and Revenue Ruling 2001-46, 2001-2 C.B. 321 (and any comparable
provisions of any applicable state or local law); provided, however, that if the Merger is
determined (within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code) not to qualify as a tax-free
reorganization, the parties intend the Reverse Merger and the Forward Merger each to be treated as
separate transactions for income tax purposes pursuant to Revenue Ruling 90-95, 1990-2 C.B. 67 (and
any comparable provisions of any applicable state or local law).

Representative has been provided notice, which withheld amount shall be applied against

Article&nbsp;VII. In no event shall Parent be entitled to reduce the value of the FDA Milestone
Consideration that is set-off against indemnifiable Losses under this Section&nbsp;7.3 by more than the
amount of the Indemnification Reserve, with set-off being done in both cash and shares of Parent
Common Stock in the same ratio as such cash and shares comprise the Milestone Cash Consideration
and the Milestone Stock Consideration, respectively (with the value of any share of Parent Common
Stock determined by using the Deemed FDA Milestone Price). The Indemnitees shall provide the
Shareholder Representative with notice of any set-off by Parent for any indemnifiable Losses, which
will set forth the basis for and amount of such indemnifiable Loss and right to set-off (an
&#147;<U>Indemnification Set-off Notice</U>&#148;). The Shareholder Representative shall have 60&nbsp;days after
the receipt of an Indemnification Set-off Notice to review the Indemnification Set-off Notice and
assess the validity of Indemnitees&#146; claim for set-off against the FDA Milestone Consideration (the
&#147;<U>Set-off Review Period</U>&#148;). If, within the Set-off Review Period, the Shareholder
Representative disputes any claim for indemnification and set-off by Parent against the FDA
Milestone Consideration set forth in the Indemnification Set-off Notice, the Shareholder
Representative shall give Parent written notice of such disagreement specifically identifying the
indemnifiable Losses and set-off amounts in dispute and the basis for such dispute (the
&#147;<U>Set-off Dispute Notice</U>&#148;). The parties shall use reasonable efforts to reach agreement
with respect to such disputed items within 30&nbsp;days following the delivery of the Set-off Dispute
Notice, or such longer period as may be agreed upon in writing by the parties (the &#147;<U>Set-off
Resolution Period</U>&#148;). Any indemnifiable Loss and set-off not specifically identified in writing
as a disputed item before the end of the Set-off Review Period shall be deemed to have been
accepted by the Shareholder Representative and shall not be subject to any further dispute, review
or change. If the parties fail to resolve any such disputes with respect to an indemnifiable Loss
and set-off right set forth in an Indemnification Set-off Notice within the Set-off Resolution
Period, Parent shall have the right to exercise such set-off and the Shareholder Representative
shall have the right to seek remedy in law in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

in good faith, may result in a demand by it for indemnification hereunder, the Shareholder
Representative shall be entitled to participate, at his or her sole cost and expense, in any
defense of such claim. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall conduct
and control such defense, but shall not settle any such claim without the consent of the
Shareholder Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that, if such Shareholder Representative consent is so obtained, neither the
Shareholder Representative nor any other Company Shareholder shall have any power or authority to

Company fails to fulfill the Company&#146;s obligations under this Agreement to consummate the

Agreement and to the Contemplated Transactions (&#147;<U>Company Transaction Legal Files</U>&#148;) contain
confidential and attorney-client privileged material with respect to the matters set forth herein
which may prejudice certain parties, including without limitation the Shareholder Representative,

described herein. The Shareholder Representative agrees to provide Parent, the Surviving

necessary in connection with matters other than disputes among the parties hereto relating to this
Agreement and to the Contemplated Transactions.
