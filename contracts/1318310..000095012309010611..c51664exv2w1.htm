 Accordingly, and in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE II. 
 Effects of the Merger; Merger Consideration 

   

 2.1 __Effect on Capital Stock__. 

  

 (a) _ _Cancellation of Certain Stock__. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Reverse Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, all shares of common stock, without par value, of Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), series A preferred stock, without par value, of Company (the " _Series A Preferred Stock_"), series B preferred stock, without par value, of Company (the " _Series B Preferred Stock_") and series C preferred stock, without par value, of Company (the " _Series C Preferred Stock_" and, collectively with the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, the " _Company Preferred Stock_ " and, collectively with the Company Common Stock, the " _Company Capital Stock_ ") that are owned by Company, or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Company, shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no cash or shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (b) _ _Conversion of Company Preferred Stock__. If the condition to the obligation of Parent, Merger Co. and Acquisition Co. to effect the Merger set forth in Section 5.2(d) is not satisfied prior to the Closing and Parent has waived the satisfaction of such condition, each share of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(a) and (ii) Dissenting Shares) shall be, at the Effective Time by virtue of the Reverse Merger, canceled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive the Liquidation Preference Payment applicable to such share, without interest, payable (A) such percentage that is equal to 100% minus the Closing Stock Percentage (the " _Closing Cash Percentage_ ") in cash and (B) such percentage that is between 60% and 70% (inclusive) as is selected by Parent in its sole discretion and set forth in a written notice to Company delivered by Parent at least 3 days prior to the anticipated Closing Date (the " _Closing Stock Percentage_ ") in shares of Parent Common Stock (assuming each share of Parent Common Stock has a value equal to the Applicable Denominator). Upon conversion of the shares of Company Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1(b) into the right to receive 

   ##### 

  

    

the Liquidation Preference Payment in cash and shares of Parent Common Stock,
all such shares of the Company Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and extinguished and shall cease to
exist, and each certificate previously representing any such shares shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Liquidation
Preference Payment in respect of such shares as provided in this Section
2.1(b) upon the surrender of the certificate representing such shares in
accordance with Section 2.4(c) (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in
the manner provided in Section 2.4(k)). If the condition to the obligation of
Parent, Merger Co. and Acquisition Co. to effect the Merger set forth in
Section 5.2(d) is not satisfied prior to Closing and Parent has waived the
satisfaction of such condition because shares of Company Preferred Stock have
not converted and holders thereof will receive the Liquidation Preference
Payment, the calculation of the Per Share Merger Consideration payable to the
holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be adjusted such that the holders of Company Common Stock
and Company Options immediately prior to the Effective Time will receive the
benefit of the holders of Company Preferred Stock that are paid the
Liquidation Preference Payment receiving less than the Per Share Merger
Consideration that would have been payable if such holders of Company
Preferred Stock had converted prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) _ _Conversion of Company Common Stock__. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(a) or (ii) Dissenting Shares) shall be, at the Effective Time by virtue of the Reverse Merger, canceled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive (i) the Closing Date Per Share Consideration and (ii) the FDA Milestone Per Share Consideration (collectively, the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ ") that may be payable in respect of such share pursuant to this Agreement, if any, at the respective times and subject to the conditions and contingencies herein. Upon conversion of the shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1(c), all such shares of the Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and extinguished and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any such shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of such shares upon the surrender of the certificate representing such shares in accordance with Section 2.4(c) (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in the manner provided in Section 2.4(k)).

respect to the payment of any Closing Date Merger Consideration.

In the event that the Closing Date Merger Stock Consideration Value would constitute less than 40% of the Closing Date Merger Consideration Value to be paid and issued to the Company Shareholders and Company Option Holders hereunder before giving effect to this Section 2.1(e), then there shall be a reduction in the amount of cash that comprises the Closing Date Cash Consideration such that, after giving effect to such reduction, the Closing Date Merger Stock Consideration Value equals 40% of the aggregate Closing Date Merger Consideration paid and issued to the Company Shareholders and Company Option Holders hereunder.

the total number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon full
exercise of the Company Option, _provided_   _further_ , _however_ , that if
the product of clause (A) and (B) in clause (i) is greater than the aggregate

the product of (A) and (B) over the aggregate Closing Date Cash Per Share
Consideration payable with respect to such Company Option shall also be
deducted from the aggregate Closing Date Stock Per Share Consideration payable

 (ii) _Payout of FDA Milestone Consideration_. The amount of FDA Milestone Consideration that each Milestone Payee shall be entitled to receive hereunder, if any, shall be an amount equal to the FDA Milestone Per Share Consideration (as defined in Section 2.3(b)(iii)) for each share of Company Common Stock held, or subject to a Company Option held, by each Milestone Payee at the Effective Time. 

  

 (iii) _FDA Milestone Consideration as Merger Consideration_. The parties acknowledge and agree that the achievement by the Surviving Corporation of certain 

   ##### 

  

    

regulatory approvals is a material factor in determining the valuation of
Company by Parent. The FDA Milestone Consideration payable pursuant to this
Section 2.3 does not constitute payment for services, but rather constitutes
part of the merger consideration payable by Parent in connection with the
Merger (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") and shall be treated as such for all
purposes, including for tax purposes. 

  

 (iv) _FDA Milestone Consideration Not Transferable_. No Milestone Payee may sell, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of his, her or its right to receive any portion of the FDA Milestone Consideration, other than with the consent of the Parent or by the laws of descent and distribution or succession. Any transfer in violation of this Section 2.3(a)(iv) shall be null and void and shall not be recognized by Parent or the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) __Definitions__. For purposes of this Agreement: 

   

 (i) " _Milestone Cash Consideration_ " means an amount payable in cash equal to (A) the FDA Milestone Consideration _less_ (B) the product of (x) the number of shares that comprise the Milestone Stock Consideration multiplied by (y) the Deemed FDA Milestone Price _less_ (C) any amount payable to Asante Partners with respect to the FDA Milestone Consideration as set forth in the waiver and release referred to in Section 5.2(i) _less_ (D) any Milestone Cash Adjustment Amount. 

  

 (ii) " _FDA Milestone Consideration_ " means $75,000,000, subject to reduction as provided in Section 2.3(d), less any reduction as provided in Section 7.3. 

  

 (iii) " _FDA Milestone Per Share Consideration_ " means the aggregate of (A) the Milestone Stock Consideration (consisting of the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock described in Section 2.3(b)(iv)) divided by the number of Fully Diluted Shares and (B) the Milestone Cash Consideration divided by the number of Fully Diluted Shares. 

  

 (iv) " _Milestone Stock Consideration_ " means that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of (A) an amount equal to the Milestone Stock Percentage multiplied by the FDA Milestone Consideration, divided by (B) the greater of (i) the average of the closing prices of Company Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the ten (10) trading days ending on the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the Milestone Achievement Date (the " _Actual FDA Milestone Price_ ") or (ii) two dollars ($2.00) (the greater of such prices, the " _Deemed FDA Milestone Price_ "), payable in validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock. In determining the Deemed FDA Milestone Payment, the amount of two dollars ($2.00) will be adjusted, as necessary, to take into account stock splits or reverse stock splits or any dividends of stock or rights with respect to stock that are declared or made to holders of Parent Common Stock in the period between the last measurement date for the Upfront Signing Price and the last measurement date for the Actual FDA Milestone Price. 

  

 (v) " _Milestone Stock Percentage_ " means such percentage as is selected by Parent in its sole discretion subject to the following parameters: (A) such percentage must be between (1) a percentage equal to 80% minus the Closing Stock Percentage and (2) 70%

no event can the Milestone Stock Percentage be a percentage that would result
in the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued to Company
Shareholders and Company Option Holders as part of the Merger Consideration
to exceed a number that would require the approval of Parents stockholders
under NASDAQ Market Place Rule 5635 (or any successor rule). In comparing the
Actual FDA Milestone Price with the Upfront Signing Price, the amounts will be
adjusted, as necessary, to take into account any stock splits or reverse
stock splits or any dividend of stock or rights with respect to stock that
are declared or made to holders of Parent Common Stock in the period between
the first measurement date for the Upfront Signing Price and the last
measurement date for the Actual FDA Milestone Price. 

  

 (vi) " _Merger Stock Consideration Value_ " means the aggregate value of all of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued to Company Shareholders and Company Option Holders as part of the Merger Consideration as determined by the opening price for such shares as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (or such other exchange on which shares of Parent Common Stock may be traded at the time of issuance) on the date of issuance.

In the event that the FDA issues a letter which does not satisfy the definition of PMA Letter above, then the obligations of the parties under this Agreement to continue to attempt to obtain the PMA Letter shall continue in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) __Potential Adjustment to Milestone Cash Consideration__. In the event that the Merger Stock Consideration Value would constitute less than 40% of the aggregate Merger Consideration Value to be paid and issued to the Company Shareholders and Company Option Holders hereunder before giving effect to this Section 2.3(c), then there shall be a reduction in the amount of cash that comprises the Milestone Cash Consideration such that, after giving effect to such reduction, the Merger Stock Consideration Value equals 40% of the aggregate Merger Consideration paid and issued to the Company Shareholders and Company Option Holders hereunder. The amount of any such reduction is referred to herein as the " _Milestone Cash Adjustment Amount_ ".

and are undertaken during the period from the Closing Date until the earlier

The fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent shall be paid by Parent. 

  

 (b) _ _Deposit of Merger Consideration; Adjustment to Closing Date Cash Consideration__.

the foregoing, however, the Closing Date Cash Consideration and the Closing
Date Stock Consideration to be deposited with the Exchange Agent under and

Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.4(c), each Company Certificate, or until the Exchange Agent receives a duly completed and signed letter of transmittal, each Company Option, shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Liquidation Preference Payment or the Per Share Merger Consideration, as the same may become payable from time to time pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. Except pursuant to Section 2.3(e)(ii), no interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Company Certificates or Company Options under the provisions of this Article II.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Person_ " means an individual, a corporation, a limited liability company, a partnership, an association, a trust or any other entity or organization, including a government or political subdivision or any agency or instrumentality thereof. 

   #####

Any amounts withheld pursuant to this provision will be promptly paid to the relevant federal, state or local or other non-U.S. tax authority, and the withholding party shall provide evidence of such payment to the Shareholder Representative upon request.

Company will prepare and deliver to Parent not less than three (3) or more than ten (10) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, a statement which will set forth a good faith estimate of (i) the amount of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company, as of the anticipated Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Cash_ "), and (ii) the Indebtedness of Company as of the anticipated Closing Date (the " _Estimated Indebtedness_ ").

the amount of any required adjustments pursuant to this Section 2.5. 

  

 (c) _ _Post-Closing Cash Adjustment__.

 (ii) If the Closing Indebtedness is greater than the Estimated Indebtedness, there shall be a negative true-up adjustment in an amount equal to the difference between the Closing Indebtedness and the Estimated Indebtedness. 

  

 (e) _ _Review by Shareholder Representative__. The Shareholder Representative shall have 30 days after the receipt of the Closing Statement to review the Closing Statement and all work papers and other documents generated or reviewed by the Surviving Corporation in connection with the preparation of the Closing Statement, and all books and records of the Surviving Corporation related to the Closing Statement (the " _Statement Review Period_ "). If, within the Statement Review Period, the Shareholder Representative disputes any item(s) on the Closing Statement, the Shareholder Representative shall give Parent written notice of such disagreement specifically identifying the item(s) and amount(s) in dispute and the basis for such dispute (the " _Dispute Notice_ "). The parties shall use reasonable efforts to reach agreement with respect to such disputed items within 10 days following the delivery of the Dispute Notice, or such longer period as may be agreed upon in writing by the parties (the " _Resolution Period_ "). Any item(s) on or omitted from the Closing Statement not specifically identified in writing as a disputed item before the end of the Statement Review Period shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Shareholder Representative and shall not be subject to any further dispute, review or change. If the parties fail to resolve any such disputes with respect to the Closing Statement within the Resolution Period, the disputed item(s) shall be resolved and, as a result thereof, the amount of the Closing Cash or Closing Indebtedness, as the case may be, shall be definitely and finally determined using the Financial Issue Resolution Process set forth in Section 2.5(f). 

  

 (f) _ _Financial Issue Resolution Process__. Disputes between Parent and the Shareholder Representative relating to accounting matters under Section 2.5 of this Agreement that cannot be resolved by negotiation in accordance with Section 2.5(e) shall be definitely and finally determined by a nationally or regionally recognized firm of independent public accountants agreed upon by both Parent and the Shareholder Representative (the " _Accounting_  

   ##### 

  

    

 _Firm_ "), who shall act as experts as to accounting matters and not as
arbitrators and whose determination shall be final and binding strictly with
respect to matters dependent only on accounting issues. Parent and the
Shareholder Representative shall select, by mutual agreement, the Accounting
Firm if the stated accounting firm is unwilling to serve, and the Accounting
Firm shall have agreed in writing to serve in such capacity pursuant to the
terms herein described, within 10 days following the end of the applicable

disputed item(s) as to accounting matters and the determination of the
Closing Cash or the Closing Indebtedness, as the case may be, shall be
completed by the Accounting Firm within 30 days following the time the
dispute is submitted to it. The Accounting Firms determination of
the Closing Cash and Closing Indebtedness shall be completed in a manner
consistent with GAAP as applied by Company in accordance with past practices.
The fees and expenses associated with the Accounting Firms determination

the portion of the contested amount not awarded of such party bears to the
amount actually contested by such party.

If such net adjustment is a positive amount (the " _Additional Consideration_ "), Parent shall pay such Additional Consideration, which amount shall be made in all cash, into the account in which the Exchange Fund is maintained and thereafter such amount shall be considered part of the Exchange Fund. If such net adjustment is a negative amount (the " _Negative Adjustment_ "), Parent shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2 in the amount of the Negative Adjustment, less the amount of any payments received by Parent for the Negative Adjustment, in whole or in part, pursuant to any other contractual arrangement for payment of the Negative Adjustment, in whole or in part, to Parent (the " _Negative Adjustment Shortfall_ "). Any payment by Parent into the account in which the Exchange Fund is maintained shall be made within five Business Days following agreement on or final determination of such amount. After such payment is made, the Shareholder Representative and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay any amount in the Exchange Fund to the Company Shareholders and Company Option Holders entitled to such amounts pursuant to this Article II.

In lieu of any such fractional share, each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock or Company Options who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock upon surrender of a Company Certificate for exchange (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in the manner provided in Section 

   ##### 

  

    

2.4(k)) or upon delivery of a letter of transmittal with respect to a Company
Option shall be paid upon such surrender or delivery (and after taking into
account and aggregating shares of Company Capital Stock or Company Options
represented by all Company Certificates surrendered by or Company
Options held by such holder) cash (without interest) in an amount equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional share interest to
which such holder (after taking into account and aggregating all shares of
Company Capital Stock or Company Options represented by all
Company Certificates surrendered by or Company Options held by such holder)
would otherwise be entitled by (b) the Applicable Denominator (in the case of
the Closing Date Per Share Consideration) or the Deemed FDA Milestone Price
in the case of the FDA Milestone Per Share Consideration. 

  

 2.9 __Dissenting Shares__. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Capital Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a holder of such shares of Company Capital Stock who properly exercises appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with CCC (such shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the consideration provided for above, and the holder of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the CCC unless and until such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such holders right to appraisal and payment under the CCC. Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by Company for appraisals of shares of Company Capital Stock.

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of Company (the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of Company, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) to the same extent such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by Company pursuant to Companys Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof with any directors, officers and employees of Company. 

     ##### 

 

   

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Company (the " _D andO Policy_") on, and neither the Parent or the Surviving Corporation will cancel or amend such "tail" policy. 

   

 (c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 4.9. 

   

 (d) The provisions of this Section 4.9 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. 

   

 4.10 __Public Announcements__. Parent, Merger Co., Acquisition Co. and Company shall use reasonable best efforts (i) to develop a joint communications plan, (ii) to ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint communications plan, and (iii) except in respect of any announcement required by Applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of Nasdaq in which it is impracticable to consult with each other as contemplated by this clause (iii), to consult with each other before issuing any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition to the foregoing, except to the extent disclosed in or consistent with the Company Shareholder Materials in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.7, no party shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement or disclosure concerning the other parties or the other parties business, financial condition or results of operations without the consent of such other parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 4.11 __Form S-3 Resale Registration Statement; Registration Procedures__. Unless Parent has provided the S-4 Notice to Company under Section 4.20: 

  

 (a) Parent will use (A) best efforts to file a resale registration statement on Form S-3 (the " _Registration Statement_ ") with the SEC not later than five (5) days after the Closing Date and (B) reasonable best efforts to file a Registration Statement no later than thirty (30) days after the Milestone Achievement Date, in each case covering the resale of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in consideration of the Merger (for the purposes of this Section 4.11, the " _Registrable Securities_ "), in the case of (A) above, with respect to the resale of the shares issued as Closing Date Stock Consideration, and in the case of (B) above, with respect to the resale of the shares, if any, issued as Milestone Stock Consideration. In connection with (A) and (B) above, Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective as soon as possible and to remain effective as provided herein, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in either case before filing the Registration Statement, Parent will 

     ##### 

  

    

furnish or otherwise make available to the Shareholder Representatives
counsel at least two days prior to filing with the SEC copies of all such
documents proposed to be filed in connection with the Registrable Securities
registered thereby and keep the Shareholder Representative reasonably
apprised of the status of such Registration Statement. 

   

 (b) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to the Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep the Registration Statement effective until six months from the date the shares registered thereunder were first issued. 

   

 (c) Parent shall furnish to each holder of Registrable Securities such number of copies, without charge, of such Registration Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto, and prospectus included therein, all exhibits and other documents filed therewith and such other documents as such Holder may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such Holder. 

   

 (d) As a condition precedent to registering Registrable Securities, Parent may require each Holder as to which any registration is being effected to furnish Parent with such information regarding such Person and pertinent to the disclosure requirements relating to the registration and the distribution of such securities as Parent may from time to time reasonably request in writing. Each such Holder shall promptly notify Parent in writing of any changes in the information set forth in the Registration Statement after it is prepared regarding the Holder. For the purposes of this Section 4.11, "a Holder" or "the Holders" refers solely to a holder or holders of Registrable Securities as of the Closing Date or as of the Milestone Achievement Date, as applicable. 

   

 (e) Parent may, by two days prior written notice to the Holders (each, a " _Blackout Notice_ "), (i) delay the filing of the Registration Statement or a request for acceleration of the effective date or (ii) suspend the Registration Statement after effectiveness and require that the Holders immediately cease sales of shares pursuant to the Registration Statement, in the event that (A) Parent is engaged in any activity or transaction or preparations or negotiations for any activity or transaction that Parent desires to keep confidential for business reasons, if Parent determines in good faith that the public disclosure requirements imposed on Parent under the Securities Act in connection with the Registration Statement would require at that time disclosure of such activity, transaction, preparations or negotiations and such disclosure could result in imminent and material harm to Parent or (B) any other event occurs that makes any statement of a material fact made in the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated by reference therein, untrue or that requires the making of any additions or changes in the Registration Statement in order to make the statements therein not misleading. If Parent suspends the Registration Statement and requires the Holders to cease sales of shares pursuant to this Section 4.11(e), Parent shall, immediately following the termination of the circumstance which entitled Parent to do so, take such actions as may be necessary to file or reinstate the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and give written notice to all Holders authorizing them to resume sales pursuant to the Registration Statement. If as a result thereof the prospectus included in the Registration Statement has been amended to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act, Parent shall enclose such revised prospectus with the notice to Holders given pursuant to this Section 4.11(e), and the Holders shall make no offers or sales of shares pursuant 

    ##### 

  

    

to the Registration Statement other than by means of such revised prospectus.
Parent need not specify the nature of the event giving rise to any delay
or suspension in any notice to Holders and the Holders agree to treat and
keep the existence of such delay or suspension, as the case may be,
confidential. Only two Blackout Notices may be delivered in any 12 month
period, with a duration of not more than 30 days in the aggregate. 

   

 4.12 __Stock Exchange Listing__. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Closing Date Stock Consideration to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Milestone Stock Consideration to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the dates of its issuance. 

  

 4.13 __Supporting FDA Approval Process__. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will manage its overall ongoing business as it determines reasonably necessary to pursue and obtain the issuance of the PMA Letter. From and after the Closing Date until the earlier of the Milestone Achievement Date or December 31, 2012, Parent will not make any material changes to the Pipeline business of the Surviving Corporation that it reasonably believes would adversely affect the issuance of the PMA Letter and specifically agrees (i) that the existing manufacturing and operations of the Surviving Corporation relating to Pipeline will be maintained as reasonably necessary to facilitate a favorable FDA inspection in support of getting the PMA Letter and (ii) not to terminate, or cause the Surviving Corporation to terminate, the employment of, or materially change the terms of employment of Daniel J. Cher, Victor Ham, Jeremiah Bailey, Adrian Garcia and Tina Ye; provided, however, that Parent will be permitted to terminate, or permit the Surviving Corporation to terminate, the employment of any such individuals for reasons that would constitute "cause" under the employment agreements by and between the Surviving Corporation and the executives of the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Parent shall not be required to provide funding to the Surviving Corporation in excess of $6,000,000 in any calendar year (which amount will be pro-rated for the calendar year 2009 based on when the Closing occurs). 

  

 4.14 __Additional Agreements__. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either of the Constituent Corporations, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall use reasonable best efforts to take all such necessary action. 

  

 4.15 __Tax Free Qualification__. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Co., Acquisition Co. and Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure the Merger qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

 4.16 __Employees and Employee Benefit Plan Matters__. 

  

 (a) Parent will compensate, or cause its appropriate affiliates to compensate, each individual employed by Company at the Closing (an " _Employee_ ") for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2009 so long as such Employee is employed by Parent or its affiliates (i) at a base wage or base salary rate, and any applicable variable pay rate 

      ##### 

  

    

(e.g., shift differential pay), which shall not be less than that provided to
the Employee by Company immediately prior to the Closing Date; and (ii) with
employee benefit plans and similar programs (including for this purpose a
holiday schedule), which may include any of the Company Benefit Plans, which
are of all the same material types as, and which on an economic basis in the
aggregate are substantially comparable to, the comparable Company
Benefit Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date except for
equity compensation plans. 

   

 (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting the power of Parent and its affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation, to amend or terminate any Parent welfare or employee benefit plan or to discontinue the employment of any given Employee, subject to applicable legal requirements and any other applicable provisions of this Agreement. 

   

 4.17 __Parent Changes__. During the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, except as contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall not undertake during such period (i) a merger, reorganization, stock exchange, consolidation, business combination or recapitalization if such transaction results in the Parent Common Stock no longer being publicly traded or (ii) a liquidation or dissolution of Parent. 

  

 4.18 __Section 280G Matters__. 

  

 (a) Within five days after the date hereof, the Company will deliver a document setting forth in reasonable detail a list of all persons who may be "disqualified individuals" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) and who may be receiving payments or benefits in connection with the Merger (under this Agreement or any other contract, plan or arrangement with the Company or otherwise, including severance payments and acceleration of vesting or repurchase right lapse, or benefits under options or restricted stock). Such document shall be accompanied by a worksheet or memorandum from the Companys counsel demonstrating the extent (if any) to which such payments, vesting or benefits constituting "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code will or could be made to such disqualified individuals. If for any reason it will reasonably appear that a disqualified individual will receive an excess parachute payment, then the balance of this Section 4.18 will apply, in addition to any other rights and remedies Parent may have. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time of Merger, the Company will submit to, and use all reasonable efforts to obtain, a shareholder vote or written consent approving the right of any "disqualified individual" to receive or retain any and all payments that could be deemed "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code and the related waiver by such "disqualified individual" described in clause (b) below, on the following terms and conditions interpreted in a manner which complies with Section 280G of the Code and all applicable final, proposed or temporary regulations thereunder: (a) such payments so submitted for approval will be computed without reduction for any amounts which could otherwise be treated as excludable, reasonable compensation for services rendered before or after the Effective Time of the Merger under Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code; such payments will be calculated assuming all options and restricted stock are ultimately settled at the maximum FDA Milestone Consideration; such payments will be calculated including maximum severance potentially payable; such payments will not include post-merger base pay, performance bonus, company-paid employee benefits or other compensatory amounts paid or available for performance of post-merger services; (b) the 

     ##### 

  

    

shareholder approval will be timely solicited in form and substance and
pursuant to such disclosure as will be sufficient to satisfy the shareholder
approval requirements for the small business exemption of Section 280G(b)(5)
of the Code, including requirements that such disqualified individual waive
in advance the right to such payment if the requisite shareholder approval is
not obtained, and such payments will be separately approved within the
meaning of such regulations; and (c) for such approval to be effective as to
any such payment, 75% or more of the voting power of the Company will have
approved such payment without counting as outstanding or permitting to
vote (except as contemplated by Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1,
QandA-7(b)(4)) any stock (i) actually owned or constructively owned under
Section 318(a) of the Code by or for such disqualified individual, or (ii) as
to which the owner of such stock is considered under Section 318(a) of
the Code to own any part of the stock owned directly or indirectly by or for
such disqualified individual. 

   

 4.19 __Merger Consideration Distributions__. On the day before the anticipated Closing Date, Company will deliver a complete and correct list, in excel spreadsheet format, of (a) Company Shareholders as of the Closing Date, identifying each Company Shareholder by name, address, and the number of shares owned, the aggregate Closing Date Stock Per Share Consideration and Closing Date Cash Per Share Consideration issuable or payable to such shareholder, and share ownership information, including Company Certificate numbers, the number of whole shares represented by each Company Certificate, and the date of issuance for each Company Certificate, and (b) Company Option Holders as of the Closing Date, identifying each Company Option Holder by name, address, and the number of whole shares of Company Common Stock that are issuable upon full exercise of the Company Option (including the number of whole shares of Company Common Stock that are issuable upon conversion of all shares of Company Preferred Stock that are issuable upon exercise of a Company Option), the exercise price of each Company Option, and the aggregate Closing Date Stock Per Share Consideration and Closing Date Cash Per Share Consideration issuable or payable to such Company Option Holder; which such list will supersede and replace the similar list delivered to Parent as promptly as practicable after the date hereof and will be delivered by Parent to the Exchange Agent for use in distributing the Closing Date Stock Per Share Consideration and Closing Date Cash Per Share Consideration. 

  

 4.20 __Preparation and Filing of Form S-4__. In the event that the condition set forth in Section 5.2(f) has not been satisfied on or prior to July 10, 2009, then Parent may elect to have the provisions of this Section 4.20 apply by delivering written notice (the " _S-4 Notice_ ") of such election to the Company. If Parent delivers such S-4 Notice: 

  

 (a) The Company will promptly cease any and all actions that constitute directly or indirectly engaging or participating in any activities that reasonably could be deemed to have the effect of soliciting Company Shareholders and Company Option Holders with respect to the offer or issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by the Company Shareholders and Company Option Holders in the Merger or the approval of the Company Shareholders of the Merger until the Form S-4 has been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

   

 (b) After an appropriate period of time as determined by Parent upon advice of counsel so as not to cause Parent to be in violation of any federal or state securities laws or 

     ##### 

  

    

adversely affect Parents ability to register the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger not to exceed 30 days,
Parent will prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form
S-4 in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the
Merger (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Form
S-4_"). The Form S-4 shall include (i) a prospectus for the issuance of
shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger and (ii) the Company Shareholder
Materials (as may be amended as necessary or appropriate to reflect the
applicability of the provisions of this Section 4.20 and the fact that a
meeting of the Company Shareholders shall take place in lieu of the Proposed
Written Consent) (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the "
_Proxy Statement-Prospectus_ "). The Proxy Statement-Prospectus will include
the Company Board Recommendation in favor of this Agreement and the Merger and
the conclusion of the Company Board that the terms and conditions of the
Merger are in the best interests of the Company Shareholders. Company shall,
and shall cause its respective representatives to, fully cooperate with
Parent hereto and its respective representatives in the preparation of the
Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement-Prospectus, and shall furnish Parent with
all information concerning it and its affiliates as the Parent may deem
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the preparation of the
Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement-Prospectus, and any amendment or supplement
thereto, and Parent shall provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment thereon before it is filed with the SEC. 

   

 (c) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts in accordance with Applicable Law and Companys Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, as promptly as practicable under the Companys Bylaws and the CCC, a meeting of its shareholders (the " _Company Shareholder Meeting_ ") for the purpose of considering and voting upon the approval of the Company Shareholder Proposal. Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from the Company Shareholders proxies in favor of the Company Shareholder Proposal and to secure the Required Company Shareholder Vote. Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Shareholder Meeting are solicited in compliance with the CCC, Companys Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, and all other Applicable Laws. Company shall submit the Company Shareholder Proposal to the Company Shareholders at the Company Shareholder Meeting for the purpose of acting upon such proposal, whether or not the Company Boards fiduciary duties require the Company Board to change its Company Board Recommendation to the Company Shareholders. 

   

 (d) As promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective by the SEC, and regardless of whether or not the Company Boards fiduciary duties require the Company Board to change its Company Board Recommendation to the Company Shareholders, Company shall cause the Proxy Statement-Prospectus to be mailed to each of its shareholders and shall thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Required Company Shareholder Vote as soon as practicable.

Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of a party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. Any waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given and shall not constitute a waiver to any subsequent or other exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder. 

  

ARTICLE VII. 
 Indemnification 

   

 7.1 __Survival__. The parties agree that the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement (including those incorporated herein by reference) shall survive the Closing for a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending at 11:59 p.m., Minnesota time, on the date which is 18 months after the Closing Date (the " _Indemnity Termination Date_ "), except that the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1(b) (Capital Structure), 3.1(c) (Authority), 3.1(g) (Taxes), 3.1(i) (Benefit Matters), 3.1(p) (Environmental Matters) and 3.1(o) (Intellectual Property) shall survive until the later of (i) the Indemnity Termination Date, or (ii) the earlier of December 31, 2012 and the Milestone Achievement Date (the " _Extended Indemnity Termination Date_ " with respect to such Sections). The Indemnity Termination Date or Extended Indemnity Termination Date, as applicable, shall be subject to extension for any pending claims in respect of which Company has been provided notice in accordance with the provisions of this Article VII prior thereto and which remain unresolved until resolved in accordance herewith. 

  

 7.2 __Indemnification__. 

  

 (a) __General Indemnification Provisions__. Subject to Section 7.1, from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their respective affiliates, 

     ##### 

  

    

officers, directors, shareholders, representatives and agents (collectively
the " _Indemnitees_ ") shall be indemnified and held harmless by each Company
Shareholder and each Company Option Holder (each, an " _Indemnifying Party_
"), each of whom shall be severally liable only to the extent of
each Indemnifying Partys pro rata interest in the "Indemnification Reserve"
(as defined below), from and against and in respect of any and all Losses
incurred by, resulting from, arising out of, relating to, imposed upon or
incurred by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Indemnitee by
reason of (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of Companys representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or any
schedule, certificate or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto
or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby to the
extent the indemnifiable Losses with respect thereto exceed, in the aggregate,
the Loss Deductible and then only for the amount of indemnifiable Losses in
excess of the Loss Deductible, which indemnifiable Losses shall be calculated
without giving effect to any materiality or similar limitations or
qualifications herein or therein, (ii) any claim by a holder of shares
of Company Preferred Stock that are converted to Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time or that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that such a holder is entitled to any
consideration by virtue of such holding other than as provided in Article
II hereof, (iii) all Taxes of Company for any Taxable periods or portions
thereof ending on or before the Effective Time, except to the extent such
Taxes are included in Closing Indebtedness, (iv) any Negative Adjustment
Shortfall, (v) any amounts payable by the Company Shareholders to
the Accounting Firm pursuant to Section 2.5, and (vi) any and all reasonable
costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, in
connection with enforcing the indemnification rights of Parent pursuant to
this Section 7.2. After the Effective Time, the Indemnitees sole
and exclusive remedy for any Losses shall be the ability to seek indemnity
with respect to indemnifiable Losses from the Indemnification Reserve
pursuant to this Article VII. 

   

 (b) __Losses__. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Losses_ " means any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, diminution in value, interest, awards, judgments, penalties, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees, costs and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or defending the foregoing) asserted against, incurred, sustained or suffered by an Indemnitee. 

   

 (c) __Loss Deductible__. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Loss Deductible_ " means $200,000. 

   

 (d) __Indemnification Reserve__. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Indemnification Reserve_ " means a portion of the FDA Milestone Consideration equal to the lower of (I) fifteen million dollars ($15,000,000) and (II) the FDA Milestone Consideration. In the event that no FDA Milestone Consideration is payable, the Indemnification Reserve shall be zero. 

   

 7.3 __Satisfaction of Indemnifiable Losses After the Effective Time__. Parents right to indemnification after the Effective Time under Section 7.2(a) shall be satisfied solely through a set-off by Parent of any indemnifiable Losses it is entitled to recover under Section 7.2(a) against any payment of FDA Milestone Consideration owed to Milestone Payees pursuant to Section 2.3. Parent shall also be entitled to withhold from any payment of FDA Milestone Consideration, an amount equal to the amount of indemnifiable Losses for which Parent believes 

   ##### 

  

 

in good faith it is entitled to indemnification under Section 7.2(a), in
respect of which the Shareholder Representative has been provided notice,
which withheld amount shall be applied against indemnifiable Losses as and
when such indemnifiable Losses are determined in accordance with this Article
VII. In no event shall Parent be entitled to reduce the value of the FDA
Milestone Consideration that is set-off against indemnifiable Losses under
this Section 7.3 by more than the amount of the Indemnification Reserve, with
set-off being done in both cash and shares of Parent Common Stock in the same
ratio as such cash and shares comprise the Milestone Cash Consideration and
the Milestone Stock Consideration, respectively (with the value of any share
of Parent Common Stock determined by using the Deemed FDA Milestone Price).
The Indemnitees shall provide the Shareholder Representative with notice of
any set-off by Parent for any indemnifiable Losses, which will set forth the
basis for and amount of such indemnifiable Loss and right to set-off (an "
_Indemnification Set-off Notice_ "). The Shareholder Representative shall have
60 days after the receipt of an Indemnification Set-off Notice to review the
Indemnification Set-off Notice and assess the validity of Indemnitees claim
for set-off against the FDA Milestone Consideration (the " _Set-off Review
Period_ "). If, within the Set-off Review Period, the
Shareholder Representative disputes any claim for indemnification and set-off
by Parent against the FDA Milestone Consideration set forth in the
Indemnification Set-off Notice, the Shareholder Representative shall give
Parent written notice of such disagreement specifically identifying
the indemnifiable Losses and set-off amounts in dispute and the basis for
such dispute (the " _Set-off Dispute Notice_ "). The parties shall use
reasonable efforts to reach agreement with respect to such disputed items
within 30 days following the delivery of the Set-off Dispute Notice, or such
longer period as may be agreed upon in writing by the parties (the " _Set-
off Resolution Period_ "). Any indemnifiable Loss and set-off not
specifically identified in writing as a disputed item before the end of the
Set-off Review Period shall be deemed to have been accepted by the
Shareholder Representative and shall not be subject to any further dispute,
review or change. If the parties fail to resolve any such disputes with
respect to an indemnifiable Loss and set-off right set forth in an
Indemnification Set-off Notice within the Set-off Resolution Period, Parent
shall have the right to exercise such set-off and the Shareholder
Representative shall have the right to seek remedy in law in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement. 

   

 7.4 __Third-Party Claims__. With respect to any third-party claim that Parent believes, in good faith, may result in a demand by it for indemnification hereunder, the Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to participate, at his or her sole cost and expense, in any defense of such claim. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall conduct and control such defense, but shall not settle any such claim without the consent of the Shareholder Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, if such Shareholder Representative consent is so obtained, neither the Shareholder Representative nor any other Company Shareholder shall have any power or authority to object under any provision of this Article VII to the amount of any demand by Parent for indemnification (up to the amount of the Indemnification Reserve with respect to all Indemnifiable Losses) with respect to such settlement. 

  

 7.5 __Remedies__. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall have the right to seek any remedy in law or equity, including an action for breach of contract, in lieu of or in addition to any remedies provided in this Article VII. Furthermore, the Company understands that if the Company fails to fulfill the Companys obligations under this Agreement to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby the damages to Parent would be very difficult to determine. 

   ##### 

  

 

Therefore, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to the
Company at law, in equity, or by statute, the parties agree that Parent shall
be entitled to specific enforcement with respect to the Companys obligations
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to comply with the
Companys covenants related thereto, including, without limitation, Sections
4.6 and 4.7. 

   

 7.6 __Waiver of Defenses__. To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Indemnifying Party waives any claim or defense that the indemnification rights provided for in this Article VII are unenforceable under any provision of Applicable Law. 

  

 7.7 __Treatment of Indemnification Payments__. All indemnification payments made to Parent shall be, and shall be treated as, an adjustment to the Merger Consideration.
