and any discussions relating thereto shall be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule(s) and evidence of such discussions shall not be admissible in any future proceedings between the parties to
this Agreement. If, during such period, the Stockholder Representative and Parent are unable to reach agreement on all disputed items, they shall promptly thereafter mutually engage and submit such dispute to an Independent Accounting Firm for final
and binding resolution. The Independent Accounting Firm (i)&nbsp;shall consider only those items or amounts disputed by the Stockholder Representative in the Objection Notice which remain in dispute; (ii)&nbsp;shall not assign a value to any item or
amount in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item or amount assigned by the Stockholder Representative, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, or less than the smallest value for such item or amount assigned by the Stockholder
Representative, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand; and (iii)&nbsp;shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. The Independent Accounting Firm is not authorized to, and shall not, make any determination as to (1)&nbsp;whether the
Working Capital Target was properly calculated or calculated in accordance with GAAP (unless required by the Methodology determined in accordance with the Methodology Priority), (2) the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement, or (3)&nbsp;compliance by any party hereto with any of their respective covenants in this Agreement (other than those set forth in this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;2.9(c)</U>). The parties hereto acknowledge that the purpose of
preparing the Closing Statement and determining the Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Working Capital, Transaction Expenses and the related consideration adjustment contemplated by this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;2.9</U> is to (1)&nbsp;measure
the Closing Cash and Closing Indebtedness and (2)&nbsp;measure changes in Working Capital against the Working Capital Target, and such processes are not intended to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting policies, principles,
practices, techniques, categorizations, evaluation rules and procedures, methods and bases for the purpose of preparing the Closing Statement or determining Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, or Working Capital, and the Independent Accounting Firm
shall make its determinations in accordance with this purpose. The Independent Accounting Firm&#146;s determination will be based solely on presentations by the Stockholder Representative and Parent which are in accordance with the guidelines and
procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of independent review) and the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall cause the Independent Accounting Firm to deliver to the Stockholder Representative and Parent as promptly as
practicable (but in any event within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of its retention) a written report setting forth its determination of the amounts in dispute. Such report shall be final and binding on the parties. The cost of such review and report shall
be borne (and paid) by the Stockholder Representative (solely on behalf of the Company Equityholders), on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, based on the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears
to the amount actually contested by such party. For example, if closing accounts receivable is the only disputed item, and Parent claims that closing accounts receivable is $1,000 less than the amount determined by the Stockholder Representative,
and the Stockholder Representative contests only $500 of the amount claimed by Parent, and if the independent accountant ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Parent $300 of the $500 contested, then the cost of such review and report will be
allocated 60% (i.e., 300 &divide; 500) to the Stockholder Representative (solely on behalf of the Company Equityholders) and 40% (i.e., 200 &divide; 500) to Parent. </P>
