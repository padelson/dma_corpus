Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time, other than shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock to be
cancelled pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_ or Dissenting Shares, shall be
converted solely into the right to receive an amount equal to the product of
(A) _ multiplied by_ (B), where (A) is the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of such share of Company
Series A Preferred Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the First
Effective Time, and (B) is the Per Share Mixed Consideration, in each case,

payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof.

(d) _Effect on_ _Merger Sub_ _Equity_. Each limited liability company interest
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective
Time shall automatically be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the First
Surviving Company and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the First Surviving Company.

(e) _Reduction of Consideration_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a portion of
the consideration payable to each Stockholder pursuant to _Section_ __ _

intent of this _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ is to allocate the consideration payable
hereunder in accordance with the terms of the Companys

of effecting the payment of the consideration in connection with the First
Merger (other than with respect to compensatory payments for Tax
purposes) (the " _Paying Agent_ "). Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid,
the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender of Certificates_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the First Effective Time, the Company shall cause to be
delivered to Parent a letter validly executed by the Companys transfer agent,
eShares, Inc. DBA Carta, Inc. as to the cancellation (the " _Carta
Cancellation_ ") as of the First Effective Time of all electronic stock
certificates that immediately prior to the First Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (the " _Electronic Certificates_
"). As soon as practicable after the First Effective Time, to the extent not
previously delivered, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
Person that was, immediately prior to the First Effective Time, a holder of
record of Company Capital Stock, which shares of Company Capital Stock were
converted into the right to receive the consideration set forth in _Section_
__ _ 2.1_ at the First Effective Time, and who has not returned a Stock
Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent prior to the Closing Date: (A) a
letter of transmittal substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_
(a " _Stock Letter of Transmittal_ "); and (B) solely for holders of Company
Capital Stock holding physical certificates or instruments that immediately
prior to the First Effective Time represented issued and outstanding Company
Capital Stock (the " _Paper Certificates_ " and, together with the Electronic
Certificates, the " _Certificates_ " and each, a " _Certificate_ "),
instructions for effecting the surrender of such Paper Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of Paper Certificates and, if required, an
indemnification agreement as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_) in
exchange for payment of the consideration set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.1_.
Upon surrender of a Paper Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the
Certificate and, if required, an indemnification agreement as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_) to the Paying Agent or upon delivery of the Carta
Cancellation, as applicable, and upon delivery of a Stock Letter of
Transmittal, in accordance with the terms of such Stock Letter of
Transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such
Certificates, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the consideration set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ for
each share of Company Capital Stock formerly represented by such Certificate,
and any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled if not already
cancelled pursuant to the Carta Cancellation. If payment of such
consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
any surrendered Paper Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
precedent of payment that the Paper Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the consideration to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Paper Certificate so surrendered and shall
have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes either have
been paid or are not required to be paid. Until surrendered or cancelled as
contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
First Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the consideration
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, except for Certificates representing shares
of Company Capital Stock held by holders of Dissenting Shares, which shall be
deemed to represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such
shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with and to the extent provided
by Section 262 of the DGCL.

 



6

    

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in_ _Company Capital Stock_.
At the First Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and no transfer of shares of Company Capital Stock shall thereafter be
made. If, after the First Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Parent
or the First Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Agreement. From and after the First Effective
Time, each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the First Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as a
stockholder of the Company, except for, in the case of a holder of Company
Capital Stock (other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.1(c)_ or Dissenting Shares), the right to surrender such holders shares of
Company Capital Stock in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ in exchange
for the consideration set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, or in the case of a
holder of Dissenting Shares, the right to perfect such holders right to
receive payment pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No_ _Liability_. Any portion of
the funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) and shares of
Parent Stock made available to the Paying Agent that remains unclaimed by the
by the holders of Certificates on the first anniversary of the First
Effective Time will be returned to Parent or an Affiliate thereof designated
by Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not prior to such time
provided a duly executed Stock Letter of Transmittal to Parent or, if
applicable, has not tendered its Paper Certificates for the consideration set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 2_ _.1_ , in each case in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 2.2(b)_, shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) for delivery of such consideration,
without interest, in respect of such holders surrender of their Paper
Certificates in compliance with the procedures in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_.
Any consideration remaining unclaimed by the holders of Certificates
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or
become property of, any Governmental Authority will, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of Parent or an Affiliate thereof
designated by Parent, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
Merger Sub, Merger Sub II, the Surviving Companies, the Paying Agent or their
respective Affiliates will be liable to any holder of Certificates for
consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the consideration
made available to the Paying Agent to pay for shares of Company Capital Stock
for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent or
an Affiliate thereof designated by Parent upon demand.

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates representing fractional shares of
Parent Stock shall be issued in connection with the First Merger and
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of
a shareholder of Parent, but in lieu thereof, each holder of Company Capital
Stock, an Exercisable Warrant or an In-The-Money Option that would otherwise
be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Stock (after aggregating all
fractional shares of Parent Stock that otherwise would be received by such
holder) shall, upon surrender of such holders Paper Certificate (or in the
case of a lost, stolen or destroyed Paper Certificate, upon delivery of an
affidavit and, if required, an indemnification agreement as provided in 
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_), or receipt of the Carta Cancellation, as applicable,
receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent),
without interest, equal to the product of (i) such fraction _multiplied by_
(ii) the Parent Stock Value.

 



7

    

(f) _Lost, Stolen_ _or_ _Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Paper Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Paper
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.1_. Parent or the Paying Agent may, in their reasonable discretion and
as a condition precedent to the payment of such consideration, require the
owner of any lost, stolen or destroyed Paper Certificate to deliver an
indemnification agreement in such form and containing such substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable,
indemnifying Parent and/or the Paying Agent against any claim that may be
made against Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub II, the Surviving Companies or
the Paying Agent with respect to the Paper Certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject to
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_), shares of Company Capital Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time and held by a holder
who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such shares
of Company Capital Stock in accordance with, and who complies in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares of Company Capital Stock, the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
consideration set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 2.1_. At the First Effective
Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and the
holders of Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to the rights granted to
them under Section 262 of the DGCL, subject to the immediately following
sentence. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws
or loses such holders right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then
such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the
First Effective Time, into, and shall represent only, the right to receive
(upon surrender in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_) the consideration set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, without interest.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice
of any written demand for appraisal received by the Company pursuant to the
applicable provisions of the DGCL (and of any similar demand purportedly made
under other applicable Law) and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), make any
payment with respect to any such demands or offer to settle or settle
any such demands other than as required by Law or pursuant to a final court
order. Prior to the Closing Date, any written communication to be made by the
Company to any holder of Company Capital Stock with respect to such demands
shall be submitted to Parent in advance and the Company shall consider in
good faith any input from Parent with regards to such written communication.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Parent, either Surviving
Company or the Company makes any payment or payments in respect of any
Dissenting Shares in excess of the consideration that otherwise would have
been payable in respect of such shares in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1_
(" _Excess Dissenting Share Payments_ "), Parent shall be entitled to recover
the amount of such Excess Dissenting Share Payments in accordance with the
terms of _Article VII_ hereof.

2.4 _Treatment of_ _Company Options_ _._

 

(a) Immediately prior to the First Effective Time, for each Person who holds
any Company Option that is an In-The-Money Option, (i) if such Person is an
Accredited Investor, each outstanding In-The-Money Option then held by
such Person shall be cancelled and converted as of the First Effective Time
into the right to receive (A) an amount in cash equal to the Option/Warrant AI
Cash Consideration with respect to such In-The-Money Option, to be paid in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)_, and (B) a number of shares of Parent
Stock equal to the Option/Warrant AI Stock Consideration with respect to such
In-The-Money Option to be delivered in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.4(c)_, or (ii) if such Person is not an Accredited Investor,
each outstanding In-The-Money Option then held by such Person shall be
cancelled and converted as of the First Effective Time into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the Option/Warrant Non-AI Consideration
with respect to such In-The-Money Option, to be paid in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)_ with respect to such In-The-Money Option. Each Company
Option that is an Out-Of-The-Money Option, if any, whether vested or unvested,
shall be cancelled and forfeited for no consideration.

 

(b) Each Company Option that is outstanding and unvested (after taking into
account any accelerated vesting that occurs immediately prior to, or in
connection with, the First Effective Time) and is not an Out-Of-The-Money
Option as of the First Effective Time (the " _Unvested Options_ ") shall, as
of the First Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into an option to
purchase Parent Stock (the " _Assumed Options_ ") under the Parent Plan on
the terms and conditions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_.
Accordingly, from and after the First Effective Time, (i) each Assumed Option
may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Stock; (ii) the number of shares
of Parent Stock subject to each Assumed Option shall equal the product of (A)
such number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such
Assumed Option immediately prior to the First Effective Time _multiplied by_
(B) the Exchange Ratio and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Stock; and (iii) the per share exercise price
for the shares of Parent Stock issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Option
shall equal the quotient of (X) the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Assumed Option immediately prior to the First Effective
Time divided by (Y) the Exchange Ratio and rounding the resulting exercise
price up to the nearest whole cent. The conversion and assumption of Assumed
Options hereunder is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code and the
applicable regulations thereunder (including Treas. Reg. Section
1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D)) and, for the avoidance of doubt, each Assumed Option
shall continue to have and be governed by the same terms and conditions as
were applicable immediately prior to the First Effective Time, including the
expiration date, vesting conditions and exercise rights, except for
administrative changes or changes resulting from the Assumed Options being
subject to the Parent Plan, in each case, that are not materially adverse to
the holder of such Assumed Option or to which the holder consents. For the
avoidance of doubt, Parent may also elect to convert and assume (on the same
basis set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_) the share reserve available
under the Company Equity Plan as of the First Effective Time into the Parent
Plan to the extent permitted under and in accordance with applicable law.

 



9

    

(c) From and after the First Effective Time, the former holder of any Company
Option (other than holders of Assumed Options, which shall be treated in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_) shall have no further rights with
respect to Company Options, other than the right to receive payment in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)_. No later than the Second Surviving
Companys first ordinary payroll payment date that is at least three (3)
Business Days after the Closing, Parent shall cause to be paid or delivered to
each former holder of In-The-Money Options that is an Employee Optionholder
the applicable Option/Warrant Consideration to be paid or delivered to such
former holder of In-The-Money Options pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)_ as
set forth on the Closing Consideration Schedule (less the amount to be
deposited into the escrow accounts pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.8_), the
cash portion of which (in the aggregate, the " _Employee Option Cash Amount_
") shall be paid through the payroll system of Parent or a Subsidiary of
Parent subject to applicable Tax withholding in respect of the entire
applicable Option/Warrant Consideration payable to such former holder of In-
The-Money Options.

 

(d) Prior to the First Effective Time, the board of directors of the Company
(or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all other actions reasonably necessary or appropriate
(including obtaining any required consents) to effect the transactions
described in this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, and to ensure that, following
the First Effective Time, no former holder of a Company Option shall have any
right to acquire any Company Capital Stock or to receive any payment, right or
benefit with respect to any award previously granted under the Company Equity
Plan, except the right to receive a payment with respect thereto as provided
in this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.9_,
or the Assumed Options, as applicable.

 

(e) Parent shall file with the SEC, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor
form), if available for use by Parent (or, if Form S-8 is not available, other
appropriate forms as may be required under applicable Law) relating to
the shares of Parent Stock issuable with respect to the Assumed Options and
(if applicable) the assumed and converted share reserve available under the
Company Equity Plan in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_.

 

2.5 _Treatment of Company Warrants_. Immediately prior to the First Effective
Time, (a) each Company Warrant then outstanding that is an Exercisable
Warrant shall be cancelled and converted as of the First Effective Time into
the right to receive (i) an amount in cash equal to the Option/Warrant AI Cash
Consideration with respect to such Exercisable Warrant, and (ii) a number of
shares of Parent Stock equal to the Option/Warrant AI Stock Consideration with
respect to such Exercisable Warrant, and (b) each Company Warrant then
outstanding that is not an Exercisable Warrant, shall be cancelled and
forfeited for no consideration in accordance with the terms of such Company
Warrant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a portion of the cash consideration
payable to each holder of an Exercisable Warrant pursuant to the foregoing
sentence shall be reduced pursuant to the escrow provisions of _Section_ __ _
2.8_ hereof and shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein. From and
after the First Effective Time, the former holder of any Company Warrant shall
have no further rights with respect to Company Warrants, other than the right
to receive payment in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_.

 



10

    

2.6 _Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration;_ _Parent Stock_ _._

 

(a) _Estimated_ _Aggregate Merger Consideration_. At least three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
statement (the " _Estimated_ _Closing_ _Statement_ ") setting forth (i) the
Companys good faith estimate of (A) the Transaction Expenses (the "
_Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "), (B) the Closing Indebtedness (the "
_Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ "), (C) the Closing Cash (the " _Estimated
Closing Cash_ ") and (D) the Working Capital (the " _Estimated
Working Capital_ "), and based thereon the calculation of the Estimated
Aggregate Merger Consideration and (ii) wire instructions for repayment of the
Estimated Transaction Expenses. The Estimated Closing Statement shall be
accompanied by a schedule showing the Companys reasonably detailed
calculation of the items set forth thereon. The Company shall consider in good
faith, and, in the sole discretion of the Company, update the Estimated
Closing Statement to reflect, any comments by Parent on such Estimated
Closing Statement. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Estimated_
_Aggregate Merger Consideration_ " means an amount equal to (1) $192,000,000
(the " _Base Consideration Amount_ ");  _minus_ (2) the Estimated Transaction
Expenses; _minus_ (3) the Estimated Closing Indebtedness; _plus_ (4) the
Estimated Closing Cash; _plus_ (5) the amount (if any) by which Estimated
Working Capital exceeds the Working Capital Target; _minus_ (6) the amount
(if any) by which the Working Capital Target exceeds the Estimated Working
Capital; _plus_ (7) the Aggregate Exercise Amount. The Estimated Aggregate
Merger Consideration shall be calculated consistent with (x) definitions
herein and the methodologies, practices and principles used in the preparation
of the illustrative calculation set forth on _Exhibit J_ , (y) the
methodologies, practices and principles used in the preparation of the
Companys financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, and (z)
GAAP (clauses, (x) through (z), the " _Methodology_ "). In the event of any
conflict, (1) first, the definitions herein and the methodologies, practices
and principles used in the preparation of the illustrative calculation set
forth on _Exhibit J_ shall control, (2) second, the methodologies, practices
and principles used in the preparation of the Companys financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2019, and (3) lastly, GAAP (the " _Methodology
Priority_ "). The Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration shall be subject to
adjustment as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.9_. The Estimated Aggregate
Merger Consideration shall be paid in both cash (subject to adjustment as
provided herein) and the Total Parent Shares in accordance with the provisions
of  _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, _Section_ __ _ 2.2,_ _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ and
_Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_.

 

(b) _Parent Stock_.

(i) The total number of shares of Parent Stock issuable by Parent as
consideration in the First Merger shall be determined by dividing (A) an
amount equal to $102,000,000 (the " _Base Stock Consideration Amount_ ") by
(B) the Parent Stock Value, rounded up to the nearest share of Parent Stock
(the " _Total Parent Shares_ "). The Total Parent Shares shall be paid in
accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.1_,  _Section_ __ _
2.2_, _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_. If at any time between
the date of this Agreement and the First Effective Time, any change in the
number of issued or outstanding shares of Parent Stock shall occur as a
result of a reclassification, recapitalization, share split (including a
reverse share split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any share dividend or share distribution (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into shares of Parent Stock) with a
record date during such period, the amount of the Total Parent Shares shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change and, if such change occurs after
the date on which the Parent Stock Value is calculated, the Parent Stock Value
shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change as well.

 



11

    

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall Parent be required to issue shares of Parent Stock if such issuance
would require Parent to obtain shareholder approval under NASDAQ Select Market
Listing Rule 5635(a) and if for the foregoing reason, the number of shares of
Parent Stock to be issued pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(b)(i) _is reduced
by any amount, then the Base Cash Consideration Amount shall be increased by
an amount equal to the corresponding decrease of the Base Stock Consideration
Amount required to effect the foregoing, but for the avoidance of doubt, the
Base Consideration Amount shall remain unchanged.

2.7 _Closing Consideration Schedule_ _._ At least three (3) Business Days

Option/Warrant Consideration, if any, to be delivered to such holder of
Company Warrants in respect of each Company Warrant held by such holder of
Company Warrants, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_, including the cash
amount and number of shares of Parent Stock (which shall be rounded down to
the nearest share of Parent Stock, together with the amount of cash to be
paid in lieu of any fractional shares rounded down to the nearest whole cent)
to be delivered to each holder of Company Warrants;

amount of cash in excess of the Base Cash Consideration Amount (subject to
adjustment as set forth in _Sections 2.6_ and _2.9_ ) or issue a number of
shares of Parent Stock in excess of the Total Parent Shares hereunder to the
Stockholders and holders of In-The-Money Options and Exercisable Warrants plus
shares of Parent Stock, if any, to be issued upon exercise of the Assumed
Options and cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.2(e)_.

2.8 _Escrows_.

 

(a) In order to satisfy, and to establish a procedure for the satisfaction of,
amounts owed to Parent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.9_, Parent, the
Stockholder Representative and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (or such other
reputable escrow agent reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Stockholder
Representative) (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") shall enter into the Escrow
Agreement on the Closing Date substantially in the form attached hereto as

deposit with the Escrow Agent in an escrow account established by the Escrow
Agent (the " _Adjustment Escrow Account_ ") $3,840,000 in cash on the Closing
Date (the " _Closing Date Adjustment Escrow Amount_ "). Parent shall be deemed
to have contributed the percentage of the Closing Date Adjustment Escrow
Amount with respect to each Participating Equityholder as set forth on the
Closing Consideration Schedule and the cash consideration payable to each
Participating Equityholder pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, _Section_ __ _
2.4_, or _Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_, as applicable, shall be reduced by such
amount. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Adjustment Escrow Amount_ "
means, as of any

 



13

    

 moment in time, the amount of cash then in the Adjustment Escrow Account.
The timing and methodology for the release of the Adjustment Escrow Amount
shall be governed by the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of
Parent and the Stockholder Representative agrees that it will act in good
faith and cooperate with one another to execute and deliver such joint
written instructions, including with respect to any distributions of the
Adjustment Escrow Amount, to the Escrow Agent as are required to implement the
intent of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. If any funds remain in
the Adjustment Escrow Account after all payments have been made pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.9(d)_, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall
promptly jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver to the Paying Agent, for
further distribution to the Participating Equityholders (other than holders
of In-The-Money Options), and Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent, for further
distribution to the holders of In-The-Money Options through the payroll
system of Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent subject to applicable Tax
withholding, the remaining Adjustment Escrow Amount. The Escrow Agreement
shall provide that Parent be treated as the owner of the Closing Date
Adjustment Escrow Amount for U.S. federal income tax purposes ( _provided_
that the Parent shall be entitled to distributions in respect of Taxes on any
interest, gains and other income earned on the Closing Date Adjustment Escrow
Amount in accordance with the Escrow Agreement). In the event of a
distribution of any amounts from the Adjustment Escrow Account to the
Participating Equityholders, each Participating Equityholder shall be
entitled to receive a percentage of such distribution equal to the percentage
set forth with respect to such Participating Equityholder on the Closing
Consideration Schedule.

 

(b) In order to satisfy, and to establish a procedure for the satisfaction of,
amounts owed to Parent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.9(d)_ or claimed by the

escrow account established by the Escrow Agent (the " _Indemnity Escrow
Account_ ") $9,600,000 in cash on the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date
Indemnity Escrow Amount_ "). Parent shall be deemed to have contributed the
percentage of the Closing Date Indemnity Escrow Amount with respect to each
Participating Equityholder as set forth on the Closing Consideration Schedule
and the cash consideration payable to each Participating Equityholder pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_,  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_, as
applicable, shall be reduced by such amount. As used in this Agreement, the
term " _Indemnity Escrow Amount_ " means, as of any moment in time,
the amount of cash then in the Indemnity Escrow Account. The timing and
methodology for the release of the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be governed
by the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that each of Parent and the
Stockholder Representative agrees that it will act in good faith and cooperate
with one another to execute and deliver such joint written instructions,
including with respect to any distributions of the Indemnity Escrow Amount,
to the Escrow Agent as are required to implement the intent of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement. Within five (5) Business Days after the twelve (12)
month anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver to the
Paying Agent, for further distribution to the Participating Equityholders
(other than holders of In-The-Money Options), and Parent or a Subsidiary of
Parent, for further distribution to the holders of In-The-Money
Options through the payroll system of Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent
subject to applicable Tax withholding, the remaining Indemnity Escrow Amount
minus the Pending Claims Amount. The Escrow Agreement shall provide that
Parent be treated as the owner of the Indemnity Escrow Amount for U.S.
federal income tax purposes

 



14

    

 ( _provided_ that the Parent shall be entitled to distributions in respect
of Taxes on any interest, gains and other income earned on the Closing Date
Adjustment Escrow Amount in accordance with the Escrow Agreement). In the
event of a distribution of any amounts from the Indemnity Escrow Account to
the Participating Equityholders, each Participating Equityholder shall be
entitled to receive a percentage of such distribution equal to the percentage
set forth with respect to such Participating Equityholder on the Closing
Consideration Schedule.

2.9 _Post-_ _Closing _ _Adjustments to the_ _Estimated_ _Aggregate Merger
Consideration_.

(a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than ninety (90) days following
the Closing Date, Parent will prepare and deliver to the Stockholder
Representative a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth
Parents good faith calculation of (i) the Transaction Expenses, (ii) the
Closing Indebtedness, (iii) the Closing Cash, (iv) the Working Capital, and
(v) based thereon, a calculation of the Aggregate Merger Consideration in
accordance with the Methodology and the Methodology Priority.

(b) During the thirty (30) days after delivery of the Closing Statement,
Parent will provide the Stockholder Representative and its accountants
reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to
(x) review the financial books and records of the Second Surviving Company,
any of Parents accountants work papers related to the calculation of
amounts in the Closing Statement (subject to the execution of any access
letters that such accountants may reasonably require in connection with the
review of such work papers), and (y) the employees and other representatives
of Parent who were responsible for the preparation of the Closing Statement
to respond to questions relating to the preparation of the Closing Statement
and the calculation of the items thereon, in each case solely to allow the
Stockholder Representative to determine the accuracy of Parents calculation
of the items set forth on the Closing Statement. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to provide information or access to
information, materials or persons if doing so would reasonably be expected to
(i) unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of Parents or any of its
Subsidiaries business, (ii) result in the waiver of any attorney-client
privilege or the disclosure of any trade secrets or (iii) violate any Law or
breach the terms of any applicable Contract to which Parent or any of its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries is party. If the Stockholder Representative
disagrees with any of Parents calculations set forth in the Closing
Statement, the Stockholder Representative may, within thirty (30) days after
delivery of the Closing Statement, deliver a written notice (the " _Objection
Notice_ ") to Parent disagreeing with such calculations. Any Objection Notice
shall specify those items or amounts with which the Stockholder Representative
disagrees, together with a reasonably detailed written explanation of the
reasons for disagreement with each such item or amount, and shall set forth
the Stockholder Representatives calculation, based on such objections, of the
Transaction Expenses, the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Cash and the
Working Capital, and based thereon a calculation of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration along with reasonable supporting documentation. To the
extent not set forth in the Objection Notice, the Stockholder Representative
shall be deemed to have agreed with Parents calculation of all other items
and amounts contained in the Closing Statement and such amounts shall be
final and binding on the parties. If the Stockholder Representative does not
deliver an Objection Notice within such thirty-day period, then the amounts
set forth in the Closing Statement shall be deemed to be final and binding on
the parties.

 



15

    

(c) If an Objection Notice is timely delivered pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
2.9(b)_, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall, during the thirty
(30) days following such delivery, use their reasonable best efforts to reach
agreement on the value of the disputed items or amounts, and any discussions
relating thereto shall be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence and any applicable similar state rule(s) and evidence of such
discussions shall not be admissible in any future proceedings between the
parties to this Agreement. If, during such period, the Stockholder
Representative and Parent are unable to reach agreement on all disputed items,
they shall promptly thereafter mutually engage and submit such dispute to an
Independent Accounting Firm for final and binding resolution. The Independent
Accounting Firm (i) shall consider only those items or amounts disputed by the
Stockholder Representative in the Objection Notice which remain in dispute;
(ii) shall not assign a value to any item or amount in dispute greater than
the greatest value for such item or amount assigned by the Stockholder
Representative, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, or less than
the smallest value for such item or amount assigned by the
Stockholder Representative, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand;
and (iii) shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. The Independent
Accounting Firm is not authorized to, and shall not, make any determination as
to (1) whether the Working Capital Target was properly calculated or
calculated in accordance with GAAP (unless required by the Methodology
determined in accordance with the Methodology Priority), (2) the accuracy of
the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, or (3)
compliance by any party hereto with any of their respective covenants in this
Agreement (other than those set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.9(c)_). The
parties hereto acknowledge that the purpose of preparing the Closing
Statement and determining the Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Working
Capital, Transaction Expenses and the related consideration adjustment
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.9_ is to (1) measure the Closing Cash
and Closing Indebtedness and (2) measure changes in Working Capital against
the Working Capital Target, and such processes are not intended to permit the
introduction of different judgments, accounting policies,
principles, practices, techniques, categorizations, evaluation rules and
procedures, methods and bases for the purpose of preparing the Closing
Statement or determining Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, or Working
Capital, and the Independent Accounting Firm shall make its determinations in
accordance with this purpose. The Independent Accounting Firms determination
will be based solely on presentations by the Stockholder Representative and
Parent which are in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth
in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of independent review) and the
Stockholder Representative and Parent shall cause the Independent Accounting
Firm to deliver to the Stockholder Representative and Parent as promptly
as practicable (but in any event within thirty (30) days of its retention) a
written report setting forth its determination of the amounts in dispute. Such
report shall be final and binding on the parties. The cost of such review and
report shall be borne (and paid) by the Stockholder Representative (solely on
behalf of the Company Equityholders), on the one hand, and Parent, on the
other hand, based on the percentage which the portion of the contested amount
not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by such
party. For example, if closing accounts receivable is the only disputed item,
and Parent claims that closing accounts receivable is $1,000 less than the
amount determined by the Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder
Representative contests only $500 of the amount claimed by Parent, and if the
independent accountant ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Parent $300
of the $500 contested, then the cost of such review and report will
be allocated 60% (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to the Stockholder Representative (solely
on behalf of the Company Equityholders) and 40% (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to Parent.

 



16

    

(d) If the Aggregate Merger Consideration, as finally determined pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.9_, is less than the Estimated Aggregate Merger
Consideration, then, within five (5) Business Days of the final determination
of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver to Parent
the amount of such difference from the Adjustment Escrow Account; _provided_ ,
that if the Adjustment Escrow Amount is insufficient to cover the full amount
of the difference, then Parent shall be entitled to recover such shortfall
from the Indemnity Escrow Account beyond which no Participating Equityholder
shall have any liability or obligation with respect to such shortfall. If the
Aggregate Merger Consideration, as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.9_, is greater than the Estimated Aggregate Merger
Consideration, then the amount of such excess shall be paid in cash within
five (5) Business Days of the final determination of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration by Parent (i) to the Paying Agent, for further distribution to
the Participating Equityholders (other than holders of In-The-Money Options)
and (ii) to the holders of In-The-Money Options through the payroll system of
Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent subject to applicable Tax withholding, in
each case based on percentages specified on the Closing Consideration
Schedule.

 

2.10 _Withholding Rights_. Merger Sub, Parent, the First Surviving Company,
the Second Surviving Company and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement, such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the
Treasury Regulations or under any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign Tax Law; _provided_ , _however_ , assuming the Company complies with
its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)(x)_, if either the Merger Sub,
Parent, the First Surviving Company, the Second Surviving Company or the
Paying Agent (as applicable) determines that it is obligated to deduct or
withhold any amounts from any non-compensatory consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement (other than in respect of
backup withholding), such Person shall (i) provide such payee with prior
written notice of its intent to deduct and withhold (together with information
setting forth the amount and reason for such deduction or withholding), and
(ii) afford such payee a reasonable opportunity to reduce or eliminate such
deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority by Merger Sub,
Parent, the First Surviving Company, the Second Surviving Company or the
Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any
compensatory payments for Tax purposes payable pursuant to or as contemplated
by this Agreement shall be paid through the payroll system of Parent or
a Subsidiary of Parent subject to applicable Tax withholding. For the
avoidance of doubt, any such amount withheld shall reduce the cash
consideration payable to such Company Equityholder regardless of whether the
withholding is in respect of cash or equity consideration payable hereunder.

 



17

    

2.11 _Second Merger Conversion of Securities_. At the Second Effective Time,
by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
the First Surviving Company or Merger Sub II:

(a) Each limited liability company interest of Merger Sub II issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be cancelled
and retired and shall cease to exist.

 

(b) Each share of common stock of the First Surviving Company issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be converted
into one limited liability company interest of the Second Surviving Company.

Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act, with respect to the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days
after the date that the Company or its representatives has provided Parent or

legal conditions that would be binding on the Company or any of its

the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and nothing in this
Agreement shall require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to commit to or
take any action with respect to the assets or businesses of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries. Any materials required to be provided by a party to another

(i) a written consent (or written consents) of the Stockholders holding (i) at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and Company
Series A Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class) adopting this
Agreement and approving the First Merger in accordance with Delaware Law and
the Companys Organizational Documents in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
H_ (" _Company Written Consent_ ") and (ii) the Voting and Support Agreements
executed by Stockholders, including each holder of Company Series A Preferred

deliver to any Stockholder who has not executed the Company Written Consent a
notice of the actions taken pursuant to the Company Written Consent that
complies with the requirements of Section 228(e) of the DGCL, which notice
shall also constitute and include the notice required by Section 262 of the
DGCL that appraisal or similar rights may be available to the Stockholders who
did not execute the Company Written Consent (the " _Stockholder Notice_ ").
The Stockholder Notice, as well as any information statement prepared by the
Company in which the Stockholder Notice shall be included, shall be subject to
review and approval by Parent which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed and the Company shall consider in good faith any comments proposed by
Parent to the draft Stockholder Notice.

6.5 _Accredited Investor Certifications_. Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub II
and the Company acknowledge and agree that, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.7_,
the shares of Parent Stock to be issued as consideration in the First Merger
will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in
reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public
offering. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a
Company Equityholder who is not a party to a Voting and Support Agreement
shall be entitled to receive Parent Stock in connection with the First Merger
only if such Company Equityholder is (a) an accredited investor within the
meaning of SEC Rule 501 of Regulation D, as presently in effect, under the
Securities Act and (b) provides an executed accredited investor questionnaire
in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit I_ (an " _Accredited
Investor Questionnaire_ ") no later than 6:00 pm Eastern Time on August 28,
2020 (the " _Accredited Investor Questionnaire Deadline_ "). Each Accredited
Investor Questionnaire shall also contain restrictions on the resale of the
Parent Stock consistent with the restrictions set forth in the form of Voting
and Support Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company shall, as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in any event
within five (5) Business Days of the date hereof), deliver to each (i)
Company Equityholder who is not a party to a Voting and Support Agreement and
(ii) each holder of a Company Warrant, an Accredited Investor Questionnaire to
be completed by such Person and returned to Parent by the Accredited
Investor Questionnaire Deadline. If any Company Equityholder, holder of a
Company Warrant delivers an Accredited Investor Questionnaire to the Company,
the Company shall promptly deliver a copy of such Accredited Investor
Questionnaire to Parent. Any Company Equityholder that does not execute and
deliver a Voting and Support Agreement or an Accredited Investor Questionnaire
by the Accredited Investor Questionnaire Deadline certifying such Company
Equityholders status as an Accredited

 



56

    

 Investor shall, for all purposes of this Agreement, be deemed not to be an
Accredited Investor; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company has a good
faith and reasonable basis to believe that any Company Equityholder is an
Accredited Investor based on the compensation paid to such Company
Equityholder by the Company or the value of the Company Capital Stock held by
such Company Equityholder, the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any
such Company Equityholder.

6.6 _Warrants_. The Company shall, as promptly as possible after the date of
this Agreement (but in any event within five (5) Business Days of the date
hereof), deliver to each holder of a Company Warrant a notice of the First
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as required
pursuant to the terms of each such warrant.

6.7 _Parent Shelf Registration Statement_.

 

(a) On the Closing Date following the First Effective Time, assuming Parent is
a WKSI as of such date, Parent shall file with the SEC an automatic shelf
registration statement (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) on
Form S-3 (a " _Shelf Registration Statement_ ") relating to the offer and sale
of Parent Stock by any Company Equityholders from time to time in accordance
with the methods of distribution elected by such Company Equityholders (but
excluding any underwritten offering or underwritten block trade), and Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Shelf Registration
Statement to become automatically effective under the Securities Act. The
Company shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Shelf Registration Statement before it is filed with the SEC, and Parent
shall consider in good faith any comments from the Company.

(b) If Parent is not a WKSI on the Closing Date or at any time prior to the
three-year anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall file a registration
statement on Form S-3 if available or, if Form S-3 is not available, on any
applicable form pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, relating to
the offer and sale of Parent Stock by Company Equityholders. The Company (if
prior to the Closing) or the Stockholder Representative (if after the
Closing), as applicable, shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such registration statement before it is filed with the SEC,
and Parent shall consider in good faith any comments from the Company or the
Stockholder Representative, as applicable.

 

6.8 _Tax Matters_.

(a)  _Tax Returns_.

(i) The Company shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared or
timely filed, all Tax Returns in respect of any member of the Company Group
that are required to be filed (taking into account any extension) on or before
the Closing Date, and shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes of the Company
Group due on or before the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared
by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with past
practices of such member, except as required by applicable Law. At least
fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for filing any material income Tax
Return described in this _Section_ __ _ 6.8(a)(i)_, the Company shall
deliver a draft copy of such Tax Return to Parent for Parents review.

 



57

    

(ii) Parent shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns for each member of the Company Group for any periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are filed after the Closing Date
and all Tax Returns for the Company Group for any Straddle Periods (each, a "
_Post-Closing Tax Return_ "). Such Post-Closing Tax Returns shall be prepared
on a basis consistent with the most recent Tax Returns of the applicable
member of the Company Group, except as required by applicable Law. Not later
than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for filing of any such Post-
Closing Tax Returns that show Taxes due and that could give rise to any
liability that is recoverable pursuant to _Article VII_ of this Agreement
(taking into account, for the avoidance of doubt, the limitations on
indemnification included in this Agreement, including the availability of
amounts in the Indemnity Escrow Account (the " _Indemnity Limits_ ")), Parent
shall provide the Stockholder Representative with drafts of such Post-Closing
Tax Returns at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the due date for
filing such Post-Closing Tax Returns. Parent shall incorporate any comments
reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative in writing provided to
Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior to the due date of such Post-
Closing Tax Returns. To the extent the Parent disagrees with any such comments
provided by the Stockholder Representative, any disagreement with respect to
such comments have not been resolved, the principles of _Section_ __ _ 2.9_
shall apply thereto. Any payments of Taxes due with respect to Post-Closing
Tax Returns not otherwise taken into account in Working Capital shall be paid
from the Indemnity Escrow Account.

(iii) For purposes of this Agreement, the portion of Taxes payable for any
Straddle Period allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be (A) in the
case of Property Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period _multiplied by_ a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days of such Straddle Period in the Pre-Closing Tax Period
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period and (B) in the case of all other Taxes, determined as though
the taxable year of the Company terminated at the close of business on the
Closing Date, except that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall
be apportioned on a time basis. If any party (the " _Paying Party_ ") pays or
has paid a Tax for which the other party (the " _Non-Paying Party_") is
responsible pursuant to the apportionment set forth in this _Section_ __ _
6.8(a)(iii)_, the Paying Party shall be entitled to reimbursement from the
Non-Paying Party.

 

(iv) Except as specifically provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.8(a)(ii)_ or after
the Indemnity Escrow Amount has been reduced to $0 or released pursuant to
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates shall (or after the Closing, shall cause or permit either Surviving
Company to) (A) file (other than as set forth in  _Section_ __ _
6.8(a)(ii)_), amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return of the Company
and its Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period; (B) initiate
or enter into any voluntary disclosure agreement or program with any Tax
authority with respect to the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period; (C) make
or change any Tax election of the Company that has retroactive effect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period; or (D) make an election under Section 338 of the Code
(or similar provisions of state, local or foreign law) with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case to the without the
prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



58

    

(b) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 

(i) Parent, the First Surviving Company, the Second Surviving Company and the
Stockholder Representative shall reasonably cooperate, as and to the extent
reasonably requested in writing by the other party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement and any Tax Contest (as
defined below).

 

(ii) Parent, the First Surviving Company, the Second Surviving Company and the
Stockholder Representative further agree, upon prior written request, to use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from
any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but
not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all transfer,
stamp, documentary, registration, recording, value-added and other similar
Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer Taxes) incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby ("
_Transfer Taxes_ ") and all expenses of filing Tax Returns with respect to
such Taxes will be borne one-half by Parent and one-half by the Participating
Equityholders (as a Transaction Expense). Each Person required by applicable
law agrees to file, or cause to be filed, in a timely manner all necessary
documents (including, but not limited to, all Tax Returns) with respect to
such Transfer Taxes.

(d) _Tax Contests_.

 

(i) Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall promptly notify each other
in writing upon receipt by such party or any of their respective Affiliates
of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign
audits, examinations, claims, assessments or administrative or court
proceeding relating to Taxes of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (a
" _Tax Contest_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to promptly
notify the Stockholder Representative shall not limit Parents
indemnification obligations pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent
that any delay in notification actually and materially prejudices the other
party.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding _Article_ __ _ VII_, subject to the consent rights of
any insurer or any other limitations in the RandW Insurance Policy, to the
extent the Participating Equityholders could be held liable for a majority of
the Taxes with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods arising as a result of the
relevant Tax Contest under the provisions of this Agreement (and taking into
account the RandW Insurance Policy and the Indemnity Limits), then:

 

(A) the Stockholder Representative shall have the right, in good faith, to
control and to direct such Tax Contest and to employ counsel of its own
choice for such purpose; _provided_ , _however_ , Parent shall be entitled to
participate at its expense in or with respect to any such Tax Contest. The
Stockholder Representative shall have the right to settle or compromise, or
agree to settle or compromise, either administratively or after the
commencement of litigation, any Tax Contest for any Tax Contest that it is
entitled to control under this _Section_ __ _ 6.8(d)(ii)(A)_;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , no such settlement, compromise or agreement shall be effectuated
without Parents prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 



59

    

(B) Parent and Stockholder Representative shall have the right, in
good faith, to jointly control and to represent the interests of the Company
in and with respect to any Tax Contest for any Straddle Period; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither party may settle or compromise, or agree to settle or
compromise, either administratively or after the commencement of litigation,
any Tax Contest for any Straddle Period without the prior written consent of
both parties, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

 

(iii) Parent shall control all other proceedings in respect Taxes of each
member of the Company Group and the Stockholder Representative shall have no
right to participate in any such proceedings.

(e) _Tax Status_. __

 

(i) The parties intend, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that the Mergers
will be treated as an integrated plan that will qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and this Agreement is hereby
adopted as a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-2(g). The parties agree to report the Mergers as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, unless
otherwise required pursuant to a final determination as defined in Section
1313 of the Code.

(ii) Parent makes no representations or warranties to the Company or to any
Company Equityholder or other Person regarding the Tax treatment of the
Mergers, or any of the Tax consequences to the Company or to any Company
Equityholder or other Person of this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the
other transactions or agreements contemplated hereby. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that the Company is relying solely on its own Tax
advisors in connection with this Agreement, the Mergers, and the other
transactions and agreements contemplated hereby.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Article VII_ or otherwise in
this Agreement, the Participating Equityholders shall not be liable under
_Article VII_ or otherwise in this Agreement (including via the Indemnity
Escrow Account) with respect to (and Parent shall pay or cause to be paid) (w)
any Taxes that were taken into account in the calculation of Working Capital,
(x) Taxes incurred by the Surviving Companies, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates as a result of actions outside the ordinary course of
business not otherwise contemplated by this Agreement taken after the Closing
on the Closing Date, (y) any Taxes arising as a result of a breach by Parent,
the Surviving Companies or any of their Affiliates of _Section_ __ _ 6.8(a)_
and _Section_ __ _ 6.8(d)_ or (z) Taxes of the Company incurred after the
Closing Date (other than in respect of a breach of _Section_ __ _ 4.22(h)_,
_(i)_ or _(m)_ ).

 



60

    

(g) _Tax Refunds_.

 

(i) Any expected Tax refunds as described in _Section_ __ _ 6.8(g)(i)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule that are received by Parent or the Surviving Companies
shall be for the account of the Participating Equityholders. Following the
Closing, Parent, Surviving Company and their respective Affiliates shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any Tax refunds to
which the Participating Equityholders would be entitled pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.8(g)(i)_.

(ii) Until the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, any Tax
refunds (other than those described in _Section_ __ _ 6.8(g)(i)_) that are
received by Parent or the Surviving Companies that relate to Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be for the account of the Participating Equityholders except to
the extent that (i) such refund was reflected as an asset in Working Capital,
(ii) such refund arises as a result of a carryback of any net operating loss
or capital loss arising in a tax period (or portion thereof) ending after the
Closing Date or (iii) any such Tax refund is attributable to an adjustment
that results in an increase in the taxable income of the Company for any
Post-Closing Tax Period.

(iii) Following the Closing, Parent, the Second Surviving Company and
its Affiliates shall, upon the request of the Stockholder Representative, use
reasonable best efforts to obtain any Tax refunds to which the Participating
Equityholders would be entitled pursuant to this Section 6.8(g). Parent shall
pay over to the Paying Agent (for distribution to the Participating
Equityholders other than In-The-Money Options) and the Company or the Parent
(for distribution to the In-The-Money Options) any refund that is for the
account of the Participating Equityholders within thirty (30) days after
receipt thereof. Any Tax refunds to which the Participating Equityholders
would be entitled pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.8(g)_ shall be net of
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including Taxes with respect to the
refund.

6.9 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_.

 

(a) Parent acknowledges that all rights to indemnification for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the First Effective Time existing as of the date
of this Agreement in favor of the current and former directors and officers of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (such persons, the " _D andO Indemnified
Parties_") shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms for a period of six (6) years
following the First Effective Time, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Companies to fulfill and honor such obligations to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase and fully pay the
associated premium of, tail insurance coverage for the Companys DandO

arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing (the "
_D andO Tail Policy_"), and which DandO Tail Policy shall be reasonably acceptable
to Parent. Any portion of the premium of the DandO Tail Policy that remains
outstanding as of the Closing Date shall be deemed to be a Transaction
Expense.

 



61

    

(c) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ (i) shall survive the Closing
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each DandO
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs, personal representatives, successors
and assigns and nothing in this Agreement shall affect any indemnification
rights that any such DandO Indemnified Party and his or her heirs, personal
representatives, successors or assigns may have under the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or equivalent organizational documents of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or under any Contract or applicable Law and (ii) shall not
be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any DandO Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of such DandO
Indemnified Party or his or her heirs, personal representatives, successors
or assigns, as applicable.

assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person (other than in respect of the
Mergers), then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors or assigns of such Surviving Company or any of its respective
successors or assigns, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_.

6.10 _Confidentiality; Publicity_.

(a) Parent and the Company hereby acknowledge and agree to continue to be
bound by the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall mutually agree upon a joint initial press

which shall be disseminated at such time and in such manner as determined by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company. After such initial press
release is disseminated, the Stockholder Representative and Parent will
consult with each other and will mutually agree upon any press releases or
public announcements pertaining to the transactions and shall not issue any
such press releases or make any such public announcements prior to such
consultation and agreement (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), except as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations
pursuant to any agreement with any national securities exchange, in which case
the party proposing to issue such press release or make such public
announcement shall use reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with
the other party before issuing any such press releases or making any such
public announcements; _provided_ , that Parent may make any public statement
to the press, analysts, investors, lenders, rating agencies, proxy advisory
firms or those attending industry conferences or Parent conference calls, so
long as such statements are substantially similar to previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements.

shall cause its Subsidiaries, shareholders, equity partners, affiliates,
officers, directors, employees, representatives, financial advisors, legal
counsel and agents not to, directly or indirectly solicit, initiate,

encourage in discussions, conversations, negotiations or other communications
with or provide any information to, or otherwise assist, cooperate with or
knowingly encourage any person or entity (other than Parent and its
representatives) in connection with any Competing Transaction or proposal
thereof, or enter into any contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding
with any person or entity to do the same, except prior to delivery of the
Company Written Consent to Parent to the extent failure

 



62

    

 to do so would result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the board of
directors of the Company under applicable Law. Any information provided
pursuant to the foregoing clause shall only be provided pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement with confidentiality provisions that are no less
favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days) inform Parent of the receipt of a Competing Transaction and
shall provide a copy of the same to Parent (except that if identifying the
person proposing such Competing Transaction would be deemed confidential
information restricted from disclosure under a confidentiality or non-
disclosure agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall only be required to provide a summary of the material terms of
such proposal for a Competing Transaction).

6.12 _2_ _80G Cooperation_. To the extent necessary to avoid the application
of Section 280G of the Code and the applicable final Treasury regulations and
rulings thereunder, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall (i) obtain waivers from each Person who has a
right to any payments and/or benefits as a result of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that would reasonably be expected
to constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code and as to which such Person waives his or her rights to some or all of
such payments and/or benefits (the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ ") applicable to
such Person so that all remaining payments and/or benefits applicable to such
Person shall not be deemed to be "excess parachute payments" (within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code), and (ii) following the execution of
the waivers described in clause (i), solicit the approval of the Stockholders
to the extent required under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code of any Waived
280G Benefits pursuant to a vote intended to meet the requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, and that shall be in
a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent. To the extent any of the Waived 280G
Benefits are not approved by the Stockholders as contemplated above,
such Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made or provided. Prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence that a vote of the
Stockholders was solicited in accordance with the foregoing provisions of
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ and that either (A) the requisite number of votes
were obtained with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits (the " _280G Approval_
"), or (B) that the 280G Approval was not obtained, and, as a consequence,
the Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made or provided. The Company shall
provide Parent and its representatives, with a copy of such waiver and
disclosure statement within a reasonable time prior to, and in no event later
than five (5) Business Days prior to, delivery to the "disqualified
individuals" and the Stockholders of the Company of such waiver and disclosure
statement, respectively, and the Company shall consider in good faith any
changes reasonably requested by Parent or its representative to such
disclosure statement and waiver. As soon as practicable following the date
hereof and no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the First Effective
Time, the Company shall provide Parent or its representatives with the
calculations and related documentation required to determine whether the vote
described in this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ is necessary in order to avoid the
imposition of Taxes under Section 4999 of the Code.

6.13 _Benefits Plans_. If requested by Parent in writing, the Company shall,
prior to but conditioned upon the Closing, take all actions necessary to
terminate any Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code as of no later than one day prior to the Closing
Date, in each case without Liability to Parent, the Company or any of their
respective affiliates, and provide evidence of such termination reasonably
acceptable to Parent prior to Closing.

 



63

    

6.14 _Payoff Letters_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Parent copies of executed payoff letters ( _provided_ that drafts
of such letters shall be provided to Parent at least five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date) in respect of all Indebtedness of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that is contemplated to be repaid at the Closing (if any) as
set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ of the Disclosure Schedule (the " _Existing
Target Debt_ "), which (a) confirms the aggregate outstanding amount
required to be paid to fully satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment
premiums, penalties, breakage costs or any other outstanding and unpaid
obligations under the Existing Target Debt as of the anticipated Closing Date
(and the daily per diem accrual of interest thereafter) (the " _Payoff
Amount_ "), (b) provides that upon receipt of the applicable Payoff Amount,
all agreements and instruments related to such Indebtedness shall be
terminated, and (c) provides that all Encumbrances and all guarantees granted
in connection with the Existing Target Debt shall be, upon the payment of the
Payoff Amount at Closing, automatically released, terminated and discharged
(the " _Payoff Letters_ ").

 

6.15 _R andW Insurance Policy_.

 

The Company agrees to reasonably cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best
efforts to take all actions that are reasonably necessary to cause the RandW
Insurance Policy to be in effect at or prior to the Closing. If Parent obtains
and binds the RandW Insurance Policy, Parent agrees that the RandW Insurance
Policy will include provisions providing that the insurer expressly waives,
and agrees not to pursue, directly or indirectly, except in the case of Fraud,
any subrogation rights against the Participating Equityholders with respect to
any claim made by any insured thereunder. If Parent obtains and binds the
RandW Insurance Policy, Parent shall not amend, terminate, waive or otherwise
modify the RandW Insurance Policy in any manner that would allow the insurer
thereunder or any other Person to subrogate or otherwise make or bring any
claim, suit, action or proceeding against the Company, any Company
Equityholder or any past, present or future director, manager, officer,
employee or advisor of any of the foregoing based upon, arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements. Parent
shall comply with all requirements and deliverables for binding the RandW
Insurance Policy, if obtained, at Closing (including delivery of a no
claims declaration).

6.16 _Continuation of Benefits_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that for the period beginning on the Closing Date and
continuing until September 30, 2021 (the " _Continuation Period_ "), for each
employee of the Company Group as of the First Effective Time, while such
employee remains employed (a " _Continuing Employee_ "), Parent shall cause
its applicable Subsidiary that employs each such Continuing Employee (i) to
provide (a) a base salary or hourly wages which are no less than the base
salary or hourly wages provided by the Company Group immediately prior to the
First Effective Time and (b) target cash incentive bonus opportunities
(excluding any equity or equity-based awards or deferred compensation
arrangements), if any, which are no less than the target cash incentive bonus
opportunities (excluding any equity or equity-based awards or deferred
compensation arrangements) provided by the Company Group immediately prior to
First Effective Time, and (ii) to use reasonable best efforts to maintain
those employee benefits and

 



64

    

 payroll processing services provided pursuant to the TriNet Services
Agreement and those benefits provided by a third party vendor or pursuant to a
Company Group plan or policy in each case listed on _Section_ __ _ 4.19(a)_
of the Disclosure Schedule immediately prior to the First Effective Time
(excluding any equity or equity-based awards, deferred compensation
arrangements, retiree health and welfare benefits or defined benefit pension
plans) (collectively, the " _Company Benefits Program_ "); _provided_
___Section_ __ _ 6.16(a)(i)_ will not apply to any Continuing Employee that
has entered into an individual employment agreement with Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries; ___provided_ ___further_ such Company Benefits Program shall be
administered by the senior management of the Company during the Continuation
Period; _provided_   _further_ that between the date hereof and August 24,
2020 at 1:00 PM ET, the Company Group and Parent will cooperate in good faith
and use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain and receive the
approval of any benefit plan vendor, including approval to assign the
contracts listed on _Section_ __ _ 6.16(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule,
necessary to continue such employee benefits and payroll processing on the
same basis, including on the same material terms, pricing and conditions of
their applicable agreements with the Company, as immediately prior to the
First Effective Time; _provided_ _,_ _further_ , the obligations set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.16(a)_ are contingent on each of the following not
occurring: (A) any such necessary approval is not received by August 24, 2020
at 1:00 PM ET, (B) any such benefit plan vendor changes the material terms,
pricing or conditions of benefits or services with respect to the Company
Benefits Program offered at or following the Closing ( _provided_ that Parent
used its commercially reasonable efforts to avoid such changes) or (C) senior
management of the Company fail to administer the Companys employee benefit
plans and payroll processing during the Continuation Period on the basis
required by this _Section_ __ _ 6.16(a)_.

 

(b) If Parent is (or Parent and the Company reasonably agree that Parent will
be) unable to obtain, on or prior to August 24, 2020 at 1:00 PM ET, the
approvals contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 6.16(a)_, then, for the Continuation
Period, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to provide each Continuing
Employee with employee benefits no less favorable than those provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent and shall pay each Continuing Employee,
an amount that shall be based on a formula that shall be reasonably determined
in good faith by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing (each, a " _Make
Whole Payment_ "). During the Continuation Period, the Make Whole Payment
shall be paid in four installments (which, where applicable, shall be subject
to applicable withholding and taxes) with the first payment no later than the
two month anniversary of the date that such Continuing Employee ceased to
participate in the Companys employee benefits and the remaining payments in
connection with the first payroll following each of Parents subsequent
fiscal quarters, subject to such Continuing Employees employment on each
such payment date. The total amount of the Make Whole Payment shall depend on
the enrollment of Continuing Employees in Parent benefit plans and shall in no
case exceed $600,000.00 in the aggregate. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Parent agrees that the benefits offered under the Company
Groups One Medical program and the Companys vacation and parental leave
policies will remain as constituted immediately prior to the First Effective
Time during the Continuation Period. For the avoidance of doubt, this
_Section_ __ _ 6.16(b)_ shall not apply if _Section_ __ _ 6.16(a)_ applies.

 



65

    

(c) With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent,
the First Surviving Company or the Second Surviving Company in which a
Continuing Employee participates, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause (i) to be waived for the calendar year in which the First Effective Time
occurs any eligibility waiting periods or the application of any pre-existing
condition limitations under such plan to the extent such were waived or
satisfied under the comparable health or welfare benefit plan of the Company
Group immediately prior to the First Effective Time, and (ii) each Continuing
Employee to be given credit under such plan for all amounts paid by such
Continuing Employee under any similar Employee Benefit Plan for the plan year
that includes the First Effective Time for purposes of applying deductibles,
co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plans maintained by Parent,
the First Surviving Company or the Second Surviving Company, as applicable,
for the plan year in which the First Effective Time occurs; provided, however,
that Parents obligations under this clause (ii) shall be subject to its
receipt of all necessary information from either the Company Group or such
Continuing Employee related to such amounts paid by such Continuing Employee.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6._ _16_ are solely for the benefit
of the parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section_
__ _ 6._ _16_ shall create such rights in any such persons or any other
third party. Nothing herein shall (i) guarantee employment for any period of
time or preclude the ability of Parent, the First Surviving Company or the
Second Surviving Company to terminate the employment of any Continuing
Employee at any time and for any reason, (ii) require Parent, the First
Surviving Company or the Second Surviving Company to continue any Employee
Benefit Plans, or other employee benefit plans or arrangements or prevent
the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the First Effective
Time, or (iii) amend or establish any Employee Benefit Plans or other employee
benefit plans or arrangements.

 

6.17 _Notices of Certain Events_. During the Interim Period, the Company and
Parent shall promptly notify each other of:

 

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is required in connection with the Mergers or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
delivered in connection with the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

(c) any Action commenced or, to its Knowledge, threatened against the Company
or Parent, as applicable, that relates to the consummation of the Mergers or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

 

(d) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant by
the Company or Parent, as applicable, contained in this Agreement of which
the Company has Knowledge or the Parent has knowledge, as applicable, that
would result in the failure of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_.

 



66

    

No such notice shall be deemed to supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule
for the purpose of (x) determining the accuracy of any of the representations
and warranties made by the Company or Parent, as applicable, in this Agreement
or (y) determining whether any condition set forth in _Article_ _VIII_ has
been satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a
partys failure to give notice under _Section_ __ _ 6.17(d)_ shall not be
deemed to be a breach of covenant under  _Section_ __ _ 6.17(d)_ but instead
shall constitute only a breach of the underlying representation or warranty or
covenant, condition or agreement, as the case may be.

 

6.18 _Further Assurances_. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions
contained herein, the parties agree: (a) to use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements by or before the Outside Date, (b) to execute any documents,
instruments or conveyances of any kind which may be reasonably necessary or
advisable to carry out any of the transactions contemplated hereunder or
thereunder, and (c) to reasonably cooperate with each other in connection
with the foregoing.

6.19 _Legal Representation_. All communications involving attorney-client
confidences among the Company Group, Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve
Franklin __ and Hachigian, LLP (" _Gunderson_ ") and Hogan Lovells in the
course of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences that belong solely to the Stockholders (and neither of the
Surviving Companies or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, including
Parent) and may be controlled by the Stockholder Representative. __Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (a) the
Stockholders and their Affiliates (and neither of the Surviving Companies or
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, including Parent) will be the
sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, the " _Pre-Merger Communications_"), and neither of
the Surviving Companies or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
(including Parent) will be a holder thereof, (b) __ to the extent that files
of Gunderson or Hogan Lovells with respect to the negotiation, documentation
and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute
property of the client, only the Stockholders and their Affiliates will hold
such property rights and (c) __ neither Gunderson nor Hogan Lovells will have
any duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose the Pre-Merger Communications or
files pertaining to the Pre-Merger Communications to the Surviving Companies
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including Parent) by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between any of Gunderson or Hogan
Lovells and the Company or otherwise. __Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that a dispute arises between either of the Surviving Companies or their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, including Parent, on the one hand, and
a third party other than the Stockholders, on the other hand, Parent may
assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent the disclosure of the Pre-
Merger Communications to such third party or waive such privilege if desired
in connection with resolving such dispute. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that a dispute arises between Parent, either of the Surviving
Companies or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one hand, and
one or more Stockholders, on the other hand, relating to any event that
occurred prior to the Closing Date or the transactions contemplated hereby,
Parent shall be provided access to, and permitted to use, all Pre-Merger
Communications that relate directly to contested facts in connection with

 



67

    

 such dispute, including information in the files of Gunderson; _provided_
that for the avoidance of doubt, this sentence shall not apply to such
disputes with the Stockholders collectively or the Stockholder Representative
on behalf of the Stockholders. In the event that Parent is legally required or
requested by governmental order or otherwise (any such request or order, a "
_Legal Request_ ") to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Pre-
Merger Communications, Parent shall be entitled to access or obtain a copy of
and disclose the Pre-Merger Communications to the extent necessary to comply
with any such Legal Request. In the event of any Legal Request, Parent shall
promptly notify the Stockholder Representative in writing (prior to the
disclosure by Parent of any Pre-Merger Communications to the extent
practicable) so that the Stockholder Representative can seek a protective
order and Parent agrees to use all reasonable best efforts (at the sole cost
and expense of the Company Equityholders) to assist therewith.

6.20 _Financial Statements_. The Company shall assist promptly, and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its representatives (including its auditors)
to assist promptly, Parent and its representatives in connection with the
preparation of any filings, documents, or other materials, including any pro
forma financial statements, that may be reasonably required in connection
with the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby, or otherwise
in connection with Parents reporting obligations or public offerings under
applicable federal securities Laws, including all applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act and Regulation S-X, and supply promptly and further furnish
promptly, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its representatives
(including its auditors) to supply and furnish promptly, any and all
information, documents, and records as Parent may reasonably request, and
provide reasonable access to the Companys personnel and facilities (subject
to the limitations on access described in _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, which shall
apply _mutatis mutandis_ to any access requested by Parent pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.20_), in connection with the matters contemplated by this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.20_.

6.21 _Termination of Affiliate Agreements_. On or prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent of the termination of all Contracts required to be
disclosed under clause (a) of the definition of Material Contracts
(collectively, " _Affiliate Agreements_ "), in each case, with no further
liability to or obligation of the Company Group under such Contract as of the
First Effective Time.

 

6.22 _VDR_. No later than five (5) Business Days following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Parent a CD-ROM or flash drive
containing the contents of the VDR as of the date of this Agreement.

7.3 _Limitations on Indemnity; Priority of Recovery._ __

 

(a) (i) No amount shall be payable to the Parent Indemnitees in satisfaction
of claims for indemnification that may be made solely pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 7.2(a)(i)_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)(ix)_ unless and until the
aggregate amount of all Losses of the Parent Indemnitees arising therefrom
exceeds an amount equal to $960,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), at which time the
Parent Indemnitees shall have the right to recover all Losses in excess of the
Deductible, subject to the other limitations set forth in this _Article_ _VII_
; _provided_ , that the Deductible shall not apply to indemnification claims
for breaches of or inaccuracies in the Fundamental Representations or in the
case of Fraud and (ii) except in the case of Fraud, the aggregate liability of
the Participating Equityholders with respect to claims for indemnification by
the Parent Indemnitees under this _Article VII_ shall not exceed the Indemnity
Escrow Amount and the aggregate liability of a Participating Equityholder with
respect to such claims shall not exceed such Participating Equityholders pro
rata portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount (as determined in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(f)_).

 

(b) (i) No amount shall be payable to the Stockholder Indemnitees in
satisfaction of claims for indemnification that may be made solely pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)(i)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of all
Losses of the Stockholder Indemnitees arising therefrom exceeds an amount
equal to the Deductible, at which time the Stockholder Indemnitees shall have
the right to recover all Losses in excess of the Deductible, subject to the
other limitations set forth in this _Article_ _VII_ ; _provided_ , that the
Deductible shall not apply to indemnification claims for breaches of
or inaccuracies in the Parent Fundamental Representations or in the case of
Fraud and (ii) except in the case of Fraud, the aggregate liability of Parent
with respect to claims for indemnification by the Stockholder Indemnitees
under this  _Article VII_ shall not exceed an amount equal to the $9,600,000;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ shall be
deemed to limit Parents obligation to make the payments to holders of
Company Capital Stock pursuant to _Article II_ and _Article III_.

(c) From and after the First Effective Time, recovery from the Indemnity
Escrow Account shall constitute the sole and exclusive monetary remedy for the
indemnity obligations of each Participating Equityholder under this Agreement
for Losses arising out of, resulting from or in connection with the
matters listed in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_, except in the case of Fraud by or
on behalf of the Company or such Participating Equityholder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no Participating Equityholder shall be liable for any Fraud
by or on behalf of any Person other than the Company or such Participating
Equityholder; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing herein shall limit the
liability of a Participating Equityholder for any Fraud by such Participating
Equityholder. 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) any
liability for indemnification under this _Article VII_  shall be determined
without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to
such liability constituting a breach or other violation of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, (ii) if and solely to the
extent that an amount of Losses in connection with an indemnifiable matter was
already actually included as a current liability in the definition of Working
Capital or as Closing Indebtedness in the Aggregate Merger Consideration as
finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.9_, the same amount of such
Losses may not be recovered under this _Article VII_ and (iii) Indemnified
Parties

 



70

    

 shall use reasonable best efforts to mitigate the amount of Losses upon and
after becoming aware of any event that could reasonably be expected to give
rise to Losses that may be indemnifiable under this _Article VII_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall any Parent Indemnitee be required
to (a) maintain or cause any Person to maintain or carry any specific type or
level of insurance coverage following the Closing, or (b) seek recovery (i)
under any insurance policy (including the RandW Insurance Policy) or from other
third parties prior to seeking indemnification hereunder or (ii) from any
customer, supplier, or other Person with whom such Parent Indemnitee has a
business relationship that is material to the Parent Indemnitees taken as a
whole, except in connection with any manifest error on the part of any such
customer, supplier or other Person.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) with
respect to any claims that may be made by a Parent Indemnitee under _Section_
__ _ 7._2, subject to the limitations in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, Losses

Account, (B) after the retention under the RandW Insurance Policy is satisfied,
from the RandW Insurance Policy, if coverage is available thereunder and until
it is exhausted, and (C) any combination of (A) and (B) and in any sequence,
_provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, no Parent Indemnitee
shall be entitled to duplicate recovery in respect of such Losses. and (ii)
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ is intended to, or shall, limit any
recovery available under the RandW Insurance Policy, provided, however, for the
avoidance of doubt, no Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to duplicate

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ shall not apply to
claims for a partys failure to consummate the transaction pursuant to

7.4 _Direct Claims Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) If a Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder (an " _Indemnified
Party_ "), the Indemnified Party shall deliver a written demand (a " _Claim
Certificate_ ") to Parent (in the case of an indemnification claim from a
Stockholder Indemnitee) or the Stockholder Representative (in the case of an
indemnification claim from a Parent Indemnitee), as applicable (each, an "
_Indemnifying Party_ "), which Claim Certificate shall contain a description
of, and if reasonably determinable at the time such demand is delivered, the
amount of any Losses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by such
Indemnified Party and a reasonable explanation of the basis therefor. The
failure to provide such notice to the Indemnifying Party shall not affect the
Indemnifying Partys obligations under this _Article_ _VII_  except and only
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially
prejudiced by such failure. For the avoidance of doubt and as applicable,
"Indemnifying Party" shall only refer to the Stockholder Representative
acting on behalf of the Participating Equityholders, and any provisions
relating to an obligation to make or right to receive any payments shall
relate directly to the applicable Stockholder Indemnitees.

 

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not, within fifteen (15)
Business Days of the receipt thereof, object in writing to any claim or
claims made in any Claim Certificate pursuant to the terms hereof, the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to
the Losses set forth in the Claim Certificate arising out of any claim or
claims that are not objected to by the Indemnifying Party, subject to the
limitations in _Section_ _7.3_ ; _provided_ , that if the Indemnified Party is
a Parent Indemnitee, then such amount shall be recovered from the Indemnity
Escrow Account in accordance with the terms hereof and of the Escrow
Agreement.

 



71

    

(c) In case the Indemnifying Party shall object in writing to any claim or
claims made in any Claim Certificate, the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified
Party shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement
shall be prepared and signed, and the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the
Indemnified Party the amount set forth in such memorandum in accordance with
the terms thereof; _provided_ , that if the Indemnified Party is a Parent
Indemnitee, then such amount shall be recovered from the Indemnity Escrow
Account in accordance with the terms hereof and of the Escrow Agreement. In
the event that the parties are not able to reach an agreement, or the
memorandum contains an agreement as to only a portion of the Losses in
question, the parties may resolve such dispute in the manner provided in
_Section_ __ _ 10.5_.

 

7.5 _Defense of_ _Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a) A party seeking indemnification hereunder in connection with a claim by
any Person other than the Indemnified Party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") shall
provide prompt notice of such Third-Party Claim to Parent (in the case of an
indemnification claim from a Stockholder Indemnitee) or the Stockholder
Representative (in the case of an indemnification claim from a
Parent Indemnitee), as applicable, which notice describes in reasonable
detail such Third-Party Claim and includes copies of all material written
correspondence received by such party in connection therewith; _provided_ that
the failure to provide such notice shall not affect an Indemnifying Partys
obligations under this _Article_ _VII_ except and only to the extent that an
Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right in its discretion and at its expense,
to participate in and control the defense or settlement of such Third-Party
Claim so long as each of the following conditions are, and continue to be,
satisfied: (i) the claim does not seek an injunction or other equitable
relief; (ii) the claim does not involve criminal allegations or a claim by a
Governmental Authority or any customer, supplier, or other Person with whom
the applicable Parent Indemnitee has a business relationship that is material
to the Parent Indemnitees taken as a whole; (iii) the Indemnifying Party
admits that such Third-Party Claim is indemnifiable pursuant to this _Article_
_VII_ and eighty percent (80%) of the expected liability for such Third-Party
Claim (as reasonably determined by the Indemnifying Partys outside counsel)
is equal to or less than the amount of the then-remaining Indemnity Escrow
Amount (less the Pending Claims Amount); (iv) such Indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of such Third-Party Claim within thirty (30) days of receipt by
the Indemnifying Party of notice of such Third-Party Claim and a reasonable
description of such Third-Party Claim; (v) such Indemnifying Party conducts
the defense of the Third-Party Claim diligently; (vi) is not one in which the
Indemnifying Party is also a party and there are legal defenses available to
the Indemnified Party which are materially inconsistent with those available
to the Indemnifying Party; and (vii) in the case of a claim against a Parent
Indemnitee, the assumption of the defense would not cause any Parent
Indemnitee to lose coverage under the RandW Insurance Policy (clauses (i)
through (vii), the " _Assumption Conditions_ "). If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of such Third-Party Claim, (A) the Indemnified Party shall
be entitled, at its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense of
such Third-Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such
purpose and (B) the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party
reasonably apprised of all material developments, including settlement offers,
with respect to the Third-Party Claim.

 



72

    

(b) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a
Third-Party Claim, neither party shall admit to any Liability with respect
to, consent to the entry of any judgment, or settle, compromise or discharge,
any Third-Party Claim for which indemnity is sought without the prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) of the
other party; _provided_ , that an Indemnified Party shall have no obligation
of any kind to consent to the entrance of any judgment or into any settlement
unless such judgment or settlement (i) is for only money damages, eighty
percent (80%) of the amount of which is equal to or less than the amount of
the then remaining Indemnity Escrow Amount (less the Pending Claims Amount),
and (ii) includes, as a condition thereof, an express, unconditional release
of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates, Subsidiaries and their respective
representatives from any liability or obligation with respect to such Third-
Party Claim; _provided_ _,_ _further_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
such consent shall be subject, in all cases, to the terms (including any right
of the insurer to consent) of the RandW Insurance Policy.

 

(c) If any Assumption Condition is or becomes unsatisfied, (i) the Indemnified
Party may defend against, and consent to the entry of any judgment or,
subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.5(b)_, enter into any settlement with respect to,
the Third-Party Claim in any manner it may deem appropriate (and the
Indemnified Party need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, the
Indemnifying Party in connection therewith), (ii) to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is liable for such Losses under this _Article_ _VII_ , the
Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly and
periodically (but no less often than quarterly and no more often than
monthly) for the costs of defending against the Third-Party Claim, including
reasonable, out-of-pocket fees and expenses of counsel engaged by the
Indemnified Party, and (iii) to the extent the Indemnifying Party is liable
for such Losses under this _Article_ _VII_ , the Indemnifying Party will
remain responsible for any Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer, sustain
or become subject to, as a result of, arising out of, relating to or in
connection with the Third-Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this
_Article_ _VII_. This _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ shall not apply to Taxes which
shall be governed exclusively by _Section_ __ _ 6.8(d)_.

7.6 _Effect of Knowledge; Waiver of Condition;_ _Calculation of Loss_.

(a) The right to indemnification, payment of Losses, or other remedies based
on any representations, warranties, covenants and agreements will not be
affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after
the execution of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of
any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with
any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification,
payment of Losses, or other remedies based on such representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements.

 



73

    

(b) In determining whether there existed a breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty, and with respect to the calculation of the amount
of Losses incurred by a Parent Indemnitee, each representation and warranty
contained in this Agreement (other than the third sentence of _Section_ __ _
4.1(a)_) shall be read without regard to any materiality, Material Adverse
Effect or similar materiality qualification contained in or otherwise
applicable to such representation or warranty.

 

7.7 _Escrow; Payment_. __

 

(a) Within five (5) Business Days after the resolution of any claim for
indemnification for which a Parent Indemnitee is entitled to recover Losses
from the Indemnity Escrow Account, Parent and the Stockholder Representative
shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver from the Indemnity Escrow
Account to such Parent Indemnitee the amount of such Losses.

 

(b) Within five (5) Business Days after the resolution of any claim for
indemnification for which a Stockholder Indemnitee is entitled to recover
Losses from Parent, Parent shall deliver to such Stockholder Indemnitee the
amount for which it is responsible by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account(s) specified by the Stockholder Representative.

 

7.8 _No Contribution_. No Stockholder shall have, and no Stockholder shall
exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of
contribution or right of indemnity or advancement against the Surviving
Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries, in connection with any
indemnification obligation to a Parent Indemnitee to which such Stockholder is
subject under or in connection with this Agreement.

7.9 _Indemnification Sole Remedy_. Except (a) for the ability of Parent,
Merger Sub, Merger Sub II or the Company to obtain equitable remedies in
connection with any breach or threatened breach of any of the covenants and
agreements of the parties set forth herein; (b) as specified in _Section_ __ _
2.9_,  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.18(f)_, (c) with respect
to claims under any Stock Letter of Transmittal delivered in connection
herewith, and (d) in the case of Fraud, (i) the indemnification rights
provided pursuant to this _Article_ _VII_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of the parties and their respective officers, directors, employees,
affiliates, agents, representatives, successors and assigns for any breach of
any representations and warranties and covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement (but for the avoidance of doubt the indemnification rights
provided pursuant to this _Article VII_ are not the sole and exclusive
remedies of the Parent Indemnitees with respect to the Voting and Support
Agreements and the Parent Indemnitees expressly reserve all rights and
remedies with respect thereto); and (ii) each party hereby irrevocably waives
any right to any remedy relating to any such breach other than the
indemnification rights provided pursuant to this _Article_ _VII_ (whether by
contract, common law, statute, regulation or otherwise) (but for the avoidance
of doubt the indemnification rights provided pursuant to this _Article VII_
are not the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parent Indemnitees with respect
to the Voting and Support Agreements and the Parent Indemnitees expressly
reserve all rights and remedies with respect thereto).

7.10 _Tax_ _Matters_. Any payments made to an Indemnified Party pursuant to
any indemnification obligations under this _Article_ _VII_ will be treated as
adjustments to the purchase price for all federal, state, local and foreign
Tax purposes to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and the parties shall
file their respective Tax Returns accordingly and such agreed treatment will
govern for purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise required by Law.

 



74

    

7.11 _Losses Net of Insurance; Tax Benefits_. Losses indemnifiable pursuant
to this _Article VII_ shall be reduced by the amount of (i) insurance
proceeds or indemnity, contribution or other similar amounts actually
recovered by Parent with respect to the Losses, net of any actual increase in
premium, deductible amounts or costs or expenses of recovery (including
reasonable attorney and advisor fees) and (ii) any Tax benefit actually
realized by the Indemnified Party arising from such Loss in the year of the
Loss or the next succeeding taxable year;  _provided_ , _however_ , in no
event shall any Parent Indemnitee be required to (a) maintain or cause any
Person to maintain or carry any specific type or level of insurance coverage
following the Closing, or (b) seek recovery (i) under any insurance policy or
from other third parties prior to seeking indemnification hereunder or (ii)
from any customer, supplier, or other Person with whom such Parent Indemnitee
has a business relationship that is material to the Parent Indemnitees taken
as a whole, except in connection with any manifest error on the part of any
such customer, supplier or other Person. If a Parent Indemnitee recovers,
under insurance policies (other than any amounts under the RandW Insurance
Policy) or from other collateral sources, any amount in respect of a matter
for which such Parent Indemnitee was already indemnified pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 7.2(a)_, Parent shall promptly pay over the amount so recovered (after
deducting therefrom the full amount of any increases in premium, deductible
amounts or costs or expenses of recovery (including reasonable attorney and
advisor fees and the costs and expenses incurred by such Parent Indemnitee
in obtaining and paying over the amount of such recovery) (such amount, a "
_Previously Indemnified Amount_ ") to the Paying Agent, for further
distribution to the Participating Equityholders (other than the holders of In-
The-Money Options), and Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent, for further
distribution to the holders of In-The-Money Options) through the payroll
system of Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent subject to applicable Tax
withholding; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such recovery occurs prior to
the expiration of the survival periods under _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ or while any
claim by a Parent Indemnitee remains pending in accordance with _Section_ __ _
7.1_, then such Previously Indemnified Amount shall be re-deposited in the
Indemnity Escrow Account until it is released in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

Disclosure Schedule), constitute the entire agreement and understanding of the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and
all prior negotiations, correspondence, agreements, understandings, duties or
obligations between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

10.13 _Construction_. Each party hereto agrees that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

10.14 _No Personal Liability_. This Agreement and all documents,
understandings and arrangements relating hereto and/or to the transactions
contemplated hereby have been negotiated, executed and delivered on behalf of
the parties hereto by their respective officers, directors, employees,

arrangements relating hereto and/or to the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this _Section_ __ _ 10.14_

103

    

10.16 _Waivers_. No purported waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall
be binding upon any of the parties to this Agreement unless: (a) with respect
to waivers by the Company on or prior to the Closing, the Company has duly
executed and delivered to Parent a written instrument which states that it
constitutes a waiver of one or more provisions of this Agreement; (b) with
respect to waivers by the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder
Representative has duly executed and delivered to Parent a written instrument
which states that it constitutes a waiver of one or more provisions of this
Agreement; (c) with respect to waivers by Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Sub II
on or prior to the Closing, Parent has duly executed and delivered to the
Company a written instrument which states that it constitutes a waiver of one
or more provisions of this Agreement; or (d) with respect to waivers by
Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Sub II after to the Closing, Parent has duly
executed and delivered to the Company (if prior to or at the Closing) or the
Stockholder Representative (if after the Closing) a written instrument which
states that it constitutes a waiver of one or more provisions of this
Agreement. Any such waiver shall be effective only to the extent specifically
set forth in such written instrument. Neither the exercise (from time to time
and at any time) by a party of, nor the delay or failure (at any time or for
any period of time) to exercise, any right, power or remedy shall constitute a
waiver of the right to exercise, impair, limit or restrict the exercise of,
such right, power or remedy or any other right, power or remedy at any time
and from time to time thereafter. No waiver of any right, power or remedy of a
party shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other right, power or remedy of
such party or shall, except to the extent so waived, impair, limit or restrict
the exercise of such right, power or remedy.

 

10.17 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and all of its conditions
and provisions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under
or by reason of this Agreement or any provision hereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (x) any Person that is not a party to this Agreement but, by
the terms of _Article_ _VII_ , is entitled to indemnification shall be
considered a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, with full rights of
enforcement as though such Person was a signatory to this Agreement and (y) _
Section_ __ _ 6.9_ is intended to benefit the DandO Indemnified Parties.

 

10.18 _Appointment of the Stockholder Representative._

 

(a) By executing this Agreement, the Company (and, upon execution of a Stock
Letter of Transmittal or participating in the Mergers and receiving the
benefits thereof, including the right to receive the consideration payable in
connection with the Mergers, each Company Equityholder) shall be deemed to
have constituted and appointed, effective from and after the Closing Date,
the Stockholder Representative as the representative, agent and attorney-in-
fact for and on behalf of each Stockholder to act as the Stockholder
Representative for all purposes in connection with this Agreement and any
agreements ancillary hereto.

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall take any and all actions required,
permitted, necessary or appropriate under this Agreement or any agreement
ancillary hereto for and on behalf of the Company Equityholders as if the
Company Equityholders were acting on their own behalf, including:

 



104

    

(i) taking any and all actions (including executing and delivering any
documents and incurring any costs and expenses, in each case, on behalf of
the Company Equityholders) and making any and all determinations which may be
required or permitted in connection with the post-Closing implementation of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby;

(ii) giving and receiving notices and communications under this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements;

(iii) negotiating, defending, settling, compromising and otherwise handling
and resolving any and all claims and disputes with Parent and any other
Parent Indemnitees arising out of or in respect of this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements, including claims and disputes pursuant to this _Article_
_VII_ ;

 

(iv) retaining legal counsel, accountants, consultants and other experts in
connection with all matters and things set forth or necessary with respect to
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby; and

(v) making any other decision or election or exercising such rights, power
and authority as are incidental to the foregoing.

(c) Upon execution of a Stock Letter of Transmittal, each Company
Equityholder acknowledges and agrees (i) that upon any delivery by the
Stockholder Representative of any waiver, amendment, agreement, opinion,
certificate or other document executed by the Stockholder Representative,
such Company Equityholder shall be bound by such documents as fully as if such
Company Equityholder had executed and delivered such documents and (ii) to be
bound by the provisions set forth in _Sections_ _10.4_ ,  _10.5_ , and _10.6_
as if they were a party to this Agreement.

(d) The Stockholder Representative my resign at any time. Upon
the resignation, death, disability or incapacity of the initial Stockholder
Representative, then such Person as is appointed by the Company Equityholders
who held a majority of the voting power of the Company Capital Stock
immediately prior to the Closing shall become the Stockholder Representative;
_provided_ that no appointment of a successor shall be effective prior to the
delivery to Parent of written notice thereof from such Company Equityholders.
The Stockholder Representative shall not receive compensation for service in
such capacity except as set forth in that certain Engagement Letter by and
among the Stockholder Representative, the Company and certain Company
Equityholders dated on or about the Closing Date.

 

(e) Any and all actions taken or not taken, exercises of rights, power or
authority and any decision or determination made by the
Stockholder Representative in connection herewith shall be absolutely and
irrevocably binding upon the Company Equityholders as if such Company
Equityholder had taken such action, exercised such rights, power or authority
or made such decision or determination in its individual capacity, and Parent
may rely upon such action, exercise of right, power, or authority or such
decision or determination of the Stockholder Representative as the action,
exercise, right, power, or authority, or decision or determination of such
Company Equityholders, and no Company Equityholder shall have the right to
object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. Parent is hereby
relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by the
Stockholder Representative and any acts done by Parent in accordance with any
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative.

 



105

    

(f) The Stockholder Representative will incur no liability of any kind with
respect to any action or omission by the Stockholder Representative in
connection with the Stockholder Representatives services pursuant to this
Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, except in the event of
liability directly resulting from the Stockholder Representatives gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representative shall not be
liable for any action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The
Company Equityholders will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Stockholder Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and
expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their
staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection
with the Stockholder Representatives execution and performance of this
Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such
Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that in the event
that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly
caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Stockholder
Representative, the Stockholder Representative will reimburse the Company
Equityholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent
attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid
directly to the Stockholder Representative by the Company Equityholders, any
such Representative Losses may be recovered by the Stockholder Representative
from (i) the funds in the Expense Fund, and (ii) the amounts in the
Adjustment Escrow Account and Indemnity Escrow Account at such time as
remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Participating
Equityholders; _provided_ , that while this section allows the Stockholder
Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of funds, this does
not relieve the Company Equityholders from their obligation to promptly pay
such losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the
Stockholder Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law
or otherwise. In no event will the Stockholder Representative be required to
advance its own funds on behalf of the Stockholders or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions
or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of, or provisions
limiting the recourse against non-parties otherwise applicable to, the Company
Equityholders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be
applicable to the indemnities provided to the Stockholder Representative under
this Section. The foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing, the
resignation or removal of the Stockholder Representative or the termination
of this Agreement.

(g) Upon the Closing, Parent will wire $250,000 (the " _Expense Fund_ ") to
the Stockholder Representative, which will be used for the purposes of paying
directly, or reimbursing the Stockholder Representative for, any third party
expenses pursuant to this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto. The
Participating Equityholders will not receive any interest or earnings on the
Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Stockholder
Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any
such interest or earnings. The Stockholder Representative will not be liable
for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of its
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representative will
hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds
for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not
voluntarily

 



106

    

 make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As
soon as practicable following the completion of the Stockholder
Representatives responsibilities, the Stockholder Representative will
deliver any remaining balance of the Expense Fund to the Paying Agent for
further distribution to the Participating Equityholders. For tax purposes, the
Expense Fund will be treated as having been received and voluntarily
set aside by the Participating Equityholders at the time of Closing.

10.19 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform any provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
in Law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose
the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that
any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at Law or in equity. Any party hereto seeking an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such order or injunction.
