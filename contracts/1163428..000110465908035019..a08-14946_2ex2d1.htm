of WFB Common Stock for any amount paid in good faith to a public official or
agency pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.
Until such time as WFB Certificates are surrendered to HNC for exchange, HNC
shall have the right to withhold dividends or any other distributions on the
shares of HNC Common Stock issuable to such shareholder.

  



  

(e) Upon the Effective Date, the stock transfer books for WFB Common Stock

(f) If there is a transfer of ownership of WFB Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of WFB, one or more HNC Certificates
evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper number of shares of HNC Common Stock
and any cash in lieu of a fractional share payment to Section 2.04 and
dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.06(c), as applicable, may be issued with respect to such WFB Common
Stock to such a transferee if the WFB Certificate representing such shares of
WFB Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not payable.

  



  

(g) If any WFB Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
WFB Certificate, upon the making of a sworn affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof in form satisfactory to the Exchange Agent, the Merger
Consideration required pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that
the Exchange Agent may, in its sole discretion and as a condition precedent
to the delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the holder of such WFB
Certificate is entitled as a result of the Merger, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed WFB Certificate to deliver a bond in such amount as
it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against WFB,
HNC or the Exchange Agent or any other party with respect to the WFB
Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

2.07 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. If HNC shall at any time before the
Effective Date:

  



  

(a) declare a dividend in shares of HNC Common Stock with a record date prior
to the Effective Date;

  



  

(b) resolve to combine the outstanding shares of HNC Common Stock into a
smaller number of shares prior to the Effective Date;

  



        
   

  



  

(c) resolve to effect a split or subdivide the outstanding shares of HNC
Common Stock with a record date prior to the Effective Date; or

  



  

(d) reclassify the shares of HNC Common Stock prior to the Effective Date;

  



  

then, in any such event, the number of shares of HNC Common Stock to be
delivered to WFB shareholders in exchange for shares of WFB Common Stock
shall be adjusted so that each WFB shareholder shall be entitled to receive
such number of shares of HNC Common Stock as such shareholder would have been
entitled to receive if the Effective Date had occurred prior to the happening
of such event. (By way of illustration, if HNC declares a stock dividend of
5% payable with respect to a record date on or prior to the Effective Date,
the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted upward by 5%.). In addition, in the
event that, prior to the Effective Date, HNC enters into an agreement
pursuant to which shares of HNC Common Stock would be converted into shares
or other securities or obligations of another corporation, proper provision
shall be made in such agreement so that each WFB shareholder who becomes a
shareholder of HNC shall be entitled to receive such number of shares or
other securities or amount or obligations of such other corporation as such
shareholder would be entitled to receive if the Effective Date had occurred
immediately prior to the happening of such event. Furthermore, the number of
shares of HNC Common Stock subject to each WFB Stock Option referenced in
Section 2.05(a) and the applicable exercise price shall be appropriately
adjusted.

3.12 _Employee Benefits; Labor Matters_.

unwritten employee benefit plans, including any agreements, programs,
policies or other arrangements whether or not subject to ERISA, multiemployer
plans within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(37), employee pension benefit

purchase plans, stock option plans, severance plans, change in control
agreements, employment agreements, fringe benefits, bonus or incentive plans,

other employee benefit plans, policies, agreements, and arrangements,
currently maintained or contributed to or under which WFB has any liability
or obligation for the benefit of past, present, or retired
employees, independent contractors, directors, or any other individuals or
any beneficiaries thereunder or any entity (collectively, the "WFB Benefit
Plans"), all of which are set forth on _WFB Disclosure Schedule 3.12(a)_ ,
together with, as applicable:

  



  

(i) the most recent actuarial valuation reports and audited financial
statements relating to WFB Benefit Plans;

  



        
   

  



  

(ii) the most recently filed Form 5500 relating to the WFB Benefit Plans;

  



  

(iii) the most recent IRS determination letters which pertain to any WFB
Benefit Plans;

  



  

(iv) all written communications between WFB or a WFB ERISA Affiliate (as
defined below) and any governmental authority regarding any of the WFB
Benefit Plans;

  



  

(v) all trust agreements or other funding instruments related to WFB Benefit
Plans;

  



  

(vi) current summary plan descriptions, amendments, modifications, or
material supplements; or

  



  

(vii) summary of any proposed amendments or changes anticipated to be made to
any WFB Benefit Plan other than, in either case, as contemplated by this
Agreement;

  



  

(b) With respect to each of the WFB Benefit Plans, no event has occurred and
there exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which
WFB or any of its Subsidiaries would be subject to any liability that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on WFB. Except as set forth on _WFB Disclosure
Schedule 3.12(b)_ , WFB and each of its Subsidiaries have operated,
maintained and administered each WFB Benefit Plan in material compliance with
all applicable laws and the terms of each such plan. The terms of each WFB
Benefit Plan are in compliance with all applicable laws in all material
respects. Each WFB Benefit Plan that is intended to be "qualified" under IRC
Section 401(a) has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS to
such effect and, to WFBs Knowledge, no fact, circumstance or event has
occurred or exists since the date of such determination letter that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such
WFB Benefit Plan. There are no pending or to the Knowledge of WFB threatened
or anticipated claims by, on behalf of or against any of the WFB Benefit
Plans, any fiduciaries of such WFB Benefit Plans (with respect to whom WFB
has an indemnification obligation) with respect to their duties to any WFB
Benefit Plan, or against the assets of such WFB Benefit Plan or any trust
maintained in connection with such WFB Benefit Plan (other than routine
claims for benefits). All contributions, premiums and other payments required
to be made with respect to any WFB Benefit Plan have been made on or before
their due dates under applicable law and the terms of such WFB Benefit Plan,
and with respect to any such contributions, premiums or other
payments required to be made with respect to any WFB Benefit Plan that are
not yet due, to the extent required by GAAP, adequate reserves are reflected
on the consolidated balance sheet of WFB included in its SEC filings
(including any notes thereto) or liability therefor was incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. There is not now,
and to the Knowledge of WFB there are no existing circumstances that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to, any requirement for the posting of
security with respect to a WFB Benefit Plan or the imposition of any pledge,
lien, security interest or encumbrance on the assets of WFB or any of WFBs
Subsidiaries or any of their respective WFB ERISA Affiliates (as defined
below) under ERISA or the IRC, or similar laws of foreign jurisdictions.

  



        
   

  



  

No "excess contributions" have been made that would be non-deductible or that
would subject WFB or any of WFBs Subsidiaries to the excise tax imposed
under Section 4972 of the IRC.

  



  

(c) Except as set forth on _WFB Disclosure Schedule 3.12(c)_ , (i) neither
WFB nor any of WFBs Subsidiaries nor any trade or business, whether or not
incorporated, that, together with WFB or any of WFBs Subsidiaries would be
deemed to be a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b)
of ERISA (an "WFB ERISA Affiliate"), maintains or contributes to, or during
the five-year period prior to the date hereof has maintained or contributed
to, (x) any "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
ERISA that is subject to Section 412 of the IRC or Section 302 or Title
IV of ERISA or (y) a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section
3(37) and 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or a "multiple employer plan" within the
meaning of Sections 4063/4064 of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the IRC, (ii)
neither WFB nor any of WFBs Subsidiaries has incurred, either directly or
indirectly (including as a result of any indemnification or joint and several
liability obligation), any liability pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA other
than plan funding obligations in the ordinary course and Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") premiums (including any Controlled Group
Liability as a result of its relationship with an ERISA Affiliate) or the
penalty tax, excise tax or joint and several liability provisions of the IRC
relating to employee benefit plans, whether contingent or otherwise,
including pursuant to any non-exempt "prohibited transactions" as such term
is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the IRC, and to the
Knowledge of WFB, no event, transaction, fact or condition exists that
presents a risk to WFB or any ERISA Affiliate of WFB of incurring any such
liability, or after the Effective Time, to HNC or any of its Affiliates, in
each case, with respect to the WFB Benefit Plans, (iii) no WFB Benefit Plan
has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the
meaning of Section 412 of the IRC or Section 302 of ERISA, (iv) with respect
to each WFB Benefit Plan that is a "multiemployer plan," no complete or
partial withdrawal from such plan has been made by WFB or any of WFBs
Subsidiaries, or by any other person, that would reasonably be expected to
result in any material liability to WFB or any of WFBs Subsidiaries, whether
such liability is contingent or otherwise, and if WFB or any of WFBs
Subsidiaries were to withdraw from any such WFB Benefit Plan, such withdrawal
would not result in any material liability to WFB or any of WFBs
Subsidiaries, and (v) during the five-year period prior to the date hereof,
with respect to any WFB Benefit Plan subject to Title IV or Section 302 of
ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the IRC (a) there has not been a partial
termination, and (b) none of the following events has occurred: (x) the
filing of a notice of intent to terminate, (y) the treatment of an amendment
to such a WFB Benefit Plan as a termination under Section 4041 of ERISA or
(z) the commencement of proceedings by the PBGC to terminate such a WFB
Benefit Plan and (iii) there has been no "reportable event" within the
meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations and interpretations
thereunder which required a notice to the PBGC which has not been fully and
accurately reported in a timely fashion, as required, or which, whether or
not reported, would constitute grounds for the PBGC to institute involuntary
termination proceedings with respect to any WFB Benefit Plan that is subject
to Title IV of ERISA. "Controlled Group Liability" means any and all
liabilities (i) under Title IV of ERISA, (ii) under Section 302 of ERISA,
(iii) under Sections 412 and 4971 of the IRC, (iv) resulting from a violation
of the continuation coverage requirements of Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and
Section 4980B of the IRC and (v) under corresponding or similar provisions of
foreign laws or regulations.

  



     



  

      
 

  



  

(d) With respect to each WFB Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the IRC, as of the last day of
the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the actuarially
determined present value of all "benefit liabilities" within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA did not exceed the then current value of assets
of such WFB Benefit Plan or, if such liabilities did exceed such assets, the
amount thereof was properly reflected on the financial statements of WFB or
WFBs Subsidiary previously filed with the SEC. With respect to each WFB
Benefit Plan for which financial statements are required there has been no
material adverse change in the financial status of such WFB Benefit Plan
since the date of the most recent financial statements provided to HNC by
WFB.

  



  

(e) Except as set forth on _WFB Disclosure Schedule 3.12(e)_ , to the
Knowledge of WFB, (i) no WFB Benefit Plan is under audit or is the subject of
an investigation by the IRS, the Department of Labor, the PBGC, the SEC or
any other Regulatory Authority, and (ii) no such audit or investigation is
pending or threatened.

  



  

(f) Except as set forth on _WFB Disclosure Schedule 3.12(f)_ , (i) neither
the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either alone or
in conjunction with any other event, (A) result in any payment or
benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to any director,
employee or independent contractor of WFB or any of WFBs Subsidiaries, (B)
increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable
or required to be provided to any such director, employee or
independent contractor, (C) result in the acceleration of the time of
payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit or compensation, (D) result
in any amount failing to be deductible by reason of IRC Section 280G or (E)
result in any limitation on the right of WFB or any of WFBs Subsidiaries to
amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any WFB Benefit
Plan or related trust and (ii) no WFB Benefit Plan provides for the
reimbursement of excise taxes under Section 4999 of the IRC or any income
taxes under the IRC.

  



  

(g) No payment made or to be made in respect of any employee or former
employee of WFB or any of its Subsidiaries is reasonably expected to
be nondeductible by reason of Section 162(m) of the IRC.

  



  

(h) Except as set forth on _WFB Disclosure Schedule 3.12 (h)_ , neither WFB
nor any of WFBs Subsidiaries has any liability with respect to an obligation
to provide post-employment welfare benefits (whether or not insured) with
respect to any person beyond their retirement or other termination
of service, other than coverage mandated by Section 4980B of the IRC
or applicable state or local law.

  



  

(i) Except as set forth on _WFB Disclosure Schedule 3.12 (i)_ , with respect

compulsory occupational disability insurance, and compulsory health and
safety insurance required to be made have been timely and properly made.

  



        
   

  



  

(j) All WFB Stock Options have been granted in compliance with the terms of
applicable WFB Benefit Plans and with the applicable provisions of the WFB
articles and bylaws as in effect at the applicable time, and all such WFB
Stock Options are accurately disclosed as required under applicable law
in the WFB SEC Reports (as defined below), including the financial
statements contained therein or attached thereto (if amended or superseded by
a filing with the SEC made prior to the date of this Agreement, as so amended
or superseded). In addition, WFB has not issued any WFB Stock Options or
Rights pertaining to shares of WFB Common Stock under any WFB Benefit Plan
with an exercise price that is less than the "fair market value" of the
underlying shares on the date of grant, as determined for financial
accounting purposes under GAAP.

  



  

(k) Neither WFB nor any of WFBs Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any
labor or collective bargaining agreement and to the Knowledge of WFB there
are no organizational campaigns, petitions or other activities or proceedings
of any labor union, workers council or labor organization
seeking recognition of a collective bargaining unit with respect to, or
otherwise attempting to represent, any of the employees of WFB or any of
WFBs Subsidiaries or compel WFB or any of WFBs Subsidiaries to bargain with

bound by, any consent decree with, or citation by, any Regulatory Authority
relating to employees or employment practices. Each of WFB and WFBs
Subsidiaries are in material compliance with all applicable laws relating to

including without limitation any report or statement required to be filed

any Regulatory Authority, and have paid all fees and assessments due and
payable in connection therewith, except where the failure to file such

4.13 _Employee Benefits._

  



  

(a) HNC has made available to WFB true and complete copies (or written
summaries describing) any written or unwritten employee benefit plan,
including any agreements, programs, policies or other arrangements whether or
not subject to ERISA, multiemployer plans within the meaning of ERISA Section
3(37), employee pension benefit plans within the meaning of ERISA Section
3(2), profit sharing plans, stock purchase plans, stock option plans,
severance plans, loans, change in controls, fringe benefits, bonus or
incentive plans, deferred compensation plans, supplemental income plans,
supplemental executive retirement plans, annual incentive plans, split-dollar
plans, group insurance plans, and all other employee welfare benefit plans
within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(1), vacation pay, sick leave, short-
term disability, long-term disability, life insurance, and medical plans, and
all other employee benefit plans, policies, agreements, arrangements, and any
funding mechanisms now in effect or required in the future as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, currently maintained or
contributed to or maintained or contributed to in any of the past six
calendar years for the benefit of past, present, or retired employees,
independent contractors, or directors or any beneficiaries thereunder or any
other entity (an "HNC ERISA Affiliate") (collectively "HNC Benefit Plans"),
all of which are set forth on _HNC Disclosure Schedule 4.13._

  



  

(b) With respect to each of the HNC Benefit Plans, to the best of HNCs
Knowledge, no event has occurred and there exists no condition or set of
circumstances in connection with which HNC or any of its Subsidiaries would
be subject to any liability that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on HNC. To the
best of HNCs Knowledge, HNC and each of its Subsidiaries have operated and
administered each HNC Benefit Plan in compliance with all applicable laws and
the terms of each such plan. The terms of each HNC Benefit Plan are in
compliance with all applicable laws. To the best of HNCs Knowledge, each HNC
Benefit Plan that is intended to be "qualified" under Section 401 and/or 409
of the IRC has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS to such
effect and, to the Knowledge of HNC, no fact, circumstance or event has
occurred or exists since the date of such determination letter that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such
HNC Benefit Plan. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of HNC,
threatened or anticipated claims by, on behalf of or against any of the HNC
Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries of such HNC Benefit Plan (with respect to whom
HNC has an indemnification obligation) with respect to their duties to any
HNC Benefit Plan, or against the assets of such HNC Benefit Plan or any trust
maintained in connection with such HNC Benefit Plan (other than routine
claims for benefits). All contributions, premiums and other payments required
to be made with respect to any HNC Benefit Plan have been made on or before
their due dates under applicable law and the terms of such HNC Benefit Plan,
and with respect to any such contributions, premiums or other payments
required to be made with respect to any HNC Benefit Plan that are not yet
due, to the extent required by GAAP, adequate reserves are reflected on the
consolidated balance sheet of HNC included in its SEC filings (including any
notes thereto) or liability therefor was incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice. There is not now, and to
the Knowledge of HNC there are no existing circumstances that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to, any requirement for the posting of
security with respect to a HNC Benefit Plan or the imposition of any pledge,
lien, security interest or encumbrance on the assets of HNC or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective HNC ERISA Affiliates

  



        
   

  



  

under ERISA or the IRC, or similar laws of foreign jurisdictions. No "excess
contributions" have been made that would be non-deductible or that would
subject HNC or any of HNCs Subsidiaries to the excise tax imposed under
Section 4972 of the IRC. To the extent any HNC Benefit Plan provides benefits
in the form of, or permits investment in, securities of HNC or any of HNCs
Subsidiaries, the interests in such HNC Benefit Plan are subject to a
current, effective registration statement under the Securities Act, or are
subject to an exemption from registration and the requirements of such
exemption have been satisfied, and the participants in such plan have been
provided a current prospectus to the extent required by applicable law.

  



  

(c) To the Knowledge of HNC, (i) no HNC Benefit Plan is under audit or is the
subject of an investigation by the IRS, the Department of Labor, the PBGC,
the SEC or any other Regulatory Authority, and (ii) no such audit or
investigation is pending or threatened.

  



  

(d) Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either alone or in
conjunction with any other event, (i) result in any payment or benefit
becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to any director,
employee or independent contractor of HNC or any of HNCs Subsidiaries, (ii)
increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable
or required to be provided to any such director, employee or independent
contractor, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting
or funding of any such benefit or compensation, (iv) result in any amount
failing to be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the IRC or (v) result
in any limitation on the right of HNC or any of HNCs Subsidiaries to amend,
merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any HNC Benefit Plan
or related trust.

  



  

(e) With respect to the employees of HNC and HNCs Subsidiaries, all social
security payments, including payments to any public pension scheme,
compulsory retirement insurance, unemployment insurance, compulsory long term
care insurance, compulsory occupational disability insurance, and compulsory
health and safety insurance required to be made have been timely and properly
made.

  



  

(f) All HNC Stock Options have been granted in compliance with the terms of
the applicable HNC Benefit Plans, with applicable law, and with the
applicable provisions of the HNC articles and bylaws as in effect at the
applicable time, and all such HNC Stock Options are accurately disclosed as
required under applicable law in the HNC SEC Reports (as defined below),
including the financial statements contained therein or attached thereto (if
amended or superseded by a filing with the SEC made prior to the date of this
Agreement, as so amended or superseded). In addition, HNC has not issued any
HNC Stock Options or Rights pertaining to shares of HNC Common Stock under
any HNC Benefit Plan with an exercise price that is less than the "fair
market value" of the underlying shares on the date of grant, as determined
for financial accounting purposes under GAAP.

  



  

(g) Neither HNC nor any of HNCs Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any
labor or collective bargaining agreement and there are no organizational
campaigns, petitions or other activities or proceedings of any labor union,
workers council or labor organization seeking recognition of a collective
bargaining unit with respect to, or otherwise attempting to represent,

  



        
   

  



  

any of the employees of HNC or any of HNCs Subsidiaries or compel HNC or any
of HNCs Subsidiaries to bargain with any such labor union, works council or
labor organization. There are no labor related controversies, strikes,
slowdowns, walkouts or other work stoppages pending or, to the Knowledge of
HNC, threatened and neither HNC nor any of HNCs Subsidiaries has experienced
any such labor related controversy, strike, slowdown, walkout or other work
stoppage within the past three years. Neither HNC nor any of HNCs
Subsidiaries is a party to, or otherwise bound by, any consent decree with,
or citation by, any Regulatory Authority relating to employees or employment
practices. Each of HNC and HNCs Subsidiaries are in compliance with all
applicable laws relating to labor, employment, termination of employment or
similar matters, including but not limited to laws relating to
discrimination, disability, labor relations, hours of work, payment of wages
and overtime wages, pay equity, immigration, workers compensation, working
conditions, employee scheduling, occupational safety and health, family and
medical leave, and employee terminations, and have not engaged in any unfair
labor practices or similar prohibited practices. Except as would not result
in any material liability to HNC or any of HNCs Subsidiaries, there are no
complaints, lawsuits, arbitrations, administrative proceedings, or other
proceedings of any nature pending or, to the Knowledge of HNC, threatened
against HNC or any of HNCs Subsidiaries brought by or on behalf of any
applicant for employment, any current or former employee, any person alleging
to be a current or former employee, any class of the foregoing, or any
Regulatory Authority, relating to any such law or regulation, or alleging
breach of any express or implied contract of employment, wrongful termination
of employment, or alleging any other discriminatory, wrongful or tortious
conduct in connection with the employment relationship. HNC has
made available to HNC a copy of all written policies and procedures related
to HNCs and HNCs Subsidiaries employees and a written description of all
material unwritten policies and procedures related to HNCs and HNCs
Subsidiaries employees.

  



  

(h) No material penalties have been imposed on HNC, any HNC Subsidiary, any
HNC Benefit Plan, or any employee, officer, director, administrator or agent
thereof under Sections 1176 or 1177 of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, as amended.

  



  

(i) Neither HNC nor any of HNCs Subsidiaries has taken any action to take
corrective action or make a filing under any voluntary correction program of
the IRS, Department of Labor or any other Regulatory Authority with respect
to any HNC Benefit Plan, and neither HNC nor any of HNCs Subsidiaries has
any Knowledge of any material plan defect that would qualify for correction
under any such program.

  



  

4.14 _Brokers and Finders_. Neither HNC, any HNC Subsidiary, nor any of
their respective officers, directors, employees, independent contractors or
agents, has employed any broker, finder, investment banker or financial
advisor, or incurred any liability for any fees or commissions to any such
person, in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, except for Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC ("Janney") whose engagement letter with HNC is included

proceedings, or demands, claims or notices, including without limitation
notices, demand letters or requests for information from any Regulatory
Authority, instituted or pending, or to the Knowledge of HNC, threatened, or

Subsidiary with respect to any property owned or operated by HNC or any HNC
Subsidiary under any Environmental Law, except as to any such actions or
other matters which would not result in a Material Adverse Effect on HNC.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth on _HNC Disclosure Schedule 4.15(b)_ , no property,
now or formerly owned or operated by HNC or any HNC Subsidiary or on which
HNC or any HNC Subsidiary holds or held a mortgage or other security interest
or has foreclosed or taken a deed in lieu of foreclosure, has been listed or
proposed for listing on the NPL under CERCLA, is listed on the CERCLIS, or is
listed or proposed to be listed on any state list similar to the NPL or the
CERCLIS, or is the subject of federal, state or local enforcement actions or
other investigations which would reasonably be likely to lead to claims
against HNC or any HNC Subsidiary for response costs, remedial work,
investigation, damage to natural resources or for personal injury or property
damage, including, but not limited to, claims under CERCLA, which would have
a Material Adverse Effect on HNC.

require HNC to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any
conditions or restrictions, in connection with obtaining the foregoing

and regulations to consummate and make effective, as soon as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, the Contemplated Transactions including, if
necessary, appealing any adverse ruling in respect of any Application.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
require HNC to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any
conditions or restrictions, in connection with obtaining the foregoing
permits, consents, approvals and

legal counsel, that failure to do so would result in a breach by such
directors of their fiduciary duties.

business days, in reasonable detail, as to any inquiries and proposals
relating to an Acquisition Proposal which it or any of its representatives or

this Agreement. If consistent with its fiduciary duties, the Board of
Directors of HNC shall recommend adoption of this Agreement by the

in positions that will contribute to the successful performance of the
combined organization. During the period prior to the Effective Time, HNC
will cooperate with WFB to identify the roles that WFBs current employees
will be expected to play with HNC, HNC Bank or other HNC Subsidiary after the
Effective Time. If prior to the Effective Time or within one year after the
Effective Time, HNC elects to displace or eliminate a position of an employee
not subject to an employment or change of control agreement for reasons other
than cause, then HNC will make severance payment of two (2) weeks of
compensation for each year of the employees combined service with WFB and
WFB Bank (subject to applicable taxes and withholding requirements), with a
minimum of  four (4) weeks up to a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks.
Terminated WFB employees will have the right to continue coverage under the
group health plans of HNC or HNC Bank in accordance with IRC Section 4980(f).
During the severance payment term or until the employee is enrolled in
another health plan, whichever occurs first, HNC will continue to pay the
employers share of medical benefits that it pays for its
employees generally, provided that any coverage period required under IRC
4980B shall run concurrently with the period that HNC pays the employers
share of health coverage under this Section.

  



  

(B) WFBs employees who become employees of HNC and its Subsidiaries (the
"Continuing Employees") will, immediately upon Effective Time, be eligible
for all HNC Benefit Plans that are generally available to HNC employees upon
the terms of the HNC Benefit Plans applicable from time to time. The
Continuing Employees will be given full credit for years of service with WFB
for purposes of eligibility and vesting, but not for purposes of calculating
benefit amounts, under HNCs applicable employee benefit plans.

  



  

(C) HNC shall have no obligation to provide to any directors, officers or
employees of WFB or any WFB Subsidiary any benefits of any sort other than,
as to employees of WFB, HNCs normal and customary benefits for HNCs
employees.

  



  

(D) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, before, at or
promptly after the Effective Time, HNC shall have the right to freeze, merge
or terminate the existing WFB Benefit Plans and where applicable transfer its
assets into HNCs existing 401(k) plan or shall have WFB freeze or terminate
any existing WFB Benefit Plan.

  



  

(E) Employees of WFB shall not be deemed third party beneficiaries of the
commitments set forth in this Section 5.08.

  



        
   

  



  

(iv) _Election of HNC Bank Directors_.

  



  

(A) Upon consummation of the Merger and subject to compliance with all

Directors (each, a "WFB/HNC Bank Director") as directors of HNC Bank,
effective the Effective Date, each to hold office until his successor is
elected and qualified or otherwise in accordance with applicable law, the
articles of association and bylaws of HNC Bank.

  



  

(1) The WFB/HNC Directors who are elected to serve on the HNC Bank Board will
be compensated for such service after the Effective Date in the same manner
and in the same amounts as all other directors of HNC who serve on the HNC
Bank Board are compensated.

  



  

(v) _Indemnification, Insurance_.

  



  

(A) From and after the Effective Time, HNC shall indemnify and hold harmless
each present and former director, officer, employee and agent of WFB or a
Subsidiary of WFB, as applicable, determined as of the Effective Time, other
than former directors under criminal indictment or current criminal
proceedings as of the date of this Agreement, (the "Indemnified Parties")
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), amounts
paid in settlement as provided below, judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to the fact
that he or she is or was a director, officer or employee of WFB or, while a
director, officer or employee of WFB, is or was serving at the request of WFB
as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
association, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise to the
fullest extent which such Indemnified Parties would be entitled under the BCL
and HNCs articles of incorporation and bylaws (which right to
indemnification shall include the advancement of reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation upon receipt from an Indemnified Party of any
required undertaking).

  



  

(B) Prior to the Effective Date, HNC shall use its reasonable best efforts
(and WFB shall cooperate and assist prior to the Effective Date in these
efforts), at no expense to the beneficiaries, to:

  



  

(1) maintain directors and officers liability insurance ("DandO Insurance")
for the Indemnified Parties with respect to matters occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, issued by a carrier assigned a claims-paying ability
rating by A.M. Best and Co. of "A (Excellent)" or higher; or

  



  

(2) obtain coverage for Prior Acts for the Indemnified Parties under a
directors and officers tail liability insurance policy;

  



        
   

  



  

effective at the Effective Time, in either case, providing at least the same
coverage as the DandO Insurance currently maintained by WFB and containing
terms and conditions which are no less favorable to the beneficiaries, for a
six-year period after the Effective Date; provided, that HNC shall not be
obligated to make annual premium payments for such six-year period in respect
of the DandO Insurance which exceed, for the portion related to WFBs directors
and officers, 200% of the annual premium payment, as of December 31, 2007,
under WFBs current policy in effect on the date of this Agreement (the
"Maximum Amount"). If the amount of the premiums necessary to maintain or
procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, HNC shall use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of
directors and officers liability insurance obtainable for a premium equal
to the Maximum Amount.

  



  

(C) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
5.08(c)(v)(C), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify HNC. In the event of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether arising before or
after the Effective Time, (i) HNC shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if HNC
elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Party and
advises the Indemnified Party that there are issues that raise conflicts of
interest between HNC and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may
retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to HNC, and HNC shall pay,
promptly as statements therefore are received, the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Party, which may not exceed one
firm in any jurisdiction, (ii) the Indemnified Party will cooperate in the
defense of any such matter, (iii) HNC shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent which shall not be unreasonably
withheld and (iv) HNC shall have no obligation hereunder in the event that a
federal or state banking agency or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable laws and regulations.

  



  

5.09 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement is intended to give HNC, directly or indirectly, the right
to control or direct WFBs or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of HNC and WFB shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its (and its respective Subsidiaries)
respective operations.

8.07 _Disclosure Schedules_. Information contained on either the WFB
Disclosure Schedule or the HNC Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to cover
the express disclosure requirement contained in a representation or warranty
of this Agreement and any other representation or warranty of this Agreement
of such party where it is clearly cross-referenced to such Disclosure
Schedule with specificity and incorporated therein. The mere inclusion of an
item in a

  



        
   

  



  

Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not
be deemed an admission by a party that such item represents a material
exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is or could result
in a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

8.08 _Captions_. The captions contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and are not part of this Agreement.

shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the

parties need not sign the same counterpart. A facsimile or other electronic

execution in writing for purposes of execution of this Agreement.

  



  

8.10 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, and if any provision
