(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the
Closing, the Seller shall sell or cause to be sold, assigned transferred or
delivered, (i) all of the Securities and the Transferred Interests, and the
Purchaser shall, and the Parents shall cause the Purchaser to, purchase from
the Seller all of the Securities and the Transferred Interests, free and clear
of all Encumbrances other than restrictions or other Encumbrances specifically
set forth in the Organizational Documents provided or made available to the

shall not include any Economic Interests), and (ii) all of the Roseland
Property Assets, and the Purchaser shall, and the Parents shall cause the

(a) Subject to adjustment as set forth in subsection (b) of this Section 2.02
and Section 2.06 and Section 2.07, the consideration for all of the
Securities, the Roseland Property Assets and the Transferred Interests shall
be an aggregate amount (the " _Purchase Price_ ") equal to (i) One Hundred
Fifteen Million Fifteen Thousand Nine Hundred Thirty Two Dollars
($115,015,932) in

 



      
 

 



 

cash, to be paid at Closing in accordance with subsection (c) hereof (the "
_Closing Cash Payment_ "), plus (ii) the assumption of the Assumed Roseland
Property Liabilities, plus (iii) the Earnout contemplated by subsection (d)
hereof.

 



 

(b) The Closing Cash Payment shall be:

 



 

(A) increased by the amount of Cash on the Closing Date, net of checks then
outstanding (it being understood that if such amount is a negative number,
such amount shall be subtracted from, rather than added to, the Closing Cash
Payment);

 



 

(B) decreased by the amount of Indebtedness of the Companies to be repaid in
accordance with the Payoff Letters (as herein defined); and

 



 

(C) increased by the amount by which the Estimated Working Capital exceeds the

(c) At the Closing, the sum of Thirty Four Million Seventy Nine Thousand Six
Hundred Eighty Four Dollars ($34,079,684) (the " _Escrow Deposit_ ") shall be
deducted from the Closing Cash Payment and shall be deposited by Purchaser in
escrow with US Bank Corporate Trust Services, as escrow agent (the " _Escrow
Agent_ "), pursuant to and in accordance with an Escrow Agreement among
Seller, Purchaser, the Parents and the Escrow Agent, in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Indemnity Escrow Agreement_ "), and the balance

Agreement.

 



 

(d) As additional consideration for the Securities, the Roseland Property
Assets and the Transferred Interests, the Purchaser agrees to pay, and the
Parents agree to cause the Purchaser to pay, in cash, an aggregate amount of
up to Fifteen Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($15,600,000) (the "
_Earnout_ "), to be determined in the manner set forth in _Exhibit C_ hereto,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, and, to the
extent so earned, payable in the manner and at the times set forth therein.
The Purchase Price shall be deemed to include and be increased by any amounts
payable to Seller pursuant to _Exhibit C_.

Interests in the manner required by Section 1060 of the Code, to the extent
applicable, and in any event as shown on the Allocation Schedule attached
hereto as Schedule 2.02(e). The parties agree that the form of the
transactions (and the consideration therefor) provided for in this Agreement
and in the Ancillary Agreements were arrived at on the basis of arms-length
negotiation among the parties, and will be respected by them for Federal,
state, local and other Tax reporting purposes

none of them will assert or maintain a position inconsistent with the
foregoing.

 



 

(f) Purchaser shall comply with N.J.S.A. 54:32B-22(c) and N.J.S.A. 54:50-38 in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, and Seller shall cooperate, to the extent reasonably required, in
connection with such compliance. In furtherance thereof: (i) Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Purchaser the Asset Transfer Tax Declaration (the "
_TTD_ ") in the form prescribed by the Director (the " _Director_ ") of the
New Jersey Division of Taxation (the " _Division_ "), so that such form is
received by Purchaser prior to the date of this Agreement; and (ii) Purchaser
shall deliver a Notification of Sale, Transfer or Assignment in Bulk (Form
C-9600) (a " _Tax Notification_ "), together with the completed TTD and a copy
of this Agreement to the Director, by overnight delivery sent no later than
one day after the date of this Agreement. Seller shall promptly provide all
information reasonably requested by any of Purchaser or Parents to enable
Purchaser to complete the Tax Notification. If, at any time prior to Closing,
the Director informs Purchaser that the Division may have a claim for Taxes
imposed or to be imposed on Seller (a " _NJ Tax Claim_ "), including, without
limitation, any Tax on any gain realized from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and any interest or penalties on
delinquent amounts, then the parties shall proceed to Closing in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, _provided_ , that, at the Closing, (A)
Seller and Purchaser shall mutually execute and deliver to each other and to
the Escrow Agent, and Purchaser shall cause the Escrow Agent to execute and
deliver to Seller and Purchaser, an Escrow Agreement in the form annexed
hereto as _Exhibit H_ (the " _Tax Escrow Agreement_ "), (B) Purchaser shall
withhold from the Closing Cash Payment an amount equal to the NJ Tax Claim and
(C) the Escrow Agent shall hold such amount (hereinafter referred to as the "
_Tax Escrow_ ") in escrow in accordance with the terms of the Tax Escrow
Agreement. If, after Closing, the Director or Seller requests that Purchaser
pay all or any portion of the NJ Tax Claim on behalf of Seller, Purchaser
shall direct the Escrow Agent to, and the Escrow Agent shall, promptly release
to the Division of Taxation such amount from the Tax Escrow. If the Director
informs Purchaser that the NJ Tax Claim has been fully paid or that Parents
and Purchaser have no further liability for the NJ Tax Claim, Purchaser shall
direct the Escrow Agent to, and the Escrow Agent shall, promptly release the
Tax Escrow (or the balance thereof) to Seller. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, Seller shall have the right to negotiate with the
Director regarding the NJ Tax Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i)
Purchaser shall be entitled to comply with all instructions of the Director;
(ii) the Closing shall not be delayed as a result of such negotiations; and
(iii) none of Parents or Purchaser shall be liable for any amount in excess of
the Tax Escrow.

(ii) The Seller shall have the right to dispute any amounts reflected on the
Closing Statement of Working Capital, by written notice setting forth each
disputed item, specifying the estimated amount thereof in dispute and setting
forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for such dispute, delivered to the
Parents within thirty (30) Business Days of the delivery of the Closing
Statement of Working Capital to the Seller. The Purchaser shall provide to the
Seller and its designated independent public accountants access to such of the
Companies records that were delivered to Purchaser prior to or at the
Closing, as well as any other records, as may reasonably be required for the
review of the Closing Statement of Working Capital. In the event of such a

the items remaining in dispute for resolution to EisnerAmper LLP or another
independent public accounting firm of national reputation mutually acceptable
to Purchaser and Seller, _provided_ , that neither Purchaser, the Parents,
Seller or any of the Principals has had a prior relationship with such firm

(60) days after such submission, determine and report (in a written, reasoned
manner) to the Seller and the Purchaser upon such remaining disputed items,
and such report shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Seller and the
Purchaser. The Independent Accounting Firm may, at its discretion, conduct a
conference concerning the disputes, at which conference each party shall have
the right to present additional documents, materials and other information and
to have present its advisors, counsel and accountants. In connection with such
process, there shall be no other hearings or any oral examinations, testimony,
depositions, discovery or other similar proceedings. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall address only those issues in dispute, shall make its
decision solely on the basis of the evidence and position papers presented to
it, and may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for
such item claimed by a party or less than the smallest value for such item
claimed by a party. The Independent Accounting Firm shall determine the
proportion of its fees and expenses to be paid by each of Seller and
Purchaser, based primarily on the degree to which the Independent Accounting
Firm has accepted the positions of the respective parties. In acting under
this Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm shall be entitled to the
privileges and immunities of arbitrators.

 



 

(d) _Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Closing Statement of Working Capital

Capital being deemed final and binding, a Purchase Price adjustment shall be
made as follows:

 



 

(A) In the event that the Estimated Working Capital exceeds the Closing Net
Working Capital reflected on the final Closing Statement of Working Capital,
then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward in an amount equal to such
excess and the Seller shall pay the amount of such excess to the Purchaser by
wire transfer in immediately available funds; or

 



 

(B) In the event that the Closing Net Working Capital reflected on the final
Closing Statement of Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Working Capital,
then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward in an amount equal to such
excess and the Purchaser shall pay, and the Parents shall cause the Purchaser
to pay, the amount of such excess to the Seller by wire transfer in
immediately available funds.

 



 

(e) _Interest on Payments_. Any payments required to be made pursuant to
Section 2.06(d) shall bear interest from the date of the Closing through the
date of payment at the weighted average of the prime rate of interest
published by Citibank, N.A. (or any successor thereto) from time to time as
its reference prime rate from the date of the Closing to the date of each
payment.

 



 

Section 2.07. _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment for Certain Fees
Shortfall_. If, during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on

their Affiliates (collectively, the " _Applicable Agreements_ ") (exclusive of
any expense reimbursements) shall be less than $2,000,000 in the aggregate,
then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward in an amount equal to the
shortfall (the " _Fee Shortfall Amount_ "). As promptly as practicable after
the expiration of the Fee Measuring Period, Purchaser and the Parents shall
provide to Seller a written statement (the " _Fee Computation Statement_ ")
setting forth (a) the amount of gross fees received by the Companies (or any
entity in which Purchaser or its Affiliates own an interest of at least 50%)
from the Applicable Agreements during the Fee Measuring Period and (b) a
computation of the Fee Shortfall Amount (if any), together with reasonable
backup therefor. The Seller shall pay the Fee Shortfall Amount (if any) to
the Purchaser by wire transfer in immediately available funds within fifteen
(15) Business Days after the date of delivery of the Fee Computation
Statement.

to the maximum extent practicable, cause, to observe the terms of this Section
5.08(c).

 



 

(d) Seller and the Principals agree that Purchasers and the Parents remedies
at law for any breach or threat of breach by Seller or the Principals of the
provisions of this Section 5.08 will be inadequate, and that Purchaser and/or
the Parents shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, without the
necessity for the posting of a bond or other collateral security, to prevent
breaches of the provisions of this Section 5.08 and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof. If, at the time of the enforcement of this
Section 5.08, a court shall hold that the duration, scope, area or other
restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under the circumstances then
existing, each of the Seller, the Principals, the Purchaser and the Parents
agree that it is the

 



      
 

 



 

intention of the parties hereto that such provision should be enforceable to
the maximum extent permissible under applicable Law.

 



 

(e) Each of the Seller and the Principals acknowledge that the covenants of
the Seller and the Principals set forth in this Section 5.08 are an essential
element of this Agreement and that, but for the agreement of the Seller to
comply with the covenant, the Purchaser and the Parents would not have entered
into this Agreement. Each of the Seller and the Principals acknowledge that
this Section 5.08 constitutes an independent covenant that shall not be
affected by the performance or nonperformance of any other provision of this
Agreement by the Purchaser and the Parents. Purchaser and the Parents
acknowledge and agree that if a Principal breaches a covenant or agreement
contained in this Section 5.08, the Purchaser and the Parents shall not be
entitled to assert a claim against, or otherwise recover damages from, the
Seller or the other Principals; it being agreed that the sole recourse shall
be against the breaching Principal. Each of the Principals and the Seller and
the Principals have independently consulted with their counsel and after such
consultation agree that the covenants set forth in this Section 5.08 are
reasonable and proper.

 



 

Section 5.09. _Use of the Roseland Name_. After the Closing, neither Seller
nor Roseland Property or any of the Principals shall use the names or marks
"Roseland," "Roseland Partners," "Roseland Management" or any derivative
thereof reasonably likely to be confused with the names of the Companies for
commercial purposes, and Seller shall promptly change its name, and cause
Roseland Property to change its name, so as to comply with the foregoing. The
parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the names and marks referenced in
the immediately preceding sentence shall constitute Assets for all purposes of
this Agreement, and shall not constitute Excluded Assets.

 



 

Section 5.10. _Excluded Assets_. Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall cause
the Companies (other than Roseland Property) to distribute the Excluded Assets
to Seller.

 



 

Section 5.11. _Further Action_. The parties hereto shall use all reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, to do or
cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law, and to execute and deliver such documents and other papers, as may be
required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the most
expeditious manner practicable.

 



 

Section 5.12. _Conveyance Taxes_. The Seller shall be liable for, shall hold
the Purchaser and the Parents harmless against, and agrees to pay any and all
Conveyance Taxes that may be imposed upon, or payable or collectible or
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, other than Conveyance Taxes that by statute are payable in the first
instance by the transferee or purchaser (e.g., N.J.S.A. 54:15C-1 et. seq.), as
to which the Parents shall be liable for and hold the Seller harmless against.
The Purchaser and the Seller agree to cooperate in the execution and delivery
of all instruments and certificates necessary to enable the Seller and the
Purchaser to comply with any pre-Closing filing requirements.

 



 

Section 5.13. _Insurance_. Seller hereby covenants and agrees to make any
claim, on behalf of the Companies, at the request of the Purchaser, for any
Loss which is covered by an insurance policy

 



      
 

 



 

owned by Seller and not included in the Assets and to use reasonable best
efforts in the recovery of said insurance proceeds. Furthermore, the Seller
hereby covenants and agrees to pay to the Purchaser any insurance proceeds
actually recovered from said claims. All rights to uncollected proceeds which
vested in the Seller prior to the Closing Date shall be conveyed, transferred
and assigned to the Purchaser in connection with this Agreement, and the
Seller shall waive any and rights or claims with respect to such proceeds.

 



 

Section 5.14. _Economic Benefits of Assignment_. If any note, bond, mortgage
or indenture, contract, agreement, lease, sublease, Permit or other instrument
or arrangement to be transferred or assigned to Purchaser, the Parents or any
of their Affiliates under the terms of this Agreement or in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby may not be transferred or assigned
without a Third Party Consent or Governmental Consent and the transfer or
assignment or attempted transfer or assignment would constitute a breach
thereof or a violation of any Law, nothing in this Agreement or in any
Ancillary Agreement will be deemed a transfer or assignment or an attempted
transfer or assignment thereof. The Seller will use its commercially
reasonable efforts after the Closing to secure all Governmental Consents, and
Seller shall cooperate fully with the Purchaser and the Parents after the
closing to obtain all Remaining Third Party Consents, and all costs and fees
payable to or on behalf of the consenting Person (including such consenting
Persons attorneys fees) associated with obtaining such Remaining Third Party
Consents and Governmental Consents shall be borne by the Seller, whether or
not the terms of such Remaining Third Party Consents or Governmental Consents
provide otherwise, as provided in Section 5.07. Without limiting any other
provision of this Agreement, if any Remaining Third Party Consents or
Governmental Consents are not (for any reason) obtained within a reasonable
time following the Closing, then the Seller will cooperate (at its expense) in
any reasonable arrangement requested by the Purchaser and the Parents to
transfer to the Purchaser the economic benefit for all periods after the
Closing of any such note, bond, mortgage or indenture, contract, agreement,
lease, sublease, Permit or other instrument or arrangement (any of the
foregoing, an " _Affected Agreement_ ") as to which a Remaining Third Party
Consent or Governmental Consent is not obtained, including by enforcement for
the benefit of the Purchaser of any and all rights of the Seller against any
other party thereto, and all payments received by the Seller under any
Affected Agreement for all periods after the Closing will be immediately paid
over to the Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser and the Parents
shall be responsible for making any payments due from, and otherwise
performing the obligations of, the Seller, the SPVs and/or the Principals
accruing or to be paid or performed after the Closing in respect of such
Affected Agreement. The Parents and the Purchasers consummation of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement shall not abridge the Parents,
the Purchasers or the Seller obligations under this Section 5.14, which
obligations shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and the Closing,
and remain in full force and effect thereafter.

 



 

Section 5.15. _REIT Issues_. The Seller hereby acknowledges the status of MCRC
as a REIT. The Purchaser and MCRC intend to operate and manage, or cause to be
operated or managed, the Companies (other than Roseland Property), Transferred
Entities and Property Owners in a manner so that: (a) MCRCs gross income
meets the tests provided in Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code; (b) MCRCs
assets meet the tests provided in Section 856(c)(4) of the Code; and (c) MCRC
minimizes federal, state, local and excise taxes that may be incurred by MCRC,
or any of its Affiliates, including taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or
4981 of the Code. Notwithstanding

 



      
 

 



 

anything in this Section 5.16 to the contrary, the Seller shall have no
obligation to take any action that would increase the Sellers or its direct
or indirect equity holders liability for Taxes for a Pre-Closing Period or a
Pre-Closing Straddle Period, including any Taxes payable with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.16. _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Seller shall be liable for and timely pay any and all Taxes with
respect to the ownership or operations of the Companies, Property Owners and
the Transferred Entities (each to the extent of Sellers interest therein) for
all Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Except as otherwise
provided herein with respect to Straddle Periods, Purchaser or the Parents
shall be liable for and timely pay any and all Taxes with respect to the
ownership or operations of the Companies and, to the extent of its interest
therein, the Transferred Entities and Property Owners for all Tax periods
ending after the Closing Date. In any case where applicable law does not
permit any Company or Transferred Entity or Property Owner to close its Tax
year as of the Closing Date or in any case in which a Tax is assessed with
respect to a Tax period which includes the Closing Date (but does not begin or
end on that day), then Taxes, if any, attributable to the Tax period of any
Company or any Transferred Entity or Property Owner beginning before and
ending after the Closing Date shall be allocated to and be payable by (i) the
Seller (to the extent of its ownership interest therein) for the period up to
and including the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Straddle Period_ ") and
(ii) the Purchasers or the Parents (to the extent of their ownership interest
therein) for the period after the Closing Date (the " _Post- Closing Straddle
Period_ " and together with a Pre-Closing Straddle Period, a " _Straddle
Period_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligations of Seller and
Purchaser for Taxes with respect to a Transferred Entity or Property Owner
shall be to the extent of their interests therein. The Seller shall prepare
and timely file (including applicable filing extensions), or shall cause to be
prepared and timely filed (including applicable filing extensions), all Tax
Returns for the Companies, the Controlled Property Owners and the Controlled
Transferred Entities for Tax periods ended on or prior to the Closing Date (a
" _Pre-Closing Tax Return_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller shall
provide the Purchaser and the Parents with a copy of any such Pre-Closing Tax
Return no later than fifteen (15) calendar days prior to filing such Pre-
Closing Tax Return and shall within five (5) calendar days of filing provide
the Purchaser and the Parents with a copy of any such Pre-Closing Tax Return
filed with any taxing authority. All Pre-Closing Tax Returns shall be prepared
in a manner consistent with the reporting of all items of income or loss on
prior Tax Returns of any Company or any Controlled Transferred Entity or any
Controlled Property Owner, unless otherwise required by applicable laws. The
Purchaser or the Parents shall prepare and shall timely file (including
applicable filing extensions) or cause to be prepared and timely filed
(including applicable filing extensions) all Tax Returns for the Companies,
the Controlled Property Owners and the Controlled Transferred Entities for Tax
periods which begin before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date ("
_Straddle Returns_ "). Straddle Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the reporting of all items of income and loss on prior Tax
Returns of any Company or any Controlled Transferred Entity or any Controlled
Property Owner, unless otherwise required by applicable Laws, and to the
extent they involve an allocation of Taxes as to a Pre-Closing Straddle
Period. Purchaser shall provide a copy of such return to Seller no later than
15 days prior to filing such return and such return shall be subject to
Sellers approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Taxes payable
with Straddle Returns shall be apportioned to the Pre-Closing Straddle

 



       
 

 



 

Period and Post-Closing Straddle Period, as described above, based on an
assumed Tax period ending on the date of Closing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Taxes not based on income or receipts shall be apportioned to the Pre-
Closing Straddle Period and Post-Closing Straddle Period based on the number
of days in each such Tax period.

 



 

(b) If any claim, demand, assessment (including a notice of proposed
assessment) or other assertion is made with respect to Taxes against the
Seller or the Purchaser or the Parents the calculation of which involves a
specific matter covered in this Agreement (" _Tax Claim_ ") or if the
Purchaser or the Parents receives any notice from any Governmental Authority
with respect to any current or future audit, examination, investigation or
other proceeding (" _Proceeding_ ") involving the Seller, the Purchaser or the
Parents or that otherwise involves a specific matter covered in this Agreement
that could directly or indirectly materially affect the Seller (adversely or
otherwise), then the Purchaser or the Parents, as applicable, shall promptly
notify Seller of such Tax Claim or Proceeding. Any Proceeding that could
increase Sellers or any SPVs, or any of their respective direct or indirect
equity holders liability for Taxes for a Pre-Closing Period or a Pre-Closing
Straddle Period or could give rise to a claim for indemnification under this
Agreement shall be considered material to Seller.

 



 

(c) Seller shall have the right to control the defense, settlement or
compromise of any Proceeding or Tax Claim with respect to the ownership or
operations of the Companies or the Controlled Transferred Entities or
Controlled Property Owners for any Tax period ended on or prior to the Closing
Date (" _Pre-Closing Period_ "), unless any such action would reasonably be
expected to result in a material adverse Tax effect or a liability or material
increase in liability to the Purchaser or the Parents for any Tax period, in
which case, such action may not be taken without Purchasers or the Parents
consent. The Purchaser or MCRC shall have the right to control the defense,
settlement or compromise of any Proceeding or Tax Claim with respect to the
ownership or operations of the Companies or the Controlled Property Owners or
the Controlled Transferred Entities for any Tax period ending after the
Closing Date (" _Post-Closing Period_ "), unless any such action could
reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse Tax effect or a
liability or material increase in liability to Seller or any SPVs, or any of
their respective direct or indirect equity holders for any Tax period, in
which case, such action may not be taken without Sellers consent. Subject to
the provision of this Section 5.17(c), neither Seller nor the Purchaser or the
Parents shall consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to a Tax Claim or Proceeding without the prior written
consent of the other party to the extent that such Proceeding or Tax Claim
could directly or indirectly materially affect (adversely or otherwise) the
other party; _provided_ , that each such party shall keep the other party duly
and contemporaneously informed of the progress thereof and shall afford the
other party the right to review and comment on any and all submissions made to
the IRS or any Governmental Authority with respect to such Tax Claim or
Proceeding and shall consider any such comments in good faith. As a condition
to withholding its consent to a settlement proposal (i) a party must have a
reasonable basis to believe that such settlement would have a material adverse
Tax effect or material increase in liability to such party or any of its
Affiliates, or any of their respective direct or indirect equity holders;
_provided_ , that if for any period ending after the Closing a proposed
settlement does not increase Sellers or any SPVs or any of their direct or
indirect respective equity holders liability for Taxes for a Pre-Closing
Period or a Pre-Closing Straddle Period and could not give rise to a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, then such impact

 



      
 

 



 

shall not be deemed material to Seller unless it is different than the impact
to other holders of equity in the applicable entity other than Seller, and
(ii) a party must believe, based on the advice of a recognized accounting or
law firm, that it is more likely than not that the position asserted by the
party seeking consent would prevail if it were to be asserted in a judicial
proceeding. A party withholding its consent shall offer to assume the
subsequent costs of defending and asserting the positions asserted by such
party, and shall indemnify the other party for any taxes and related interest
and penalties resulting from a subsequent judgment in excess of the amounts
that would have been imposed pursuant to the rejected settlement (but not any
other costs associated with such proceeding or any other issues involved
therein).

 



 

(d) From and after the Closing, the parties shall provide each other with such
assistance as may reasonably be requested by any of them in connection with
(i) the preparation of any Tax Return, election, consent or certificate
required to be prepared by any party hereto or (ii) any Tax Claim or
Proceeding. Such assistance shall include making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder and shall include providing copies of any
relevant Tax Returns and supporting work schedules.

 



 

Section 5.17. _NJ Lease_. MCRLP shall assume the NJ Lease as of the Closing
Date. Monthly base rent for the month in which the Closing Date occurs and
real estate Taxes shall be prorated between Seller and Purchaser on a daily
basis. On the Closing Date, MCRLP and Seller shall execute and deliver to one
another an assignment and assumption agreement pursuant to which Seller shall
assign its rights as tenant under the NJ Lease and MCRLP shall assume Sellers
corresponding obligations under the NJ Lease, in each case accruing for
periods from and after the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 5.18. _Seller to Remain in Existence_. Seller shall not, and the
Principals shall cause Seller to not, liquidate or dissolve (voluntarily or
involuntarily) until after the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date.
During the period beginning on the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date
and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall,
and the Principals shall cause Seller to, maintain a net worth (based on the
fair market value of the Sellers assets) of not less than $10,000,000;
_provided_ , _however_ , that from and after a Change of Control of MCRC,
Seller shall no longer be required to comply with this net worth requirement.
On the last day of each calendar year following the Closing Date prior to the
calendar year in which the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date shall
occur, and also on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller
shall, and the Principals shall cause Seller to, certify to the Parents and
the Purchaser in writing that the requirements of this Section 5.18 have been
met at all times following the Closing Date, together with reasonable evidence
to support such certification.

 



 

Section 5.19. _Transitional Assistance_. Subject to the limitation set forth
in this Section 5.19, for so long as any of the Principals continue to be
employed by Purchaser, Parents or any of their Affiliates, MCRC shall, at no
cost to Seller, permit the personnel formerly employed by the Seller or its
Affiliates (" _Transitional Personnel_ ") to provide to Seller (i) certain
minimal management, development and administrative services with respect to
the assets listed on Section 3.26 of the Disclosure Schedule and general
bookkeeping and administrative matters (and no additional assets, properties
and matters shall be included from and after the date hereof), and (ii)
services in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with any matters related to the terms of this Agreement (the "
_Transitional Assistance_ "). In no event shall the Transitional Assistance
unreasonably interfere with the Transitional Personnels duties and
responsibilities to Purchaser, Parents or any of their Affiliates.

 



 

Section 5.20. _CDM Smith Litigation Settlement_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the Seller shall be solely responsible for
making all payments required to be made and for performing all obligations
required to be performed by Overlook Ridge, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (" _Overlook_ "), under the terms of that certain settlement
agreement, dated as of July 2012 (the " _Settlement Agreement_ "), by and
between CDM Smith Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (" _CDM Smith_ "), and
Overlook, and Seller shall timely make all such payments and shall perform all
such obligations required to be made or performed by Overlook in accordance
with the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, except as set forth in the immediately following
sentence, the parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that Seller shall
have no right of contribution against Overlook, the Companies, the Transferred
Entities, the Roseland Property Assets, Parents or Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates with respect to any of the foregoing, and the Seller
hereby unconditionally, fully and finally releases Overlook, the Companies,
the Transferred Entities, the Roseland Property Assets, Parents, Purchaser and
their respective Affiliates from any claim of any kind or nature for, and
waives any and all rights of every kind or character with respect to,
indemnification or contribution by Overlook, the Companies, the Transferred
Entities, the Roseland Property Assets, Parents or Purchaser or their
respective Affiliates with respect to (i) all payments required to be made and
obligations required to be performed by Overlook under the terms of the
Settlement Agreement, (ii) the pending litigation entitled _CDM Smith Inc. v.
Overlook Ridge, LLC_ , Middlesex County Superior Court Civil Action No.
2012-00874, and (iii) any default or breach of the Settlement Agreement.
However, if Overlook sells sites 2C and 3B in Malden, Massachusetts to
Overlook Ridge Apartments Investors, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(the " _UBS Venture_ "), a joint venture comprised of an Affiliate of UBS, on
the one hand, and an Affiliate of Overlook, on the other hand, as contemplated
in accordance with the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of August 22, 2012
between Overlook and the UBS Venture, then $900,000 of the proceeds of such
sale shall be applied as follows: (i) if and to extent that there are
Installments (as defined in the Settlement Agreement) remaining to be paid to
CDM Smith, that portion of the $900,000 equal to the amount of the remaining
Installments shall be paid by Overlook to CDM Smith and thereby reduce or
extinguish any liability of Seller with respect thereto; (ii) if there is any
portion of the $900,000 remaining after the payment to CDM Smith as provided
in clause (i), such excess shall be paid to Seller by Overlook (and Purchaser
and the Parents shall cause Overlook to do so, to the extent they have the
ability to do so); and (iii) if any of the Installments remain unpaid after
the payment to CDM Smith as provided in clause (i), Seller shall continue to
be liable to pay such unpaid Installments (or the remaining portion thereof)
as and when due. Further, if the sale of sites 2C and 3B in Malden,
Massachusetts to the UBS Venture referenced above is not consummated on or
prior to March 31, 2013, then the immediately preceding sentence shall not
apply.

 



 

Section 5.21. _Prepaid Umbrella Premium Adjustment_. Roseland Property is the
named insured under two (2) excess liability insurance policies (each, an "
_Excess Policy_ " and, together, the " _Excess Policies_ ") issued by
Lexington Insurance Company and AIG Excess Liability Insurance Company Ltd.
(collectively, the " _Excess Insurers_ ") (Policy nos. 17726691 and 1730940,

 



      
 

 



 

respectively), which policies are prepaid through December 31, 2017 for
projects enrolled in such policies. Based on the terms of the Excess Policies,
the premiums already paid by Seller to the Excess Insurers would permit
Roseland Property or its Affiliates to enroll additional development projects
for coverage under the Excess Policies at no additional cost. Premiums for
enrolling a new development project for coverage under the Excess Policies is
determined by the Excess Insurers based on the amount of construction costs
associated with the construction of the project. Sellers prepaid premiums
(after reflecting the reservation of a portion of the prepaid premiums to
cover additional phases of a project owned by one of the assets to be retained
by Seller and listed in Section 3.26 of the Disclosure Schedule) (the "
_Prepaid Premiums_ ") with respect to (i) the Lexington Insurance Company
Excess Policy in the amount of $2,158,424 would allow $554,864,781 in
additional construction costs (the " _Excess Lexington Costs_ ") to be added
to such Excess Policy at no additional premium cost, and (ii) the AIG Excess
Policy in the amount of $804,151 would allow $204,099,239 in additional
construction costs, to be added to such Excess Policy at no additional premium
cost (the " _Excess AIG Costs_ " and, together with the Excess Lexington
Costs, the " _Excess Costs_ "). Following the Closing, Seller and the
Purchaser and the Parents shall cooperate with each other to amend or
otherwise supplement the Excess Policies or establish new excess liability
policies with the Excess Insurers with the Prepaid Premiums transferred to
such policies (and in such event such new policies shall be deemed to be
"Excess Policies" for purposes of this Section 5.21), such that Purchaser, the
Parents and/or their respective Affiliates will be entitled to enroll
additional development projects for coverage under the Excess Policies and
apply the Prepaid Premiums to the cost for such coverage. To the extent that
Purchaser, the Parents or any of their respective Affiliates are so entitled,
then they will enroll additional development projects for coverage under the
applicable Excess Policy, and when each such project is enrolled, Purchaser
shall pay (and Parents shall cause Purchaser to pay) to the Seller an amount,
in cash, equal to the amount of the Prepaid Premiums actually applied by the
Excess Insurers as a credit against the premiums which would otherwise be due
and payable to the Excess Insurers as a consequence of the enrollment of such
additional development project for coverage under the Excess Policies. The
foregoing payment shall be made promptly (but, in any event, within thirty
(30) days) after the later to occur of (i) each additional development project
being bound for coverage under either of the Excess Policies and (ii) receipt
by Purchaser of a statement from the Excess Insurers setting forth the amount
of such credit. Any payment to Seller pursuant to this Section 5.21 shall be
deemed to be an adjustment in the Purchase Price for Tax purposes allocable to
Prepaid Premiums.

 



 

Section 5.22. _Distribution of Proceeds From Sales of Alterra Properties_.
Seller owns (i) 100% of the outstanding membership interests in
Roseland/Overlook Ridge Phase I, L.L.C. (" _Roseland/Overlook I_ "), which, in
turn, has a direct and indirect ownership interest in Property Owners which
own or have rights with respect to the Alterra IA Property and (ii) 100% of
the outstanding membership interests in Roseland/Overlook Ridge Phase IB,
L.L.C. (" _Roseland/Overlook IB_ "), which, in turn, has a direct and indirect
ownership interest in Property Owners which own or have rights with respect to
the Alterra IB Property. Promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business
Days) following the consummation of any sale or other disposition of the
Alterra IA Property to any Person (including, without limitation, to any of
the Parents or the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates), Seller
shall provide to the Purchaser a written statement setting forth in reasonable
detail the amount of cash proceeds to be received by the Property Owners and
Roseland/Overlook I in connection with such sale or other disposition, and

 



      
 

 



 

the anticipated timeframe within which Roseland/Overlook I expects to receive
such cash proceeds, together with reasonable backup therefor. Promptly (and in
any event within five (5) Business Days) following the consummation of any
sale or other disposition of the Alterra IB Property to any Person (including,
without limitation, to any of the Parents or the Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates), Seller shall provide to the Purchaser a written
statement setting forth in reasonable detail the amount of cash proceeds to be
received by the Property Owners and Roseland/Overlook IB in connection with
such sale or other disposition, and the anticipated timeframe within which
Roseland/Overlook IB expects to receive such cash proceeds, together with
reasonable backup therefor. Seller shall cause (a) Roseland/Overlook I to
transfer to a TRS of MCRC, by wire transfer in immediately available funds to
an account designated by MCRC in writing to the Seller prior to such transfer,
all of such cash proceeds from any such sale or disposition of the Alterra IA
Property to any Person (including, without limitation, to any of the Parents
or the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates) promptly (and in any
event within five (5) Business Days) following the receipt by
Roseland/Overlook I of such cash proceeds, whether such cash proceeds are
received in one lump sum or through periodic distributions from the applicable
Property Owners from time to time, and (b) Roseland/Overlook IB to transfer to
a TRS of MCRC, by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account
designated by MCRC in writing to the Seller prior to such transfer, any and
all of such cash proceeds from any such sale or disposition of the Alterra IB
Property to any Person (including, without limitation, to any of the Parents
or the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates) promptly (and in any
event within five (5) Business Days) following the receipt by
Roseland/Overlook IB of such cash proceeds, whether such cash proceeds are
received in one lump sum or through periodic distributions from the applicable
Property Owners from time to time. Any transfer of such cash proceeds to a TRS
of MCRC pursuant to this Section 5.22 shall be deemed to be an adjustment in
the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, and the Seller shall be responsible for
and pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes resulting from the sale or other
disposition of the Alterra IA Property and the Alterra IB Property.

 



 

Section 5.23. _OCIP Policy Matters_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, from and after the Closing, the Seller shall
continue to be responsible for and shall continue to pay and perform all
Financial Obligations arising from or relating to the OCIP Policy. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that following
the Closing, Seller shall be entitled to collect the amounts reflected on
Schedule 5.23 from the Property Owners of the projects described on such
schedule, which amounts represent OCIP Policy premiums and charges to be
reimbursed and/or paid to Seller, to the extent such amounts are properly
budgeted and actually funded (it being acknowledged and agreed that the
obligations of the Seller set forth in the immediately preceding sentence
shall not be conditioned on the receipt of such funds by the Seller).

 



 

Section 5.24. _Payments Received_. Seller, on the one hand, and the Parents
and Purchaser, on the other hand, agree that, after the Closing Date, they
shall hold and shall promptly transfer and deliver to the other Party, from
time to time as and when received by it and in the currency received, any
cash, checks with appropriate endorsements (using commercially reasonable
efforts not to convert such checks into cash), or other property that they may
receive after the date hereof which property belongs to the other Party,
including any

 



      
 

 



 

payments of accounts receivable and insurance proceeds, and shall account to
the other party for all such receipts.

 



 

Section 5.25. _Like-Kind Exchange_. So long as the Exchange (as defined below)
does not prevent or delay the Closing, Seller acknowledges and agrees that
Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates) may consummate the purchase of Sellers
100% membership interest in Roseland/Short Hills, L.L.C., which owns a 99%
membership interest in 233 Canoebrook Associates, L.L.C., and Sellers 1%
membership interest in 233 Canoebrook Associates, L.L.C. (collectively, the "
_Canoe Brook Interest_ ") **** contemplated in this Agreement as part of a so-
called like-kind exchange (the " _Exchange_ ") pursuant to Section 1031 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (including a so-called "reverse"
exchange pursuant to Revenue Procedure 2000-37, 2000-2 C.B. 38, as modified by
Revenue Procedure 2004-51, 2004-2 CB 294), and that, notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller agrees to execute such reasonable
documents and otherwise cooperate in such respects as may reasonably be
requested by Purchaser in order to enable Purchaser to effect the Exchange.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser reserves the
right, in effectuating the Exchange, to assign Purchasers rights, but not its
obligations, under this Agreement with respect to the Canoe Brook Interest to
a "qualified intermediary" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii)), and Seller hereby consents to such assignment.
Purchaser shall pay any additional costs that would not otherwise have been
incurred by Seller had Purchaser not consummated the purchase through the
Exchange.

 



 

Section 5.26. _RCC Contracting Settlement_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Seller shall be solely responsible for making
all payments required to be made and for performing all obligations required
to be performed by Roseland/Overlook, L.L.C., a New Jersey limited liability
company (" _R.O._ "), under the terms of that certain Settlement Agreement,
dated as of August 3, 2012 (the " _RCC Settlement Agreement_ "), by and
between Rowe Contracting Company, a Massachusetts corporation (" _RCC_ "),
R.O. and Seller, and Seller shall timely make all such payments and shall
perform all such obligations required to be made or performed by R.O. in
accordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except as set forth in the
immediately following sentences, the parties hereto hereby acknowledge and
agree that Seller shall have no right of contribution against R.O., Overlook,
the Companies, the Transferred Entities, the Roseland Property Assets, Parents
or Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to any of the
foregoing, and the Seller hereby unconditionally, fully and finally releases
R.O., Overlook, the Companies, the Transferred Entities, the Roseland Property
Assets, Parents, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates from any claim of
any kind or nature for, and waives any and all rights of every kind or
character with respect to, indemnification or contribution by R.O., Overlook,
the Companies, the Transferred Entities, the Roseland Property Assets, Parents
or Purchaser or their respective Affiliates with respect to (i) all payments
required to be made and obligations required to be performed by R.O. under the
terms of the RCC Settlement Agreement and (ii) any default or breach of the
RCC Settlement Agreement. However, if Overlook sells sites 2C and 3B in
Malden, Massachusetts to the UBS Venture, as contemplated in accordance with
the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of August 22, 2012 between Overlook
and the UBS Venture, then the Applicable Amount (as defined below) of the
proceeds of such sale shall be applied as follows: (i) if and to extent that
there are amounts remaining to be paid to RCC, that portion of the Applicable
Amount equal to

 



      
 

 



 

the amount of such remaining amounts shall be paid by Overlook to RCC and
thereby reduce or extinguish any liability of Seller with respect thereto;
(ii) if there is any portion of the Applicable Amount remaining after the
payment to RCC as provided in clause (i), such excess shall be paid to Seller
by Overlook (and Purchaser and the Parents shall cause Overlook to do so, to
the extent they have the ability to do so); and (iii) if any such amount
payable to RCC remain unpaid after the payment to RCC as provided in clause
(i), Seller shall continue to be liable to pay such unpaid amounts (or the
remaining portion thereof) as and when due. Further, if the sale of sites 2C
and 3B in Malden, Massachusetts to the UBS Venture referenced above is not
consummated on or prior to March 31, 2013, then the immediately preceding
sentence shall not apply. The term " _Applicable Amount_ " shall mean the sum
of $1,100,000 less any amounts that are distributed to RCC out of the proceeds
of the sale of sites 2C and 3B in Malden, Massachusetts to the UBS Venture in
order to cover the income taxes payable by RCC as a result of such sale.

 



 

Section 5.27. _Real Property Encumbrances_. Seller covenants and agrees that
Seller shall not cause, to the extent it has the power to do so, a Property
Owner to subject its respective Real Property to an Encumbrance, except for
Permitted Encumbrances, from and after the date of this Agreement through the
Closing.

 



 

Section 5.28. _Hilltop Membership Interests._ If, at any time prior to the
seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date, (i) Seller is granted consent
by the other Member(s) of (A) Cenrose Hilltop Urban Renewal, L.L.C. ("
_Cenrose I_ "), the Property Owner of the Hilltop I Property, or (B) Cenrose
Hilltop Urban Renewal II, L.L.C. (" _Cenrose II_ "), the Property Owner of the
Hilltop II Property, to sell or transfer to an unaffiliated third party all or
any portion of its direct or indirect ownership interests in Cenrose I or
Cenrose II (the " _Hilltop Interests_ ") ( _i.e._ , Seller is permitted to
transfer all or any portion of its membership interests in Roseland/Verona,
L.L.C. or Roseland/Verona II, L.L.C., or Seller is permitted to cause the
foregoing Roseland/Verona entities to transfer all or any portion of their
respective membership interests in Cenrose I or Cenrose II), and (ii) such
sale or transfer is _not_ being made in connection with a sale of the entire
Hilltop I Property or Hilltop II Property to an unaffiliated third party by
way of a sale or transfer of 100% of the direct or indirect equity interests
in Cenrose I or Cenrose II, respectively (in either case, a " _Property Sale
By Equity Transfer_ "), then in such event:

 



 

(x) Seller shall first offer to sell the applicable Hilltop Interests to MCRC
or one or more of its Affiliates by giving written notice of that offer to
sell to MCRC (the " _Offer Notice_ "). The Offer Notice shall set forth the
terms and conditions upon which Seller is willing to sell the applicable
Hilltop Interests, including the purchase price for an all cash sale. For a
period of fifteen (15) days after the Offer Notice is given to MCRC, MCRC
shall have the right to accept Sellers offer to sell the applicable Hilltop
Interests, but only upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer
Notice, on written notice to Seller. If MCRC accepts Sellers offer, for a
period of forty-five (45) days thereafter (the " _Negotiating Period_ "),
Seller and MCRC agree to prepare and negotiate in good faith a definitive
Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the " _Sale Agreement_ ") which shall
incorporate all of the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer Notice and
such other customary terms and conditions (which are not contrary to the terms
in the Offer Notice) reasonably required by Seller and MCRC. In the event that
Seller and MCRC execute the Sale Agreement, the sale or transfer of applicable
Hilltop Interests shall be consummated as soon

 



      
 

 



 

as practicable thereafter. MCRC shall have the right to assign all or any
portion of its rights under the Sale Agreement to one or more Affiliates of
MCRC.

 



 

(y) If (i) MCRC fails to accept Sellers offer to sell by written notice to
Seller given within fifteen (15) days after the Offer Notice is given to MCRC
or (ii) the parties fail to execute the Sale Agreement prior to the expiration
of the Negotiating Period, then, in each case, MCRC shall be deemed to have
failed to exercise the right of first offer granted by this Section 5.28
(each, an " _Exercise Failure_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that an Exercise
Failure shall not be deemed to have occurred if such Exercise Failure was
caused, directly or indirectly, by a breach by Seller of its obligations
hereunder. In the event of an Exercise Failure, Seller may then offer to sell
and sell the applicable Hilltop Interests to any party for a purchase price
which is equal to or greater than ninety-seven percent (97%) of the purchase
price proposed in the Offer Notice and such other terms and conditions which
are not less favorable to Seller than that contained in the Offer Notice. If
Seller (x) does not execute a definitive agreement relating to such sale
within 180 days after the Exercise Failure or (y) intends to consummate such
sale at a purchase price that is less than ninety-seven percent (97%) of the
purchase price proposed in the Offer Notice or otherwise on terms and
conditions which are less favorable to Seller than that contained in the Offer
Notice, then, in each case, the right of first offer provided to MCRC
hereunder shall be deemed to be revived and such sale shall not be consummated
unless the provisions of this Section 5.28 are again complied with respect
thereto.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, MCRC shall have no right of first offer pursuant
to this Section 5.28 in connection with any (i) sale or other transfer of the
Hilltop Interests to one or more Affiliates of Seller (provided that any such
Affiliate transferee(s) shall continue to be bound by this Section 5.28), (ii)
sale by Cenrose I or Cenrose II of the Hilltop I Property or Hilltop II
Property, respectively ( _i.e._ , a deed transfer by Cenrose I or Cenrose II),
or (iii) Property Sale By Equity Transfer.

Section 6.01. _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) As of the Closing Date, the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall (and
the Parents shall cause the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates to) offer to
employ substantially all of the employees of Roseland Property (the "
_Roseland Employees_"), with the understanding that such employment shall be
on the same terms as the Roseland Employees are currently employed; _provided_
, _however_ , that it is understood and agreed that neither the Purchaser nor
any of its Affiliates shall offer employment to those employees who are
identified on Schedule 6.01. With respect to such Roseland Employees, the
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall (i) for a period of one (1) year
following the Closing, cause any Roseland Employee that was covered under a
medical or dental plan, disability benefit plan, 401(k) plan or life insurance
plan (collectively, the " _Benefit Plans_ ") immediately prior to the Closing
Date to receive coverage on the Closing Date that is substantially comparable
in the aggregate to such coverage provided to the Roseland Employees by
Roseland Property, and at a cost, if any, to a Roseland Employee that is

 



      
 

 



 

substantially comparable to the cost borne by the Roseland Employee,
immediately prior to the Closing Date, subject to any applicable limitations
arising from the nondiscrimination requirements of the Code, (ii) recognize
the service completed by the Roseland Employees to Roseland Property for
purposes of determining eligibility service and vesting service under any
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by Parents for their
employees on or after the Closing Date substantially to the same extent such
service was credited under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
provided by Roseland Property immediately prior to the Closing Date;
_provided_ , that the foregoing shall not be construed to require crediting of
service that would result in violation of the nondiscrimination requirements
of the Code, duplication of benefits, service credit for benefit accruals,
service credit under a newly established plan for which prior service is not
taken into account, or employer contribution for any 401(k) plan, (c) cause to
be waived any pre-existing condition limitations under welfare Benefit Plans
of the Parents, Purchaser or their Affiliates in which Roseland Employees
participate (to the extent those conditions were waived under the
corresponding Plans of Roseland Property or its Affiliates), (d) cause to be
credited any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket requirements incurred
by the Roseland Employees and their beneficiaries and dependents during the
portion of the calendar year prior to participation in the Benefit Plans
provided by the Parents and (e) solely to the extent of the Applicable
Vacation and Sick Leave Accruals, assume responsibility for the vacation time
and sick leave benefits accrued and due to the Roseland Employees as of the
Closing Date.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i)
none of the Parents, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates shall
assume or acquire any of the Plans (including, without limitation any multi-
employer plan **** as defined in ERISA Section 4001.2, and the union plans
maintained by or on behalf of the Service Employees International Union, Local
32BJ with respect to employees engaged in management of the property known as
Riverbank West (collectively the " _Union Plans_ ")) ** ** or any Liabilities
thereunder (including any withdrawal liability arising under Section 4201(a)
of ERISA), all of which shall constitute Excluded Roseland Property
Liabilities **,** (ii) Seller and its affiliates (as defined in Code section
414(b), (c), (m) or (o)) (" _ERISA Affiliate_ ") shall remain liable with
respect all Liabilities relating to any Plans of the Seller or ERISA Affiliate
** ** and (iii) Seller shall be solely responsible for the payment of all
salaries, wages, and benefits under the Plans, vacation pay and other
compensation which shall be due to any of the Roseland Employees for any
period prior to the Closing Date and the payment of any claim or demand for
withdrawal liability (as defined in ERISA Section 4201(a)) against the
Companies and their ERISA Affiliates as a result of employees and former
employees who are or were covered by the Union Plans or have an accrued
benefit in the Union Plans, all of which shall constitute Excluded Roseland
Property Liabilities. Seller shall take all necessary and appropriate action,
if any, to comply on or prior to the Closing Date with any federal, state,
local and foreign laws regarding termination of Roseland Employees.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained herein shall confer upon any Roseland Employee any right
with respect to continuance of employment by the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, nor shall anything herein interfere with the right of the
Purchaser or any of their Affiliates to terminate the employment of any of the
Roseland Employees hired by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates at any
time, with or without cause, or restrict the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates in the exercise of its independent business judgment in modifying
any of the terms and conditions of the

 



      
 

 



 

employment of the Roseland Employees consistent herewith. The foregoing shall
not affect the rights of the Principals under the Employment Agreements.

 



 

(d) No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Roseland Employee, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, with
respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and benefits
that may be provided to any Roseland Employee.

Section 8.04. _Limits on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) No claim may be asserted nor may any Action be commenced against any party

party describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect
to the subject matter of such claim or Action on or prior to the date on which
the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on which such claim or
Action is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section 8.01, irrespective
of whether the subject matter of such claim or action shall have occurred
before or after such date. Without limiting the foregoing, nothing herein
shall be deemed to prevent an Indemnified Party from making a claim hereunder
for potential or contingent claims or demands; _provided_ that the written
notice of such claim sets forth the specific basis for any such contingent
claim to the extent then feasible and the Indemnified Party has reasonable
grounds to believe that such a claim may be made.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: (i)
an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification
pursuant to (x) Section 8.02(a)(i) (other than with respect to a breach of any
representation or warranty contained in Section 3.17 or Section 3.20) or (y)
Section 8.03(a), unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses
which may be recovered from the Indemnifying Party thereunder equals or
exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Indemnification Threshold_ "), after which the
Indemnifying Party shall fully indemnify the other party for the total of such
Losses (including those incurred prior to exceeding the Indemnification
Threshold), subject to the limitations set forth in clause (ii) of this
Section 8.04(b); (ii) the maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be
recovered from an Indemnifying Party arising out of or resulting from the
causes set forth in (x) Section 8.02(a)(i) (other than with respect to a
breach of any representation or warranty contained in Section 3.17 or Section
3.20, for which an Indemnifying Party shall be liable for all Losses) or (y)
Section 8.03(a) shall be $40,000,000; (iii) an Indemnified Party shall not be
entitled to make any claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII
for any single Loss of $75,000 or less or any related series of Losses which
in the aggregate do not exceed $75,000; and (iv) none of the parties hereto
shall have any liability under any provision of this Agreement for any
punitive damages, special damages or consequential damages (including lost
profits and lost opportunities), except to the extent an Indemnified Party is
required to pay such damages in connection with a Third Party Claim. For the
purposes of determining whether the Indemnification Threshold has been met
(but not determining whether a breach of a representation has occurred), all
representations and warranties in Article III or Article IV of this Agreement
which are qualified by Material Adverse Effect or materiality (or similar
qualifications) shall be read as if such qualifications were not present
therein.

 



 

(c) For all purposes of this Article VIII, " _Losses_ " shall be net of any
insurance or other recoveries actually received by the Indemnified Party or
its Affiliates in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of
indemnification. In addition, any indemnification payment made under this
Agreement will take into account and be reduced by any Tax benefit to the
Indemnified Party resulting from the Loss giving rise to such payment.

 



 

(d) Payments by an Indemnified Party of amounts for which such Indemnified
Party is indemnified hereunder shall not be a condition precedent to recovery.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing set
forth in this Agreement, including the limitations on indemnification set
forth in clause (b) of this Section 8.04 and the durational limitations of the
survival periods set forth in Section 8.01, shall limit the rights, remedies
or claims of any party, or the liability of any party for any Losses, arising
out of, based on or related to actual fraud; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
limitations on indemnification set forth in clause (b) of this Section 8.04
and the durational limitations of the survival periods set forth in Section
8.01 shall apply to limit the rights, remedies or claims of any party, or the
liability of any party for any Losses, arising out of, based on or related to
actual fraud which are first asserted from and after the _later_ of (i) March
31, 2013 and (ii) if the filing with the SEC of the Annual Report on Form 10-K
of either of MCRC or MCRLP for the year ended December 31, 2012 is delayed due
to any failure to complete the preparation of MCRCs or MCRLPs financial
statements, or any failure to complete the audit of such financial statements,
due to any issue relating to the Companies, the Assets, the Business, the
Transferred Interests or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and the date of such filing with the
SEC is later than March 31, 2013, the date on which such Annual Report on Form
10-K of MCRC or MCRLP, as applicable, is filed with the SEC (such later date,
the " _Fraud Limitation Start Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, (i) nothing set forth in this Agreement, including
the limitations on indemnification set forth in clause (b) of this Section
8.04 and the durational limitations of the survival periods set forth in
Section 8.01, shall limit the rights, remedies or claims of any party, or the
liability of any party for any Losses, arising out of, based on or related to
any of the matters referred to in clauses (vi), (vii), (viii), (ix), (x) or
(xi) of Section 8.02(a), and (ii) the limitations on indemnification set forth
in clause (b) of this Section 8.04 shall not limit the rights, remedies or
claims of any party, or the liability of any party for any Losses, arising out
of, based on or related to (A) any of the matters referred to in clauses (ii),
(iii), (iv) or (v) of Section 8.02(a), (B) any of the matters referred to in
Section 8.02(b) or (C) any of the matters referred to in clauses (b), (c), (d)
or (e) of Section 8.03.

 



 

Section 8.05. _Notice of Loss; Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) An Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of any
matter (other than Third Party Claims which are addressed in subsection (b)
below), which an Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise
to a right of indemnification under this Agreement, within sixty (60) days of
such determination, stating the amount of the Loss, if known, and method of
computation thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or
arises; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notice within such
sixty (60) day period shall not affect the Indemnifying Partys obligations
under this Article VIII except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have
been prejudiced by such failure.

 



 

(b) If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Action, audit, claim,
demand or assessment (each, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against it which may
give rise to a claim for Loss under this Article VIII, within thirty (30) days
of the receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall give the
Indemnifying Party notice of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying
Party from any of its obligations under this Article VIII except to the extent
that such failure results in a detriment to the Indemnifying Party. Unless (i)
the Third Party Claim involves the seeking of an injunction or other equitable

 



      
 

 



 

relief, or (ii) unless the Third Party Claim is criminal in nature, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such
Third Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice, reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, if it gives notice of its intention to
do so, to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such
notice from the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the
Indemnifying Party shall lose the right to control the defense of the Third
Party Claim if it shall fail to diligently defend the Third Party Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party has the right to elect, and elects, to undertake any
such defense against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may
participate in such defense and in any settlement negotiations at its own
expense. The Indemnified Party shall fully cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the
Indemnifying Partys expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in the Indemnified Partys possession or under the Indemnified
Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying
Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to direct the defense of any such
claim or proceeding or if the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to direct the
defense of such Claim or proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall not pay, or
permit to be paid, any part of such Third Party Claim unless the Indemnifying
Party consents in writing to such payment or unless the Indemnifying Party
withdraws from the defense of such Third Party Claim (if it is entitled to
direct the defense thereof as above provided) or unless a final judgment from
which no appeal may be taken by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party is
entered against the Indemnified Party for such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim, or
fails to diligently defend the Third Party Claim following its assumption of
the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party may defend the Third Party Claim
with counsel of the Indemnified Partys choice, and may settle the Third Party
Claim in its sole discretion. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of
any such claims or proceeding pursuant to this Section 8.05 and proposes to
forgo any appeal of an adverse outcome with respect thereto, then the
Indemnifying Party shall give the Indemnified Party prompt written notice
thereof and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume or reassume
the defense of such claims or proceeding. The Indemnifying Party shall not
enter into any settlement or compromise of any action, suit or proceeding or
consent to the entry of any judgment (i) which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the
Indemnified Party of a written release from all liability in respect of such
action, suit or proceeding, (ii) which attributes fault to the Indemnified
Party, or (iii) for other than monetary damages to be borne in full by the
Indemnifying Party, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification against a
Third Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party fails to accept a tender of, or
assume, the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 8.05, or
if, in accordance with the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not have
the right or shall lose its right to contest, defend, litigate and settle such
a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, without
prejudice to its right of indemnification hereunder, in its discretion
exercised in good faith and upon the advice of counsel, to contest, defend and
litigate such Third Party Claim, and may settle such Third Party Claim, either
before or after the initiation of litigation, at such time and upon such terms
as the Indemnified Party deems fair and reasonable, provided that at least ten
(10) days prior to any such settlement, written notice of its intention to
settle is given to the Indemnifying Party. If, pursuant to this Section 8.05,
the Indemnified Party so contests, defends, litigates or settles a Third Party
Claim for which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder as hereinabove
provided, the Indemnified Party shall be

 



      
 

 



 

reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party for the reasonable attorneys fees and
other expenses of contesting, defending, litigating and/or settling the Third
Party Claim which are incurred from time to time, forthwith following the
presentation to the Indemnifying Party of itemized bills for said attorneys
fees and other expenses.

 



 

Section 8.06. _Right of Offset Against Earnout_. Anything in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that Seller or any of the
Principals is obligated to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant
to the provisions of this Article VIII, the Parents and the Purchaser may (but
shall not be obligated to), in addition to any other right or remedy
(including those set forth in Section 8.07(c)), withhold up to $10,000,000
that may become due to Seller under the terms of the Earnout ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the first $4,000,000 that may become due to Seller under the
terms of the Earnout shall not be subject to any such right of offset pursuant
to this Article VIII) and set off such funds so withheld by the Parents and
the Purchaser against such indemnification obligation. Neither the exercise of
nor the failure to exercise such right of offset shall be deemed to be or
construed as a waiver or election of remedies by the Parents or the Purchaser
or prejudice or impair the concurrent or subsequent exercise or enforcement of
any other rights or remedies available to them.

 



 

Section 8.07. _Other Matters Relating to Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Any payment by an Indemnifying Party of any Losses hereunder shall be
deemed to be an adjustment in the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

 



 

(b) If (i) whether as a result of Parents or Purchasers investigation or
otherwise, Seller shall establish that Mitchell E. Hersh had actual knowledge
prior to Closing that a representation and warranty made by the Seller in this
Agreement was untrue or incorrect in any material respect when made, and (ii)
Purchaser proceeds with the Closing, then the representation or warranty and
the corresponding Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement shall automatically be
deemed to be modified to reflect the information, event or condition of which
Mitchell E. Hersh had actual knowledge prior to Closing, and the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall be deemed to have waived any right pursuant to
Article VIII to claim indemnification or Losses after the Closing by reason of
such breach or misrepresentation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
shall not affect or be deemed to affect Parents and Purchasers rights prior
to Closing under Article IX to elect to terminate this Agreement. Except as
expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, a partys right to
indemnification or other remedies based upon the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of the other parties set forth in this Agreement
(including the Disclosure Schedule) and the Ancillary Agreements (other than
the Employment Agreements) delivered by any such party pursuant hereto shall
not in any way be affected by any investigation or knowledge of such party or
any waiver by such party of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or compliance with any covenant or agreement.
Except as expressly provided in the first sentence of this subsection (b) of
this Section 8.07, such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of the fact that a party knew
or should have known that any representation or warranty might be inaccurate
or that the other parties failed to comply with any agreement or covenant and
any investigation by such party shall be for its own protection only and shall
not affect or impair any right or remedy hereunder.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) The parties acknowledge and agree that, except for the matters for which
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.02(b) of this Agreement, and prior to any Change of
Control (as defined in the Employment Agreements) of MCRC, (i) the Escrow
Deposit until the funds comprising the Escrow Deposit are required to be
released from escrow in accordance with the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, (ii)
the right of offset with respect to the Earnout provided in Section 8.06 of
this Agreement and (iii) after the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing
Date, the assets of Seller after such date, but only to the extent of a
cumulative amount of $10,000,000, shall be the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
exclusive method of receiving indemnification from the Seller pursuant to this
Agreement. It is hereby acknowledged and agreed by the parties that the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to proceed directly
against the assets of the Seller in respect of any such indemnification
obligation and that any such funds released to Seller or paid to Seller shall
no longer be subject to any claim for indemnification once they were released
or paid and that any such amounts paid or released by Seller or distributed by
Seller to its equityholders shall not be subject to any claims of
indemnification, except that (1) the assets of Seller shall be subject to
claims for indemnification to the extent provided in clause (iii) above and
(2) the assets of the Principals shall be subject to claims of indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.02(b) of this Agreement. With respect to the matters for
which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.02(b) of this Agreement, the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties may, but shall not be required to, proceed directly against the
Principals, (A) severally and not jointly, with respect to any breach of any
covenant or agreement contained in Section 5.08 of this Agreement, and (B)
jointly and severally, with respect to any breach of any covenant or agreement
contained in Section 5.18 of this Agreement, in addition to any other right or
remedy (including those referred to in the immediately preceding sentence and
those set forth in Sections 5.08 and 10.16 of this Agreement), notwithstanding
any funds or assets referred to in the immediately preceding sentence then
available to proceed against, and without first proceeding against any such
funds, securities or assets. For the sake of clarity, (i) the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties may only proceed against the applicable Principal with
respect to any breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in Section 5.08
of this Agreement by such Principal and may not proceed against the Seller,
the other Principals or the Escrow Deposit, and may not exercise any right of
offset pursuant to Section 8.06, for any such breach of Section 5.08 by such
Principal and (ii) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may proceed against the
Seller or the Escrow Deposit, and/or may exercise any right of offset pursuant
to Section 8.06, or any combination thereof, with respect to any breach of any
covenant or agreement set forth in Section 5.08 of this Agreement by the
Seller. The parties acknowledge and agree that, except for (x) the matters for
which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.02(b) of this Agreement, or (y) any claim made in
accordance with Section 8.04(a) by a Purchaser Indemnified Party prior to a
Change of Control of MCRC, following any Change of Control of MCRC, Seller and
the Principals shall have no further indemnification obligations pursuant to
this Article VIII.

 



 

(d) Except for any claim or proceeding arising out of, resulting from or
incident to (i) the Employment Agreements, (ii) the matters for which the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 8.02(b) of this Agreement, (iii) actual fraud, subject to the
immediately following sentence, and (iv) any equitable relief expressly
provided for elsewhere in this Agreement (including in Sections 5.08 and 10.16
of this Agreement), from and after the Closing, the parties sole remedy with
respect to any and all claims arising under this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement shall be pursuant to this Article VIII, and, in furtherance of the
foregoing, the parties hereby waive, from and after the Closing, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, all other rights, claims and causes of action
they may have against one another under this Agreement and in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties sole remedy with
respect to any and all claims of actual fraud that are asserted after the
Fraud Limitation Start Date shall be pursuant to this Article VIII (and shall
be subject to the limitations on indemnification contained in this Article
VIII, including the limitations set forth in Section 8.04(b) and the
durational limitations of the survival periods set forth in Section 8.01),
and, in furtherance of the foregoing, the parties hereby waive, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, all other rights, claims and causes of action they
may have against one another with respect to claims for actual fraud that are
asserted after the Fraud Limitation Start Date.

 



 

Article IX

 



 

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 



 

Section 9.01. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing:

 



 

(a) by either the Seller, on the one hand, or the Purchaser and the Parents,
on the other hand, if the Closing shall not have occurred by the Termination
Date (including any extension thereof); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.01(a) shall not be
available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure
of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date;

 



 

(b) by either the Purchaser and the Parents, on the one hand, or the Seller,
on the other hand, in the event that any Governmental Order restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall have become final and nonappealable;

 



 

(c) by the Seller, if the Parents or the Purchaser shall have breached any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement which would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Article VII, which breach cannot be cured or which, if curable, has not been
cured within thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice by the Seller
to the Purchaser and the Parents specifying such breach;

 



 

(d) by the Purchaser and the Parents, if the Seller shall have breached any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement which would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Article VII, which breach cannot be cured or which, if curable, has not been
cured within thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice by the
Purchaser to the Seller specifying such breach; or

 



 

(e) by the mutual written consent of the Seller, on the one hand, and the
Purchaser and the Parents, on the other hand.

 



 

Section 9.02. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement by either Seller or Purchaser and the Parents as provided in Section
9.01:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) Purchasers and the Parents right of access pursuant to Section 5.02
shall terminate and each party, if so requested by the other party, will
return promptly every document furnished to it by the other party (or any
subsidiary, division, associate or Affiliate of such other party) in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, whether so obtained
before or after the execution of this Agreement, and any copies thereof
(except for copies of documents publicly available) which may have been made,
and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its representatives and any
representatives of financial institutions and investors and others to whom
such documents were furnished promptly to return such documents and any copies
thereof any of them may have made; and

 



 

(b) All information received by any party hereto with respect to the business
of the other party hereto or their respective subsidiaries, divisions,
Affiliates or associates (other than information which is a matter of public
knowledge or which has heretofore been or is hereafter publicly published in
any publication for public distribution or filed as public information with
any governmental authority) shall not, unless otherwise required by law, at
any time be used for the advantage of, or disclosed to third parties by, such
party for any reason whatsoever.

 



 

This Section 9.02 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.03. _Remedies_. Notwithstanding any termination right granted in
Section 9.01, in the event of the nonfulfillment of any condition to a partys
closing obligations, such party may elect to do one of the following:

 



 

(a) proceed to close despite the nonfulfillment of any closing condition, it
being understood that consummation of the Closing shall not be deemed a waiver
of a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant or of any partys
rights and remedies with respect thereto;

 



 

(b) decline to close, terminate this Agreement as provided in Section 9.01,
and thereafter seek damages to the extent permitted in Section 9.04; or

 



 

(c) seek specific performance of the obligations of the other party in
accordance with Section 10.16.

 



 

Section 9.04. _Right to Damages_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 9.01, no party hereto shall have any claim against the other parties
hereto, except if the circumstances giving rise to such termination were
caused either by the other partys breach of any covenant or agreement of such
other party contained in this Agreement, or by any of the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement by such other party being incorrect
such that any of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.01(a) or 7.02(a) shall
not be satisfied at the time set forth in such Sections, in which event
termination shall not be deemed or construed as limiting or denying any legal
or equitable right or remedy of said party, and said party shall also be
entitled to recover, without limitation, its costs and expenses which are
incurred in pursuing its rights and remedies (including reasonable attorneys
fees).

Section 10.03. _Public Announcements; Confidentiality_. Upon the execution of
this Agreement, the Purchaser and MCRC shall have the right to make such
public announcements or filings as may be required by (i) the Securities Act,
(ii) the Securities Exchange Act, (iii) the rules and listing standards of the
New York Stock Exchange, Inc., (iv) any other law of a jurisdiction to which
the Parents are subject, or (v) any oral questions, interrogatories, requests
for information, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar process
required by applicable rules, laws or regulations by any court, law or
administrative authority to which Purchaser and the Parents are

 



      
 

 



 

subject. Purchaser and the Parents also shall have the right to make such
public announcements or filings as they may deem reasonably prudent, and shall
be entitled to make such filings or announcements upon advice of counsel as
may be otherwise be deemed necessary. In this connection, it should be noted
that Purchaser and the Parents have determined that the entry into this
Agreement will need to be disclosed within four (4) business days of its
execution on a Current Report on Form 8-K under Item 1.01 thereof and that the
Agreement will be filed as an exhibit thereto or be filed as an exhibit to the
Parents next following periodic report filed pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act. Seller may make such public disclosures as are required by Law.
Each of Seller, Purchaser and the Parents hereby agree to provide the non-
disclosing parties as much advance notice as reasonably possible with respect
to the nature of such disclosure, cooperate fully as to the timing and
contents of such disclosure and review in good faith the suggestions of the
other party with respect to the contents of such disclosure.

 



 

Section 10.04. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or
public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect for so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to either party hereto. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

 



 

Section 10.05. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits and
the Disclosure Schedule and other Schedules) and the Ancillary Agreements
constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, between the Seller and the Purchaser with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 



 

Section 10.06. _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned by operation
of Law or otherwise without the prior express written consent of the Seller,
and the Purchaser or either of the Parents, which consent may be granted,
conditioned, delayed or withheld in the sole discretion of the Seller or the
Purchaser or the Parents, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Purchaser and/or the Parents may assign any or all of their respective
interests in this transaction to one or more Affiliates, _provided_ , that any
such assignment shall not relieve the Purchaser and the Parents from their
obligations hereunder.

 



 

Section 10.07. _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified
except (a) by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, the Seller,
on the one hand, and the Purchaser or either of the Parents, on the other
hand, or (b) by a waiver in accordance with Section 10.08.

 



 

Section 10.08. _Waiver_. Any party to this Agreement may (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
other party contained herein or in any document delivered by the other party
pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements of the
other party or conditions to such partys obligations contained herein. Any
such extension or waiver

 



      
 

 



 

shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be
construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the
same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this
Agreement. The failure of either party hereto to assert any of its rights
hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such rights.

 



 

Section 10.09. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or
implied (including the provisions of Article VI relating to employee matters
and Article VIII relating to Indemnified Parties), is intended to or shall
confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any specified
period, under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.10. _Currency_. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all
references to currency, monetary values and dollars set forth herein shall
mean United States (U.S.) dollars and all payments hereunder shall be made in
United States dollars.

 



 

Section 10.11. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all others arising out of

Period agreeing that some, but not all, of the portion of the Escrow Fund
requested to be released by Party B may be released to Party B, and
specifically setting forth the Agreed Release Amount, if any, the Escrow Agent
shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days following
expiration of the

 



      
 

 



 

Release Response Period) deliver to Party B, such Agreed Release Amount, if
any, in accordance with the written delivery instructions furnished by Party B

such amounts in the Escrow Account in accordance with this Escrow Agreement
until it receives such written delivery instructions.

 



 

(iii) Subject to the release of any Agreed Release Amount pursuant to Section

applicable Release Notice prior to the expiration of the Release Response
Period indicating that all or any portion of the Escrow Fund requested to be
released in the Release Notice should not be released to Party B, Party B and
Party A shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute. If Party A and
Party B shall resolve such dispute, such resolution shall be binding on Party
B, on the one hand, and Party A, MCRLP and the Purchaser, on the other hand,
and a settlement agreement shall be signed by Party A and Party B and sent to
the Escrow Agent together with a Joint Written Direction, and the Escrow Agent
shall, promptly following receipt of a Joint Written Direction (and in any
event within two (2) Business Days after receipt thereof), if applicable,

instructions provided in the Joint Written Direction (which shall include
written delivery instructions for Party B (if applicable)).

 



 

(iv) If Party B and Party A are unable to resolve the dispute relating to any
Release Notice within 45 calendar days after the delivery of the Release
Notice, the dispute shall be submitted to any court of competent jurisdiction
referred to in Section 16 of this Escrow Agreement (a " _Competent Court_ "),
and the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold the disputed portion of the Escrow
Fund until Escrow Agent receives either: (i) a Joint Written Direction
providing specific written instructions regarding the delivery of the disputed
portion of the Escrow Fund; or (ii) a final, non appealable order or judgment
of a Competent Court (a " _Final Order_ ") providing specific written
instructions regarding the delivery of the disputed portion of the Escrow
Fund. Any Final Order shall be furnished to Party A, Party B and the Escrow
Agent in writing, shall constitute the conclusive determination of the issue
in question, and shall be binding upon Party A, Party B, MCRLP, the Purchaser,
and the Escrow Agent. The prevailing party in any dispute between Party B and
Party A submitted to any Competent Court shall be entitled to an award of
attorneys fees and costs to be paid by the losing Party.

 



 

(b) At any time and from time to time prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time)
on the Second Release Date, Party A may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
deliver one or more written notices to Party B and the Escrow Agent (together
with a certification to the Escrow Agent that delivery to Party B was done in
accordance with the notice provisions of this Escrow Agreement) executed by a
Party A Representative (each, a " _Party A Discretionary Release Notice_ "),
requesting that a specified amount of the Escrow Fund, to be determined in the
sole and absolute discretion of Party A, be released to Party B; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the aggregate amount of the Escrow Fund that may be released
to Party B pursuant to all Party A Discretionary Release Notices shall not
exceed $5,000,000; and _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this Escrow
Agreement shall be deemed to require Party A to deliver any Party A
Discretionary Release Notice to the Escrow Agent or Party B or to specify that
any particular amount of the Escrow Fund be released to Party B pursuant
thereto, it being hereby acknowledged and agreed that the delivery of any
Party A Discretionary Release Notice pursuant to this Section 7(b), and the
specified amount of the Escrow Fund requested to be released to Party B
pursuant thereto,

 



      
 

 



 

shall be in the sole and absolute discretion of Party A (subject to the first
proviso of this Section 7(b)), and that the failure of Party A to deliver any
Party A Discretionary Release Notice pursuant to this Section 7(b), or the
failure of Party A to specify that any particular amount of the Escrow Fund be
released to Party B pursuant thereto, shall not be (or be deemed to be) a
breach of this Escrow Agreement or the Purchase Agreement. The Escrow Agent
shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) following the
date the Escrow Agent receives a Party A Discretionary Release Notice deliver
to Party B the specified amount of the Escrow Fund requested to be released to
Party B in such Party A Discretionary Release Notice, in accordance with the
written delivery instructions furnished by Party B to the Escrow Agent;
_provided_ , that if no such delivery instructions are furnished by Party B to
the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall retain all such amounts in the Escrow
Account in accordance with this Escrow Agreement until it receives such
written delivery instructions.

 



 

(c) If, as of 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Second Release Date, (i)
the Escrow Agent has not received any written Claim Notice or (ii) the Escrow
Agent has received one or more written Claim Notices, but there is no pending
or unresolved Claim Notice (and all Claimed Amounts payable to Party A in
satisfaction of such Claim Notices have theretofore been paid in full), then
at such time Party B shall deliver a Release Notice to Party A and the Escrow
Agent (together with a certification to the Escrow Agent that delivery to
Party A was done in accordance with the notice provisions of this Escrow
Agreement) executed by a Party B Representative requesting that the remaining
Escrow Fund, if any, be released to Party B. If, as of 5:00 p.m. (New York
City time) on the Second Release Date, the Escrow Agent has received one or
more written Claim Notices, and any one or more of such written Claim Notices
are pending or unresolved as of the Second Release Date (or any Claimed
Amounts payable to Party A in satisfaction of any Claim Notices have not
theretofore been paid in full), then at such time Party B shall deliver a
Release Notice to Party A and the Escrow Agent (together with a certification
to the Escrow Agent that delivery to Party A was done in accordance with the
notice provisions of this Escrow Agreement) executed by a Party B
Representative requesting that an amount (if such amount is a positive number)
equal to (x) the remaining Escrow Fund _minus_ (y) the amount of all Claimed
Amounts that have not been paid or otherwise resolved as of the Second Release
Date (including, without limitation, those relating to Claim Notices received
on or prior to the First Release Date) (the " _Retained Amount_ "), be
released to Party B. If Party A delivers a Release Response Notice with
respect to the applicable Release Notice prior to the expiration of the
Release Response Period agreeing that part, but not all, of the amount of the
Escrow Fund requested for release by Party B may be released from the Escrow
Fund to Party B in respect of the Second Release Date, or indicating that no
part of the Escrow Fund may be released to Party B in respect of the Second
Release Date, the procedures set forth in Section 7(a)(ii)-(iv) shall apply
_mutatis mutandis_. If Party A does not deliver to Escrow Agent a Release
Response Notice with respect to the applicable Release Notice, or if Party A
delivers a Release Response Notice with respect to the applicable Release
Notice agreeing that the entire amount of the Escrow Fund requested for
release by Party B may be released from the Escrow Fund to Party B in respect
of the Second Release Date, in either case prior to the expiration of the
Release Response Period, the procedures set forth in Section 7(a)(i) shall
apply _mutatis mutandis_.

 



 

(d) If at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Second
Release Date, Party A desires to make a claim against the Escrow Fund with
respect to any

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnification Claim, then Party A shall, on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York
City time) on the Second Release Date, deliver a written claim notice executed
by a Party A Representative (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to Party B and to the
Escrow Agent (together with a certification to the Escrow Agent that delivery
to Party B was done in accordance with the notice provisions of this Escrow
Agreement). Such Claim Notice shall contain (i) a description and a good
faith estimate of the amount of any Losses incurred or reasonably expected to
be incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified Party (the " _Claimed Amount_ ");
(ii) a statement that any Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under Article VIII of the Purchase Agreement for such Losses;
and (iii) a demand for payment.

 



 

(e) Prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the 30th calendar day after
receipt by Escrow Agent of a Claim Notice (the " _Claim Response Period_ "),
Party B may deliver to Party A and to the Escrow Agent (together with a
certification to the Escrow Agent that delivery to Party A was done in
accordance with the notice provisions of this Escrow Agreement) a written
response executed by a Party B Representative (the " _Claim Response Notice_
") in which Party B may: (i) agree that the full Claimed Amount may be
released from the Escrow Fund to Party A; (ii) agree that part, but not all,
of the Claimed Amount (the " _Agreed Claim Amount_ ") may be released from the
Escrow Fund to Party A, _provided_ , that such Claim Response Notice shall
specify in detail the amount that may be released from the Escrow Fund; or
(iii) indicate that no part of the Claimed Amount may be released from the
Escrow Fund to Party A (in which case no portion of the Escrow Fund shall be
released pursuant to the Claim Notice). Any part of the Claimed Amount that
is not to be released to Party A shall be the " _Contested Amount._ "

 



 

(A) If Party B does not deliver a Claim Response Notice with respect to the
applicable Claim Notice prior to the expiration of the Claim Response Period,
then Party B shall be deemed to have agreed that the entire Claimed Amount may
be released from the Escrow Fund to Party A and consented to the release by
the Escrow Agent, and the Escrow Agent shall deliver to Party A the entire
Claimed Amount promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) after
the expiration of the Claim Response Period in accordance with the written
delivery instructions furnished by Party A to the Escrow Agent; _provided_ ,
that if no such delivery instructions are furnished by Party A to the Escrow
Agent, the Escrow Agent shall retain all such amounts in the Escrow Account
until it receives such written delivery instructions.

 



 

(B) If Party B delivers a Claim Response Notice with respect to the applicable
Claim Notice prior to the expiration of the Claim Response Period agreeing
that the entire Claimed Amount may be released from the Escrow Fund to Party
A, the Escrow Agent shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business
Days) following the Escrow Agents receipt of the Claim Response Notice,
deliver to Party A the entire Claimed Amount in accordance with the written
delivery instructions furnished by Party A to the Escrow Agent; _provided_ ,
that if no such delivery instructions are furnished by Party A to the Escrow
Agent, the Escrow Agent shall retain all such amounts in the Escrow Account
until it receives such written delivery instructions.

 



 

(C) If Party B delivers a Claim Response Notice with respect to the applicable
Claim Notice prior to the expiration of the Claim Response Period agreeing
that part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount may be released from the Escrow
Fund to Party A, the

 



       
 

 



 

Escrow Agent shall retain the Contested Amount in the Escrow Account in
accordance with this Escrow Agreement and shall promptly (and in any event
within two (2) Business Days) following the expiration of the Claim Response
Period deliver to Party A the Agreed Claim Amount in accordance with the
written delivery instructions furnished by Party A to the Escrow Agent;
_provided_ , that if no such delivery instructions are furnished by Party A to
the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall retain all such amounts in the Escrow
Account until it receives such written delivery instructions.

 



 

(D) If Party B delivers a Claim Response Notice with respect to the applicable
Claim Notice prior to the expiration of the Claim Response Period indicating
that there is a Contested Amount, Party B and Party A shall attempt in good
faith to resolve the dispute related to the Contested Amount. If Party A and
Party B shall resolve such dispute, such resolution shall be binding on Party
B, on the one hand, and Party A and any other Purchaser Indemnified Party (as
applicable), on the other hand, and a settlement agreement shall be signed by
Party A and Party B and sent to the Escrow Agent together with a Joint Written
Direction, and the Escrow Agent shall, promptly (and in any event within two
(2) Business Days) after receipt thereof, if applicable, release funds from
the Escrow Fund in accordance with the specific instructions provided in such
Joint Written Direction (which shall include written delivery instructions as
applicable).

 



 

(E) If Party B and Party A are unable to resolve the dispute relating to any
Contested Amount within 45 calendar days after the delivery of the Claim
Notice, the dispute relating to such Contested Amount shall be submitted to
any Competent Court, and the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold the Contested
Amount until Escrow Agent receives either: (i) a Joint Written Direction
providing specific written instructions regarding the delivery of the
Contested Amount, if any, to be released from the Escrow Fund; or (ii) a Final
Order providing specific written instructions regarding the delivery of the
Contested Amount, if any, to be released from the Escrow Fund. Any Final Order
shall be furnished to Party A, Party B and the Escrow Agent in writing, shall
constitute the conclusive determination of the issue in question, and shall be
binding upon Party A, Party B, MCRLP, the Purchaser, and the Escrow Agent. The
prevailing party in any dispute between Party B and Party A submitted to any
Competent Court shall be entitled to an award of attorneys fees and costs to
be paid by the losing Party.

 



 

(f) If a Change of Control (as defined in the Employment Agreements of even
date herewith between the Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser, on the
one hand, and each of the Principals, on the other hand) of Party A shall be
consummated prior to the Second Release Date, then Party B shall deliver a
written notice of such Change of Control executed by a Party B Representative
(a " _Change of Control Notice_ ") to Party A (or its successor in interest,
as applicable) and the Escrow Agent (together with a certification to the
Escrow Agent that delivery to Party A or its successor in interest, as
applicable, was done in accordance with the notice provisions of this Escrow
Agreement) requesting that the remaining Escrow Fund, if any, less the amount
of all Claimed Amounts that have not been paid or otherwise resolved as of the
date of such Change of Control Notice (the " _Retained Change of Control
Amount_ "), be released to Party B. Upon resolution of all Claim Notices made
prior to the date of such Change of Control Notice, that portion of the
Retained Change of Control Amount that is not paid to Party A, or to any
successor in interest of Party A, in satisfaction of such Claim Notices shall
be released in manner prescribed in or with respect to the resolution of the
applicable Claim Notice. Prior to

 



      
 

 



 

5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the 10th calendar day after receipt by
Escrow Agent of a Change of Control Notice (the " _Change of Control Response
Period_ "), Party A (or its successor in interest, as applicable) may deliver
to Party B and to the Escrow Agent (together with a certification to the
Escrow Agent that delivery to Party B was done in accordance with the notice
provisions of this Escrow Agreement) a Release Response Notice (which may be
executed by an authorized agent of Party As successor in interest) to any
Change of Control Notice delivered by Party B to the Escrow Agent pursuant to

interest) delivers a Change of Control Response Notice with respect to a
Change of Control Notice prior to the expiration of the Change of Control

8. _Escrow Agent_.

 



 

The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are specifically
and expressly set forth herein and no duties shall be implied. The Escrow
Agent shall neither be responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of, nor
have any requirements to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other
agreement, instrument or document between the Parties, in connection herewith,
if any, including without limitation, the Purchase Agreement (the "
_Underlying Agreement_ "), nor shall the Escrow Agent be required to determine
if any Person has complied with any such agreement, nor shall any additional
obligations of the Escrow Agent be inferred from the terms of such agreement,
even though reference thereto may be made in this Escrow Agreement. In the
event of any conflict between the terms and provisions of this Escrow
Agreement, those of the Underlying Agreement, any schedule or exhibit attached
to the Escrow Agreement, or any other agreement among the Parties, the terms
and conditions of this Escrow Agreement shall control. The Escrow Agent may
rely upon and shall not be liable for acting or refraining from acting upon
any written notice, document, instruction, request or other instrument
furnished to it hereunder, not only as to its due execution, validity and
effectiveness,

 



      
 

 



 

but also as to the truth and accuracy of any information contained therein,
which the Escrow Agent reasonably believes to be genuine and to have been
signed or presented by the proper party or parties, without inquiry and
without requiring substantiating evidence of any kind. The Escrow Agent shall
be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or
content of any such document, notice, instruction or request. Concurrent with
the execution of this Escrow Agreement, the Parties shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent authorized signers forms in the form of Annex I to this Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any Party, any beneficiary
or other Person for refraining from acting upon any instruction setting forth,
claiming, containing, objecting to, or related to the transfer or distribution
of the Escrow Fund, or any portion thereof, unless such instruction shall have
been delivered to the Escrow Agent in accordance with Section 14 below and the
Escrow Agent has been able to satisfy any applicable security procedures as
may be required hereunder and as set forth in Section 15. The Escrow Agent
shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy
or content of any such document, notice, instruction or request. Escrow Agent
shall not be responsible or liable in any manner for the performance by any
party of their respective obligations under the Underlying Agreement nor shall
Escrow Agent be responsible or liable in any manner for the failure of any
party to honor any of the provisions of this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow
Agent shall have no duty to solicit any payments which may be due it or the
Escrow Fund, including, without limitation, the Escrow Amount nor shall the
Escrow Agent have any duty or obligation to confirm or verify the accuracy or
correctness of any amounts deposited with it hereunder.

 



 

The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted
by it except to the extent that a Final Order of a Competent Court determines
that the Escrow Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct was the primary
cause of any loss to either of the Parties. The Escrow Agents sole
responsibility shall be for the safekeeping and disbursement of the Escrow
Fund in accordance with the terms of this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent
may execute any of its powers and perform any of its duties hereunder directly
or through affiliates, agents or attorneys and may consult with counsel,
accountants and other skilled Persons to be selected and retained by it,
including without limitation in the event of any dispute or question as to the
construction of any of the provisions hereof or of any other agreement or of
its duties hereunder, or relating to any dispute involving any party hereto.
The Escrow Agent shall incur no liability and shall be fully indemnified from
any liability whatsoever for anything done, suffered or omitted by it in
accordance with, or in reasonable reliance upon, the advice or opinion of any
such counsel, accountants or other skilled Persons. Party A shall promptly
pay, upon demand, the reasonable fees and expenses of any such counsel. Escrow
Agent shall have no liability or responsibility to question or determine the
accuracy or reasonableness of any Claimed Amount. Escrow Agent shall not be
obligated to take any legal action or commence any proceeding in connection
with the Escrow Fund, any account in which Escrow Fund is deposited, this
Escrow Agreement or the Underlying Agreement, or to appear in, prosecute or
defend any such legal action or proceeding.

 



 

If, at any time, (i) there shall exist any dispute involving any of the
Parties, Party A Representative and/or Party B Representative with respect to
the holding or disposition of any portion of the Escrow Fund or any other
obligations of Escrow Agent hereunder or Escrow Agent shall receive
instructions, claims or demands from any Party which the Escrow Agent
determines, in its sole discretion, conflict with any provision of this Escrow
Agreement, (ii)

 



      
 

 



 

Escrow Agent is unable to determine, to Escrow Agents sole satisfaction, the
proper disposition of any portion of the Escrow Fund or Escrow Agents proper
actions with respect to its obligations hereunder, or (iii) Party A
Representative and Party B Representative have not within 30 days of the
furnishing by Escrow Agent of a notice of resignation pursuant to Section 9
hereof, appointed a successor Escrow Agent to act hereunder, then Escrow Agent
may, in its sole discretion, take either or both of the following actions: (1)
suspend the performance of any of its obligations (including without
limitation any disbursement obligation) under this Escrow Agreement until such
dispute or uncertainty shall be resolved to the sole satisfaction of Escrow
Agent or until a successor Escrow Agent shall have been appointed (as the case
may be); or (2) petition (by means of an interpleader action or any other
appropriate method) any Competent Court, for instructions with respect to such
dispute or uncertainty, and to the extent required or permitted by law, pay
into such court, for holding and disposition in accordance with the
instructions of such Competent Court, the entire Escrow Fund. Escrow Agent
shall have no liability to any Party or any other individual or entity with
respect to any suspension of performance or disbursement into a Competent
Court, specifically including any liability or claimed liability that may
arise, or be alleged to have arisen, out of or as a result of any delay in the
disbursement of funds held in the Escrow Fund or any delay in or with respect
to any other action required or requested of Escrow Agent. Anything in this
Escrow Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Escrow
Agent be liable for special, incidental, punitive, indirect or consequential
loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost
profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such
loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. Escrow Agent may rely on
the validity, accuracy and content of the statements contained any written
notice, document, instruction, or request furnished to it hereunder by Party A
and Party B without further investigation, inquiry or examination.

 



 

9. _Succession_. The Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties or obligations hereunder at any time by giving its written resignation to the Parties. Such resignation shall take effect on the earlier of (a) a successor escrow agent being in place and (b) 30 days after such resignation is given to the Parties. In such event, Party A and Party B may appoint a successor escrow agent by mutual consent. If Party A and Party B fail to appoint a successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of 30 days following receipt of the notice of resignation, the Escrow Agent may petition any Competent Court for the appointment of a successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment shall be binding upon all parties hereto. The successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent an instrument accepting such appointment and the successor escrow agent shall, without further acts, be vested with all the estates, property rights, powers and duties of the predecessor Escrow Agent as if originally named as Escrow Agent herein. The retiring Escrow Agent shall transmit all records pertaining to the Escrow Fund and shall pay the entire Escrow Fund to the successor Escrow Agent, after making copies of such records as the retiring Escrow Agent deems advisable and after payment by Party A to the retiring Escrow Agent of all fees and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys fees) payable to or incurred by the retiring Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties and the exercise of its rights hereunder. After any retiring Escrow Agents resignation, the provisions of this Escrow Agreement shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement. Any entity into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any entity to which all or

 



      
 

 



 

substantially all the escrow business may be transferred, shall be the Escrow
Agent under this Escrow Agreement without further act.

 



 

10. _Removal of Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent may be removed at any time by mutual agreement of Party A and Party B by giving not less than 30 days prior written notice to the Escrow Agent. Prior to the expiration of such 30-day period, Party A and Party B shall designate, by mutual consent, a successor escrow agent. If no successor escrow agent is appointed within such 30-day period, the Escrow Agent may deposit all amounts remaining in the Escrow Fund with a Competent Court, whereupon the Escrow Agent shall be discharged of all duties and obligations hereunder.

 



 

11. _Compensation and Reimbursement_.

 



 

Party A agrees to (a) pay the Escrow Agent upon execution of this Escrow
Agreement and from time to time thereafter reasonable compensation for the
services to be rendered hereunder, which unless otherwise agreed in writing
shall be as described in Schedule A attached hereto, and (b) pay or reimburse
the Escrow Agent upon request for all expenses, disbursements and advances,
including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, travel expenses, telephone
and facsimile transmission costs, postage (including express mail and
overnight delivery charges), copying charges and the like incurred or made by
it in connection with the preparation, execution, performance, delivery,
modification and termination of this Escrow Agreement. The additional
provisions and information set forth on Schedule A are hereby incorporated by
this reference and form a part of this Escrow Agreement. All such compensation
and amounts payable to the Escrow Agent shall be paid by Party A. The
obligations of Party A under this Section 11 shall survive any termination of
this Escrow Agreement and the resignation or removal of Escrow Agent.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, the Escrow Agent is expressly _not_ authorized to,
and may _not_ , disburse to itself from the Escrow Fund any amounts, whether
for compensation and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses due and payable
hereunder or for any amount to which Escrow Agent is entitled to seek
indemnification pursuant to Section 12 hereof. Escrow Agent hereby waives and
shall not claim any lien on, right of setoff against or security interest in
the Escrow Fund for the payment of any claim for indemnification,
compensation, expenses or other amounts due hereunder.

 



 

12. _Indemnity_. From and at all times after the date of this Escrow Agreement, Party A, MCRLP and the Purchaser, on the one hand, and Party B, on the other hand, shall jointly and severally, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify, defend and save harmless the Escrow Agent and its affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers, agents, representatives and employees (the " _Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all actions, claims (whether or not valid), losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of in house or outside counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) of any kind or nature whatsoever incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee, whether direct, indirect or consequential, as a result of, arising out of or in connection with any claim, demand, suit, action or proceeding (including any inquiry or investigation) by any Person, including without limitation any Party to this Escrow Agreement, whether threatened or initiated, asserting a claim for any legal or equitable remedy against any

 



      
 

 



 

Person under any statute or regulation, including, but not limited to, any
federal or state securities laws, or under any common law or equitable cause
or otherwise, arising from or in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution, performance or failure of performance of this Escrow Agreement or
any transactions contemplated herein, whether or not any such Indemnitee is a
party to any such action, proceeding, suit or the target of any such inquiry
or investigation; _provided,_ that no Indemnitee shall have the right to be
indemnified hereunder for any liability determined by a Competent Court
pursuant to a Final Order to have resulted primarily from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. The Parties hereto acknowledge that
the foregoing indemnities shall survive the resignation or removal of the
Escrow Agent or the termination of this Escrow Agreement.

Notwithstanding the above, in the case of notices, approvals, consents,
requests and other communications delivered to the Escrow Agent pursuant to
(b) of this _Section 14_, such notices, approvals, consents, requests and
other communications shall be deemed to have been given on the date received
by the Escrow Agent. In the event that the Escrow Agent, in its sole
discretion, shall determine that an emergency exists, the Escrow Agent may use
such other means of communication as the Escrow Agent deems appropriate. "
_Business Day_ " shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or any other
day on which the Escrow Agent located at the notice address set forth above is
authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed.

 



 

15. _Security Procedures_ **.** In the event transfer instructions are given, whether in writing, by telecopier or otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized, but under no circumstance is required, to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the Person or Persons designated on Annex I hereto, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be the Person or Persons so designated. The Persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in a writing actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. If the Escrow Agent is unable to contact any of the authorized representatives identified in Annex I for Party A, the Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to any one or more of its executive officers, (" _Executive Officers_ "), which shall include the titles of President or Chief Financial Officer as the Escrow Agent may select. Such Executive Officer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully executed Incumbency Certificate, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such officer. The Escrow Agent and the beneficiarys bank in any transfer

 



      
 

 



 

may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying numbers
provided by Party A or Party B to identify (a) the beneficiary, (b) the
beneficiarys bank, or (c) an intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply
any of the escrowed property for any disbursement order it executes using any
such identifying number, even when its use may result in a Person other than
the beneficiary being delivered property, or the transfer to a bank other than
the beneficiarys bank or an intermediary bank designated. The parties to this
Escrow Agreement acknowledge that these security procedures are commercially
reasonable. Party A and Party B agree that repetitive or standing settlement
instructions will be effective as the transfer instructions of Party A and
Party B, whether or not authorized, if such settlement instructions are
verified pursuant to the security procedure provided herein or such other
security procedure that the Escrow Agent, Party A and Party B may agree to.

 



 

16. _Miscellaneous_ **. **The provisions of this Escrow Agreement may be waived, altered, amended or supplemented, in whole or in part, only by a writing signed by all of the parties hereto.

Consistent with the preceding sentence, the parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Escrow Agreement brought by any party hereto and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Escrow Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Escrow Agreement may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts. The parties hereto hereby waive to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Escrow Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Escrow Agreement.

other provision of this Escrow Agreement and each and every other provision of
this Escrow Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The waiver by
any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Escrow Agreement shall
not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach by
any party. This Escrow Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. All signatures of the parties to this
Escrow Agreement may be transmitted by facsimile, and such facsimile will, for

entity we will ask for documentation to verify its formation and existence as
a legal entity. We may also ask to see financial statements, licenses,

million of cash (not to exceed a total of $3 million):

 



 

a. Obtaining an Urban Transit Hub Tax Credit for the _Marbella II Project_

 



 

b. Obtaining a New Jersey ERGG Grant for the _Hotel Development atop the 4/5
Garage_

 



 

c. Subject to the discretion of the Chief Executive Officer of MCRC, regarding
working efficiently to achieve tax credits

 



 

The payments required to be made pursuant to this Section B will be paid on
the Third Anniversary Date.

 



      
 

 



 

 **II.** ** ****_Mack-Cali TRS Component_**

 



 

To the extent that MCRC generates shareholder value in excess of the specified
absolute and/or relative thresholds described below, Seller will receive a
maximum of $7 million of additional cash. There are three ways in which all or
a portion of the $7 million can be earned.

 



 

1. _Absolute Threshold._ To the extent that MCRC generates an aggregate total return to shareholders ("TRS") between 18% and 27% over the three-year period commencing on the Closing Date (6-9% annually) Seller will earn between $1.4 million and $7 million in cash, respectively. TRS includes share price appreciation and dividends.

 



 

a. At performance levels between 18-27%, the award will be prorated
accordingly.

 



 

b. Therefore, if MCRC has an aggregate TRS during the three-year period of
27%, the full $7 million will be earned.

 



 

c. If MCRC has an aggregate TRS of 18% during the three-year period, $1.4
million will be earned.

 



 

d. By way of example, if the dividend remains constant and the stock price at
the date of Closing is $30 per share, if the stock reaches approximately
$32.50 by the end of Year 3, the full $7 million will be earned.

 



 

2. _Relative Threshold._ To the extent that MCRCs TRS for the three-year period is at or above the 50th percentile of the peer group (consisting of the SNL Equity REIT Index), Seller will earn at least a portion of the $10 million even though the absolute hurdles may not have been met. Specifically, the relative component would work as follows:

 



 

a. If MCRCs TRS performance is at or above the 80th percentile of the peer
group, 100% of the otherwise unearned amount would be earned.

 



 

b. If MCRCs TRS performance is at or above the 70th percentile of the peer
group, 75% of the otherwise unearned amount would be earned.

 



 

c. If MCRCs TRS performance is at or above the 60th percentile of the peer
group, 50% of the otherwise unearned amount would be earned.

 



 

d. If MCRCs TRS performance is at or above the 50th percentile of the peer
group, 25% of the otherwise unearned amount would be earned.

 



 

e. For performance levels between the identified percentiles, the award will
be prorated accordingly.

 



      
 

 



 

3. _Annual Earnout Opportunity._ To the extent that in any single year _(i.e._ each of the twelve-month periods commencing on the Closing Date and the first and the second anniversaries of the Closing Date (each such twelve-month period, a cash "Year")), MCRC generates a TRS of between 6% and 9%, Seller will receive a payment equal to 50% of the annualized value of the award that would have been earned had MCRC generated that level of return over the full three year period. To the extent that an award is earned under this provision, subsequent negative shareholder value creation will have no impact on the amounts earned.

 



 

a. By way of example, if MCRCs TRS in Year 1 reaches 9%, Seller will earn
$1.167 million computed as follows: $7 million total value divided by three
years multiplied by 50%. In the event MCRCs stock price decreases in
subsequent years, the $1.167 million earned will not be forfeited.

 



 

b. If MCRCs stock price decreased from $30 to $20 in Year One, Seller would
still have the opportunity to earn a portion of the Earn-out based upon the
Companys performance in Year 2 relative to the $20 baseline stock price.

 



 

4. Purchaser will pay, and the Parents will cause Purchaser to pay, to Seller any amounts payable pursuant to Paragraphs 1 and 2 above no later than thirty (30) days after the Third Anniversary and any amounts payable pursuant to Paragraph 3 above no later than thirty (30) days after the end of each Year.

 



 

The attached schedules illustrate the calculations described above both in the
aggregate over the preceding six historical three-year periods and
prospectively on a hypothetical annual basis. References on the attached
schedules to Mack-Cali mean MCRC.

1. _Release_. For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which the parties hereby acknowledge, **** Seller and each of the Principal Parties, on such Persons own behalf, on behalf of the Principals respective heirs, and on behalf of the respective successors and assigns of all of the foregoing Persons (collectively, the " _Releasing Parties_ ") hereby release and forever discharge each of the Companies (other than Roseland Property) and each of the Property Owners, and each of their respective officers, directors, shareholders, members and managers (but solely with respect to activities that such individuals have conducted on behalf of a Company as an officer, director, shareholder, member or manager of such Company), and their respective, heirs, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Released Parties_ ") from any and all claims, demands, obligations, causes of action, controversies, actions, debts, liens, contracts, agreements, promises, representations, torts, damages, costs, attorneys fees, moneys due on accounts, obligations, judgments or liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever, whether at law or in equity, pursuant to statute, regulation or common law, for negligence, strict liability, fiduciary or contract breach, intentional wrongdoing or otherwise, and regardless of whether known or unknown, accrued or contingent, arising out of or relating in any manner to any matters, causes or things whatsoever from the beginning of time through the date hereof.

2. _Covenant Not to Sue_.

3. _No Additional Facts_. Each of the Releasing Parties hereby expressly waives any rights such Releasing Party may have under the statutes of any jurisdiction or common law principles of similar effect, to preserve claims and the like which are released pursuant to Section 1 (" _Released Claims_ ") which such Releasing Party does not know or suspect to exist in such Releasing Partys favor at the time of executing this Release. Each of the Releasing Parties understands and acknowledges that it may discover facts different from, or in addition to, those which it knows or believes to be true with respect to the claims released herein, and agrees that this Release shall be and

 



      
 

 



 

remain effective in all respects notwithstanding any subsequent discovery of
different and/or additional facts. Should any Releasing Party discover that
any fact relied upon in entering into this Release was untrue, or that any
fact was concealed, or that an understanding of the facts or law was
incorrect, no Releasing Party shall be entitled to any relief as a result
thereof, and each of the Releasing Parties surrenders any rights it might have
to rescind this Release on any ground. This Release is intended to be and is
final and binding regardless of any claim of misrepresentation, promise made

other circumstances whatsoever.

 



 

4. _No Assignment of Released Claims_. Each Releasing Party represents and warrants to the Released Parties that there has been no assignment or other transfer of any interest in any Released Claim.

the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective legal
representatives, successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

(b) _Non-Waiver_. The failure in any one or more instances of a party to
insist upon performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this
Release, to exercise any right or privilege in this Release conferred, or the
waiver by said party of any breach of any of the terms, covenants or
conditions of this Release, shall not be construed as a subsequent waiver of
any such terms, covenants, conditions, right or privileges, but the same shall
continue and remain in full force and effect as if no such forbearance or
waiver had occurred. No waiver shall be effective unless it is in writing and
signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party.

 



 

(c) _Applicable Law_. This Release shall be governed and controlled as to
validity, enforcement, interpretation, construction, effect and in all other
respects by the internal laws of the state of New York applicable to contracts
made in that state.

 



 

(d) _Binding Effect_. This Release shall be binding upon the parties hereto
and shall inure to the benefit of the Released Parties, Purchaser, the
Parents, and the successors and permitted assigns of all of the foregoing
Persons. Nothing in this Release, express or implied, is intended to confer on
any Person other than the Released Parties, Purchaser and the Parents any
rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this
Release.

 



 

(e) _Assignment_. This Release shall not be assignable by any of the Releasing
Parties without the prior written consent of the Parents.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Amendments_. This Release shall not be modified or amended except
pursuant to an instrument in writing executed and delivered on behalf of each
of the parties hereto.

 



 

(g) _Headings_. The headings contained in this Release are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Release.

 



 

(h) _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Release shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision of this Release is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or any other jurisdiction, and this Release shall be
reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction so as to best give
effect to the intent of the parties under this Release.

 



 

(i) _Counterparts_. Counterpart copies of this Release may be signed by all
parties and signature pages exchanged by telecopier or email. The parties
intend and agree that counterpart copies signed and exchanged as provided in
the preceding sentence shall be fully binding. All such counterparts, taken
together, shall constitute the one and same instrument.

 



 

(j) _No Strict Construction_. The parties hereto jointly participated in the
negotiation and drafting of this Release. The language used in this Release
shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express
their collective mutual intent, this Release shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties hereto, and no rule of strict construction shall be
applied against any Person.

 



 

(k) _Gender_. As used in this Release, the masculine, feminine or neuter
gender shall be deemed to include the others whenever the context so indicates
or requires.

 



 

(l) _Interpretation_. Whenever the term "include" or "including" is used in
this Release, it shall mean "including, without limitation," (whether or not
such language is specifically set forth) and shall not be deemed to limit the
range of possibilities to those items specifically enumerated. The words
"hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import refer to this
Release as a whole and not to any particular provision. Terms defined in the
singular have a comparable meaning when used in the plural and vice versa.

 



 

(m) _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Any action, suit or proceeding initiated in
connection with this Release shall be brought solely in any Court in the
Borough of Manhattan of the City of New York, N.Y. having jurisdiction over
the subject matter hereof. Each of the parties hereto hereby submit themselves
to the jurisdiction of any such Court for the purpose of any such action and
agree that

 



      
 

 



 

the service of process on them in any such action may be effected by the means
by which notices are to be given under the Purchase Agreement.

 



 

(n) _Facsimile Signatures_. This Release, and any amendments hereto, to the
extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or electronic
transmission in portable document format ("pdf"), shall be treated in all
manner and respects as an original agreement and shall be considered to have
the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto or to any such
amendment, each other party hereto or thereto shall re-execute original forms
thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto or to any such
amendment shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or electronic
transmission in pdf to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
amendment was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile
machine or electronic transmission in pdf as a defense to the formation or
enforceability of a contract and each such party forever waives any such
defense.

place of employment shall be at the principal office of the Company which
shall be located either in Short Hills, New Jersey or at Port Imperial located

minimum annual base salary in the amount of $400,000 (the "Annual Base
Salary") payable in accordance with the Companys regular payroll practices.
Employees Annual Base Salary shall be reviewed annually in accordance with
the policy of the Company from time to time and may be subject to upward
adjustment based upon, among other things, Employees performance, as
determined in the sole discretion of the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company. In no event shall Employees Annual Base Salary in effect at a
particular time be reduced without his prior written consent.

 



 

(b) _Incentive Compensation/Bonuses_. In addition, during the Employment
Period, Employee shall be eligible for incentive compensation payable in such
amounts as may be determined by the Company, in the exercise of its
discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee shall have a threshold
bonus opportunity of up to $1 million with respect to the first twelve months
of the Employment Period, up to $1.5 million with respect to the second twelve

 



      
 

 



 

months of the Employment Period, and up to $2 million with respect to the
third twelve months of the Employment Period (the "Target Bonuses"). Each such
twelve-month period is referred to in this Agreement as a Year. For purposes
of these Target Bonuses, fifty percent (50%) of the Target Bonuses shall be
based on the achievement of specified operating objectives as described on
Exhibit A hereto, and the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the Target Bonuses
shall be determined by the Chief Executive Officer **** of the Company, in his
sole discretion. The amount of the Target Bonus for each Year will be awarded
and determined no later than 30 days after the end of each such Year and will
be communicated to the Employee within such 30 day period in a notice from the
Chief Executive Officer **** of the Company. The Target Bonuses awarded
("Awarded Target Bonuses") to Employee for each Year shall be payable to the
Employee within 30 days after the third anniversary (the "Third Anniversary")
of the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that if Employees
employment with the Company is terminated prior to the Third Anniversary by
the Company for Cause or by reason of the resignation of the Employee for
other than Good Reason, then none of the Awarded Target Bonuses shall be
payable to Employee. If Employees employment is terminated for any other
reason prior to the Third Anniversary, then any Awarded Target Bonuses for any
of the applicable Years preceding the Year in which such termination occurs
shall be deemed earned and shall be paid as provided below in this Agreement
**.**

 



 

(c) Taxes and Withholding. The Company shall have the right to deduct and
withhold from all compensation all social security and other federal, state
and local taxes and charges which currently are or which hereafter may be
required by law to be so deducted and withheld.

 



 

(d) Additional Benefits. In addition to the compensation specified above and
other benefits provided pursuant to this Paragraph 4, Employee shall be
entitled to the following benefits:

Retirement Plan (subject to statutory rules and maximum contributions and non-

stock and/or unit awards, loan programs and any other incentive compensation
plans or programs (whether or not employee benefit plans or programs), as
maintained by the Company or Mack-Cali Realty Corporation ("MCRC") from time
to time and made generally available to employees of the Company or MCRC with
such participation to be consistent with reasonable Company or MCRC guidelines
as the case may be;

 



 

(ii) participation in any health insurance, disability insurance, paid

available to employees of the Company (which shall be comparable to the plans
and benefits provided to employees of MCRC); and

 



 

(iii) reimbursement for reasonable business expenses incurred by Employee in
furtherance of the interests of the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

5. Termination of Employment and Change In Control.

 



 

(a) Employees employment hereunder may be terminated during the Employment
Period under the following circumstances:

 



 

(i) Cause. The Company shall have the right to terminate Employees employment

persons, as such terms are used in Sections 13 and 14 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), other than any employee
benefit plan sponsored by the Company **** or MCRC, becomes the "beneficial
owner", as such term is used in Section 13 of the Exchange Act, (irrespective
of any vesting or waiting periods) of (I) Common Stock of MCRC **** ("Common
Stock") **** or any class of stock convertible into Common Stock and/or (II)
Common OP Units of MCRLP ("Common OP Units") **** or preferred units or any
other class of units convertible into Common OP Units, in an amount equal to
twenty (20%) percent or more of the sum total of the Common Stock and the
Common OP Units (treating all classes of outstanding stock, units or other
securities convertible into stock units as if they were converted into Common
Stock or Common OP Units as the case may be and then treating Common Stock and
Common OP Units as if they were a single class) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to such acquisition as if they were a single class and
disregarding any equity raise in connection with the financing of such
transaction; (B) any Common Stock is purchased pursuant to a tender or
exchange offer other than an offer by MCRC; (C) the dissolution or liquidation

partnership units possessing less than fifty (50%) percent of the surviving or
acquiring company or MCRC **** and MCRLP taken as a whole; or (D) a turnover,
during any two (2) year period, of the majority of the members of the Board
**** of Directors of MCRC **** (the "Board"), without the consent of the

(b) Notice of Termination. Any termination of Employees employment by the
Company or any such termination by Employee (other than on account of death)
shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination to the other party
hereto. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a
notice which shall indicate the specific termination provision in this
Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of Employees
employment under the provision so indicated. In the event of the termination
of Employees employment on account of death, written Notice of Termination
shall be deemed to have been provided on the date of death.

 



      
 

 



 

6. Compensation Upon Termination of Employment By the Company for Cause or By Employee without Good Reason.

 



 

In the event the Company terminates Employees employment for Cause or
Employee terminates his employment without Good Reason, the Company shall pay
Employee any unpaid Annual Base Salary at the rate then in effect accrued
through and including the date of termination. In addition, in such event,
Employee shall be entitled (i) to receive any earned but unpaid incentive
compensation or Awarded Target Bonuses (provided that Employee shall not be
entitled to any Awarded Target Bonuses if his employment is terminated prior
to the Third Anniversery by the Company for Cause or by reason of his
resignation for other than Good Reason) and (ii) in the event any options have
been granted Employee **,** to exercise any options which have vested and are
exercisable in accordance with the terms of the applicable option grant
agreement or plan.

 



 

Except for any rights which Employee may have to unpaid salary amounts through
and including the date of termination, earned but unpaid incentive
compensation or Awarded **** Target Bonuses (except to the extent he shall not
be entitled to Awarded Target Bonuses as herein provided), the Company shall
have no further obligations hereunder following such termination. The
aforesaid amounts shall be payable in full immediately upon such termination.

 



 

7. Compensation Upon Termination of Employment Upon Death or Disability.

 



 

In the event of termination of Employees employment as a result of either
Employees death or Disability, the Company shall pay to Employee, his estate
or his personal representative the aggregate of (i) a cash payment of one
million dollars ($1,000,000) in full immediately upon such termination (the
"Fixed Amount") and (ii) reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to date of
termination ("Expense Reimbursement"). Employee (and Employees dependents)
shall also receive continuation of health coverage through the end of the
Unexpired Employment Period on the same basis as health coverage is provided
by the Company or MCRC **** for active employees and as may be amended from
time to time ("Medical Continuation"), and any reimbursements under such plan
will be made no later than the last day of the year after the year in which
the expense was incurred.

 



 

In addition, if granted to Employee, all (A) incentive compensation payments
or programs of any nature whether stock based or otherwise that are subject to
a vesting schedule including, without limitation, Warrants, Restricted Share
Awards or any other restricted stock, phantom stock, units and any loan
forgiveness arrangements granted to Employee ("Incentive Compensation") shall
immediately vest as of the date of such termination ("Vested Incentive
Compensation") and, (B) options granted to Employee, if any, shall immediately
vest as of the date of such termination (the "Vested Options") and Employee
shall be entitled at the option of Employee, his estate or his personal
representative, within one (1) year of the date of such termination, to
exercise the Vested Options and/or other options which have vested (including,
without limitation, all other options which have previously vested in
accordance with any applicable option grant agreement or plan) (the "Total
Vested Options") and are exercisable in accordance with the terms of the
applicable option grant agreement or plan and/or any other methods or
procedures for exercise applicable to optionees or to require the Company
(upon written notice delivered within one hundred eighty (180) days following
the date of Employees

 



      
 

 



 

termination) to repurchase all or any portion of Employees vested options to
purchase shares of Common Stock at a price equal to the difference between the
Repurchase Fair Market Value (as hereinafter defined) of the shares of Common
Stock for which the options to be repurchased are exercisable and the exercise
price of such options as of the date of Employees termination of employment
(the "Vested Option Exercise Election"). In the event of a conflict between
any Incentive Compensation grant agreement or program or any option grant
agreement or plan and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall
control **.** In addition, upon Employees death or disability, the Company
shall pay to Employees estate or to Employee, as the case may be, within 30
days after such death or disability all Awarded Target Bonuses.

 



 

Except for any rights which Employee or Employees estate in the event of
Employees death may have to all of the above including the Fixed Amount,
Vested Incentive Compensation, Total Vested Options and the Vested Option
Exercise Election, Awarded Target Bonuses, **** Expense Reimbursement and
Medical Continuation (which, in the event of Employees death, shall be
provided to Employees dependents), the Company shall have no further
obligations hereunder following such termination.

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Repurchase Fair Market Value" shall mean the
average of the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange (or such other
exchange on which the Common Stock is primarily traded) of the Common Stock on
each of the trading days within the thirty (30) days immediately preceding the
date of termination of Employees employment.

 



 

8. Compensation Upon Termination of Employment By the Company Without Cause or By Employee for Good Reason.

 



 

In the event the Company terminates Employees employment for any reason other
than Cause or Employee terminates his employment for Good Reason, the Company
shall pay to Employee and Employee shall be entitled to receive the aggregate
of (i) the Fixed Amount **** plus an amount (the "Remaining Salary") equal to
the Annual Base Salary for the balance of the Employment Term, which shall be
payable in a lump sum within 10 days after any such termination of employment
**** and (ii) Vested Incentive Compensation, Total Vested Options and the
Vested Option Exercise Election, Expense Reimbursement and Medical
Continuation at such time as provided in subparagraph 4(d) and Paragraph 7
above and any Awarded Target Bonuses within 10 days after any such termination
of employment. In the event of a conflict between any Incentive Compensation
grant agreement or program or any option grant agreement or plan and this
Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control. Employee understands
that any options exercised more than ninety (90) days following the date of
his termination of employment which were granted as incentive stock options
shall automatically be converted into non-qualified options.

 



 

Except for any rights which Employee may have to the Fixed Amount, Remaining
Salary Vested Incentive Compensation, Total Vested Options and the Vested
Option Exercise Election, Awarded Target Bonuses, Expense Reimbursement and
Medical Continuation, the Company shall have no further obligations hereunder
following such termination. The parties both agree that the agreement to make
these payments was consideration and an inducement to obtain Employees
consent to enter into this Agreement. The payments are not a penalty and
neither

 



      
 

 



 

party will claim them to be a penalty. Rather, the payments represent a fair
approximation of reasonable amounts due to Employee for the Employment Period.

 



 

9. Change in Control.

 



 

(a) Options. Any Incentive Compensation and options granted to Employee that
have not vested as of the date of a Change in Control shall immediately vest
upon the date of the Change in Control. Neither the occurrence of a Change in
Control, nor the vesting in any warrants or options as a result thereof shall
require Employee to exercise any warrants or options. In the event of a
conflict between any Incentive Compensation grant agreement or program or any
option grant agreement or plan and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement
shall control.

 



 

(b) Upon Termination. In the event Employee terminates his employment on or
following a Change in Control as set forth in sub-paragraph 5(a)(vii), the
Company shall pay to Employee and Employee shall be entitled to all the
payments and rights Employee would have had if Employee had terminated his
employment for Good Reason as set forth in Paragraph 8.

 



 

Except for any rights which Employee may have to the Fixed Amount, ****
Remaining Salary Vested Incentive Compensation, Total Vested Options
(including, without limitation, by acceleration in accordance with sub-
paragraph 9(a)) and the Vested Option Exercise Election, Awarded Target
Bonuses, Expense Reimbursement and Medical Continuation, the Company shall
have no further obligations hereunder following such termination.

 



 

10. Mitigation / Effect on Employee Benefit Plans and Programs.

 



 

(a) Mitigation. Employee shall not be required to mitigate amounts payable
under this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, and there shall
be no offset against amounts due Employee under this Agreement on account of
subsequent employment. Amounts owed to Employee under this Agreement shall not
be offset by any claims the Company may have against Employee and such payment
shall not be affected by any other circumstances, including, without
limitation, any counterclaim, recoupment, defense, or other right which the
Company may have against Employee or others.

 



 

(b) Effect on Employee Benefit Programs. The termination of Employees
employment hereunder, whether by the Company or Employee, shall have no effect
on the rights and obligations of the parties hereto under the Companys or
MCRCs (i) welfare benefit plans including, without limitation, Medical
Continuation as provided for herein and, health coverage thereafter but only
to the extent required by law, and on the same basis applicable to other
employees and (ii) 401(k) Plan but only to the extent required by law and
pursuant to the terms of the 401(k) Plan.

 



 

11. Confidential Information.

 



 

(a) Employee understands and acknowledges that during his employment with the
Company, he will be exposed to Confidential Information (as defined below),
all of which is proprietary and which will rightfully belong to the Company.
Employee shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company
such Confidential Information obtained by Employee

 



      
 

 



 

during his employment with the Company and shall not, directly or indirectly,
at any time, either during or after his employment with the Company, without
the Companys prior written consent, use any of such Confidential Information
or disclose any of such Confidential information to any individual or entity
other than the Company or its employees, attorneys, accountants, financial
advisors, consultants, or investment bankers except as required in the
performance of his duties for the Company or as otherwise required by law.
Employee such take all reasonable steps to safeguard such Confidential
Information and to protect such Confidential Information against disclosure,
misuse, loss or theft.

 



 

(b) The term "Confidential Information" shall mean any information not
generally known in the relevant trade or industry or otherwise not generally
available to the public, which was obtained from the Company or its
predecessors or which was learned, discovered, developed, conceived,
originated or prepared during or as a result of the performance of any
services by Employee on behalf of the Company or its predecessors. For
purposes of this Paragraph 11, the Company shall be deemed to include any
entity which is controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Company or MCRC and
any entity of which a majority of the economic interest is owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Company or MCRC.

 



 

12. Return of Documents.

 



 

Except for such items which are of a personal nature to Employee (e.g., daily
business planner), all writings, records, and other documents and things
containing any Confidential Information shall be the exclusive property of the
Company, shall not be copied, summarized, extracted from, or removed from the
premises of the Company, except in pursuit of the business of the Company and
at the direction of the Company, and shall be delivered to the Company,
without retaining any copies, upon the termination of Employees employment or
at any time as requested by the Company.

 



 

13. Noncompete.

 



 

Employee agrees that:

 



 

(a) During the Employment Period and, in the event (i) the Company terminates
Employees employment, for Cause, or (ii) Employee terminates his employment
without Good Reason, for a one (1) year period thereafter, Employee shall not,
directly or indirectly, within the continental United States, engage in, or
own, invest in, manage or control any venture or enterprise primarily engaged
in any office-service, flex, or office property development, acquisition or
management activities without regard to whether or not such activities compete
with the Company. Nothing herein shall prohibit Employee from being a passive
owner of not more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of any class
of securities of a corporation or other entity engaged in such business which
is publicly traded, so long as he has no active participation in the business
of such corporation or other entity. Moreover, the foregoing limitations shall
not be deemed to restrict or otherwise limit Employee from conducting real
estate development, acquisition or management activities, provided that during
the Employment Period the performance of such activities does not prevent
Employee from devoting substantially all of his business time to the Company.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) If, at the time of enforcement of this Paragraph 13, a court shall hold
that the duration, scope, area or other restrictions stated herein are
unreasonable, the parties agree that reasonable maximum duration, scope, area
or other restrictions may be substituted by such court for the stated
duration, scope, area or other restrictions and upon substitution by such
court, this Agreement shall be automatically modified without further action
by the parties hereto.

 



 

(c) For purposes of this Paragraph 13, the Company shall be deemed to include
any entity which is controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Company or MCRC
and any entity of which a majority of the economic interest is owned, directly
or indirectly, by the Company or MCRC.

 



 

(d) It is understood and agreed that Employee has joined in the ****
Membership Interest Agreement for certain limited purposes which contains
different provisions relating to non-competition and related matters, than
those in this Paragraph 13. It is further understood and agreed that the
provisions of that Membership Interest Agreement are cumulative to those
contained herein such that they shall apply if, as, and when those contained
herein do not, and the provisions of this Paragraph 13 shall apply if, as, and
when the provisions of the Membership Interest Agreement do not. In the event
of any inconsistencies between this Agreement and the Membership Interest
Agreement, the provisions of the Membership Interest Agreement shall control.

 



 

14. Remedies

 



 

The parties hereto agree that the Company would suffer irreparable harm from a
breach by Employee of any of the covenants or agreements contained in
Paragraphs 11, 12 or 13 of this Agreement. Therefore, in the event of the
actual or threatened breach by Employee of any of the provisions of Paragraphs
11, 12 or 13 of this Agreement, the Company may, in addition and supplementary
to other rights and remedies existing in its favor, apply to any court of law
or equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive
or other relief in order to enforce or prevent any violation of the provisions
thereof.

 



 

15. Indemnification/Legal Fees.

 



 

(a) _Indemnification_. In the event the Employee is made party or threatened
to be made a party to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (a "Proceeding"), by reason of Employees
employment with or serving as an officer or director of the Company, whether
or not the basis of such Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity,
the Company shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend Employee to the fullest
extent authorized by Delaware law, as the same exists and may hereafter be
amended, against any and all claims, demands, suits, judgments, assessments
and settlements including all expenses incurred or suffered by Employee in
connection therewith (including, without limitation, all legal fees incurred
using counsel reasonably acceptable to Employee) and such indemnification
shall continue as to Employee even after Employee is no longer employed by the
Company and shall inure to the benefit of his heirs, executors, and
administrators. Expenses incurred by Employee in connection with any
Proceeding shall be paid by the Company in advance upon request of Employee
that the Company pay such expenses; but, only in the event that Employee shall
have delivered in writing to the Company an undertaking to reimburse the

 



      
 

 



 

Company for expenses with respect to which Employee is not entitled to
indemnification. The provisions of this Paragraph shall remain in effect after
this Agreement is terminated irrespective of the reasons for termination. The
indemnification provisions of this Paragraph shall not supersede or reduce any
indemnification provided to Employee under any separate agreement, or the by-
laws of the Company since it is intended that this Agreement shall expand and
extend the Employees rights to receive indemnity.

 



 

(b) _Legal Fees_. If any contest or dispute shall arise between the Company
and Employee regarding or as a result of any provision of this Agreement, the
Company shall reimburse Employee for all legal fees and expenses reasonably
incurred by Employee in connection with such contest or dispute, but only if
Employee is successful in respect of substantially all of Employees claims
pursued or defended in connection with such contest or dispute. Such
reimbursement shall be made as soon as practicable following the resolution of
such contest or dispute (whether or not appealed).

 



 

16. Successors and Assigns.

 



 

(a) The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by
purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of
the business and/or assets of the Company, by agreement in form and substance
satisfactory to Employee, to expressly assume and agree to perform this
Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be
required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the
Company to obtain such agreement prior to the effectiveness of an such
succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle Employee to
compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the same terms as he
would be entitled to hereunder if Employee terminated his employment hereunder
within six (6) months of a Change in Control as set forth in Paragraph 9,
except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any
such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the date of termination. In
the event of such a breach of this Agreement, the Notice of Termination shall
specify such date as the date of termination. As used in this Agreement,
"Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to
all or substantially all of its business and/or its assets as aforesaid which
executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this Paragraph 16 or which
otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by
operation of law. Any cash payments owed to Employee pursuant to this
Paragraph 16 shall be paid to Employee in a single sum without discount for
early payment immediately prior to the consummation of the transaction with
such successor.

 



 

(b) This Agreement and all rights of Employee hereunder may be transferred
only by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Upon Employees death,
this Agreement and all rights of Employee hereunder shall inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by Employees beneficiary or beneficiaries, personal or
legal representatives, or estate, to the extent any such person succeeds to
Employees interests under this Agreement. Employee shall be entitled to
select and change a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive any benefit or
compensation payable hereunder following Employees death by giving Company
written notice thereof. If Employee should die following the date of
termination while any amounts would still be payable to him hereunder if he
had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein,
shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to such person or
persons so appointed in

 



      
 

 



 

writing by Employee, including, without limitation, under any applicable plan,
or otherwise to his legal representatives or estate.

 



 

17. Timing of and No Duplication of Payments.

 



 

All payments payable to Employee pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid at
such times as provided in this Agreement, and if specific times are not
provided for any such payments, then such payments will be paid **** as soon
as practicable after such amounts have become fully vested and determinable.
In addition, Employee shall not be entitled to receive duplicate payments
under any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

18. Modification or Waiver.

 



 

No amendment, modification, waiver, termination or cancellation of this
Agreement shall be binding or effective for any purpose unless it is made in a
writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of such amendment,
modification, waiver, termination or cancellation is sought. No course of
dealing between or among the parties to this Agreement shall be deemed to
affect or to modify, amend or discharge any provision or term of this
Agreement. No delay on the part of the Company or Employee in the exercise of
any of their respective rights or remedies shall operate as a waiver thereof,
and no single or partial exercise by the Company or Employee of any such right
or remedy shall preclude other or further exercise thereof. A waiver of right
or remedy on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of
any such right or remedy on any other occasion.

 



 

The respective rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall survive
the Employees termination of employment and termination of this Agreement to
the extent necessary for the intended preservation of such rights and
obligations.

 



 

19. Notices.

 



 

All notices or other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be
made in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered by
hand or delivered by a recognized delivery service or mailed, postage prepaid,
by express, certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and
addressed to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company or Employee, as
applicable, at the address set forth above (or to such other address as shall
have been previously provided in accordance with this Paragraph 19).

 



 

20. Governing Law.

 



 

This agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of New Jersey except as to Paragraph 15(a), without regard to
principles of conflicts of laws thereunder.

 



 

21. Severability.

 



 

Whenever possible, each provision and term of this Agreement shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision or term of this Agreement shall be held to be prohibited
by or invalid under such applicable law, then, subject to

 



      
 

 



 

the provisions of sub-paragraph 13(b) above, such provision or term shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without

provided to Employee under this Agreement:

 



 

(a) For purposes of Section 409A, (i) each "payment" (as defined by Section
409A) made under this Agreement shall be considered a "separate payment," and
(ii) payments shall be deemed exempt from the definition of deferred
compensation under Section 409A to the fullest extent possible under the
"short-term deferral" exemption of Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(b)(4), which
exemption is hereby incorporated by reference.

 



 

(b) If Employee is a "specified employee" as determined by the Company
consistent with Section 409A as of his separation from service, to the extent
any payment under this Agreement constitutes deferred compensation subject to
Section 409A, and to the extent required by Section 409A, no payments due
under this Agreement may be made until the earlier

payments delayed during this six- month period shall be paid in a lump sum on

service. Any payment due under this Agreement upon termination of employment
that is subject to Section 409A shall only be made upon a "separation from
service" as that term is defined under Section 409A.

 



 

(c) In the event there is a 6-month delay in payments under subparagraph 27(b)
above, the Company shall establish and fund an irrevocable "rabbi" trust, in
form and substance reasonable satisfactory to Employee, effective as of the
beginning of the 6-month period and ending upon the close of such period, to
secure the payment of all such delayed amounts to Employee.

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this Agreement as of the
date first above written.written.

WHEREAS, the Company desires to employ Employee as Co-President of the Company
and Employee desires to be employed by the Company as Co-President of the
Company, pursuant to the terms set forth herein.

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company is a subsidiary of Mack-Cali Realty, L.P., a Delaware

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and
agreements set forth herein, the parties hereby agree as follows:

 



 

1. Employment.

 



 

The Company hereby agrees to employ Employee, and Employee hereby agrees to
accept such employment during the period and upon the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

 



 

2. Employment Period.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement to the contrary, the terms
and conditions of this Agreement shall be and remain in effect during the
period of employment (the "Employment Period") established under this
Paragraph 2. The Initial Employment Period shall be for a term commencing on
the date of this Agreement and ending on the third (3rd) anniversary of the
date of this Agreement provided, however, that this Agreement shall
automatically renew for a term of one (1) year on the third (3rd) anniversary
of the date of this Agreement and on each anniversary of the date of this
Agreement thereafter so that a constant one (1) year Employment Period shall
be in effect, unless (i) the Company or Employee elects not to extend the term
of this Agreement by giving written notice to the other party in accordance
with Paragraph 19, in which case the term of this Agreement shall become
fixed, or (ii) Employees employment terminates hereunder. Any extension of
this Agreement shall not create an obligation of the Company to issue awards
to Employee hereunder.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary: (i) Employees
employment with the Company may be terminated by the Company or Employee
during the Employment Period, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement; and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall mandate or prohibit a

Company and Employee may mutually agree.

 



 

(c) If Employees employment with the Company is terminated, for purposes of
this Agreement the term "Unexpired Employment Period" shall mean the period
commencing on the date of such termination and ending on the last day of the

3. Services.

 



 

(a) _Services_. During the Employment Period, Employee shall **** hold the
position of Co-President of the Company reporting to the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company and devote his best efforts and substantially all of
his business time, skill and attention to the business of the Company (other
than absences due to vacation, illness, disability or approved leave of
absence), and shall perform such duties as are customarily performed by a
similar executive holding such position and as may be more specifically
enumerated from time to time by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company
**;** provided, however, that the foregoing is not intended to preclude
Employee from (i) owning and managing personal investments, including real
estate investments, subject to the restrictions set forth in Paragraph 13
hereof and managing, developing or otherwise dealing with any of the assets
owned directly or indirectly by Roseland Partners, L.L.C. or Employee or his

L.L.C., Mack-Cali Realty Acquisition LLC, MCRLP and Mack-Cali Realty
Corporation **** or (ii) engaging in charitable activities and community
affairs, provided that the performance of the activities referred to in
clauses (i) and (ii) does not prevent Employee from devoting substantially all
of his business time to the Company.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **_Place of Employment_. During the Employment Period, Employees
place of employment shall be at the principal office of the Company which
shall be located either in Short Hills, New Jersey or at Port Imperial located

4. Compensation and Benefits.

 



 

(a) _Salary_. During the Employment Period, the Company shall pay Employee a
minimum annual base salary in the amount of $400,000 (the "Annual Base
Salary") payable in accordance with the Companys regular payroll practices.
Employees Annual Base Salary shall be reviewed annually in accordance with
the policy of the Company from time to time and may be subject to upward
adjustment based upon, among other things, Employees performance, as
determined in the sole discretion of the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company. In no event shall Employees Annual Base Salary in effect at a
particular time be reduced without his prior written consent.

 



 

(b) _Incentive Compensation/Bonuses_. In addition, during the Employment
Period, Employee shall be eligible for incentive compensation payable in such
amounts as may be determined by the Company, in the exercise of its
discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee shall have a threshold
bonus opportunity of up to $1 million with respect to the first twelve months
of the Employment Period, up to $1.5 million with respect to the second twelve

third twelve months of the Employment Period (the "Target Bonuses"). Each such
twelve-month period is referred to in this Agreement as a Year. For purposes
of these Target Bonuses, fifty percent (50%) of the Target Bonuses shall be
based on the achievement of specified operating objectives as described on
Exhibit A hereto, and the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the Target Bonuses
shall be determined by the Chief Executive Officer **** of the Company, in his
sole discretion. The amount of the Target Bonus for each Year will be awarded
and determined no later than 30 days after the end of each such Year and will
be communicated to the Employee within such 30 day period in a notice from the
Chief Executive Officer **** of the Company. The Target Bonuses awarded
("Awarded Target Bonuses") to Employee for each Year shall be payable to the
Employee within 30 days after the third anniversary (the "Third Anniversary")
of the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that if Employees
employment with the Company is terminated prior to the Third Anniversary by
the Company for Cause or by reason of the resignation of the Employee for
other than Good Reason, then none of the Awarded Target Bonuses shall be
payable to Employee. If Employees employment is terminated for any other
reason prior to the Third Anniversary, then any Awarded Target Bonuses for any
of the applicable Years preceding the Year in which such termination occurs
shall be deemed earned and shall be paid as provided below in this Agreement
**.**

withhold from all compensation all social security and other federal, state
and local taxes and charges which currently are or which hereafter may be

(iii) reimbursement for reasonable business expenses incurred by Employee in
furtherance of the interests of the Company.

Company to comply with Paragraph 4 hereof; (C) on or within six (6) months
following the date a Notice of Non-Renewal is issued by the Company pursuant

Stock") **** or any class of stock convertible into Common Stock and/or (II)
Common OP Units of MCRLP ("Common OP Units") **** or preferred units or any
other class of units convertible into Common OP Units, in an amount equal to
twenty (20%) percent or more of the sum total of the Common Stock and the

(b) Notice of Termination. Any termination of Employees employment by the
Company or any such termination by Employee (other than on account of death)
shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination to the other party
hereto. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a
notice which shall indicate the specific termination provision in this
Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of Employees
employment under the provision so indicated. In the event of the termination
of Employees employment on account of death, written Notice of Termination
shall be deemed to have been provided on the date of death.

 



      
 

 



 

6. Compensation Upon Termination of Employment By the Company for Cause or By Employee without Good Reason.

 



 

In the event the Company terminates Employees employment for Cause or
Employee terminates his employment without Good Reason, the Company shall pay
Employee any unpaid Annual Base Salary at the rate then in effect accrued
through and including the date of termination. In addition, in such event,
Employee shall be entitled (i) to receive any earned but unpaid incentive
compensation or Awarded Target Bonuses (provided that Employee shall not be
entitled to any Awarded Target Bonuses if his employment is terminated prior
to the Third Anniversery by the Company for Cause or by reason of his
resignation for other than Good Reason) and (ii) in the event any options have
been granted Employee **,** to exercise any options which have vested and are
exercisable in accordance with the terms of the applicable option grant
agreement or plan.

 



 

Except for any rights which Employee may have to unpaid salary amounts through
and including the date of termination, earned but unpaid incentive
compensation or Awarded **** Target Bonuses (except to the extent he shall not
be entitled to Awarded Target Bonuses as herein provided), the Company shall
have no further obligations hereunder following such termination. The
aforesaid amounts shall be payable in full immediately upon such termination.

 



 

7. Compensation Upon Termination of Employment Upon Death or Disability.

 



 

In the event of termination of Employees employment as a result of either
Employees death or Disability, the Company shall pay to Employee, his estate
or his personal representative the aggregate of (i) a cash payment of one
million dollars ($1,000,000) in full immediately upon such termination (the
"Fixed Amount") and (ii) reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to date of
termination ("Expense Reimbursement"). Employee (and Employees dependents)
shall also receive continuation of health coverage through the end of the
Unexpired Employment Period on the same basis as health coverage is provided
by the Company or MCRC **** for active employees and as may be amended from
time to time ("Medical Continuation"), and any reimbursements under such plan
will be made no later than the last day of the year after the year in which
the expense was incurred.

 



 

In addition, if granted to Employee, all (A) incentive compensation payments
or programs of any nature whether stock based or otherwise that are subject to
a vesting schedule including, without limitation, Warrants, Restricted Share
Awards or any other restricted stock, phantom stock, units and any loan
forgiveness arrangements granted to Employee ("Incentive Compensation") shall
immediately vest as of the date of such termination ("Vested Incentive
Compensation") and, (B) options granted to Employee, if any, shall immediately
vest as of the date of such termination (the "Vested Options") and Employee
shall be entitled at the option of Employee, his estate or his personal
representative, within one (1) year of the date of such termination, to
exercise the Vested Options and/or other options which have vested (including,
without limitation, all other options which have previously vested in
accordance with any applicable option grant agreement or plan) (the "Total
Vested Options") and are exercisable in accordance with the terms of the
applicable option grant agreement or plan and/or any other methods or
procedures for exercise applicable to optionees or to require the Company
(upon written notice delivered within one hundred eighty (180) days following
the date of Employees

 



      
 

 



 

termination) to repurchase all or any portion of Employees vested options to
purchase shares of Common Stock at a price equal to the difference between the
Repurchase Fair Market Value (as hereinafter defined) of the shares of Common
Stock for which the options to be repurchased are exercisable and the exercise
price of such options as of the date of Employees termination of employment
(the "Vested Option Exercise Election"). In the event of a conflict between
any Incentive Compensation grant agreement or program or any option grant
agreement or plan and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall
control **.** In addition, upon Employees death or disability, the Company
shall pay to Employees estate or to Employee, as the case may be, within 30
days after such death or disability all Awarded Target Bonuses.

 



 

Except for any rights which Employee or Employees estate in the event of
Employees death may have to all of the above including the Fixed Amount,
Vested Incentive Compensation, Total Vested Options and the Vested Option
Exercise Election, Awarded Target Bonuses, **** Expense Reimbursement and
Medical Continuation (which, in the event of Employees death, shall be
provided to Employees dependents), the Company shall have no further
obligations hereunder following such termination.

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Repurchase Fair Market Value" shall mean the
average of the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange (or such other
exchange on which the Common Stock is primarily traded) of the Common Stock on
each of the trading days within the thirty (30) days immediately preceding the
date of termination of Employees employment.

 



 

8. Compensation Upon Termination of Employment By the Company Without Cause or By Employee for Good Reason.

 



 

In the event the Company terminates Employees employment for any reason other
than Cause or Employee terminates his employment for Good Reason, the Company
shall pay to Employee and Employee shall be entitled to receive the aggregate
of (i) the Fixed Amount **** plus an amount (the "Remaining Salary") equal to
the Annual Base Salary for the balance of the Employment Term, which shall be
payable in a lump sum within 10 days after any such termination of employment
**** and (ii) Vested Incentive Compensation, Total Vested Options and the
Vested Option Exercise Election, Expense Reimbursement and Medical
Continuation at such time as provided in subparagraph 4(d) and Paragraph 7
above and any Awarded Target Bonuses within 10 days after any such termination
of employment. In the event of a conflict between any Incentive Compensation
grant agreement or program or any option grant agreement or plan and this
Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control. Employee understands
that any options exercised more than ninety (90) days following the date of
his termination of employment which were granted as incentive stock options
shall automatically be converted into non-qualified options.

 



 

Except for any rights which Employee may have to the Fixed Amount, Remaining
Salary Vested Incentive Compensation, Total Vested Options and the Vested
Option Exercise Election, Awarded Target Bonuses, Expense Reimbursement and
Medical Continuation, the Company shall have no further obligations hereunder
following such termination. The parties both agree that the agreement to make
these payments was consideration and an inducement to obtain Employees
consent to enter into this Agreement. The payments are not a penalty and
neither

 



      
 

 



 

party will claim them to be a penalty. Rather, the payments represent a fair
approximation of reasonable amounts due to Employee for the Employment Period.

 



 

9. Change in Control.

 



 

(a) Options. Any Incentive Compensation and options granted to Employee that
have not vested as of the date of a Change in Control shall immediately vest
upon the date of the Change in Control. Neither the occurrence of a Change in
Control, nor the vesting in any warrants or options as a result thereof shall
require Employee to exercise any warrants or options. In the event of a
conflict between any Incentive Compensation grant agreement or program or any
option grant agreement or plan and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement
shall control.

 



 

(b) Upon Termination. In the event Employee terminates his employment on or
following a Change in Control as set forth in sub-paragraph 5(a)(vii), the
Company shall pay to Employee and Employee shall be entitled to all the
payments and rights Employee would have had if Employee had terminated his
employment for Good Reason as set forth in Paragraph 8.

 



 

Except for any rights which Employee may have to the Fixed Amount, ****
Remaining Salary, Vested Incentive Compensation, Total Vested Options
(including, without limitation, by acceleration in accordance with sub-
paragraph 9(a)) and the Vested Option Exercise Election, Awarded Target
Bonuses, Expense Reimbursement and Medical Continuation, the Company shall
have no further obligations hereunder following such termination.

 



 

10. Mitigation / Effect on Employee Benefit Plans and Programs.

 



 

(a) Mitigation. Employee shall not be required to mitigate amounts payable
under this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, and there shall
be no offset against amounts due Employee under this Agreement on account of
subsequent employment. Amounts owed to Employee under this Agreement shall not
be offset by any claims the Company may have against Employee and such payment
shall not be affected by any other circumstances, including, without
limitation, any counterclaim, recoupment, defense, or other right which the
Company may have against Employee or others.

 



 

(b) Effect on Employee Benefit Programs. The termination of Employees
employment hereunder, whether by the Company or Employee, shall have no effect
on the rights and obligations of the parties hereto under the Companys or
MCRCs (i) welfare benefit plans including, without limitation, Medical
Continuation as provided for herein and, health coverage thereafter but only
to the extent required by law, and on the same basis applicable to other
employees and (ii) 401(k) Plan but only to the extent required by law and
pursuant to the terms of the 401(k) Plan.

 



 

11. Confidential Information.

 



 

(a) Employee understands and acknowledges that during his employment with the
Company, he will be exposed to Confidential Information (as defined below),
all of which is proprietary and which will rightfully belong to the Company.
Employee shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company
such Confidential Information obtained by Employee

 



      
 

 



 

during his employment with the Company and shall not, directly or indirectly,
at any time, either during or after his employment with the Company, without
the Companys prior written consent, use any of such Confidential Information
or disclose any of such Confidential information to any individual or entity
other than the Company or its employees, attorneys, accountants, financial
advisors, consultants, or investment bankers except as required in the
performance of his duties for the Company or as otherwise required by law.
Employee such take all reasonable steps to safeguard such Confidential
Information and to protect such Confidential Information against disclosure,
misuse, loss or theft.

 



 

(b) The term "Confidential Information" shall mean any information not
generally known in the relevant trade or industry or otherwise not generally
available to the public, which was obtained from the Company or its
predecessors or which was learned, discovered, developed, conceived,
originated or prepared during or as a result of the performance of any
services by Employee on behalf of the Company or its predecessors. For
purposes of this Paragraph 11, the Company shall be deemed to include any
entity which is controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Company or MCRC and
any entity of which a majority of the economic interest is owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Company or MCRC.

 



 

12. Return of Documents.

 



 

Except for such items which are of a personal nature to Employee (e.g., daily
business planner), all writings, records, and other documents and things
containing any Confidential Information shall be the exclusive property of the
Company, shall not be copied, summarized, extracted from, or removed from the
premises of the Company, except in pursuit of the business of the Company and
at the direction of the Company, and shall be delivered to the Company,
without retaining any copies, upon the termination of Employees employment or
at any time as requested by the Company.

 



 

13. Noncompete.

 



 

Employee agrees that:

 



 

(a) During the Employment Period and, in the event (i) the Company terminates
Employees employment, for Cause, or (ii) Employee terminates his employment
without Good Reason, for a one (1) year period thereafter, Employee shall not,
directly or indirectly, within the continental United States, engage in, or
own, invest in, manage or control any venture or enterprise primarily engaged
in any office-service, flex, or office property development, acquisition or
management activities without regard to whether or not such activities compete
with the Company. Nothing herein shall prohibit Employee from being a passive
owner of not more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of any class
of securities of a corporation or other entity engaged in such business which
is publicly traded, so long as he has no active participation in the business
of such corporation or other entity. Moreover, the foregoing limitations shall
not be deemed to restrict or otherwise limit Employee from conducting real
estate development, acquisition or management activities, provided that during
the Employment Period the performance of such activities does not prevent
Employee from devoting substantially all of his business time to the Company.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) If, at the time of enforcement of this Paragraph 13, a court shall hold
that the duration, scope, area or other restrictions stated herein are
unreasonable, the parties agree that reasonable maximum duration, scope, area
or other restrictions may be substituted by such court for the stated
duration, scope, area or other restrictions and upon substitution by such
court, this Agreement shall be automatically modified without further action
by the parties hereto.

 



 

(c) For purposes of this Paragraph 13, the Company shall be deemed to include
any entity which is controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Company or MCRC
and any entity of which a majority of the economic interest is owned, directly
or indirectly, by the Company or MCRC.

 



 

(d) It is understood and agreed that Employee has joined in the ****
Membership Interest Agreement for certain limited purposes which contains
different provisions relating to non-competition and related matters, than
those in this Paragraph 13. It is further understood and agreed that the
provisions of that Membership Interest Agreement are cumulative to those
contained herein such that they shall apply if, as, and when those contained
herein do not, and the provisions of this Paragraph 13 shall apply if, as, and
when the provisions of the Membership Interest Agreement do not. In the event
of any inconsistencies between this Agreement and the Membership Interest
Agreement, the provisions of the Membership Interest Agreement shall control.

 



 

14. Remedies

 



 

The parties hereto agree that the Company would suffer irreparable harm from a
breach by Employee of any of the covenants or agreements contained in
Paragraphs 11, 12 or 13 of this Agreement. Therefore, in the event of the
actual or threatened breach by Employee of any of the provisions of Paragraphs
11, 12 or 13 of this Agreement, the Company may, in addition and supplementary
to other rights and remedies existing in its favor, apply to any court of law
or equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive
or other relief in order to enforce or prevent any violation of the provisions
thereof.

 



 

15. Indemnification/Legal Fees.

 



 

(a) _Indemnification_. In the event the Employee is made party or threatened
to be made a party to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (a "Proceeding"), by reason of Employees
employment with or serving as an officer or director of the Company, whether
or not the basis of such Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity,
the Company shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend Employee to the fullest
extent authorized by Delaware law, as the same exists and may hereafter be
amended, against any and all claims, demands, suits, judgments, assessments
and settlements including all expenses incurred or suffered by Employee in
connection therewith (including, without limitation, all legal fees incurred
using counsel reasonably acceptable to Employee) and such indemnification
shall continue as to Employee even after Employee is no longer employed by the
Company and shall inure to the benefit of his heirs, executors, and
administrators. Expenses incurred by Employee in connection with any
Proceeding shall be paid by the Company in advance upon request of Employee
that the Company pay such expenses; but, only in the event that Employee shall
have delivered in writing to the Company an undertaking to reimburse the

 



      
 

 



 

Company for expenses with respect to which Employee is not entitled to
indemnification. The provisions of this Paragraph shall remain in effect after
this Agreement is terminated irrespective of the reasons for termination. The
indemnification provisions of this Paragraph shall not supersede or reduce any
indemnification provided to Employee under any separate agreement, or the by-
laws of the Company since it is intended that this Agreement shall expand and
extend the Employees rights to receive indemnity.

 



 

(b) _Legal Fees_. If any contest or dispute shall arise between the Company
and Employee regarding or as a result of any provision of this Agreement, the
Company shall reimburse Employee for all legal fees and expenses reasonably
incurred by Employee in connection with such contest or dispute, but only if
Employee is successful in respect of substantially all of Employees claims
pursued or defended in connection with such contest or dispute. Such
reimbursement shall be made as soon as practicable following the resolution of
such contest or dispute (whether or not appealed).

 



 

16. Successors and Assigns.

 



 

(a) The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by
purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of
the business and/or assets of the Company, by agreement in form and substance
satisfactory to Employee, to expressly assume and agree to perform this
Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be
required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the
Company to obtain such agreement prior to the effectiveness of an such
succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle Employee to
compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the same terms as he
would be entitled to hereunder if Employee terminated his employment hereunder
within six (6) months of a Change in Control as set forth in Paragraph 9,
except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any
such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the date of termination. In
the event of such a breach of this Agreement, the Notice of Termination shall
specify such date as the date of termination. As used in this Agreement,
"Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to
all or substantially all of its business and/or its assets as aforesaid which
executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this Paragraph 16 or which
otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by
operation of law. Any cash payments owed to Employee pursuant to this
Paragraph 16 shall be paid to Employee in a single sum without discount for
early payment immediately prior to the consummation of the transaction with
such successor.

 



 

(b) This Agreement and all rights of Employee hereunder may be transferred
only by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Upon Employees death,
this Agreement and all rights of Employee hereunder shall inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by Employees beneficiary or beneficiaries, personal or
legal representatives, or estate, to the extent any such person succeeds to
Employees interests under this Agreement. Employee shall be entitled to
select and change a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive any benefit or
compensation payable hereunder following Employees death by giving Company
written notice thereof. If Employee should die following the date of
termination while any amounts would still be payable to him hereunder if he
had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein,
shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to such person or
persons so appointed in

 



      
 

 



 

writing by Employee, including, without limitation, under any applicable plan,
or otherwise to his legal representatives or estate.

 



 

17. Timing of and No Duplication of Payments.

 



 

All payments payable to Employee pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid at
such times as provided in this Agreement, and if specific times are not
provided for any such payments, then such payments will be paid **** as soon
as practicable after such amounts have become fully vested and determinable.
In addition, Employee shall not be entitled to receive duplicate payments
under any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

18. Modification or Waiver.

 



 

No amendment, modification, waiver, termination or cancellation of this
Agreement shall be binding or effective for any purpose unless it is made in a
writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of such amendment,
modification, waiver, termination or cancellation is sought. No course of
dealing between or among the parties to this Agreement shall be deemed to
affect or to modify, amend or discharge any provision or term of this
Agreement. No delay on the part of the Company or Employee in the exercise of
any of their respective rights or remedies shall operate as a waiver thereof,
and no single or partial exercise by the Company or Employee of any such right
or remedy shall preclude other or further exercise thereof. A waiver of right
or remedy on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of
any such right or remedy on any other occasion.

 



 

The respective rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall survive
the Employees termination of employment and termination of this Agreement to
the extent necessary for the intended preservation of such rights and
obligations.

 



 

19. Notices.

 



 

All notices or other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be
made in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered by
hand or delivered by a recognized delivery service or mailed, postage prepaid,
by express, certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and
addressed to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company or Employee, as
applicable, at the address set forth above (or to such other address as shall
have been previously provided in accordance with this Paragraph 19).

 



 

20. Governing Law.

 



 

This agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of New Jersey except as to Paragraph 15(a), without regard to
principles of conflicts of laws thereunder.

 



 

21. Severability.

 



 

Whenever possible, each provision and term of this Agreement shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision or term of this Agreement shall be held to be prohibited
by or invalid under such applicable law, then, subject to

 



      
 

 



 

the provisions of sub-paragraph 13(b) above, such provision or term shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating or affecting in any manner whatsoever the remainder of such
provisions or term or the remaining provisions or terms of this Agreement.

 



 

22. Legal Representation.

 



 

Each of the Company and Employee have been represented by counsel with respect
to this Agreement.

 



 

23. Counterparts.

 



 

This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts, each of which is
deemed to be an original and both of which taken together shall constitute one
and the same agreement.

 



 

24. Headings.

 



 

The headings of the Paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted for convenience
only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part hereof and shall not affect
the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

25. Entire Agreement.

 



 

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements,
negotiations, and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

26. Survival of Agreements.

 



 

The covenants made in Paragraphs 5 through 15 and 21 each shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

 



 

27. Section 409A Requirements.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the following
provisions shall apply to any payments and benefits otherwise payable to or
provided to Employee under this Agreement:

 



 

(a) For purposes of Section 409A, (i) each "payment" (as defined by Section
409A) made under this Agreement shall be considered a "separate payment," and
(ii) payments shall be deemed exempt from the definition of deferred
compensation under Section 409A to the fullest extent possible under the
"short-term deferral" exemption of Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(b)(4), which
exemption is hereby incorporated by reference.

 



 

(b) If Employee is a "specified employee" as determined by the Company
consistent with Section 409A as of his separation from service, to the extent
any payment under this Agreement constitutes deferred compensation subject to
Section 409A, and to the extent required by Section 409A, no payments due
under this Agreement may be made until the earlier

 



      
 

 



 

of: (i) the first day of the seventh month following Employees separation
from service, or (ii) Employees date of death; provided, however, that any
payments delayed during this six- month period shall be paid in a lump sum on
the first day of the seventh month following Employees separation from
service. Such lump sum payments shall include interest from the scheduled
payment date to the date of actual payment at an annual rate equal to the
prime rate as set forth in the Eastern edition of The Wall Street Journal on
the business day immediately preceding Employees date of separation from
service. Any payment due under this Agreement upon termination of employment
that is subject to Section 409A shall only be made upon a "separation from
service" as that term is defined under Section 409A.

 



 

(c) In the event there is a 6-month delay in payments under subparagraph 27(b)
above, the Company shall establish and fund an irrevocable "rabbi" trust, in
form and substance reasonable satisfactory to Employee, effective as of the
beginning of the 6-month period and ending upon the close of such period, to
secure the payment of all such delayed amounts to Employee.

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this Agreement as of the
date first above written.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

 



 

THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is entered into as of

RECITALS

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company desires to employ Employee as Co-President of the Company
and Employee desires to be employed by the Company as Co-President of the
Company, pursuant to the terms set forth herein.

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company is a subsidiary of Mack-Cali Realty, L.P., a Delaware
limited partnership ("MCRLP").

 



 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and
agreements set forth herein, the parties hereby agree as follows:

 



 

1. Employment.

 



 

The Company hereby agrees to employ Employee, and Employee hereby agrees to
accept such employment during the period and upon the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

 



 

2. Employment Period.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement to the contrary, the terms
and conditions of this Agreement shall be and remain in effect during the
period of employment (the "Employment Period") established under this
Paragraph 2. The Initial Employment Period shall be for a term commencing on
the date of this Agreement and ending on the third (3rd) anniversary of the
date of this Agreement provided, however, that this Agreement shall
automatically renew for a term of one (1) year on the third (3rd) anniversary
of the date of this Agreement and on each anniversary of the date of this
Agreement thereafter so that a constant one (1) year Employment Period shall
be in effect, unless (i) the Company or Employee elects not to extend the term
of this Agreement by giving written notice to the other party in accordance
with Paragraph 19, in which case the term of this Agreement shall become
fixed, or (ii) Employees employment terminates hereunder. Any extension of
this Agreement shall not create an obligation of the Company to issue awards
to Employee hereunder.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary: (i) Employees
employment with the Company may be terminated by the Company or Employee
during the Employment Period, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement; and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall mandate or prohibit a
continuation of Employees employment following

      
 

 



 

the expiration of the Employment Period upon such terms and conditions as the
Company and Employee may mutually agree.

 



 

(c) If Employees employment with the Company is terminated, for purposes of
this Agreement the term "Unexpired Employment Period" shall mean the period
commencing on the date of such termination and ending on the last day of the
Employment Period.

 



 

3. Services.

 



 

(a) _Services_. During the Employment Period, Employee shall **** hold the
position of Co-President of the Company reporting to the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company and devote his best efforts and substantially all of
his business time, skill and attention to the business of the Company (other
than absences due to vacation, illness, disability or approved leave of
absence), and shall perform such duties as are customarily performed by a
similar executive holding such position and as may be more specifically
enumerated from time to time by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company
**;** provided, however, that the foregoing is not intended to preclude
Employee from (i) owning and managing personal investments, including real
estate investments, subject to the restrictions set forth in Paragraph 13
hereof and managing, developing or otherwise dealing with any of the assets
owned directly or indirectly by Roseland Partners, L.L.C. or Employee or his
family which are listed in Section 3.26 of the Disclosure Schedules to the
Membership Interest and Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of
, 2012 (the "Membership Interest Agreement") by and among Roseland Partners
L.L.C., Mack-Cali Realty Acquisition LLC, MCRLP and Mack-Cali Realty
Corporation **** or (ii) engaging in charitable activities and community
affairs, provided that the performance of the activities referred to in
clauses (i) and (ii) does not prevent Employee from devoting substantially all
of his business time to the Company.

 

 ** **

 

 **(b)** ** **_Place of Employment_. During the Employment Period, Employees
place of employment shall be at the principal office of the Company which
shall be located either in Short Hills, New Jersey or at Port Imperial located
in West New York and Weehawken, New Jersey.

 



 

4. Compensation and Benefits.

 



 

(a) _Salary_. During the Employment Period, the Company shall pay Employee a
minimum annual base salary in the amount of $400,000 (the "Annual Base
Salary") payable in accordance with the Companys regular payroll practices.
Employees Annual Base Salary shall be reviewed annually in accordance with
the policy of the Company from time to time and may be subject to upward
adjustment based upon, among other things, Employees performance, as
determined in the sole discretion of the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company. In no event shall Employees Annual Base Salary in effect at a
particular time be reduced without his prior written consent.

 



 

(b) _Incentive Compensation/Bonuses_. In addition, during the Employment
Period, Employee shall be eligible for incentive compensation payable in such
amounts as may be determined by the Company, in the exercise of its
discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee shall have a threshold
bonus opportunity of up to $1 million with respect to the first twelve months
of the Employment Period, up to $1.5 million with respect to the second twelve

 



      
 

 



 

months of the Employment Period, and up to $2 million with respect to the
third twelve months of the Employment Period (the "Target Bonuses"). Each such
twelve-month period is referred to in this Agreement as a Year. For purposes
of these Target Bonuses, fifty percent (50%) of the Target Bonuses shall be
based on the achievement of specified operating objectives as described on
Exhibit A hereto, and the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the Target Bonuses
shall be determined by the Chief Executive Officer **** of the Company, in his
sole discretion. The amount of the Target Bonus for each Year will be awarded
and determined no later than 30 days after the end of each such Year and will
be communicated to the Employee within such 30 day period in a notice from the
Chief Executive Officer **** of the Company. The Target Bonuses awarded
("Awarded Target Bonuses") to Employee for each Year shall be payable to the
Employee within 30 days after the third anniversary (the "Third Anniversary")
of the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that if Employees
employment with the Company is terminated prior to the Third Anniversary by
the Company for Cause or by reason of the resignation of the Employee for
other than Good Reason, then none of the Awarded Target Bonuses shall be
payable to Employee. If Employees employment is terminated for any other
reason prior to the Third Anniversary, then any Awarded Target Bonuses for any
of the applicable Years preceding the Year in which such termination occurs
shall be deemed earned and shall be paid as provided below in this Agreement
**.**

 



 

(c) Taxes and Withholding. The Company shall have the right to deduct and
withhold from all compensation all social security and other federal, state
and local taxes and charges which currently are or which hereafter may be
required by law to be so deducted and withheld.

other benefits provided pursuant to this Paragraph 4, Employee shall be
entitled to the following benefits:

Retirement Plan (subject to statutory rules and maximum contributions and non-
discrimination requirements applicable to 401(k) plans) and such other benefit
plans and programs, including but not limited to restricted stock, phantom
stock and/or unit awards, loan programs and any other incentive compensation
plans or programs (whether or not employee benefit plans or programs), as
maintained by the Company or Mack-Cali Realty Corporation ("MCRC") from time
to time and made generally available to employees of the Company or MCRC with
such participation to be consistent with reasonable Company or MCRC guidelines
as the case may be;

 



 

(ii) participation in any health insurance, disability insurance, paid
vacation, group life insurance or other welfare benefit program made generally
available to employees of the Company (which shall be comparable to the plans
and benefits provided to employees of MCRC); and

 



 

(iii) reimbursement for reasonable business expenses incurred by Employee in
furtherance of the interests of the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

5. Termination of Employment and Change In Control.

for Cause upon Employees: (A) willful and continued failure to use best
efforts to substantially perform his duties hereunder (other than any such

performance is delivered by the Company specifically identifying the manner in
which the Company believes Employee has not substantially performed his
duties; (B) willful misconduct and/or willful violation of Paragraph 11
hereof, which is materially economically injurious to the Company and MCRC
taken as a whole; (C) the willful violation of the provisions of Paragraph 13
hereof; or (D) conviction of, or plea of guilty to a felony. For purposes of
this sub-paragraph 5(a), no act, or failure to act, on Employees part shall
be considered "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by him (I) not in
good faith and (II) without reasonable belief that his action or omission was
in furtherance of the interests of the Company.

 



 

(ii) Death. Employees employment hereunder shall terminate upon his death.

 



 

(iii) Disability. The Company shall have the right to terminate Employees
employment due to "Disability" in the event that there is a determination by

acceptable to Employee, that Employee has become physically or mentally
incapable of performing his duties under this Agreement and such disability
has disabled Employee for a cumulative period of one hundred eighty (180) days
within a twelve (12) month period.

 



 

(iv) Good Reason. Employee shall have the right to terminate his employment
for "Good Reason": (A) upon the occurrence of any material breach of this
Agreement by the Company which shall include but not be limited to; an
assignment to Employee of duties materially and adversely inconsistent with

nature of or diminution in Employees duties and/or responsibilities,
reporting obligations, titles or authority; (B) upon a reduction in Employees
Annual Base Salary or a material reduction in other benefits (except for
bonuses or similar discretionary payments) as in effect at the time in
question, a failure to pay such amounts when due or any other failure by the
Company to comply with Paragraph 4 hereof; (C) on or within six (6) months
following the date a Notice of Non-Renewal is issued by the Company pursuant
to Paragraph 2 hereof; (D) on or within six (6) months following a Change in
Control (as hereinafter defined) in accordance with the provisions set forth

the event of such failure to comply, no such purported termination shall be
effective); (F) upon the relocation of the Companys principal executive
offices or Employees own office location to a location other than Short
Hills, New Jersey or Port Imperial located in West New York and Weehawken, New
Jersey.

persons, as such terms are used in Sections 13 and 14 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), other than any employee
benefit plan sponsored by the Company **** or MCRC, becomes the "beneficial
owner", as such term is used in Section 13 of the Exchange Act, (irrespective
of any vesting or waiting periods) of (I) Common Stock of MCRC **** ("Common
Stock") **** or any class of stock convertible into Common Stock and/or (II)
Common OP Units of MCRLP ("Common OP Units") **** or preferred units or any
other class of units convertible into Common OP Units, in an amount equal to
twenty (20%) percent or more of the sum total of the Common Stock and the
Common OP Units (treating all classes of outstanding stock, units or other
securities convertible into stock units as if they were converted into Common
Stock or Common OP Units as the case may be and then treating Common Stock and
Common OP Units as if they were a single class) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to such acquisition as if they were a single class and
disregarding any equity raise in connection with the financing of such
transaction; (B) any Common Stock is purchased pursuant to a tender or
exchange offer other than an offer by MCRC; (C) the dissolution or liquidation
of MCRC, MCRLP or **** the Company or the consummation of any merger or

acquiring company or MCRC **** and MCRLP taken as a whole; or (D) a turnover,
during any two (2) year period, of the majority of the members of the Board
**** of Directors of MCRC **** (the "Board"), without the consent of the
remaining members of the Board as to the appointment of the new Board members.

 



 

(b) Notice of Termination. Any termination of Employees employment by the
Company or any such termination by Employee (other than on account of death)
shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination to the other party
hereto. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a
notice which shall indicate the specific termination provision in this
Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of Employees
employment under the provision so indicated. In the event of the termination
of Employees employment on account of death, written Notice of Termination
shall be deemed to have been provided on the date of death.

 



      
 

 



 

6. Compensation Upon Termination of Employment By the Company for Cause or By Employee without Good Reason.

 



 

In the event the Company terminates Employees employment for Cause or
Employee terminates his employment without Good Reason, the Company shall pay
Employee any unpaid Annual Base Salary at the rate then in effect accrued
through and including the date of termination. In addition, in such event,
Employee shall be entitled (i) to receive any earned but unpaid incentive
compensation or Awarded Target Bonuses (provided that Employee shall not be
entitled to any Awarded Target Bonuses if his employment is terminated prior
to the Third Anniversery by the Company for Cause or by reason of his
resignation for other than Good Reason) and (ii) in the event any options have
been granted Employee **,** to exercise any options which have vested and are
exercisable in accordance with the terms of the applicable option grant
agreement or plan.

 



 

Except for any rights which Employee may have to unpaid salary amounts through
and including the date of termination, earned but unpaid incentive
compensation or Awarded **** Target Bonuses (except to the extent he shall not
be entitled to Awarded Target Bonuses as herein provided), the Company shall
have no further obligations hereunder following such termination. The
aforesaid amounts shall be payable in full immediately upon such termination.

 



 

7. Compensation Upon Termination of Employment Upon Death or Disability.

 



 

In the event of termination of Employees employment as a result of either
Employees death or Disability, the Company shall pay to Employee, his estate
or his personal representative the aggregate of (i) a cash payment of one
million dollars ($1,000,000) in full immediately upon such termination (the
"Fixed Amount") and (ii) reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to date of
termination ("Expense Reimbursement"). Employee (and Employees dependents)
shall also receive continuation of health coverage through the end of the
Unexpired Employment Period on the same basis as health coverage is provided
by the Company or MCRC **** for active employees and as may be amended from
time to time ("Medical Continuation"), and any reimbursements under such plan
will be made no later than the last day of the year after the year in which
the expense was incurred.

 



 

In addition, if granted to Employee, all (A) incentive compensation payments
or programs of any nature whether stock based or otherwise that are subject to
a vesting schedule including, without limitation, Warrants, Restricted Share
Awards or any other restricted stock, phantom stock, units and any loan
forgiveness arrangements granted to Employee ("Incentive Compensation") shall
immediately vest as of the date of such termination ("Vested Incentive
Compensation") and, (B) options granted to Employee, if any, shall immediately
vest as of the date of such termination (the "Vested Options") and Employee
shall be entitled at the option of Employee, his estate or his personal
representative, within one (1) year of the date of such termination, to
exercise the Vested Options and/or other options which have vested (including,
without limitation, all other options which have previously vested in
accordance with any applicable option grant agreement or plan) (the "Total
Vested Options") and are exercisable in accordance with the terms of the
applicable option grant agreement or plan and/or any other methods or
procedures for exercise applicable to optionees or to require the Company
(upon written notice delivered within one hundred eighty (180) days following
the date of Employees

 



      
 

 



 

termination) to repurchase all or any portion of Employees vested options to
purchase shares of Common Stock at a price equal to the difference between the
Repurchase Fair Market Value (as hereinafter defined) of the shares of Common
Stock for which the options to be repurchased are exercisable and the exercise
price of such options as of the date of Employees termination of employment
(the "Vested Option Exercise Election"). In the event of a conflict between
any Incentive Compensation grant agreement or program or any option grant
agreement or plan and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall
control **.** In addition, upon Employees death or disability, the Company
shall pay to Employees estate or to Employee, as the case may be, within 30
days after such death or disability all Awarded Target Bonuses.

 



 

Except for any rights which Employee or Employees estate in the event of
Employees death may have to all of the above including the Fixed Amount,
Vested Incentive Compensation, Total Vested Options and the Vested Option
Exercise Election, Awarded Target Bonuses, **** Expense Reimbursement and
Medical Continuation (which, in the event of Employees death, shall be
provided to Employees dependents), the Company shall have no further
obligations hereunder following such termination.

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Repurchase Fair Market Value" shall mean the
average of the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange (or such other
exchange on which the Common Stock is primarily traded) of the Common Stock on
each of the trading days within the thirty (30) days immediately preceding the
date of termination of Employees employment.

 



 

8. Compensation Upon Termination of Employment By the Company Without Cause or By Employee for Good Reason.

 



 

In the event the Company terminates Employees employment for any reason other
than Cause or Employee terminates his employment for Good Reason, the Company
shall pay to Employee and Employee shall be entitled to receive the aggregate
of (i) the Fixed Amount **** plus an amount (the "Remaining Salary") equal to
the Annual Base Salary for the balance of the Employment Term, which shall be
payable in a lump sum within 10 days after any such termination of employment
**** and (ii) Vested Incentive Compensation, Total Vested Options and the
Vested Option Exercise Election, Expense Reimbursement and Medical
Continuation at such time as provided in subparagraph 4(d) and Paragraph 7
above and any Awarded Target Bonuses within 10 days after any such termination
of employment. In the event of a conflict between any Incentive Compensation
grant agreement or program or any option grant agreement or plan and this
Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control. Employee understands
that any options exercised more than ninety (90) days following the date of
his termination of employment which were granted as incentive stock options
shall automatically be converted into non-qualified options.

 



 

Except for any rights which Employee may have to the Fixed Amount, Remaining
Salary Vested Incentive Compensation, Total Vested Options and the Vested
Option Exercise Election, Awarded Target Bonuses, Expense Reimbursement and
Medical Continuation, the Company shall have no further obligations hereunder
following such termination. The parties both agree that the agreement to make
these payments was consideration and an inducement to obtain Employees
consent to enter into this Agreement. The payments are not a penalty and
neither

 



      
 

 



 

party will claim them to be a penalty. Rather, the payments represent a fair
approximation of reasonable amounts due to Employee for the Employment Period.

 



 

9. Change in Control.

 



 

(a) Options. Any Incentive Compensation and options granted to Employee that
have not vested as of the date of a Change in Control shall immediately vest
upon the date of the Change in Control. Neither the occurrence of a Change in
Control, nor the vesting in any warrants or options as a result thereof shall
require Employee to exercise any warrants or options. In the event of a
conflict between any Incentive Compensation grant agreement or program or any
option grant agreement or plan and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement
shall control.

 



 

(b) Upon Termination. In the event Employee terminates his employment on or
following a Change in Control as set forth in sub-paragraph 5(a)(vii), the
Company shall pay to Employee and Employee shall be entitled to all the
payments and rights Employee would have had if Employee had terminated his
employment for Good Reason as set forth in Paragraph 8.

 



 

Except for any rights which Employee may have to the Fixed Amount, ****
Remaining Salary Vested Incentive Compensation, Total Vested Options
(including, without limitation, by acceleration in accordance with sub-
paragraph 9(a)) and the Vested Option Exercise Election, Awarded Target
Bonuses, Expense Reimbursement and Medical Continuation, the Company shall
have no further obligations hereunder following such termination.

 



 

10. Mitigation / Effect on Employee Benefit Plans and Programs.

 



 

(a) Mitigation. Employee shall not be required to mitigate amounts payable
under this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, and there shall
be no offset against amounts due Employee under this Agreement on account of
subsequent employment. Amounts owed to Employee under this Agreement shall not
be offset by any claims the Company may have against Employee and such payment
shall not be affected by any other circumstances, including, without
limitation, any counterclaim, recoupment, defense, or other right which the
Company may have against Employee or others.

 



 

(b) Effect on Employee Benefit Programs. The termination of Employees
employment hereunder, whether by the Company or Employee, shall have no effect
on the rights and obligations of the parties hereto under the Companys or
MCRCs (i) welfare benefit plans including, without limitation, Medical
Continuation as provided for herein and, health coverage thereafter but only
to the extent required by law, and on the same basis applicable to other
employees and (ii) 401(k) Plan but only to the extent required by law and
pursuant to the terms of the 401(k) Plan.

 



 

11. Confidential Information.

 



 

(a) Employee understands and acknowledges that during his employment with the
Company, he will be exposed to Confidential Information (as defined below),
all of which is proprietary and which will rightfully belong to the Company.
Employee shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company
such Confidential Information obtained by Employee

 



      
 

 



 

during his employment with the Company and shall not, directly or indirectly,
at any time, either during or after his employment with the Company, without
the Companys prior written consent, use any of such Confidential Information
or disclose any of such Confidential information to any individual or entity
other than the Company or its employees, attorneys, accountants, financial
advisors, consultants, or investment bankers except as required in the
performance of his duties for the Company or as otherwise required by law.
Employee such take all reasonable steps to safeguard such Confidential
Information and to protect such Confidential Information against disclosure,
misuse, loss or theft.

 



 

(b) The term "Confidential Information" shall mean any information not
generally known in the relevant trade or industry or otherwise not generally
available to the public, which was obtained from the Company or its
predecessors or which was learned, discovered, developed, conceived,
originated or prepared during or as a result of the performance of any
services by Employee on behalf of the Company or its predecessors. For
purposes of this Paragraph 11, the Company shall be deemed to include any
entity which is controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Company or MCRC and
any entity of which a majority of the economic interest is owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Company or MCRC.

 



 

12. Return of Documents.

 



 

Except for such items which are of a personal nature to Employee (e.g., daily
business planner), all writings, records, and other documents and things
containing any Confidential Information shall be the exclusive property of the
Company, shall not be copied, summarized, extracted from, or removed from the
premises of the Company, except in pursuit of the business of the Company and
at the direction of the Company, and shall be delivered to the Company,
without retaining any copies, upon the termination of Employees employment or
at any time as requested by the Company.

 



 

13. Noncompete.

 



 

Employee agrees that:

 



 

(a) During the Employment Period and, in the event (i) the Company terminates
Employees employment, for Cause, or (ii) Employee terminates his employment
without Good Reason, for a one (1) year period thereafter, Employee shall not,
directly or indirectly, within the continental United States, engage in, or
own, invest in, manage or control any venture or enterprise primarily engaged
in any office-service, flex, or office property development, acquisition or
management activities without regard to whether or not such activities compete
with the Company. Nothing herein shall prohibit Employee from being a passive
owner of not more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of any class
of securities of a corporation or other entity engaged in such business which
is publicly traded, so long as he has no active participation in the business
of such corporation or other entity. Moreover, the foregoing limitations shall
not be deemed to restrict or otherwise limit Employee from conducting real
estate development, acquisition or management activities, provided that during
the Employment Period the performance of such activities does not prevent
Employee from devoting substantially all of his business time to the Company.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) If, at the time of enforcement of this Paragraph 13, a court shall hold
that the duration, scope, area or other restrictions stated herein are
unreasonable, the parties agree that reasonable maximum duration, scope, area
or other restrictions may be substituted by such court for the stated
duration, scope, area or other restrictions and upon substitution by such
court, this Agreement shall be automatically modified without further action
by the parties hereto.

 



 

(c) For purposes of this Paragraph 13, the Company shall be deemed to include
any entity which is controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Company or MCRC
and any entity of which a majority of the economic interest is owned, directly
or indirectly, by the Company or MCRC.

 



 

(d) It is understood and agreed that Employee has joined in the ****
Membership Interest Agreement for certain limited purposes which contains
different provisions relating to non-competition and related matters, than
those in this Paragraph 13. It is further understood and agreed that the
provisions of that Membership Interest Agreement are cumulative to those
contained herein such that they shall apply if, as, and when those contained
herein do not, and the provisions of this Paragraph 13 shall apply if, as, and
when the provisions of the Membership Interest Agreement do not. In the event
of any inconsistencies between this Agreement and the Membership Interest
Agreement, the provisions of the Membership Interest Agreement shall control.

 



 

14. Remedies

 



 

The parties hereto agree that the Company would suffer irreparable harm from a
breach by Employee of any of the covenants or agreements contained in
Paragraphs 11, 12 or 13 of this Agreement. Therefore, in the event of the
actual or threatened breach by Employee of any of the provisions of Paragraphs
11, 12 or 13 of this Agreement, the Company may, in addition and supplementary
to other rights and remedies existing in its favor, apply to any court of law
or equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive
or other relief in order to enforce or prevent any violation of the provisions
thereof.

 



 

15. Indemnification/Legal Fees.

 



 

(a) _Indemnification_. In the event the Employee is made party or threatened
to be made a party to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (a "Proceeding"), by reason of Employees
employment with or serving as an officer or director of the Company, whether
or not the basis of such Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity,
the Company shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend Employee to the fullest
extent authorized by Delaware law, as the same exists and may hereafter be
amended, against any and all claims, demands, suits, judgments, assessments
and settlements including all expenses incurred or suffered by Employee in
connection therewith (including, without limitation, all legal fees incurred
using counsel reasonably acceptable to Employee) and such indemnification
shall continue as to Employee even after Employee is no longer employed by the
Company and shall inure to the benefit of his heirs, executors, and
administrators. Expenses incurred by Employee in connection with any
Proceeding shall be paid by the Company in advance upon request of Employee
that the Company pay such expenses; but, only in the event that Employee shall
have delivered in writing to the Company an undertaking to reimburse the

 



      
 

 



 

Company for expenses with respect to which Employee is not entitled to
indemnification. The provisions of this Paragraph shall remain in effect after
this Agreement is terminated irrespective of the reasons for termination. The
indemnification provisions of this Paragraph shall not supersede or reduce any
indemnification provided to Employee under any separate agreement, or the by-
laws of the Company since it is intended that this Agreement shall expand and
extend the Employees rights to receive indemnity.

 



 

(b) _Legal Fees_. If any contest or dispute shall arise between the Company
and Employee regarding or as a result of any provision of this Agreement, the
Company shall reimburse Employee for all legal fees and expenses reasonably
incurred by Employee in connection with such contest or dispute, but only if
Employee is successful in respect of substantially all of Employees claims
pursued or defended in connection with such contest or dispute. Such
reimbursement shall be made as soon as practicable following the resolution of
such contest or dispute (whether or not appealed).

 



 

16. Successors and Assigns.

 



 

(a) The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by
purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of
the business and/or assets of the Company, by agreement in form and substance
satisfactory to Employee, to expressly assume and agree to perform this
Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be
required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the
Company to obtain such agreement prior to the effectiveness of an such
succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle Employee to
compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the same terms as he
would be entitled to hereunder if Employee terminated his employment hereunder
within six (6) months of a Change in Control as set forth in Paragraph 9,
except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any
such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the date of termination. In
the event of such a breach of this Agreement, the Notice of Termination shall
specify such date as the date of termination. As used in this Agreement,
"Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to
all or substantially all of its business and/or its assets as aforesaid which
executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this Paragraph 16 or which
otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by
operation of law. Any cash payments owed to Employee pursuant to this
Paragraph 16 shall be paid to Employee in a single sum without discount for
early payment immediately prior to the consummation of the transaction with
such successor.

 



 

(b) This Agreement and all rights of Employee hereunder may be transferred
only by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Upon Employees death,
this Agreement and all rights of Employee hereunder shall inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by Employees beneficiary or beneficiaries, personal or
legal representatives, or estate, to the extent any such person succeeds to
Employees interests under this Agreement. Employee shall be entitled to
select and change a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive any benefit or
compensation payable hereunder following Employees death by giving Company
written notice thereof. If Employee should die following the date of
termination while any amounts would still be payable to him hereunder if he
had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein,
shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to such person or
persons so appointed in

 



      
 

 



 

writing by Employee, including, without limitation, under any applicable plan,
or otherwise to his legal representatives or estate.

 



 

17. Timing of and No Duplication of Payments.

 



 

All payments payable to Employee pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid at
such times as provided in this Agreement, and if specific times are not
provided for any such payments, then such payments will be paid **** as soon
as practicable after such amounts have become fully vested and determinable.
In addition, Employee shall not be entitled to receive duplicate payments
under any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

18. Modification or Waiver.

 



 

No amendment, modification, waiver, termination or cancellation of this
Agreement shall be binding or effective for any purpose unless it is made in a
writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of such amendment,
modification, waiver, termination or cancellation is sought. No course of
dealing between or among the parties to this Agreement shall be deemed to
affect or to modify, amend or discharge any provision or term of this
Agreement. No delay on the part of the Company or Employee in the exercise of
any of their respective rights or remedies shall operate as a waiver thereof,
and no single or partial exercise by the Company or Employee of any such right
or remedy shall preclude other or further exercise thereof. A waiver of right
or remedy on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of
any such right or remedy on any other occasion.

 



 

The respective rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall survive
the Employees termination of employment and termination of this Agreement to
the extent necessary for the intended preservation of such rights and
obligations.

 



 

19. Notices.

 



 

All notices or other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be
made in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered by
hand or delivered by a recognized delivery service or mailed, postage prepaid,
by express, certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and
addressed to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company or Employee, as
applicable, at the address set forth above (or to such other address as shall
have been previously provided in accordance with this Paragraph 19).

 



 

20. Governing Law.

 



 

This agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of New Jersey except as to Paragraph 15(a), without regard to
principles of conflicts of laws thereunder.

 



 

21. Severability.

 



 

Whenever possible, each provision and term of this Agreement shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision or term of this Agreement shall be held to be prohibited
by or invalid under such applicable law, then, subject to

 



      
 

 



 

the provisions of sub-paragraph 13(b) above, such provision or term shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating or affecting in any manner whatsoever the remainder of such
provisions or term or the remaining provisions or terms of this Agreement.

 



 

22. Legal Representation.

 



 

Each of the Company and Employee have been represented by counsel with respect
to this Agreement.

 



 

23. Counterparts.

 



 

This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts, each of which is
deemed to be an original and both of which taken together shall constitute one
and the same agreement.

 



 

24. Headings.

 



 

The headings of the Paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted for convenience
only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part hereof and shall not affect
the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

25. Entire Agreement.

 



 

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements,
negotiations, and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

26. Survival of Agreements.

 



 

The covenants made in Paragraphs 5 through 15 and 21 each shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

 



 

27. Section 409A Requirements.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the following
provisions shall apply to any payments and benefits otherwise payable to or
provided to Employee under this Agreement:

 



 

(a) For purposes of Section 409A, (i) each "payment" (as defined by Section
409A) made under this Agreement shall be considered a "separate payment," and
(ii) payments shall be deemed exempt from the definition of deferred
compensation under Section 409A to the fullest extent possible under the
"short-term deferral" exemption of Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(b)(4), which
exemption is hereby incorporated by reference.

 



 

(b) If Employee is a "specified employee" as determined by the Company
consistent with Section 409A as of his separation from service, to the extent
any payment under this Agreement constitutes deferred compensation subject to
Section 409A, and to the extent required by Section 409A, no payments due
under this Agreement may be made until the earlier

 



      
 

 



 

of: (i) the first day of the seventh month following Employees separation
from service, or (ii) Employees date of death; provided, however, that any
payments delayed during this six- month period shall be paid in a lump sum on
the first day of the seventh month following Employees separation from
service. Such lump sum payments shall include interest from the scheduled
payment date to the date of actual payment at an annual rate equal to the
prime rate as set forth in the Eastern edition of The Wall Street Journal on
the business day immediately preceding Employees date of separation from
service. Any payment due under this Agreement upon termination of employment
that is subject to Section 409A shall only be made upon a "separation from
service" as that term is defined under Section 409A.

 



 

(c) In the event there is a 6-month delay in payments under subparagraph 27(b)
above, the Company shall establish and fund an irrevocable "rabbi" trust, in
form and substance reasonable satisfactory to Employee, effective as of the
beginning of the 6-month period and ending upon the close of such period, to
secure the payment of all such delayed amounts to Employee.

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this Agreement as of the
date first above written.

corporation (" _MCRC_ " and, together with MCRLP, the " _Parents_ "), are
parties to that certain Membership Interest and Asset Purchase Agreement,
dated as of [ ], 2012 (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "); and

 

 ** **

 

 **WHEREAS** , Section 2.02(f) of the Purchase Agreement provides that
Purchaser shall deposit into escrow with Escrow Agent the Tax Escrow (as that
term is defined in the Purchase Agreement);

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , this Escrow Agreement shall govern the terms of the Tax Escrow
and the disbursement of amounts from the Tax Escrow; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall
have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Purchase Agreement.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the foregoing and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

1. _Tax Escrow_. Pursuant to Section 2.02(f) of the Purchase Agreement, at Closing, Purchaser shall withheld from the Closing Cash Payment, and deposit with Escrow Agent, the sum of $ , representing the Tax Escrow, via wire transfer to the account identified on Schedule 1.

Escrow Agent is herein directed and instructed to invest and reinvest the Tax Escrow in direct obligations of the United States of America or in obligations the principal of and the interest on are unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America. Each of the Parties shall promptly provide to Escrow Agent a duly executed Money Market Authorization in the form attached hereto as _Schedule B_. With the execution of this document, the Parties acknowledge receipt of prospectuses and/or disclosure materials associated with the investment vehicles described above, either through means of hardcopy or via access to the website associated with the investment selected by the 

      
 

 



 

Parties. Roseland shall be entitled to the benefit of any interest which
accrues on the Tax Escrow, and shall pay any income tax payable with respect

4. _Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are specifically and expressly set forth herein and no duties shall be implied. The Escrow Agent shall neither be responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of, nor have any requirements to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other agreement, instrument or document between the Parties, in connection herewith, if any, including without limitation, the Purchase Agreement (the " _Underlying Agreement_ "), nor shall the Escrow Agent be required to determine if any Person has complied with any such agreement, nor shall any additional obligations of the Escrow Agent be inferred from the terms of such agreement, even though reference thereto may be made in this Escrow Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms and provisions of this Escrow Agreement, those of the Underlying Agreement, any schedule or exhibit attached to the Escrow Agreement, or any other agreement among the Parties, the terms and conditions of this Escrow Agreement shall control. The Escrow Agent may rely upon and shall not be liable for acting or refraining from acting upon any written notice, document, instruction, request or other instrument furnished to it hereunder, not only as to its due execution, validity and effectiveness, but also as to the truth and accuracy of any information contained therein, which the Escrow Agent reasonably believes to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties, without inquiry and without requiring substantiating evidence of any kind. The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such document, notice, instruction or request. Concurrent with the execution of this Escrow Agreement, the Parties shall deliver to the Escrow Agent authorized signers forms in the form of Annex I to this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any Party, any beneficiary or other Person for refraining from acting upon any instruction setting forth, claiming, containing, objecting to, or related to the transfer or distribution of the Tax Escrow, or any portion thereof, unless such instruction shall have been delivered 

      
 

 



 

to the Escrow Agent in accordance with Section 10 below and the Escrow Agent
has been able to satisfy any applicable security procedures as may be required
hereunder and as set forth in Section 11. The Escrow Agent shall be under no
duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any
such document, notice, instruction or request. Escrow Agent shall not be
responsible or liable in any manner for the performance by any party of their
respective obligations under the Underlying Agreement nor shall Escrow Agent
be responsible or liable in any manner for the failure of any party to honor
any of the provisions of this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no
duty to solicit any payments which may be due it or the Tax Escrow, including,
without limitation, the Escrow Amount nor shall the Escrow Agent have any duty
or obligation to confirm or verify the accuracy or correctness of any amounts
deposited with it hereunder.

 



 

The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted
by it except to the extent that a final, non appealable order or judgment (a "
_Final Order_ ") of a court of competent jurisdiction referred to in Section
12 of this Escrow Agreement (a " _Competent Court_ ") determines that the
Escrow Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct was the primary cause of
any loss to either of the Parties. The Escrow Agents sole responsibility
shall be for the safekeeping and disbursement of the Tax Escrow in accordance
with the terms of this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent may execute any of
its powers and perform any of its duties hereunder directly or through
affiliates, agents or attorneys and may consult with counsel, accountants and
other skilled Persons to be selected and retained by it, including without
limitation in the event of any dispute or question as to the construction of
any of the provisions hereof or of any other agreement or of its duties
hereunder, or relating to any dispute involving any party hereto. The Escrow
Agent shall incur no liability and shall be fully indemnified from any
liability whatsoever for anything done, suffered or omitted by it in
accordance with, or in reasonable reliance upon, the advice or opinion of any
such counsel, accountants or other skilled Persons. Purchaser shall promptly
pay, upon demand, the reasonable fees and expenses of any such counsel. Escrow
Agent shall not be obligated to take any legal action or commence any
proceeding in connection with the Tax Escrow, any account in which the Tax
Escrow is deposited, this Escrow Agreement or the Underlying Agreement, or to
appear in, prosecute or defend any such legal action or proceeding.

 



 

If, at any time, (i) there shall exist any dispute involving any of the
Parties with respect to the holding or disposition of any portion of the Tax
Escrow or any other obligations of Escrow Agent hereunder or shall receive
instructions, claims or demands from any Party which the Escrow Agent
determines, in its sole discretion, conflict with any provision of this Escrow
Agreement, (ii) Escrow Agent is unable to determine, to Escrow Agents sole
satisfaction, the proper disposition of any portion of the Tax Escrow or
Escrow Agents proper actions with respect to its obligations hereunder, or
(iii) the Parties have not within 30 days of the furnishing by Escrow Agent of
a notice of resignation pursuant to Section 5 hereof, appointed a successor
Escrow Agent to act hereunder, then Escrow Agent may, in its sole discretion,
take either or both of the following actions: (1) suspend the performance of
any of its obligations (including without limitation any disbursement
obligation) under this Escrow Agreement until such dispute or uncertainty
shall be resolved to the sole satisfaction of Escrow Agent or until a

      
 

 



 

successor Escrow Agent shall have been appointed (as the case may be); or (2)
petition (by means of an interpleader action or any other appropriate method)
any Competent Court, for instructions with respect to such dispute or
uncertainty, and to the extent required or permitted by law, pay into such
court, for holding and disposition in accordance with the instructions of such
Competent Court, the entire Tax Escrow. Escrow Agent shall have no liability
to any Party or any other individual or entity with respect to any suspension
of performance or disbursement into a Competent Court, specifically including
any liability or claimed liability that may arise, or be alleged to have
arisen, out of or as a result of any delay in the disbursement of funds held
in the Tax Escrow or any delay in or with respect to any other action required
or requested of Escrow Agent. Anything in this Escrow Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for
special, incidental, punitive, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any
kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the
Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and
regardless of the form of action. Escrow Agent may rely on the validity,
accuracy and content of the statements contained any written notice, document,
instruction, or request furnished to it hereunder by Purchaser and Roseland
without further investigation, inquiry or examination.

 



 

5. _Succession_. The Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties or obligations hereunder at any time by giving its written resignation to the Parties. Such resignation shall take effect on the earlier of (a) a successor escrow agent being in place and (b) 30 days after such resignation is given to the Parties. In such event, the Parties may appoint a successor escrow agent by mutual consent. If the Parties fail to appoint a successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of 30 days following receipt of the notice of resignation, the Escrow Agent may petition any Competent Court for the appointment of a successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment shall be binding upon all parties hereto. The successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent an instrument accepting such appointment and the successor escrow agent shall, without further acts, be vested with all the estates, property rights, powers and duties of the predecessor Escrow Agent as if originally named as Escrow Agent herein. The retiring Escrow Agent shall transmit all records pertaining to the Tax Escrow and shall pay the entire Tax Escrow to the successor Escrow Agent, after making copies of such records as the retiring Escrow Agent deems advisable and after payment by Purchaser to the retiring Escrow Agent of all fees and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys fees) payable to or incurred by the retiring Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties and the exercise of its rights hereunder. After any retiring Escrow Agents resignation, the provisions of this Escrow Agreement shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement. Any entity into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any entity to which all or substantially all the escrow business may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement without further act.

 



 

6. _Removal of Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent may be removed at any time by mutual agreement of the Parties by giving not less than 30 days prior written notice to the Escrow Agent. Prior to the expiration of such 30-day period, the Parties 

      
 

 



 

shall designate, by mutual consent, a successor escrow agent. If no successor
escrow agent is appointed within such 30-day period, the Escrow Agent may
deposit all amounts remaining in the Tax Escrow with a Competent Court,
whereupon the Escrow Agent shall be discharged of all duties and obligations
hereunder.

 



 

7. _Compensation and Reimbursement_. Purchaser agrees to (a) pay the Escrow Agent upon execution of this Escrow Agreement and from time to time thereafter reasonable compensation for the services to be rendered hereunder, which unless otherwise agreed in writing shall be as described in Schedule A attached hereto, and (b) pay or reimburse the Escrow Agent upon request for all expenses, disbursements and advances, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, travel expenses, telephone and facsimile transmission costs, postage (including express mail and overnight delivery charges), copying charges and the like incurred or made by it in connection with the preparation, execution, performance, delivery, modification and termination of this Escrow Agreement. The additional provisions and information set forth on Schedule A are hereby incorporated by this reference and form a part of this Escrow Agreement. All such compensation and amounts payable to the Escrow Agent shall be paid by Purchaser. The obligations of Purchaser under this Section 7 shall survive any termination of this Escrow Agreement and the resignation or removal of Escrow Agent.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, the Escrow Agent is expressly _not_ authorized to,
and may _not_ , disburse to itself from the Tax Escrow any amounts, whether
for compensation and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses due and payable
hereunder or for any amount to which Escrow Agent is entitled to seek
indemnification pursuant to Section 8 hereof. Escrow Agent hereby waives and
shall not claim any lien on, right of setoff against or security interest in
the Tax Escrow for the payment of any claim for indemnification, compensation,
expenses or other amounts due hereunder.

 



 

8. _Indemnity_. From and at all times after the date of this Escrow Agreement, Purchaser and Roseland shall, jointly and severally, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify, defend and save harmless the Escrow Agent and its affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers, agents, representatives and employees (the " _Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all actions, claims (whether or not valid), losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of in house or outside counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) of any kind or nature whatsoever incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee, whether direct, indirect or consequential, as a result of, arising out of or in connection with any claim, demand, suit, action or proceeding (including any inquiry or investigation) by any Person, including without limitation any Party to this Escrow Agreement, whether threatened or initiated, asserting a claim for any legal or equitable remedy against any Person under any statute or regulation, including, but not limited to, any federal or state securities laws, or under any common law or equitable cause or otherwise, arising from or in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, performance or failure of performance of this Escrow Agreement or any transactions contemplated herein, whether or not any such Indemnitee is a party to any such action, proceeding, suit or the target of any such inquiry or investigation; _provided,_ that no Indemnitee shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for any liability 

      
 

 



 

determined by a Competent Court pursuant to a Final Order to have resulted
primarily from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.
The Parties hereto acknowledge that the foregoing indemnities shall survive
the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent or the termination of this
Escrow Agreement.

unenforceable any other provision of this Escrow Agreement and each and every

7. _Severability_.

Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added automatically as part of this Bill of Sale a provision as similar in its terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be legal, valid and enforceable.

 ** _FORM OF LIMITED GUARANTY_**

 



 

This Limited Guaranty is made as of , 2012 by
**MACK-CALI REALTY, L.P.** , a Delaware limited partnership (the "
**Guarantor** "), in favor of (" **Employee**
").

 



 

WHEREAS, **ROSELAND MANAGEMENT SERVICES, L.P.** , a Delaware limited
partnership (the " **Employer** "), is desirous of entering into an Employment
Agreement dated of even date herewith (the " **Employment Agreement** ") with
Employee.

 



 

WHEREAS, the Employer is a subsidiary of the Guarantor.

 



 

WHEREAS, the Guarantor will be benefitted if the Employee is employed by the
Employer.

 



 

WHEREAS, the Employee would not have entered into the Employment Agreement but
for the Guarantor entering into this Limited Guaranty.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, as an inducement for the Employee to enter into the Employment
Agreement, the Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:

 



 

1. The Guarantor unconditionally guarantees to the Employee, such Employees beneficiary or beneficiaries, personal or legal representatives or estate, to the extent any such person succeeds to Employees interests under the Employment Agreement (the " **Successors** "), the prompt payment when due of all base salary, incentive compensation and any other amounts owed under the Employment Agreement.

 



 

2. The Guarantor unconditionally guarantees the prompt performance of all of the Employers obligations under the Employment Agreement, whether now existing or arising in the future, of any nature and description whatsoever, at such time or times as required by the terms of the Employment Agreement.

 



 

3. The obligations of the Guarantor under this Limited Guaranty are direct, unconditional and completely independent of the obligations of the Employer. The Employee may exercise any of his rights under this Limited Guaranty, including, without limitation, bringing and prosecuting any action against the Guarantor without the necessity of joining the Employer to the action, or previously proceeding against or exhausting any remedy against the Employer or any other person who might have become liable for the Employers obligations under the Employment Agreement.

 



 

4. The liability of the Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be affected by: (a) the release or discharge of the Employer in any creditors, receivership, bankruptcy or other proceedings, (b) the impairment, limitation or modification of the liability of the Employer or the estate of the Employer in bankruptcy, or of any remedy for the enforcement of Employers said liability under the Employment Agreement, resulting from the operation of any applicable bankruptcy law or other statute or from the decision in any court; (c) the rejection or disaffirmance of the Employment Agreement in any such proceedings; (d) any disability or other defense of the Employer, or (e) the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of

      
 

 



 

Employer. The Guarantor further agrees that the Employer may, without notice
to or the consent of the Guarantor, at any time agree with the Employee to
amend any of the terms of the Employment Agreement, or make any agreement with
the Employee for the release of any other guarantor as a guarantor of any of
the obligations under the Employment Agreement, and this Limited Guaranty will
not be impaired or affected by any of those actions. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, it shall be a complete defense to any claim to enforce this Limited
Guaranty that any amount claimed to be owed, or any obligation claimed to have
not been performed, under the Employment Agreement is not owed or has been
fully paid, or that such claimed obligation has been fully discharged or is
not owed (as the case may be) by the Employer.

 



 

5. No delay on the Employees part in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Limited Guaranty, or any other rights or remedies it may have against the Employer, will operate as a waiver of any such privilege, power, right or remedy.

 



 

6. In the event of any litigation between the parties under this Limited Guaranty, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys fees and court costs at all trial and appellate levels.

 



 

7. In order to induce the Employee to enter into the Employment Agreement with the Employer, and knowing that the Employee shall rely on the within warranty and representation, the Guarantor warrants and represents to Employee that the Guarantor shall be benefitted if the Employee enters into the Employment Agreement with the Employer.

 



 

8. The rights and authority granted to the Employee in this Limited Guaranty shall inure to the benefit of his Successors, and the agreements by the Guarantor contained in this Limited Guaranty shall bind the Guarantor and the Guarantors successors and assigns.

 



 

9. Any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that any provision of this Limited Guaranty is not valid or enforceable as specifically set forth shall not result in such provision being declared invalid, but the same shall be modified, if possible, in such a manner so as to result in it being valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law; if such modification is not possible, then such provision shall be deemed stricken and severed from this Limited Guaranty, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

 



 

10. This Limited Guaranty shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New Jersey, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws thereunder.

 



 

11. This instrument may not be changed, modified, discharged or terminated orally or in any manner other than by an agreement in writing signed by the Guarantor and the Employee.
