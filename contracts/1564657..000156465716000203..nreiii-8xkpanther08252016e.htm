Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act").



(h) Purchaser is a "qualified purchaser" as such term is defined in the

other securities laws or unless an exemption from such registration is
available. Even if such an exemption is

substantial restrictions on transfer.



(l) Purchaser has such knowledge and experience in financial and business

Section 6.1(f), Section 6.1(g), Section 6.1(j), and Section 6.1(k) (the
"Extended Survival Representations") shall survive for a period of two (2)
years from the Closing Date.



6.4. If any of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 6.1 or
Section 6.2 of this Agreement are discovered to be untrue in any material
respect after Closing, and a claim is asserted within the applicable time

claiming party shall have the right to pursue any and all remedies available
against the applicable breaching party, as the case may be, as a result of
such inaccuracy.



6.5 For the purposes of this Agreement, "knowledge" means actual knowledge.



7. Conditions to Closing

of Purchaser contained in Section 6 of this Agreement (i) shall be true and
correct in all material respects or (ii) if such representation or warranty is
already qualified by materiality, shall be true and correct in all respects,

as though such representations and warranties were made at and as of the
Closing Date (subject in each instance to the rights of Seller under Section
6.5).



(b) Performance. Purchaser shall have performed and complied with in all
material respects all agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to
be performed or complied with by Purchaser on or prior to the Closing Date.



(c) Legal Proceedings. No order, judgment, writ, decree, injunction (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent), permit or license (each, an "Order")
restraining, prohibiting or affecting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein shall be in effect, and no action, suit, litigation,
arbitration, claim, proceeding, hearing, petition, grievance, complaint or
investigation (each, an



Page 11 

"Action") by any government, political subdivision, or governmental or
regulatory authority, agency, board, bureau, commission, instrumentality,
court, arbitral tribunal or quasi-governmental authority (in each case,
whether federal, state, municipal or local and whether foreign or domestic)
(each, a "Governmental Authority") shall be pending or threatened which
questions the validity or legality of the transactions contemplated herein or
Seller's ownership of any of the Underlying Interests or performance of any
obligations under the Underlying Partnership Governing Documents.



(d) Certificate. Purchaser shall have furnished Seller with a certificate
dated the Closing Date signed by an authorized signatory of Purchaser to the
effect that the conditions set forth in clauses (a) of this Section 7.1 have

subject to the fulfillment by Seller (or waiver by Purchaser in writing) on or
prior to the Closing Date of each of the following conditions:



(a) Representations and Warranties. Each of the representations and warranties
of Seller contained in this Agreement (i) shall be true and correct in all
material respects or (ii) if such representation or warranty is already
qualified by materiality, shall be true and correct in all respects, in each
case at and as of the date when made and at and as of the Closing Date as
though such representations and warranties were made at and as of such Closing
Date; provided, however, if a general partner or manager of one or more of the
Underlying Partnerships asserts that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will breach the terms of the applicable Underlying Partnership
Governing Documents of such Underlying Partnership and, as a result, the
representation contained in Section 6.1(e)(iii) would not be true and correct,
then such incorrect representation shall not give rise to a claim against
Seller and instead, the provisions of Section 14 shall apply.



(b) Performance. Seller shall have performed in all material respects all

Interests, the Intercompany Notes and the Intercompany Loan Agreements will
not adversely affect compliance with the requirements for Purchaser's parent,
NorthStar Real Estate Income II, Inc., to qualify as a real estate investment
trust ("REIT") for United States federal income tax purposes. Purchaser and
Seller acknowledge that CAM2 is classified as a corporation, and as a TRS of
NRF, for United States federal income tax purposes, and that none of the
Intercompany Notes are treated as qualifying real estate assets for purposes
of the tax rules governing REITs.



(h) On or prior to the Closing, Seller shall update Schedule II to this
Agreement to reflect additional distributions received by the Limited Partner
Entities from the Underlying Partnerships and additional capital contributions
made by the Limited Partner Entities to any of the Underlying Partnerships (it
being agreed that any update to such Schedule II shall not be deemed to result
in a claim that Seller's representations and warranties regarding such
Schedule II were false or incorrect).



8. Indemnification.



(a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 8, from and after Closing,
Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, and its respective
partners, members, shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents,
successors and assigns (collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnitees"), from and
against any and all actual losses, damages, claims, proceedings, liabilities,
costs and expenses (including settlement costs, interest, penalties,
reasonable attorneys' fees and any reasonable legal or other expenses for
investigation or defense of any actions or threatened actions) (collectively,
"Losses" or "Claims," as the context requires) which are imposed, sustained,
incurred or suffered by a Purchaser Indemnitee or asserted against a Purchaser
Indemnitee as a result of, relating to or arising out of, without duplication,
(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Seller
contained in this Agreement, (ii) any failure by Seller to perform any
covenant or agreement contained in the Assignment Agreement, or (iii) any
taxes, fees or other governmental charges applicable to the Membership
Interests that are attributable to the ownership by Seller of the Membership
Interests on or prior to the Closing Date (including such Seller's
proportionate share of any taxes that arise on audit with respect to a year in
which Seller owned an Membership Interest and which are imposed on the
applicable Limited Partnership Entity), but for the avoidance of doubt,
excluding any such taxes arising on the Closing Date or after the Closing)
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Obligations").



(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:



(i) Seller shall not be obligated to provide any indemnification for Losses in
respect of Claims made by Purchaser Indemnitees for indemnification under
Section 8(a)(i) unless the total of all Losses and Claims in respect of such
Claims made by all Purchaser Indemnitees for indemnification from Seller
exceeds a dollar amount equal to $200,000 in the aggregate (the "Threshold"),
whereupon the total amount of such Losses or Claims from the first dollar and
without regard to the Threshold shall be recoverable from Seller in accordance
with the terms hereof; provided, however, the Threshold shall not apply to
Losses or Claims arising with respect to the Extended Survival Representations
(and Losses or Claims with respect to the Extended Survival Representations
may be recoverable from the first dollar and without regard to the Threshold);



(ii) the maximum amount payable by Seller for Losses and Claims in respect of
Claims made by the Purchaser Indemnitees for indemnification with respect to
the breach of any representations or warranties of Seller shall not exceed the
Purchase Price actually paid by the Purchaser to Seller with respect to the
Membership Interests and Intercompany Loan Documents; provided, however, that
the Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be subject to any limitation set forth in
this Section 8(b), and shall



Page 13 

be entitled to dollar-for-dollar recovery from Seller, for Losses and Claims
in connection with (A) actual fraud by Seller under this Agreement or (B) the
breach by such Seller of any of such Seller's Fundamental Representations;



(iii) in no event shall Purchaser be entitled to bring a claim for
indemnification under this Section 8 with respect to an alleged breach of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 6.1(e)(iii) unless (A) the
general partner or manager of an Underlying Partnership has asserted in
writing that the transactions under this Agreement breach the Underlying
Partnership Governing Documents applicable to such Underlying Partnership and
(B) Purchaser and Seller have been unable to obtain the GP Consent (as
hereinafter defined), effectuate an Alternative Structure (as hereinafter
defined) or consummate the Unwind Transaction (as hereinafter defined) (in
which event Purchaser may bring a Claim for indemnification against the Seller
under Section 8(a)(i) to the extent of any Losses suffered by Purchaser
arising from a breach of such representation or warranty (including, without
limitation a Claim for diminution in value of the Membership Interests or
Purchaser's share of the Underlying Interests)).



(c) Subject to the provisions of this Section 8, from and after Closing,
Purchaser shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and Seller's
affiliates, and their respective partners, members, shareholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnitees"), from and against any and all Losses and Claims which may be
imposed, sustained, incurred or suffered by a Seller Indemnitee or asserted
against a Seller Indemnitee as a result of, relating to or arising out of,
without duplication, (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty of such Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in any other
document or instrument executed and delivered by such Purchaser pursuant to
this Agreement, (ii) any failure by such Purchaser to perform any covenant or
agreement contained in the Assignment Agreement or the Loan Assignment
Agreement, or (iii) any taxes, fees or other governmental charges applicable
to the Membership Interests that are attributable to the ownership by such
Purchaser of the Membership Interests from and after the Closing Date.



(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) Purchaser
shall not be obligated to provide any indemnification for Losses in respect of
Claims made by a Seller Indemnitee for indemnification under Section 8(c)(i)
unless the total of all Losses and Claims in respect of such Claims made by
all Seller Indemnitees for indemnification from Purchaser exceeds the
Threshold, whereupon the total amount of such Losses or Claims from the first
dollar and without regard to the Threshold shall be recoverable from the
Purchaser in accordance with the terms hereof, (ii) the maximum amount payable
by Purchaser for Losses and Claims in respect of Claims made by the Seller
Indemnitees for indemnification with respect to the breach of any
representations or warranties hereunder shall not exceed the sum of the
portion of the Purchase Price actually paid by Purchaser to Seller with
respect to the applicable Membership Interests plus the remaining installments
of Deferred Purchase Price Payments with respect to the applicable Membership
Interests as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that the Seller
Indemnitees shall not be subject to any limitation set forth in this Section
8(d), and shall be entitled to dollar-for-dollar recovery from such Purchaser,
for Losses and Claims in connection with (A) actual fraud by such Purchaser
under this Agreement or (B) the breach by such Purchaser of any of such
Purchaser's Fundamental Representations.



(e) Each party hereto that may request indemnification under this Agreement
agrees to give the party from which it may request indemnification prompt
written notice of any event, or any written Claim by a third party, of which
it obtains knowledge, which could give rise to any Loss as to which it may
request indemnification under this Agreement, but the failure to give such
prompt written notice shall not affect such party's rights hereunder except to
the extent the other party was materially and adversely prejudiced thereby. In
connection with any such third-party Claim, if the indemnifying party shall
have acknowledged in writing its obligation to indemnify in respect of such
Claim, the indemnifying party may select counsel to direct the defense of such
Claim, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the



Page 14 

indemnified party, and the indemnified party, at the expense of the
indemnifying party, shall cooperate with the indemnifying party in determining
the validity of any such Claim and in the defense thereof. The indemnified
party may, at its expense, participate in the defense of such third-party
Claim. The indemnified party shall have the right to employ one counsel to
represent the indemnified party if, in the reasonable judgment of the
indemnified party and upon the advice of counsel, a conflict of interest
exists between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party with respect
to such third-party Claim, and in such event the reasonable documented fees
and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the indemnifying party;
provided, however, that such counsel shall represent the indemnified party
only with respect to such matters as to which, in the reasonable judgment of
the indemnified party and upon the advice of counsel, such conflict of
interest exists. The indemnifying party shall not settle any such Claim
without the consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) if any relief, other than the payment of
money damages, would be granted by such settlement or if such settlement does
not include the unconditional release of the indemnified party. If there is a
reasonable likelihood that a Claim from a third party may materially and
adversely affect an indemnified party, other than as a result of money damages
or other money payments for which the indemnified party is entitled to
indemnification hereunder, the indemnified party will have the right, after
consultation with the indemnifying party and at the cost and expense of the
indemnifying party, to assume the defense of the Claim in lieu of the
indemnifying party with counsel reasonably acceptable to the indemnifying
party. The indemnified party shall not settle any Claim without the consent of
the indemnifying party. Any indemnification payment shall be treated for tax
purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.



(f) If the amount of any Claim or Loss shall, at any time subsequent to
payment pursuant to this Section 8 be reduced by actual recovery, settlement
or otherwise, the amount of such reduction, less any expenses incurred in
connection therewith, shall promptly be repaid by the indemnified party to the
related indemnifying party. Upon making any payment in full in respect of any
Claim for indemnification, the indemnifying party shall, to the extent of such
payment, be subrogated to all rights of the indemnified party against any
third party in respect of such Claim.



(g) From and after the Closing, and except with respect to claims of actual
fraud, the provisions of this Section 8 shall constitute the exclusive remedy
in respect of breaches of representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement and in no event shall any person be entitled to special, indirect,
consequential or punitive damages or losses of any kind whatsoever (including
lost profits).



9. Certain Matters Pending Closing. Seller agrees that from the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date:



(a) Seller shall provide Purchaser with prompt notice of (A) any distributions
received by a Limited Partner Entity after the date hereof and prior to the
Closing Date and (B) any rights to take an action with respect to an
Underlying Interest or under an Underlying Partnership Governing Document.
Except as consented to by Purchaser in writing, Seller shall not cause any of

assign, or transfer, deliver or solicit any bids for, or enter into any
discussions with a prospective purchaser of, the Underlying Interests; (2)
amend or modify any of the Underlying Partnership Governing Documents or

Documents; (3) forgive, release, compromise or demand payment of any

Lien on the Underlying Interests, other than (i) the Liens and rights granted
under the Underlying Purchase Agreement, (ii) the Liens arising out of and
pursuant to the Liberty PSA, the Liberty Security Agreement, the SP Liberty
PSA, and the SP Liberty Security Agreement and (iii) any restriction or
limitation pertaining to the sale, assignment, disposition or transfer of any
Underlying Interest



Page 15 

(including any consents or approvals of transfers, rights of first refusal and
similar rights) arising out of or based on the applicable Underlying
Partnership Governing Documents, the SP JV Agreement and the SP Side Letter
Agreement; (5) approve or reject any matter that is submitted to the partners
of an Underlying Partnership for their approval; or (6) agree in writing to do
any of the foregoing.

(b) Seller shall give prompt notice to Purchaser of the receipt by Seller of
(i) any written notice or other written communication from an Underlying
Partnership relating to a default or event which, with notice or lapse of time
or both, would become a default, under any of the Underlying Partnership
Governing Documents, (ii) any written notice or other written communication
(including, without limitation, quarterly reports of any Underlying
Partnership or other financial statements or similar information) from or on
behalf of such Underlying Partnership or any partner of such Underlying
Partnership, and (iii) any written notice received by Seller relating to any
contemplated or pending claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation by
any governmental department, commission, board, agency, instrumentality or
authority involving or relating to such Underlying Partnership.

10. Closing Costs. All third party fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement (and the transactions contemplated hereunder), including all fees of counsel, accountants and/or other advisors, shall be borne by the party incurring the same. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall pay 50% of all fees and expenses (if any) required to be paid to the Underlying Partnerships in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.



11. Non-Liability. 



(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
direct or indirect director, officer, employee, shareholder, member, manager,
partner, joint venturer, or agent of Seller, nor any other person,
partnership, limited liability company, corporation, joint venture or trust,
as principal of Seller, whether disclosed or undisclosed (collectively, the
"Seller Exculpated Parties") shall have any personal obligation or liability
under this Agreement, and Purchaser shall not seek to assert any claim or
enforce any of their respective rights hereunder against any Seller Exculpated
Party.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
direct or indirect director, officer, employee, shareholder, member, manager,
partner, joint venturer, or agent of Purchaser, nor any other person,
partnership, limited liability company, corporation, joint venture or trust,
as principal of Purchaser, whether disclosed or undisclosed (collectively, the
"Purchaser Exculpated Parties") shall have any personal obligation or
liability under this Agreement, and Seller shall not seek to assert any claim
or enforce any of their respective rights hereunder against any Purchaser
Exculpated Party.



(c) The foregoing shall not relieve any party from any liability or obligation
under any document, guaranty, cross-indemnity agreement, or other agreement
being delivered pursuant to this Agreement.



12. Tax Matters.



(a) Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes.





Page 16 

(i) Seller shall cause CAM2, the Limited Partner Entities and each of their
respective subsidiaries which are directly or indirectly controlled by CAM2 to
operate such that each of the tax representations contained in Section 6.1(s)
through (ff) hereof (other than Section 6.1(u), (x) and (z)) is true as of the
Closing Date. During the period from the date of this Agreement until the
Closing Date, none of CAM2, the Limited Partner Entities or any of their
respective subsidiaries which are directly or indirectly controlled by CAM2
shall, without Purchaser\'s consent: (I) make or change any material election
of CAM2, the Limited Partner Entities or any of their respective subsidiaries
which are directly or indirectly controlled by CAM2 with respect to taxes;
(II) settle any proceeding that involves any material taxes of CAM2, the
Limited Partner Entities or any of their respective subsidiaries which are
directly or indirectly controlled by CAM2; or (III) amend any material tax
return of CAM2, the Limited Partner Entities or any of their respective
subsidiaries which are directly or indirectly controlled by CAM2.



(ii) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to
be timely filed all tax returns of CAM2, the Limited Partner Entities and each
of their respective subsidiaries which are directly or indirectly controlled
by CAM2, if applicable, for all taxable periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date that are filed after the Closing Date (such time period, the
"Pre-Closing Tax Period" and the applicable returns the "Pre-Closing Tax
Period Returns"). Seller shall cause such Pre-Closing Tax Period Returns that
are with respect to income tax to be delivered to Purchaser for its review and
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, no later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for such Pre-
Closing Tax Period Return. Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in
connection with the preparation and execution of the Pre-Closing Tax Period
Returns and shall make available to Seller all books and records of CAM2, the
Limited Partner Entities and each of their respective subsidiaries which are
directly or indirectly controlled by CAM2 that are in Purchaser's possession
and are reasonably required in connection with such preparation.



(iii) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause
to be timely filed all tax returns of CAM2, the Limited Partner Entities and
each of their respective subsidiaries which are directly or indirectly
controlled by CAM2, if applicable, for taxable periods that begin before the
Closing Date and end after the Closing Date ("Straddle Period", and such Tax
Returns, "Straddle Period Tax Returns"). Any such tax return shall be prepared
in a manner consistent with past practice unless otherwise required by law.
Purchaser shall cause all Straddle Period Tax Returns to be delivered to
Seller for its review and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, no later than thirty (30) days prior to the
respective due dates for such tax returns. Seller shall reasonably cooperate
with Purchaser in connection with the preparation of the Straddle Period Tax
Returns and shall make available to Purchaser all books and records of CAM2,
the Limited Partner Entities and each of their respective subsidiaries which
are directly or indirectly controlled by CAM2 which are reasonably required in
connection with such preparation.



(iv) Seller shall pay all taxes that may be due after the Closing Date that
are allocable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or to the portion of any Straddle
Period ending on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date. The portion of
such taxes that is attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending
on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be (i) in the case of
taxes that are not based on income or gross receipts, the total amount of such
taxes for the period in question multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the portion of such Straddle Period ending on
the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is
the total number of days in the entire Straddle Period in question, and (ii)
in the case of taxes that are based on income or gross receipts, the portion
of such taxes allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the
day immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of 11:59PM on the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date.





Page 17 

(v) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Pre-Closing Tax
Period Returns and Straddle Period Tax Returns, if applicable, pursuant to
this Section 12.



(b) Transfer Taxes. All transfer, sales, use, documentary, stamp or other
similar taxes, conveyance fees, recording charges or other similar fees and
charges (including interest, penalties and/or additional amounts with respect
thereto) ("Transfer Taxes") shall be borne fifty percent by Seller and fifty
percent by Purchaser. Any tax returns that must be filed in connection with
Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and filed, and such Transfer Taxes shall be
paid, by the party primarily or customarily responsible under applicable local
law for filing such tax returns, and such party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to provide such tax returns to the other parties at least ten (10)
Business Days (as hereinafter defined) prior to the date such tax returns are
filed. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in the timely completion and
filing of all such tax returns. To the extent that a party makes a payment of
a Transfer Tax (or portion thereof) for which the other party should have
paid, such other party will reimburse the party that paid the Transfer Taxes
in the amount of such payment within ten (10) Business Days.



(c) Tax Indemnification.



(i) From and after the Closing Date, subject to the limitations set forth
herein but notwithstanding anything contained in Section 8 to the contrary,
Seller shall indemnify Purchaser, CAM2 the Limited Partner Entities and their
respective subsidiaries which are directly or indirectly controlled by CAM2
(collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnitees") for, from and against, any and all
taxes of CAM2, any Limited Partner Entity or any of their respective
subsidiaries which are directly or indirectly controlled by CAM2, that are
attributable to (A) any Pre-Closing Tax Period or portion of any Straddle
Period ending on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date or (B) any
breach of any tax representation or any covenant by Seller contained in
Sections 6.1(s) through (ff) or Section 12 of this Agreement. For purposes of
this Section 12(c)(i), taxes shall be deemed to include any attorneys fees or
other out-of-pocket costs reasonably incurred by any Purchaser Indemnitees in
connection with the determination of such indemnified tax liability. Any
indemnity payments pursuant to this Section 12(c)(i) shall be treated by the
Purchaser and Seller U.S. federal income tax and other purposes as adjustments
to the Purchase Price.



(ii) Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon receipt by CAM2,
the Limited Partner Entities or any of their respective subsidiaries which are
directly or indirectly controlled by CAM2 of a written notice of any pending
or threatened tax audit, assessment, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period ("Tax Contest"). Purchaser and Seller
shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Tax Contest, which
cooperation shall include the retention and the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Seller shall control all Tax Contests to the extent they pertain to
taxes for which Seller has agreed to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees,
provided, however, that Purchaser shall have the right to participate, at its
own cost in such Tax Contest. Without the prior written consent of Purchaser,
which consent Purchaser can withhold in its sole discretion, Seller shall not
settle any Tax Contest if such settlement would or would reasonably be
expected to increase any tax of any Purchaser Indemnitee for any taxable
period ending on or after the Closing Date.



(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller shall have the
right to control any tax audit, assessment, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to the Internal Revenue Service audit of the 2014 taxable year of
CAM2 (the "2014 Audit"); provided, however, if any settlement of such 2014
Audit would or would reasonably be expected to increase any tax of any
Purchaser Indemnitee



Page 18 

for any taxable period ending on or after the Closing Date, then Purchaser's
consent shall be required for such settlement, which consent Purchaser can
withhold in its sole discretion.



(iv) Seller shall have the right to participate jointly with Purchaser in any
tax audit, assessment, litigation or other proceeding relating to a Straddle
Period and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense. Seller and
Purchaser agree to reasonably cooperate in the defense of any claim in such
proceeding.



(v) Seller shall be entitled to any refunds, including any interest paid
thereon, attributable to all taxes of CAM2, the Limited Partner Entities and
each of their respective subsidiaries which are directly or indirectly
controlled by CAM2 with respect to (A) a Pre-Closing Tax Period and (B) the
portion of a Straddle Period ending on the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date. Purchaser shall be entitled to any refunds, including any
interest paid thereon, attributable to all taxes of CAM2, the Limited Partner
Entities and each of their respective subsidiaries with respect to the portion
of a Straddle Period beginning on the Closing Date. Purchaser will pay Seller
any amounts in respect of any tax refund or interest thereon due to Seller, as
provided in this Section 12(c), within ten (10) business days of receipt of
the tax refund and/or interest or within ten (10) business days after any such
amount is credited to its account, including the account of CAM2, the Limited
Partner Entities or any of their respective subsidiaries after the Closing
Date; provided that payments to Seller under this Section 12(c) shall be net
of (1) any reasonable out-of-pocket costs associated in obtaining such refund
of taxes, and (2) any taxes imposed on Purchaser and/or CAM2, the Limited
Partner Entities or any of their respective subsidiaries which are directly or
indirectly controlled by CAM2 as a result of such refunds. If there is a
subsequent reduction by a governmental authority (or by virtue of a change in
applicable tax law), of any amounts with respect to which a payment has been
made to Seller by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 12(c), then Seller shall
pay Purchaser the amount of such reduction plus any interest or penalties
imposed by a governmental authority with respect thereto.



(vi) Any indemnification payment shall be treated for tax purposes as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price.



(d) Survival. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the provisions of this Section 12 shall survive the Closing.



13. [Intentionally Omitted]



14. Non-Assignable Interests. If, after the Effective Date, a general partner or manager of one or more of the Underlying Partnerships (each, an "Objecting GP") asserts that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will breach the terms of the applicable Underlying Partnership Governing Documents of such Underlying Partnership or, if after the Closing, an Objecting GP asserts that the transactions consummated by this Agreement have breached the terms of the applicable Underlying Partnership Governing Documents of such Underlying Partnership, then the following shall apply:



(a) Seller and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue
and obtain the consent or approval of such Objecting GP to the transactions
under this Agreement or to obtain the withdrawal of the Objecting GP's
objections or agreement of the Objecting GP that such consent or approval is
not required (the "GP Consent"). In connection with the foregoing, Seller and
Purchaser shall execute such reasonable documents and deliver such information
as may be requested by the Objecting GP (including, without limitation,
information regarding Purchaser to provide evidence that Purchaser either held
interests in the applicable Limited Partner Entity prior to the consummation
of the transactions under this Agreement or is an affiliate of an entity that
held interests in the applicable Limited Partner Entity prior to the



Page 19 

consummation of the transactions under this Agreement) and the Seller (as
managing member of the applicable Limited Partner Entity) shall have the right
to execute on behalf of the Limited Partner Entity such documents as may be
reasonably requested by the Objecting GP (including, without limitation, new
subscription documents or packages).



(b) If the GP Consent cannot be obtained, then, if the Closing has not
occurred and to the extent the Seller is not otherwise legally prohibited from
doing so, in connection with the Closing the parties shall reasonably
cooperate to modify the structure of the sale of the applicable Underlying
Interest in a way that provides each of Seller and Purchaser with the same
economic rights and benefits with respect to such Underlying Interest as is
contemplated by this Agreement but that does not require the GP Consent (or to
which the applicable Objecting GP provides its consent) (the "Alternative
Structure").



(c) If an Objecting GP asserts that the Alternative Structure would breach the
terms of the applicable Underlying Partnership Governing Documents of such
Underlying Partnership and refuses to grant its approve to the Alternative
Structure, then the following shall apply (as applicable, each an "Unwind
Transaction"):



(i) If the Closing has not occurred, then the parties shall cooperate so that
(A) the applicable Underlying Interest shall be transferred by CAM2 to an
entity that is owned by Seller (an "Unwind Transferee") (together with the
obligations of the Limited Partner Entity that is the borrower under any
Intercompany Loan with respect to any applicable advances and obligations
under the Intercompany Loan that were made with respect to such Underlying
Interest), (B) upon such transfer, such Underlying Interest and the applicable
portion of any Intercompany Loan shall not be sold or transferred to Purchaser
and shall be deemed removed for all purposes from this Agreement, and (C) the
Purchase Price shall be (1) reduced by the Allocated Purchase Price applicable
to the Underlying Interest (as set forth on Schedule I under the column
heading "Allocated Purchase Price" opposite the name of the applicable
Underlying Partnership in which such Underlying Interest is held (and, in
connection therewith, any reduction to the purchase price that would have
occurred with respect to any Remaining Deferred Purchase Price Payments
applicable to such Underlying Interest in such Underlying Partnership shall
not adjust or reduce the Purchase Price) and (2) the amounts calculated under
Section 2(a) shall be adjusted to reflect the portion of any Intercompany
Loans obligations transferred to an Unwind Transferee (e.g., if loan advances
in the amount of $10,000 were made to a Limited Partner Entity with respect to
an Underlying Interest that was transferred to an Unwind Transferee, then such
$10,000 obligation shall be severed from the applicable Intercompany Note and
a note for such $10,000 obligation shall be transferred to and assumed by the
Unwind Transferee; if an Intercompany Loan paydown in the amount of $10,000
was made by a Limited Partner Entity with respect to an Underlying Interest
that was transferred to an Unwind Transferee, then such $10,000 repayment
shall not adjust the Purchase Price).



(ii) If the Closing has occurred, then the parties shall cooperate so that the
transactions contemplated by clause (i) above shall occur but (A) Purchaser
shall cause CAM2 to transfer to an Unwind Transferee the applicable Underlying
Interests and (B) Seller shall be obligated to repay to Purchaser the amounts
that would have reduced or adjusted the Purchase Price had such reductions or
adjustments been made prior to the Closing and such amount due from Seller
shall be further adjusted as follows: (1) such amount shall be reduced by the
amount of any distributions received by Purchaser from the applicable
Underlying Partnership and (2) such amount shall be increased by the amount of
any capital contributions made by Purchaser to the applicable Underlying
Partnership.



(iii) If the Closing has occurred and the Objecting GP requires that the
indirect transfer of the Underlying Interest be subject to a right of first
refusal or other similar action which results in a third party exercising the
right to buy the applicable Underlying Interest from the applicable Limited



Page 20 

Partner Entity or CAM2, then the parties shall cooperate to effectuate such
transfer to such third party for the Allocated Purchase Price set forth on
Schedule I of this Agreement for such Underlying Interest (and any payments
required to be made to PA PSERS in connection with such transfer to a third
party from the price paid by such third party purchaser shall be paid to PA
PSERS upon receipt by Purchaser, CAM2 of the applicable Limited Partner
Entity).



(d) The provisions of this Section 14 shall survive the Closing.



15. Termination; Default.



(a) By Mutual Consent. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated by it abandoned, with respect to the Membership Interests and the
Intercompany Loans at any time prior to the Closing for any reason pursuant to
the mutual written consent of Purchaser and Seller, and Purchaser shall have
no further obligation to buy and Seller shall have no further obligation to
sell any of the Membership Interests.

(b) By Purchaser or Seller. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated by it abandoned with respect to the Membership
Interests and the Intercompany Loans by written notice from Purchaser to
Seller, or from Seller to Purchaser, in the event of a material breach by
Seller or Purchaser, respectively, of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement which is not cured within five (5)
Business Days after written notice of the breach is given to the party
committing the breach (it being agreed that the foregoing cure right shall not
apply to the failure to make the payment of the Closing Payment component of
the Purchase Price on the Closing Date).

(c) Remedies for Seller Defaults. In the event of a breach by Seller of any
material representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement which is not cured within five (5) Business Days after written
notice of the breach is given to Seller by any Purchaser, if Purchaser do not
desire to terminate this Agreement as contemplated by Section 15(b) above,
then Purchaser shall have the right to pursue all available remedies at law
against Seller, including, without limitation, the right to seek specific
performance of Seller's obligations under this Agreement (if such remedy is
available to Purchaser).

(d) Remedies for Purchaser Defaults. In the event of a breach by Purchaser of
any material representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement which is not cured within five (5) Business Days after written
notice of the breach is given to Purchaser by Seller (it being agreed that the
foregoing cure right shall not apply to the failure to make the payment of any
remaining portion of the Purchase Price on any Closing Date), if Seller does
not desire to terminate this Agreement as contemplated by Section 15(b) above,
then Seller shall have the right (at its election) to pursue all available
remedies at law against Purchaser, including, without limitation, the right to
seek specific performance of Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement (if
such remedy is available to Seller).

16. Purchaser Acknowledgments. Purchaser acknowledges that none of Seller, its affiliates or their respective officers, directors, partners, members or employees makes any representation or warranty, or have any responsibility, with respect to the solvency, financial condition or business operations or financial statements of the Underlying Partnerships. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller has not given Purchaser any investment advice and that the Purchase Price payable by Purchaser may be more or less than the fair market value of the Membership Interests and the Intercompany Loan Documents. Purchaser is acquiring the Membership Interests and the Intercompany Loan Documents for Purchaser's own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof, except in compliance with the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Purchaser has evaluated the merits and risks of purchasing the Membership Interests and the Intercompany Loan Documents on the terms set forth in this Agreement on its own and 



Page 21 

without reliance upon Seller (other than with respect to Seller's
representations and warranties set forth herein), and has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters and in making investments of this
type that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such purchase,
is aware of and has considered the financial risks and financial hazards of
purchasing the Membership Interests and the Intercompany Loan Documents on the
terms set forth in this Agreement and is able to bear the economic risks of
purchasing the Membership Interests and the Intercompany Loan Documents,
including the possibility of complete loss with respect thereto. Purchaser has
had access to such information regarding the business and finances of CAM2,
each Limited Partner Entity, each Underlying Partnership, each Underlying
Interest and such other matters with respect to each of the foregoing as a
reasonable person would consider in evaluating the transactions contemplated
hereby, including, in particular, all information necessary to determine the
fair market value of the Membership Interests, the Intercompany Loan Documents
and the Underlying Interests. Purchaser is an "accredited investor," as that
term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act and a
"qualified purchaser" as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(51) of the
Investment Company Act. Purchaser acknowledges that it has conducted its own
investigation of CAM2, each Limited Partner Entity and each Underlying
Partnership and has not relied on Seller in connection therewith except as to
Seller's representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement. The
provisions of this Section 16 shall survive the Closing and shall not be
deemed to have merged into any of the documents executed or delivered at the
Closing.



17. Notices. All notices or other communications required or permitted to be given pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be considered as properly given or made (i) upon the date of personal delivery (if notice is delivered by personal delivery), (ii) on the date of delivery, as confirmed by electronic answerback (if notice is delivered by facsimile transmission), (iii) on the day one (1) Business Day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier service (if notice is delivered by nationally recognized overnight courier service), or (iv) on the third (3rd) Business Day following mailing from within the United States by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, certified mail return receipt requested (if notice is given in such manner), and in any case addressed to the parties at the addresses set forth below (or to such other addresses as the parties may specify by due notice to the other) (for the purposes of this Agreement, "Business Day" shall mean any day other than (a) a Saturday or a Sunday, (b) a national holiday, or (c) a day on which banks are not required to be open for business in New York):

party with a copy of such proposed Form 8-K (or similar disclosure) for review
in a timely manner and the parties shall reasonably cooperate with respect to
any proposed comments or revisions that are reasonably requested (but in no
event shall any modification, amendment, or deletion to such Form 8-K (or

related entities).

(d) Any written press release to be issued by Seller or Purchaser (or their
