thereof) of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the

 



9  Closing, but subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by

as  _Exhibit C_ (the "Certificate of Merger").

 

Section 1.4 Effects of the Merger.

practicable on the Closing Date, the Parties shall file the Certificate of
Merger executed in accordance with Delaware Law and, as soon as practicable on

when the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware or at such other time as Green Plains and Global Ethanol

effective being hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time").

(b) Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock and Global Ethanol
Interests. At and as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder of any Global Ethanol
Interests or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

(i) each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub
shall be automatically converted into and become a limited liability company
interest of the Surviving Company so that immediately following the Effective
Time, Green Plains will be the holder of all limited liability company
interests of the Surviving Company;

 

(ii) each Global Ethanol Interest that is directly owned by Merger Sub
or Green Plains shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to be
outstanding, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; and

 

(iii) The Global Ethanol Interests (other than Global Ethanol
Interests to be canceled in accordance with Section 1.4(b)(ii)) shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive, in the aggregate, (A)

Agreement. At and as of the Effective Time, all such Global Ethanol Interests

as may be adjusted, is set forth on  _Exhibit D_.

(iv) In the event Green Plains changes (or establishes a record date
for changing) the number of shares of Green Plains Common Stock issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding
Green Plains Common Stock and the record date therefor shall be prior to the
Effective Time, the Stock Consideration and the Warrant Consideration to be

reflect such stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction.

Consideration received by the other Global Ethanol Members shall be adjusted
on a pro rata basis.

 

(vi) Any and all outstanding warrants to purchase Global Ethanol

Section 1.5 Adjustment of Merger Consideration.

 

(a) No later than the 30th day after the Closing Date (the "Post-
Closing Deadline"), Green Plains will prepare, with the assistance and
participation of former financial personnel of GEI under the Transition
Agreement, and deliver to the Sellers Representative, a 

 



11  consolidated balance sheet of Global Ethanol as of the Closing Date (the
"Closing Balance Sheet"), together with a statement (the "Closing Statement")
setting forth Green Plains determination of the Closing Working Capital,
prepared in accordance with Section 1.5(e) and _Exhibit A_. Notwithstanding
anything else in this Section 1.5, including any dispute pursuant to
subsection (b), (i) if the Closing Working Capital set forth in the Closing
Statement exceeds (is less negative than) the Initial Working Capital, Green
Plains and the Sellers Representative shall immediately advise the Escrow
Agent to release and pay the full amount of the Adjustment Escrow to the
Global Ethanol Members, and (ii) if the Closing Working Capital set forth in
the Closing Statement is less than (more negative than) the Initial Working
Capital, but the difference between Closing Working Capital and Initial
Working Capital is less than the balance of the Adjustment Escrow, Green
Plains and the Sellers Representative shall immediately advise the Escrow
Agent to release the excess of the Adjustment Escrow over such difference to
the Global Ethanol Members, in each case by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the accounts specified by the Global Ethanol Members.

 

(b) During the 30-day period immediately following the day on which
the Sellers Representative receives the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement, the Sellers Representative, and its representatives and advisors
will be given reasonable access, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable notice, to (i) the Surviving Companys books and records and
the working papers related to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and
the Closing Statement (including the determinations included therein),
and (ii) employees and accounting professionals of Green Plains and the
Surviving Company in order to facilitate the review by the Sellers
Representative of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement;
provided, however, that the review and access described in clauses (i) and
(ii) will be conducted at times and in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the operation of Green Plains and the Surviving Companys
respective businesses. The Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement
(including the determinations included therein) will become final, binding and
conclusive upon all Global Ethanol Members and their Affiliates on the earlier
of (A) the 30th day following the date on which the Sellers Representative
receives them, unless Green Plains receives from the Sellers Representative
prior to such 30th day a written notice from the Sellers Representative
setting forth all of its disagreements with any account or determination in
the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Statement (the "Disputed Items")
together with an explanation for each Disputed Item in reasonable detail and
its proposed adjustments with respect to each Disputed Item to the extent
reasonably practicable in light of the information then available to the
Sellers Representative (the "Dispute Notice") and (B) the date on which the
Sellers Representative notifies Green Plains in writing that it does not
dispute the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement.

 

(c) During the 10 days after the date on which Green Plains receives
a Dispute Notice, Green Plains and the Sellers Representative will seek in
good faith to resolve by written agreement any differences they have with
respect to the Disputed Items and any Disputed Item so resolved will be deemed
final, binding and conclusive upon Green Plains and all Global Ethanol
Members and their Affiliates. If Green Plains and the Sellers Representative
do not reach written agreement on the resolution of all of the Disputed Items
during such 10-day period (or such longer period as they shall mutually
agree), then at the end of such 10-day period (or longer), Green Plains and
the Sellers Representative shall submit all unresolved Disputed Items
(collectively, the "Unresolved Items") to Boulay, Huetmaker, Zibell and Co. or
such other

 



12  nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants with
a nationwide audit and accounting practice as Green Plains and the Sellers
Representative may agree in writing (the "Independent Accountants") and the
Independent Accountants shall review and resolve all of the Unresolved Items.
The Independent Accountants will determine each Unresolved Item in accordance
with this Section 1.5(c) and Section 1.5(e) as promptly as may be reasonably
practicable, and Green Plains and the Sellers Representative will instruct
the Independent Accountants to endeavor to complete such process within a
period of no more than 30 days. In resolving any Unresolved Items, the
Independent Accountants may not assign a value to any item in dispute greater
than the greatest value or less than the smallest value for such item
presented in the documentation that is proffered by the Parties. The
Independent Accountants shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator to
resolve each Unresolved Item based on the provisions of this Agreement, GAAP
and the written presentations made by Green Plains and the Sellers
Representative and not by independent review. Except as Green Plains and the
Sellers Representative may otherwise agree in writing, all communications
between Green Plains and the Sellers Representative or any of their
respective representatives, on the one hand, and the Independent Accountants,
on the other hand, will be in writing, with copies simultaneously delivered to
the non-communicating party. The Independent Accountants determination of the
Unresolved Items will be final, binding and conclusive on Green Plains, the
Global Ethanol Members and their Affiliates, effective as of the date the
Independent Accountants written determination is received by Green Plains and
the Sellers Representative. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountants will be borne one-half by Green Plains and one-half by the Global
Ethanol Members (proportionate to their Cash Consideration), and each of Green
Plains and the Global Ethanol Members will bear its own legal, accounting and
other fees and expenses of participating in such dispute resolution procedure.

 

(d) Upon final determination of the Closing Working Capital pursuant
to Section 1.5(b) or Section 1.5(c), as applicable, an adjustment will be
determined and paid as follows:

(i) If the Initial Working Capital exceeds the Closing Working Capital
(based on such final determination), the Sellers Representative and Green
Plains shall within three (3) Business Days after such final determination
issue joint written instructions directing the Escrow Agent to pay to Green
Plains the amount of such excess together with interest on such excess from
the Closing Date to the payment date at the rate equal to the interest rate
that the Adjustment Escrow earned during such time (collectively, the "Excess
Amount") out of the Adjustment Escrow by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account specified by Green Plains (the "Green Plains
Account"), and to pay to the Global Ethanol Members, pro rata, as shown on
_Exhibit D_ , the remaining amount, if any, of the Adjustment Escrow, together
with interest on such remaining amount from the Closing Date to the payment
date at the rate equal to the interest rate that the Adjustment Escrow earned
during such time, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
accounts specified by the Global Ethanol Members. If the Excess Amount is
greater than the amount in the Adjustment Escrow, then the Sellers
Representative and Green Plains shall also issue joint written instructions
directing the Escrow Agent to pay to Green Plains out of the Indemnity Escrow
the amount by which the Excess Amount exceeds the amount in the Adjustment
Escrow (up to the amount in the Indemnity Escrow) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds

 



13  to the Green Plains Account. Any amount payable to Green Plains pursuant to
this Section 1.5(d)(i) will be paid within three (3) Business Days of such
final determination by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
Green Plains Account.

 

(ii) If the Closing Working Capital (based on such
final determination) exceeds the Initial Working Capital, Green Plains will
pay to the Global Ethanol Members, pro rata, as shown on _Exhibit D_ , an
amount equal to such excess together with interest on such excess from the
Closing Date to the payment date at the rate equal to the interest rate that
the Adjustment Escrow earned during such time, and the Sellers Representative
and Green Plains shall issue joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
pay the amount of the Adjustment Escrow to the Global Ethanol Members, pro
rata, in accordance with their respective Global Ethanol Interests, as set
forth in Exhibit D. Any amount payable to the Global Ethanol Members pursuant
to this Section 1.5(d)(ii) will be paid within three (3) Business Days of
such final determination by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the accounts specified by the Global Ethanol Members.

Any amount paid to Green Plains pursuant to clause (d)(i) or to the Global
Ethanol Members pursuant to clause (d)(ii) (other than interest on the
Adjustment Escrow paid to the Global Ethanol Members pursuant to clause (ii)
above) will be deemed to constitute an adjustment to the Merger Consideration.

 

(e) For the purposes of this Section 1.5, each accounting term used
herein will have the meaning that is applied thereto in accordance with GAAP
as of the date of this Agreement and, to the extent consistent with GAAP, the
accounting principles, policies, procedures and methodologies applied
in preparing the Audited Financial Statements. The Closing Balance Sheet and
the Closing Working Capital will be calculated (i) in accordance with GAAP as
in effect on the date of this Agreement and, to the extent consistent with
GAAP, the accounting principles, policies, procedures and methodologies
applied in preparing the Audited Financial Statements, including without
limitation with respect to the nature or classification of accounts and
determining levels of reserves or levels of accruals; (ii) based on the books
and records of Global Ethanol and the former Subsidiaries of Global Ethanol
and the definitions herein agreed and (iii) and, in the case of (i) and (ii),
as may otherwise be set forth on  _Exhibit A_ hereto; _provided_ , _however_
, that no adjustment shall be made to the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing
Working Capital by Green Plains with respect to the Questionable Receivables,
except normal adjustments to reflect payments applied thereto.

Section 1.6 Exchange Procedures; Payment; Escrow.

(a) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, upon
receipt by Green Plains of evidence reasonably satisfactory to Green Plains of
a holders ownership of a Global Ethanol Interest, free and clear of any
Liens, the holder of each Global Ethanol Interest shall be entitled to
receive from Green Plains in exchange therefor, and Green Plains shall deliver
to such holder, the Merger Consideration less the amounts for Escrow Funds as
set forth in Section 1.6(g) and as may be adjusted pursuant to this
Agreement, and certain dividends or other distributions in accordance with
Section 1.6(b), as set forth on _Exhibit D_ , and such holders Global Ethanol
Interest shall forthwith be canceled. All warrants to purchase any Global
Ethanol Interests shall be extinguished and cancelled as of the Effective
Time, without consideration.

 



14  Subject to Section 1.4(b)(v), in the event of a transfer of ownership of
Global Ethanol Interests that is not registered in the transfer records of
Global Ethanol, the Merger Consideration, as may be adjusted herein, may be
delivered to a Person other than the Person in whose name such Global Ethanol
Interest is registered if such Global Ethanol Interest has been properly
assigned, Green Plains receives evidence reasonably satisfactory to Green
Plains of such assignment, and the Person requesting such delivery shall pay
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the delivery of Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Global
Ethanol Interest or establish to the satisfaction of Green Plains that such
tax has been paid or is not applicable. Each Global Ethanol Interest shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration that the holder thereof has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article I and certain dividends or
other distributions in accordance with Section 1.6(b). Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, no interest shall be paid or will accrue on any
cash payable to holders of Global Ethanol Interests pursuant to the provisions
of this Article I. Certificates evidencing the Stock Consideration, with the
legends set forth in the Investor Representation Letter, shall be delivered
to the Global Ethanol Members, together with the Green Plains Warrants, in
each case in the amounts set forth on Exhibit D.

(b) Distributions. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is
declared or made after the date hereof with respect to Green Plains
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time, such declaration
shall include a dividend or other distribution in respect of all shares of
Green Plains Common Stock issuable as Stock Consideration pursuant to this
Agreement or after exercise of a Green Plains Warrant. Subject to the effect
of applicable escheat or similar laws, there shall be paid to the holder of
each Global Ethanol Interest representing whole shares of Green Plains Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time paid with
respect to such whole shares of Green Plains Common Stock.

 

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Global Ethanol Interests. All
Merger Consideration delivered upon the surrender for exchange of Global
Ethanol Interests in accordance with this Article I shall be deemed to have
been delivered in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Global Ethanol Interests subject, however, to the Surviving Companys
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by
Global Ethanol on such Global Ethanol Interests which remain unpaid at the
Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
transfer books of the Surviving Company of the Global Ethanol Interests that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Green Plains Common Stock or Green Plains Warrants shall
be issued upon the exchange of Global Ethanol Interests, no dividends or other
distributions of Green Plains shall relate to such fractional share
interests, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of Green Plains. In lieu of
such fractional share interests, such fractional share shall be rounded up
or down to the nearest whole number (with one-half of a shares rounded up).

 

(e) No Liability. None of Green Plains, Merger Sub, Global Ethanol
or the Surviving Company shall be liable to any Person in respect of any
shares of Green Plains

 



15  Common Stock, cash, dividends or other distributions properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

 

(f) Withholding Rights. Green Plains or the Surviving Company shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Global Ethanol Interests such
amounts as Green Plains or the Surviving Company is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Green Plains
or the Surviving Company, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Global
Ethanol Interests in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by Green Plains or the Surviving Company. 

(g) Escrow Funds.

 

(i) Pursuant to an escrow agreement to be entered into on the Closing
Date by and among Green Plains, the Sellers Representative on behalf of the
Global Ethanol Members and U.S. Bank National Association (or another
financial institution proposed by either Green Plains or the
Sellers Representative and reasonably acceptable to the other of them), as
escrow agent (in such capacity, the "Escrow Agent"), in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit G_ with such changes as the Sellers Representative
and Green Plains may agree to in writing (the "Escrow Agreement"), Green
Plains and the Sellers Representative shall appoint the Escrow Agent to hold
and disburse the Escrow Funds as provided below. At the Closing, Green
Plains shall deposit with the Escrow Agent: (A) a portion of the Merger
Consideration equal to Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) (together with any
interest or other earnings thereon, the "Adjustment Escrow"), (B) a portion
of the Merger Consideration equal to Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) (the
"Indemnity Escrow"), and (C) a portion of the Merger Consideration equal to
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (together with any interest or
other earnings thereon, the "Member Fund" and, together with the Adjustment
Escrow and Indemnity Escrow, the "Escrow Funds"), in each case by wire
transfer of immediately available funds. The Adjustment Escrow and
the Indemnity Escrow shall be held by the Escrow Agent in segregated accounts
to serve as the sources of payment of certain adjustments to the Merger
Consideration required by Section 1.5(d), and indemnification obligations of
the Global Ethanol Members set forth in Article VI. The Member Fund shall be
held by the Escrow Agent in a segregated account (over which Green Plains
shall have no authority whatsoever, by way of release authority, investment
authority or otherwise, but instead will be distributed at the sole direction
of the Sellers Representative) to serve as the sources of payment of costs and
expenses pursuant to Section 1.7(d). The Escrow Funds contributed on behalf of
each Global Ethanol Member shall be in proportion to their Global Ethanol
Interests, as set forth in Exhibit D.

 

(ii) The Adjustment Escrow shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent to
Green Plains or the Global Ethanol Members, as applicable, under Section
1.5(d). From time to time prior to the Release Date, the Indemnity Escrow
shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent to Green Plains to the extent required
to pay an indemnification obligation of the Global Ethanol Members under
Article VI; _provided_ , _however_ , that such disbursements

 



16  shall be made by Escrow Agent only upon receipt of (x) joint written
instructions executed by Green Plains and the Sellers Representative or (y)
in the case of a disbursement requested with respect to an indemnification
claim under Article VI, a Final Award certified as such by Green Plains or the
Sellers Representative (a copy of which shall be contemporaneously delivered
to the non-certifying party), in each case directing the Escrow Agent to make
such disbursement. On the Release Date, the entire balance of the Indemnity
Escrow (less any amounts thereof that are subject to unresolved
indemnification claims hereunder (each such amount, a "Pending Claim
Amount")) shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent to the Global Ethanol
Members, pro rata, as set forth on _Exhibit D_. After the Release Date, each
Pending Claim Amount shall be paid by the Escrow Agent to Green Plains or the
Global Ethanol Members, as the case may be, upon receipt by the Escrow Agent
of, and in accordance with, (x) joint written instructions executed by Green
Plains and the Sellers Representative or (y) a Final Award certified as such
by Green Plains or the Sellers Representative (a copy of which shall be
contemporaneously delivered to the non-certifying party), in each case
directing the Escrow Agent to make such disbursement in the amounts and to the
Persons set forth therein. At such time, or from time to time, as directed by
the Sellers Representative, the Member Fund will be paid by the Escrow Agent
first to pay any remaining costs and expenses of the Sellers Representative,
and then pro rata among the Global Ethanol Members; provided, however, that
all amounts remaining in the Member Fund shall be disbursed promptly after
final settlement of all Pending Claim Amounts. As used herein, the date as of
which all amounts in the Escrow Funds have been paid out by the Escrow Agent
is referred to as the "Escrow Termination Date."

 

Section 1.7 Sellers Representative.

 

(a) Appointment. GEI is hereby appointed as the representative and
agent of the Global Ethanol Members under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement (the "Sellers Representative") and GEI hereby notifies Green Plains
that Green Plains shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the actions of
Jon Brett for any action on its part, including in its capacity as Sellers
Representative, under this Agreement until such time as Green Plains is
notified in writing that Jon Brett no long has such authority and that
GEI appoints another individual in his place.

 

(b) Authority. The Sellers Representative is authorized on or after
the date of this Agreement, for and on behalf of the Global Ethanol Members,
to take any action and to make and deliver any certificate, notice, consent or
instrument required or permitted to be made or delivered under this Agreement
or under the documents referred to in this Agreement, to waive any
requirements of this Agreement or to enter into one or more amendments or
supplements to this Agreement that Sellers Representative determines in
Sellers Representatives sole and absolute discretion to be necessary,
appropriate or advisable with respect to the Global Ethanol Members, which
authority includes the execution and delivery of the Escrow Agreement on
behalf of Global Ethanol Members and any amendments or supplements thereto
and the performance of all obligations thereunder, including authority to
collect and pay funds and dispute, settle, compromise and make all claims;
provided, however, that such authority shall not extend to any action that
would disproportionately impact the interest of any Global Ethanol Member in
the Merger Consideration. The authority of Sellers Representative includes
the right

 



17  to hire or retain such counsel, investment bankers, accountants,
representatives and other professional advisors as Sellers Representative
determines in Sellers Representative sole and absolute discretion to be
necessary, appropriate or advisable in order to perform this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement, the execution
of the Investor Representation Letter, and the approval of the Merger by the
Global Ethanol Members, each Global Ethanol Member (regardless of whether or
not such Global Ethanol Member votes in favor of the adoption of the Agreement
and the approval of the Merger, whether at a meeting or by written consent
in lieu thereof) appoints, as of the date of this Agreement, the Sellers
Representative as his, her or its true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact
with the authority set forth in this Section 1.7. This power of attorney is
coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. All actions, decisions and
instructions of the Sellers Representative shall be conclusive and binding
upon all of the Global Ethanol Members.

 

(c) Reliance. Green Plains will have no liability to any Global
Ethanol Member or otherwise arising out of the acts or omissions of Sellers
Representative or any disputes among the Global Ethanol Members or with
Sellers Representative. Green Plains may rely entirely on its dealings
with, and notices to and from, Sellers Representative to satisfy any
obligations it might have under this Agreement to the Global Ethanol Members,
the Escrow Agreement or any other agreement referred to in this Agreement or
otherwise to Sellers. 

(d) Reimbursement of Expenses. The Sellers Representative shall be
entitled to receive reimbursement for any and all expenses, charges and
liabilities, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by the Sellers
Representative in the performance or discharge of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement. Reimbursement of such expenses, charges and liabilities
will first be from the Member Fund and will be disbursed to the Sellers
Representative upon certification to the Escrow Agent by the Sellers
Representative. To the extent such expenses, charges and liabilities exceed
the funds available in the Escrow Fund, each Global Ethanol Member shall
reimburse the Sellers Representative, pro rata in accordance with their
interest in the Merger Consideration.

(e) Release from Liability; Indemnification; Authority of Sellers
Representative. By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement, the execution of
the Investor Representation Letter, and the approval of the Merger by the
Global Ethanol Members, each Global Ethanol Member (regardless of whether or
not such Global Ethanol Member votes in favor of the adoption of the Agreement
and the approval of the Merger, whether at a meeting or by written consent in
lieu thereof) hereby releases the Sellers Representative, and each of its
officers, directors, employees and representatives, from, and each Global
Ethanol Member agrees to indemnify the Sellers Representative, and each of
its officers, directors, employees and representatives, against, liability
for any action taken or not taken by him, her or it in his, her or its
capacity as such agent, except for the liability of the Sellers
Representative, or any officer, director, employee or representative thereof,
to a Global Ethanol Member for loss which such holder may suffer from the
intentional misconduct of the Sellers Representative or such representatives,
or knowing violations of law, in carrying out his, her or its duties
hereunder.

Global Ethanol, and with respect solely to Section 2.1(a) GEI, represents and
warrants to Green Plains as follows:

 

(a) Authorization. Global Ethanol has the necessary limited
liability company power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to

without limitation any approval by holders of any class of Global Ethanol
Interests required by the Global Ethanol LLC Agreement or any class
designation established by the board of managers of Global Ethanol) is
required. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Global
Ethanol and, assuming its due authorization, execution and delivery by Green
Plains and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of

party thereto under) any agreement, contract, lease, license, instrument or

reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-
financial) required to be disclosed by Green Plains in the reports that it
files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to Green Plains management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the

Section 5.3 Global Ethanol Equity Plans and Awards; Employee
Benefit Plans. Green Plains agrees that all employees of Global Ethanol who,
in the sole discretion of Green Plains, continue employment with Green Plains
or the Surviving Company after the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees")
shall be eligible to continue to participate in the Surviving Companys
retirement, health, vacation and other non-equity based employee benefit
plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that

 

(a) nothing in this Section 5.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
limit the right of Green Plains or the Surviving Company to amend or terminate
any such retirement, health, vacation or other employee benefit plan at any
time, and (b) if Green Plains or the Surviving Company terminates any such
retirement, health, vacation or other employee benefit plan, then the
Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in Green Plains health,
vacation and other non-equity based employee benefit plans, to substantially
the same extent as employees of Green Plains in similar positions and at
similar grade levels. With respect to such benefits and to the extent
permitted under the applicable employee benefit plans of Green Plains, credit
for service accrued by Continuing Employees (and eligible dependents) for
employment with Global Ethanol prior to the Effective Time shall be recognized
(except to the extent necessary to prevent duplication of benefits), any pre-
existing condition limitations and eligibility waiting periods applicable to
any Continuing Employee under any group health plan shall be waived, and
employees shall be given credit for amounts paid under any Global Ethanol

applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such
amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
applicable Global Ethanol employee benefit plan.

 

(b) Nothing in this Section 5.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement,
however, shall be construed to create a right in any employee to employment
with Green Plains, the Surviving Company or any other Subsidiary of Green
Plains or the Surviving Company and, subject to any 

 



45  binding written agreement between an employee and Green Plains or the
Surviving Company, the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at

or representatives, directly or indirectly through another Person, to (i)
solicit, initiate or encourage, or take any other action to facilitate, any
inquiries with respect to or the making of any Global Ethanol Takeover
Proposal or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any

Global Ethanol Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed
that any material violation of the covenants set forth in the preceding
sentence by any manager, officer, employee or representative of Global Ethanol
or GEI shall be a breach of this Section 5.4(a) by Global Ethanol and the
Global Ethanol Members. Global Ethanol shall immediately cease and cause
to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to any Global Ethanol Takeover Proposal and
request the prompt return or destruction of all Confidential Information
previously furnished. 

The term "Global Ethanol Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry (including a
request for a waiver or amendment of an existing agreement), proposal or
offer from any Person (other than Green Plains or an Affiliate thereof)
relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, of assets (including limited liability company interests of any
Subsidiary of Global Ethanol) or businesses that constitute 10% or more of the
revenues, net income or assets of Global Ethanol, or 10% or more of any
limited liability company interest of Global Ethanol; any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially
owning 10% or more of any limited liability company interest of Global
Ethanol; or any merger, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture or similar transaction involving Global Ethanol
pursuant to which any Person or the shareholders of any Person would own 10%
or more of the limited liability company interest of Global Ethanol or any
class of equity securities of any resulting parent company of Global Ethanol,
in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) The members of Global Ethanol shall not (i) (A) withdraw (or
qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Green Plains), their approval,
adoption or recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (B) approve, adopt
or recommend, any Global Ethanol Takeover Proposal; or (ii) approve, adopt or
recommend, or allow Global Ethanol to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,

not the Merger is consummated, except that each of Green Plains and Global
Ethanol shall bear and pay one-half of the filing fees for the pre-merger
notification and report forms under the HSR Act.

Agreement is terminated by Green Plains pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i) due to
a willful and intentional breach by Global Ethanol or GEI, then Global Ethanol
shall reimburse Green Plains for the actual, out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by Green Plains in connection with the anticipated Merger, to the extent not
in excess of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000).

(c) Global Ethanol acknowledges that the agreements contained in
Section 5.5(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Green Plains would not enter

amount due pursuant to Section 5.5(b), and, in order to obtain such payment,
Green Plains commences a suit that results in a judgment against Global
Ethanol for the fees set forth in Section 5.5(b), Global Ethanol shall pay to
Green Plains its out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amount due at the prime rate of U.S. Bank National Association in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made.

 

Section 5.6 GEI Asset Acquisition. On the Closing Date, Green Plains
and GEI will enter into an Asset Purchase Agreement, substantially in the
form of _Exhibit H_ hereto, whereby Green Plains shall acquire from GEI

Global Ethanol shall be terminated. In consideration thereof, Green Plains
shall pay to GEI at the Closing Date, a payment of Two Million Dollars
($2,000,000).

Section 5.7 Public Announcements. Green Plains and Global Ethanol will
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making

except as either party may determine is required by applicable law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities

statements without additional consent pursuant to the preceding sentence that
are consistent with any prior public statement of such party or any other
party made in compliance with this Section 5.7.

compliance with any applicable securities laws.

of SEC Rule 144, , Green Plains shall:

(a) Use commercially reasonable efforts to make and keep available
adequate current public information, as those terms are understood and defined
in SEC Rule 144; and

(b) furnish to any Global Ethanol Member, so long as the Global Ethanol
Member owns any shares of Green Plains Common Stock issued as part of the
Stock Consideration or upon exercise of the Warrants (the "Securities"),
forthwith upon request to the extent accurate, a written statement by the
Green Plains as to whether it has made and kept available adequate current
public information under the requirements of SEC Rule 144.

Subject to compliance with subsections (a) and (b) above and expiration of
applicable holding periods, and contingent upon receipt by counsel of
affidavits of the Global Ethanol Member in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such counsel (including representations adequate for such
counsel to confirm that such Global Ethanol Member is not an Affiliate of
Green Plains and any other requirements of Rule 144 have been met), Green
Plains shall cause its counsel to promptly (and in any case no later than
three trading days following the delivery by a Global Ethanol Member to Green
Plains or the Green Plains transfer agent of a legended certificate
representing such Securities) issue a legal opinion to the Green Plains
transfer agent facilitating the reissuance of the certificates representing
the Securities or the transfer thereof, without restrictive legend.

transition of financial and management operations to Green Plans, and
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement attached hereto Exhibit J, GEI
will make available to Green Plains, at the principal office of GEI in

Effective Time, and Green Plains shall compensate GEI for the salary,
compensation expense and overhead expense (including occupancy) of, those
financial and management personnel set forth in Schedule 1 to the
Transition Services Agreement, and such other personnel and facilities as
Green Plains shall reasonably request.

Article VI 

Indemnification.

Section 6.1 Indemnification of Green Plains.

(a) The Global Ethanol Members (in such capacity, the "Seller
Indemnifying Parties") will, after the Effective Time, indemnify and hold
harmless Green Plains and the Surviving Company and any officers, directors,
employees or agents thereof (each a "Buyer Indemnified Party"), from and
against, any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, causes of 

 



48  actions, losses, costs, damages, penalties, assessments, liabilities and
out-of-pocket expenses incurred or paid, including reasonable attorneys fees,
costs of investigation or settlement, other professionals and experts fees,
and court or arbitration costs (hereinafter collectively referred to as
"Damages"), arising from or constituting (i) any misrepresentation, false
certification, or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Global Ethanol or GEI contained in this Agreement; (ii) any breach of any of
the agreements of Global Ethanol or GEI contained in this Agreement; or (iii)
the Questionable Receivables. Solely for purposes of determining the amount
of Damages to which a Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled as a result of any
such Global Ethanol Breach, each representation or warranty shall not be
deemed qualified or limited by any concept of "material," "materiality,"
"Material Adverse Effect" or other similar materiality qualification or
limitations.

(b) Any Claim for indemnification made by a Buyer Indemnified Party
under this Section 6.1 must be raised in a Notice of Claim pursuant
to Section 6.3 no later than 12:00 PM Central Time on the Release Date and,
if so raised by such date, such Claim shall survive the Release Date until
finally resolved.

 

(c) Except as set forth in Section 6.6, claims by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties for Damages under this Section 6.1 shall be satisfied
solely from the Indemnity Escrow. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 6.1, the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.1
with respect to Global Ethanol Breaches of representations and warranties
shall not apply with respect to such Global Ethanol Breaches unless and until
the aggregate Damages from such Global Ethanol Breaches determined to be due
for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties seek or have sought indemnification
hereunder exceeds a cumulative aggregate of $325,000 (the "Basket"), in which
event the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall, subject to the other limitations
herein, be indemnified only for the aggregate amount of all such Damages in
excess of the Basket.

 

(d) The amount to which a Buyer Indemnified Party may
become entitled under this Section 6.1 shall be net of any actual recovery
(whether by way of payment, discount or credit received from a third party
(including any insurer) less any cost associated with receiving such recovery
in respect of a claim, but no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be required to
seek or collect such recoveries prior to being entitled to indemnification
hereunder. If any indemnity is paid before the Buyer Indemnified Party
receives any such recovery then the Buyer Indemnified Party will promptly
remit to the Global Ethanol Members, pro rata the portion of the indemnity to
which it would not have been entitled if it had received such recovery prior
to the payment of such indemnity.

 



49 Section 6.2 Indemnification of Global Ethanol Members.

(a) Green Plains (in such capacity, the "Buyer Indemnifying Party")
will indemnify and hold harmless each Global Ethanol Member and any officers,
directors, employees or agents thereof (each a "Seller Indemnified Party" and
together with a Buyer Indemnity Person, an "Indemnified Party"), from and
against, any and all Damages arising from or constituting (i) any
misrepresentation, false certification, or breach of any of the
representations or warranties of Green Plains contained in this Agreement; or
(ii) any breach of any of the agreements of Green Plains contained in this
Agreement (collectively, the "Green Plains Breaches"). The Buyer Indemnifying
Party and the Seller Indemnifying Party are hereafter interchangeably
referred to as an "Indemnifying Party."

 

(b) Any Claim for indemnification made by a Seller Indemnified Party
under this Section 6.2 must be raised in a Notice of Claim pursuant to Section
6.2 no later than 12:00 PM Central Time on the Release Date and, if so raised
by such date, such Claim shall survive the Release Date until finally
resolved.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.2 the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.2 with respect to Green Plains
Breaches of representations and warranties shall not apply with respect to
such Green Plains Breaches unless and until the aggregate Damages from such
Green Plains Breaches determined to be due for which the Seller Indemnified
Parties seek or have sought indemnification hereunder exceeds a the Basket, in
which event the Seller Indemnified Parties shall, subject to the other
limitations herein, be indemnified only for the aggregate amount of all such
Damages in excess of the Basket, up to a limit not to exceed Two Million
Dollars ($2,000,000).

 

Section 6.3 Notice and Resolution of Claims. As used herein, the
term "Claim" means a claim for indemnification by any Indemnified Party for
Damages. Claims resulting from the assertion, whether orally or in writing,
against any Indemnitee of a claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration,
investigation, inquiry or proceeding brought by a third party against any
Indemnitee (in each such case, a "Third-Party Claim") shall be resolved in
accordance with Section 6.3(b). Claims that are not Third-Party Claims
("Direct Claims") shall be resolved in accordance with Section 6.3(a).

 

(a) Direct Claims.

 

(i) Green Plains, on behalf of any Buyer Indemnified Party, and the
Sellers Representative, on behalf of any Seller Indemnified Party, shall give
notice in writing of any Direct Claims delivered to the Sellers
Representative, on behalf of the Seller Indemnifying Parties, for
Damages resulting from Global Ethanol Breaches, and delivered to Green Plains
for Damages resulting from Green Plains Breaches. Each such notice of a Claim
by an Indemnified Party (a "Notice of Claim") shall:

 

(A) state that the Indemnified Party has incurred or paid Damages in
an aggregate stated amount (to the extent it is practicable to provide such an
estimate) arising from such Direct Claim; and

 



50 (B) contain a brief description, in reasonable detail (to the extent
reasonably available to the Indemnified Party), of the facts, circumstances or
events giving rise to the alleged Damages based on the Indemnified Partys
good-faith belief thereof.

 

(ii) If, within twenty (20) Business Days after a Notice of Claim,
Green Plains or the Sellers Representative, as the case may be, agrees in
writing that liability for all, or any portion, of such Direct Claim is
indemnified under Section 6.1 or Section 6.2, the amount of the Damages for
which liability is agreed shall be conclusively deemed to have been consented
to, and in the case of a Global Ethanol Breach, Green Plains shall be
authorized to deliver such agreement to the Escrow Agent, and the
Sellers Representative shall join with Green Plains in, instructing the
Escrow Agent to make a wire transfer to Green Plains in the amount of such
Damages. If the representative of the Indemnifying Party does not so agree in
writing to such Notice of Claim or gives the representative of the
Indemnified Party written notice contesting any portion of a Notice of Claim
(a "Contested Claim") within such twenty (20) Business Day period, then such
Contested Claim shall be resolved by either (i) a written settlement
agreement executed by Green Plains and the Sellers Representative or (ii) in
the absence of such a written settlement agreement within forty-five (45)
Business Days of such Notice of Claim or such longer period as is mutually
agreed upon by Green Plains and the Sellers Representative, by binding
arbitration between Green Plains and the Sellers Representative in accordance
with the provisions of Section 6.3(a)(iii). 

(iii) Any Contested Claim that is not settled by the parties as set
forth in Section 6.3(a)(ii) shall be arbitrated in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.
Arbitration shall be by a single arbitrator selected by Green Plains and
the Sellers Representative in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall be held
in such place as may be specified by the arbitrator (or any place agreed to by
Green Plains, the Sellers Representative and the arbitrator). The decision
of the arbitrator shall be final and binding as to any matters submitted under
this Section 6.3. The arbitration shall be governed by the United States
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1 through 16, and judgment upon the award of the
arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. All costs
and expenses incurred in connection with any such arbitration proceeding
(including reasonable attorneys fees) shall be borne by the Party incurring
such costs and expenses. Green Plains, on the one hand, and the Sellers
Representative, on behalf of the Global Ethanol Members, on the other hand,
shall bear the expense of deposits and advances required by the arbitrator in
equal proportions, but either party may advance such amounts, subject to
recovery as an addition or offset to any award. For the avoidance of doubt,
the monetary recovery owed to the prevailing party to the arbitration
proceeding shall include reimbursement of such advances. Upon the conclusion
of any arbitration proceedings hereunder, the arbitrator shall be instructed
to render a final reasoned written arbitration award setting forth the
basis and reasons for any decision reached (the "Final Award") and shall be
instructed to deliver a signed copy of the Final Award to the Sellers
Representative and Green Plains. The Final Award shall constitute a
conclusive determination of all issues in question, binding upon the Sellers
Representative, the Global Ethanol Members and Green Plains, and shall

 



51  include an affirmative statement to such effect. The Sellers
Representative, Green Plains and the arbitrator shall conclude each
arbitration pursuant to this Section 6.3 as promptly as possible for the
Contested Claim being arbitrated. The arbitrator chosen in accordance with
these provisions shall not have the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect
the terms of these arbitration provisions or the provisions of this
Agreement. 

(b) Third Party Claims.

 

(i) In the event a Third-Party Claim arises out of or results from
any item indemnified pursuant to the terms of Section 6.1 or Section 6.2, the
Indemnified Party will give the Sellers Representative (in the case of a
Third-Party Claim arising out of Section 6.1), or Green Plains (in the case
of a Third-Party Claim arising out of Section 6.2), prompt written notice of
the commencement of the Third-Party Claim (which notice shall, for all
purposes of this Agreement, be deemed a Notice of Claim). The complaint
or other papers pursuant to which the third party commenced any action giving
rise to a Third-Party Claim will be attached to such written notice. The
failure to give prompt written notice will not affect any Indemnified Partys
right to indemnification unless such failure has materially and adversely
affected the Indemnifying Party to defend successfully such action resulting
from such Third-Party Claim.

 

(ii) The Indemnifying Party will contest and defend the action giving
rise to a Third-Party Claim on behalf of any Indemnified Party. Notice of the
intention of the Indemnifying Party to so contest and defend will be given to
the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) Business Days after the Indemnifying
Partys receipt of the Notice of Claim. Such contest and defense will be
conducted by reputable attorneys retained by Indemnifying Party, provided
that:

 

(A) an Indemnified Party will be entitled at any time, at its own cost
and expense, to participate in such contest and defense and to be represented
by attorneys of its own choosing (provided that such Indemnified Party shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the conduct of such defense); or 

(B) if (x) the Third-Party Claim imposes a significant reputational
risk to the Indemnified Party, (y) the Indemnifying Party does not promptly
contest and defend a Third-Party Claim or (z) any Indemnified Party reasonably
determines that the Indemnifying Party is not adequately representing or,
because of a conflict of interest, may not adequately represent any interests
of the Indemnified Party,

then such Indemnified Party will be entitled to conduct its own defense and to
be represented by attorneys of its own choosing, all at the Indemnifying
Partys cost and expense. Except as otherwise provided in this Section
6.3(b)(ii), if the amount of Damages that can reasonably be expected to result
from a Third Party Claim arising from a Global Ethanol Breach exceeds the
balance of the Indemnity Escrow, then Green Plains shall be entitled to
participate jointly with the Sellers Representative in such contest and
defense and to be represented by attorneys of its own choosing, and to the
extent such

 



52  reasonably expected Damages exceeds twice the Indemnity Escrow Balance,
Green Plains shall be entitled to control such defense and to be reimbursed
from the Indemnity Escrow for the costs and expense of such attorneys.

(iii) Neither an Indemnified Party nor an Indemnifying Party may
concede, settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim without the consent of the
other party, which consents will not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if (x) a Third-Party Claim seeks the issuance of an
injunction, the specific election of an obligation or similar remedy or (y)
the subject matter of a Third-Party Claim relates to the ongoing business of
any Indemnified Party, which Third-Party Claim, if decided against
any Indemnified Party, would materially adversely affect the ongoing business
or reputation of any Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party alone will be
entitled to settle such Third-Party Claim in the first instance, subject to
reasonable notice to the Indemnifying Party.

Section 6.4 Survival of Covenants, Representations and Warranties.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.4, all representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full
force and effect until that date which is the earlier of (a) the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII and (b) eighteen (18) months
from the Closing Date (the "Release Date"); provided, however, that the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2.1(a), (b) and (c),,
and Section 2.1(d) and Section 2.2(a) shall survive indefinitely and the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.2(i), Section 2.2(w) and
section 2.2(y)shall survive any and all applicable statutes of limitation
related thereto. All covenants of the parties shall survive according to their
respective terms.

Section 6.5 Payment of Claims/ Escrow Account. Except as set forth in
this Section 6.5, the right to indemnification under Section 6.1 of this
Agreement, and of Green Plains to recover amounts indemnified pursuant to
Section 6.1 of this Agreement, shall be satisfied solely and exclusively from
the Escrow Funds in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, and all collections from the Escrow Funds shall be deemed
pro rata among the Global Ethanol Members, in accordance with their interest
therein, as set forth on Exhibit D. For avoidance of doubt, except as set
forth in this Section 6.5, no Global Ethanol Member shall be liable for
Damages, other than with respect to such portion of such liability as may be
covered by the Escrow Funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 6.5 shall limit the liability of a Global Ethanol Member for fraud or
willful misconduct by Global Ethanol or by such Global Ethanol Member (but not
other Global Ethanol Members) in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; provided that any liability of a Global Ethanol Member for
fraud by Global Ethanol shall be several in proportion to such Global
Ethanols interest in the Merger Consideration, and not joint, unless such
Global Ethanol Member participated in the fraud or willful misconduct.

 



53  

Section 6.6 Exclusive Remedy. After the Effective Time,
the indemnification rights above are and shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 6.6 shall not
apply to any action or claim by any Party for specific performance or
injunctive relief with respect to any failure by any other party to perform
any of its covenants or agreements under this Agreement or any claims or
causes of actions for fraud.

Article VII

 

Tax Matters

Section 7.1 Transfer Taxes. If the Effective Time occurs, all stock
transfer, real estate transfer, documentary, stamp, recording and
other similar Taxes (including interest, penalties and additions to any such
Taxes) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Surviving Company.

 

Section 7.2 Additional Tax Covenants.

 

(a) After the Closing Date, Green Plains shall not amend, modify or
otherwise change Income Tax Returns of Global Ethanol for any Tax period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Period") without the
consent of the Sellers Representative, and to the extent such amendment,
modification or change would disproportionately impact any Global Ethanol
Member, the consent of such Global Ethanol Member.

(b) Green Plains, the Sellers Representative and each Global Ethanol
Member shall cooperate fully in any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Such cooperation shall include
signing any Tax Returns, amended Tax Returns, claims or other documents
necessary to settle any Tax controversy, the retention and (upon the other
Partys request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereby.

(c) Promptly after receipt by Green Plains, Global Ethanol or any of
their affiliates of written notice of the assertion or commencement of any
claim, audit, examination or other proposed change or adjustment by any taxing
authority relating to Income Tax for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (a "Tax
Claim"), Green Plains, Global Ethanol or an appropriate affiliate, as
applicable, shall immediately notify the Sellers Representative of such Tax
Claim. Such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known)
describing the asserted Tax Claim in reasonable detail and shall include
copies of any notice or other document received from any taxing authority in
respect of any such asserted Tax Claim. The Sellers Representative shall
have the sole right to represent the interests of Global Ethanol or any Global
Ethanol Subsidiary in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding
relating to Income Tax for a Pre-Closing Tax Period that could affect
the liability for Taxes of a Global Ethanol Member under this Agreement or
otherwise, and to employ counsel of the Sellers Representatives choice;
provided, however, that Green Plains and its representatives shall be
permitted to be present at any Tax proceeding related to any such period
which may have the effect of increasing Green Plains or Global Ethanols Tax
liability for any Tax period ending after the Closing Date, and the Sellers 

 



54  Representative shall not settle or compromise any such proceeding without
Green Plains prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld; provided, however, that Green Plains consent to any settlement or
compromise shall not be required if the settlement is consistent with the
positions previously taken by Global Ethanol and does not have the effect of
increasing the Tax liability of Global Ethanol, Green Plains, or any
affiliate of Green Plains for any Tax period (or any portion thereof) ending
after the Closing Date. The Sellers Representative shall have the right to be
present at and participate in any Tax proceeding for Tax periods or portions
thereof beginning after the Closing Date and to approve (not to be
unreasonably withheld) the disposition thereof if such disposition would
increase the liability for Taxes of any Global Ethanol Member under this
Agreement or to any taxing authority.

(d) The Parties hereto further agree, upon request from the other
party, to use their commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any governmental authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could
be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby).

 

(e) Except as provided herein, the Global Ethanol Members shall
be entitled to any refund of Income Taxes (but not, for the avoidance of
doubt, any other Taxes) of Global Ethanol or pertaining to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, and Green Plains or its affiliate, as applicable, shall pay over to
the Sellers Representative the amount of such refunds within 5 business days
following the receipt of such refund.

 

(f) The Parties agree that the Merger Consideration, for
tax purposes, shall be allocated as mutually agreed to by the parties as soon
as practical following the Closing. No Party shall take any position on any
return, declaration, report or information return or statement relating to
Taxes inconsistent with such allocation, unless so required by Applicable
Law.

Section 10.6 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware; _provided,
however_ , that the laws of the state of Iowa shall govern the relative
rights, obligations, powers, duties, and other internal affairs of Green
Plains and its board of directors.

 

Section 10.7 Jurisdiction and Venue. Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees
that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or related to this
Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof
brought by any other Party hereto or its successors or assigns may be brought
and determined in the state or federal courts located in New Castle County,
Delaware, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its
property, unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (and agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating
thereto except in such courts). Each of the Parties agrees further to accept
service of process in any manner permitted by such court. Each of the parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by
way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-referenced courts for any reason other than the
failure lawfully to serve process, (b) that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of such courts or from any legal process commenced
therein, and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by law, that (i) the suit,
action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii)
the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper, or (iii) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
court. The exclusive choice of forum set forth herein shall not be deemed to
preclude the enforcement of any judgment obtained in such forum or the taking
of any action under this Agreement to enforce such judgment in any appropriate
jurisdiction.

 

Section 10.8 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in

accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the state or federal courts
located in New Castle County, Delaware, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.

Section 10.9 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or

other situation or in any other jurisdiction.

Section 10.10 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
annexes, and schedules referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement
among the Parties and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements, or
representations by or among the Parties, written or oral, to the extent they

and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires
otherwise. The word "including" shall mean including without limitation.

Section 10.12 Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. 

Section 10.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by means of facsimile or electronic mail with scanned
attachment), each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
