consent has not been obtained in accordance with this Agreement and (ii)

related Tax costs (which shall be reduced by any related Tax benefits) imposed
on Seller or any of its Affiliates (except for any such Tax costs that are
Excluded Taxes)) with respect to the asset, claim or right with respect to

no liability whatsoever to Purchaser arising out of or relating to the failure
to obtain any consent that may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or because of any circumstances arising
therefrom unless on account of a breach or inaccuracy of any of the
representations and warranties set forth in Article 4 or Section 13.1 and (ii)
Purchaser shall not consider or deem any covenant of Seller breached as a

 **3.3** **Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment**

 



 

(a) **The Closing Statement**

 



 

Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to
Purchaser a statement (the **Closing Statement** ), setting forth the book
value of the Transferred Inventory (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
exclude the value of any obsolete Inventory) as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing
Date (the **Closing Inventory** ) calculated in accordance with the
principles, practices, methodologies and policies set forth in Section 3.3(a)
of the Disclosure Schedule (the **Accounting Principles** ), whether or not
doing so is in accordance with IAS. After the Closing Date, at Sellers
request, Purchaser shall assist Seller and its representatives in the
preparation of the Closing Statement and shall provide Seller and its
representatives any information reasonably requested and shall provide them
access at all reasonable times to the personnel, properties, books and records
of Purchaser for such purpose.

 



 

(b) **Objections**

 



 

Unless Purchaser provides Seller with a Notice of Objection within 30 days
after Sellers delivery of the Closing Statement, the Closing Statement will
become final and binding at the end of such 30-day period. During such 30-day
period, Seller shall permit Purchaser and its representatives to review its
working papers relating to the Closing Statement and shall be granted
reasonable access to appropriate personnel of Seller responsible for preparing
the Closing Statement. Any Notice of Objection must specify in reasonable
detail the basis for the objections set forth therein. Any Notice of Objection
must include only objections based on (i) mathematical errors in the

 



      
 

 



 

computation of Closing Inventory or (ii) Closing Inventory not having been
calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles.

 



 

(c) **Resolution of Disputes**

 



 

If Purchaser provides the Notice of Objection to Seller within such 30-day
period, Purchaser and Seller shall, during the 30-day period following
Sellers receipt of the Notice of Objection, attempt in good faith to resolve
Purchasers objections. During such 30-day period, Purchaser and Purchasers
accountants shall permit Seller and its representatives to review the working
papers of Purchaser and Purchasers accountants relating to the Notice of
Objection and the basis therefor and shall be granted reasonable access to
appropriate personnel of Purchaser responsible for preparing such Notice of
Objection. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve all such objections
within such 30-day period, the parties shall submit the matters remaining in
dispute to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or, if such firm declines to act, to
another nationally recognized public accounting firm mutually agreed upon by
Purchaser and Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , if Purchaser and Seller are
unable to agree on a firm within 10 days after the end of such 30-day period,
then Purchaser and Seller shall each designate a firm and such designated
firms shall jointly select a third nationally recognized firm to resolve the
disputed matters (such selected firm being the **Independent Expert** ). The
parties shall instruct the Independent Expert to render its reasoned written
decision as promptly as practicable but in no event later than 60 days after
its engagement. The Independent Expert shall only decide the specific items
under dispute by the parties and its decision shall be within the range of
values assigned to each disputed item in the Closing Statement and the Notice
of Objection, respectively. The resolution of disputed items by the
Independent Expert will be final and binding, and the determination of the
Independent Expert will constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding
and non-appealable and upon which a Judgment may be entered by a court having
jurisdiction thereover. The cost of any determination (including the fees and
expenses of the Independent Expert and reasonable attorney fees and expenses
of the parties) pursuant to this Section 3.3 shall be borne by Seller and
Purchaser in inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the
Independent Expert, which proportionate allocations shall also be determined
by the Independent Expert at the time the determination of the Independent
Expert is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. Other than the fees
and expenses referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, the fees and
disbursements of Purchasers accountants shall be borne by Purchaser and the
fees and disbursements of Sellers accountants shall be borne by Seller.

 



 

(d) **Adjustment Payment**

 



 

Within 10 days after both the Closing Statement has become final and binding
and the Adjusted Purchase Price has been finally determined in accordance with
this Section 3.3 (the **Final Purchase Price** ), (i) if the Closing Date
Payment is less than the Final Purchase Price, Purchaser shall pay to Seller
an amount equal to such difference, plus simple interest thereon at a rate of
3% per annum for each day from the Closing Date to the date payment is made in
full and (ii) if the Closing Date Payment is greater than the Final Purchase
Price, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to such difference, plus
simple interest thereon at a rate of 3% per annum for each day from the
Closing Date to the date payment is made in full. Any such payment hereunder
must be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) **Post-Closing Books and Records**

 



 

Except for the consummation of the Closing and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall conduct the
Business on the Closing Date itself in the ordinary course in a manner
substantially consistent with past practice. Following the Closing and until
the Closing Statement has become final and binding pursuant to this Section
3.3, Purchaser shall maintain the accounting books and records of the Business
on which the Closing Statement is to be based.

qualified as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction in which the character of its owned, operated or leased
properties or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary,
other than where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **4.2** **Authority, Execution and Delivery; Enforceability**

 



 

(a) Seller has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is, or is specified to be,

Agreement and such Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

(b) Seller has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and prior to the
Closing will have duly executed and delivered each Ancillary Agreement to
which it is, or is specified to be, a party, and this Agreement constitutes,
and each Ancillary Agreement to which it is, or is specified to be, a party
will, upon execution and delivery constitute, its legal, valid and binding
obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject, as
to enforceability, to the effect of any applicable Laws relating to
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or
preferential transfer or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors
rights generally and to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless
of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

consummation of the transactions contemplated to be consummated by it by this
Agreement and such Ancillary Agreements will not, conflict with or result in
any breach of or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any
Lien (other than Permitted Liens or Liens caused by Purchaser) upon any of the
Transferred Assets under, any provision of (i) its certificate of
incorporation or by-laws, (ii) any material Contract to which Seller is a
party or by which any of the Transferred Assets is bound, or (iii) any
material Judgment or applicable Law applicable to Seller or any of the
Transferred Assets, other than, in the case of clause (ii) above only, any
such items that would not reasonably be expected to materially and adversely
affect the Business or the Transferred Assets, taken as a whole.

 



 

(b) No consent, approval or authorization of, or registration, declaration or
filing with, any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or
with respect to Seller in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the Acquisition, other

applicable Law relating to competition where clearance is required prior to
the Closing and (ii) those that may be required solely by reason of
Purchasers (as opposed to any other third partys) participation in the
Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby and by the
Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

 **4.4** **Financial Statements; Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities**

 



 

(a) Section 4.4(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth the Financial
Statements. Except for adjustments necessary to present the Financial
Statements on a standalone basis for the Business or as otherwise disclosed in
the notes to the Financial Statements, the Financial Statements were prepared
in accordance with the historical management accounting principles, practices,

than Permitted Liens.

 



 

(b) The Transferred Equipment is in reasonably good repair and operating
condition (giving due account to ordinary wear and tear) and is reasonably
adequate and suitable for its present uses.

fees related to the registered Transferred Intellectual Property that are
currently due have been paid to, and all documents required for the purpose of
registering, maintaining and renewing the registered Transferred Intellectual
Property have been filed with, the relevant Governmental Entities. No
Transferred Intellectual Property is now subject to any interference, reissue,
reexamination, opposition or cancellation proceeding and, to the Knowledge of
Seller, no such action is or has been threatened with respect to any of the
material Transferred Intellectual Property. Seller is the owner of, or has the
right to use, the Transferred Intellectual Property free and clear of all
Liens, other than Permitted Liens. The unexpired Transferred Intellectual
Property is all the intellectual property that is necessary for the conduct of
the Business. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Seller does not make any
representations or warranties relating to the trademark registrations and
applications included in the Transferred Intellectual Property in
jurisdictions other than those set forth in Section 2.2(a)(vi) of the
Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(b) Seller has not granted any license of any kind relating to any material
Transferred Technology, except incidental, nonexclusive licenses to end-users,
customers or third parties providing services to Seller in the ordinary course
of business (including to co-packers, manufacturers, retailers, merchandisers
and distributors). Seller is not bound by or a party to any material option,
license or similar Contract relating to any machinery, equipment or computer
software of any other person for use in the conduct of the Business, except
(i) for nonexclusive licenses to machinery and equipment in the ordinary
course of business and (ii) for so-called "shrink-wrap" and other non-
customized license agreements relating to computer software licensed to Seller
in the ordinary course of business.

 



 

(c) To the Knowledge of Seller, no material claims have been made or
threatened since January 1, 2014, against Seller by any person (i) claiming
that use of the Transferred Intellectual Property or Transferred Technology
infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates the intellectual property
rights of any such person or (ii) challenging the validity, enforceability or
ownership or use of any Transferred Intellectual Property or trade secrets
included in the Transferred Technology (including cease and desist letters or
invitations to take a license). No claims are pending or, to the Knowledge of
Seller, threatened, as of the date of this Agreement against Seller by any
person claiming that use of the Transferred Intellectual Property or
Transferred Technology as presently used infringes the intellectual property
rights of any such person, other than pending or threatened claims that would
not reasonably be expected to result in a Business Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The operation of the Business as currently conducted by Seller does not
infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate (i) any patent, trademark,
trade name, domain name or copyright (excluding source code) of any person,
which is the subject of a registration, and (ii) to the Knowledge of Seller,
any other intellectual property of any person. To the Knowledge of Seller, no
third party is infringing or has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
violated any of the material Transferred Intellectual Property or trade
secrets in the Transferred Technology.

the use of any material Transferred Intellectual Property. Other than (i)
rights in connection with co-packing arrangements and (ii) cross-promotional

to or bound by any material license, sublicense, option or similar Contract
relating in whole or in part to the Transferred Intellectual Property.

 



 

(f) Seller is in compliance in all material respects with any posted privacy
policies, any applicable Laws and, to the Knowledge of Seller, contractual
commitments relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable
information in connection with the Business that is regulated or protected by
Law. Seller has taken commercially reasonable steps to protect all material
Transferred Intellectual Property and Transferred Technology from viruses,
worms, trojan horses and other malicious bugs or contaminants, including to
preserve the confidentiality of any material Transferred Technology. There has
been no loss of, or unauthorized access, use, disclosure or modification of
any Transferred Technology, except as would not reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect the Business or the Transferred Assets, taken
as a whole, and that would not require Seller to notify customers or employees
of such loss, access, use, disclosure or modification.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding any other representation or warranty in this Article 4,
the representations and warranties in this Section 4.6 and Sections 4.8(a)(v)
and 4.20 constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of
Seller hereunder with respect to intellectual property matters.

Lease is valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect, and Seller
enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession of the Leased Real Property; (ii)
Seller has not received nor given any notice of any default or event that with
notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default by Seller under
the Transferred Lease and, to the Knowledge of Seller, no other party is in
default thereof; (iii) Seller has not subleased or assigned or otherwise
granted to any person the right to use or occupy such Leased Real Property or
any portion thereof; and (iv) Seller has not pledged, mortgaged or otherwise
granted a Lien on

 



      
 

 



 

its leasehold interest in the Leased Real Property that remains in effect,
other than Permitted Liens.

engaged in (or is treated as engaged in due to prior activities) a trade or
business through a "permanent establishment" within the meaning of an
applicable income Tax treaty in any jurisdiction other than the United States
in connection with the Transferred Assets, the Business or the conduct of the
Business.

Ancillary Agreements and (iv) those the failure of which to obtain or make
would not reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **5.4** **Proceedings**

 



 

There are no (a) outstanding Judgments against Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries, (b) Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Purchaser,
threatened against Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or (c) investigations
by any Governmental Entity that are pending or, to the knowledge of Purchaser,
threatened against Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries that, in any such case
of clauses (a), (b) and (c), would reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **5.5** **Availability of Funds; Solvency**

 



 

(a) Purchaser has (or at the Closing will have) cash available or has existing
borrowing facilities which together are sufficient to enable it to consummate
the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

(b) As of the Closing and immediately after consummating the Acquisition and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
Seller set forth in this Agreement, Purchaser will not (i) be insolvent
(either because its financial condition is such that the sum of its debts is
greater than the fair value of its assets (including both tangible and
intangible assets) or because the present fair salable value of its assets
(including both tangible and intangible assets) will be less than the amount
required to pay its probable liability on its debts as they become absolute
and matured), (ii) have unreasonably small capital with which to engage in its
business, including the Business, or (iii) have incurred or plan to incur
debts beyond its ability to repay such debts as they become absolute and
matured.

 



 

(c) None of the funds paid by Purchaser to Seller pursuant to this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement will (i) be derived from or related to any activity
that is deemed criminal or subject to sanctions under applicable Law or (ii)
cause Seller to be in violation of any applicable Law, including in each case
the United States Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, the United States Money Laundering
Control Act of 1986, the United States International Money Laundering
Abatement and Anti Terrorist Financing Act of 2001, or any sanctions
administered by any Governmental Entity.

Purchaser represents, as to itself and its Affiliates, that no agent, broker,
investment banker or other firm or person is or will be entitled to any
brokers or finders fee or any other commission or similar fee in connection
with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **6.** **COVENANTS**

 



 

 **6.1** **Covenants Relating to Conduct of the Business**

Date, Seller shall conduct the Business in all material respects in the
ordinary course consistent with past practice and use commercially reasonable
efforts to preserve the business relationships with customers, suppliers,
distributors and others with whom Seller deals with in connection with the
conduct of the Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain relationships
with Seller and its Affiliates providing services to the Business will
terminate as of the Closing as contemplated in Section 11.4 and such
termination shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement. In addition,
except as set forth in Section 6.1 of the Disclosure Schedule or otherwise
expressly contemplated by the terms of this Agreement, Seller shall not do any
of the following in connection with the Business from the date of this
Agreement to the Closing Date without the prior written consent of Purchaser
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed):

 



 

(i) subject any of the Transferred Assets to any Lien other than Permitted
Liens;

 



 

(ii) waive any claims or rights of material value that relate primarily to the
Business or the Transferred Assets;

Transferred Asset, except (A) Inventory and obsolete or excess Equipment sold

business consistent with past practice that do not exceed $100,000 in the
aggregate;

 



 

(iv) fail to maintain in any material respect any Transferred Trademarks,
Transferred Patents, Other Transferred Intellectual Property or Transferred
Technology or grant any person a license in respect of any Transferred
Intellectual Property or Transferred Technology, in each case other than in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;

 



 

(v) other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, fail to pay or otherwise satisfy (except if being contested in good
faith) any material accounts payable, liabilities or obligations of the
Business when due and payable;

 



 

(vi) enter into any new Contract that would be a Transferred Contract, except

business;

 



 

(viii) incur or assume any liabilities, obligations or indebtedness for
borrowed money exclusively of the Business or guarantee any such liabilities,
obligations or indebtedness, other than in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice;

 **6.2** **Access to Information**

 



 

Seller shall as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 30 days
after the date of this Agreement, use its commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver to Purchaser copies of all Transferred Contracts not heretofore made
available to Purchaser. Seller shall afford to Purchaser and its accountants,
counsel and other representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable prior
notice during normal business hours during the period prior to the Closing, to
personnel, properties, books, Contracts, commitments and records relating to
the Business (other than the Excluded Assets), including Product cost sheets,
price lists and Product lists by SKU and location; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in each case such access is in compliance with applicable Law and does
not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of Seller relating to the
Business. Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be obligated by
anything contained in this Section 6.2 to breach any duty of confidentiality
owed to any person whether such duty arises contractually, statutorily or
otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Purchaser may not conduct any sampling, testing or other intrusive indoor or
outdoor investigation at or in connection with the Transferred Real Property
prior to the Closing without Sellers prior written consent.

 



 

 **6.3** **Confidentiality**

 



 

Purchaser acknowledges that the information being provided to it in connection
with the Acquisition and the consummation of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements is subject to the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated
herein by reference. Effective upon the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement
will terminate with respect to information relating solely to the Business
(other than information relating to the Excluded Assets and the personnel
engaged in the conduct of the Business); _provided_ , _however_ , that
Purchaser acknowledges that any and all other information provided to it by
Seller or Sellers representatives concerning Seller and its Affiliates shall
remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement
after the Closing Date.

 



 

 **6.4** **Regulatory Authorizations; Reasonable Best Efforts**

 



 

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
Seller and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and in any event prior to the date
set forth in Section 8.1(a)(iv), including taking any and all reasonable
actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be
imposed on it or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Closing. Each of
Seller and Purchaser shall promptly cooperate with the reasonable requests of
the other party in seeking to satisfy any such legal

 



      
 

 



 

requirements imposed by any Governmental Entity. Seller and Purchaser shall
coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information
and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing.

 



 

(b) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall (i) as promptly as practicable, but in
no event later than 10 Business Days following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, file or cause to be filed with the FTC and the DOJ the
notification and report form required for the transactions contemplated hereby
and (ii) as promptly as practicable, (A) file or cause to be filed any
supplemental information requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR
Act, (B) make such other filings as are necessary in other jurisdictions in
order to comply with all applicable Laws relating to competition and (C)
provide any supplemental information requested by applicable Governmental
Entities relating thereto. Any such filing, notification and report form and
supplemental information shall be in substantial compliance with the
requirements of the HSR Act or such other applicable Law. Each of Seller and
Purchaser shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any
filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act or such other
applicable Law. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall not, without the consent of
the other party, (x) cause any such filing or other submission applicable to
it to be withdrawn or re-filed for any reason or (y) consent or agree to any
voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any
voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements at the behest of any Governmental
Entity. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall have responsibility for one-half of
all filing fees associated with the HSR Act filings and any other similar
filings required under applicable Law required in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

(c) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall (i) promptly notify the other party of
any oral or written communications with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ and any other applicable
Governmental Entity with respect to the acquisition of the Transferred Assets
or the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, (ii) permit the other party to review in advance any communication
proposed to be made to any such Governmental Entity and (iii) provide the
other party with copies of all correspondence, filings or other communications
between the party and its representatives, on the one hand, and any such
Governmental Entity on the other hand, with respect to the foregoing. Neither
Seller nor Purchaser shall agree to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any such filing, investigation or inquiry
unless and until it consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, permits the other party to
attend and participate at such meeting.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Seller and
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1(a) as promptly as practicable.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing
shall require Purchaser to take any action that will require, or be deemed to
require, Seller or Purchaser to take any action described in this Section
6.4(d) that could reasonably be expected to have or result in a Material
Adverse Impact, including any Material Adverse Impact that would result from
(i) disposing or transferring any asset, including those of Seller or
Purchaser; (ii) licensing or otherwise making available to any person, any
technology or other intellectual property of Seller or Purchaser; (iii)
holding separate any assets or operations (either before or after the Closing
Date) of Seller or Purchaser; or (iv) changing or modifying any course of
conduct or otherwise making any commitment (to any Governmental Entity or
otherwise)

 



      
 

 



 

regarding future operations of Seller or Purchasers business to obtain any
approval from any Governmental Entity or to prevent the initiation of any
Proceeding by any Governmental Entity under the HSR Act or Other Antitrust
Regulations or to prevent the entry of any Judgment (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that would otherwise make this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby unlawful.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Purchaser shall not be obligated to defend any Proceeding instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of the HSR Act or Other Antitrust Regulations, or if
any Judgment is entered, enforced or attempted to be entered or enforced by a
court or other Governmental Entity, which Judgment would make the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement illegal or would otherwise prohibit, prevent,
restrict, impair or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, Purchaser is not required to take any action to contest or resist any
such Proceeding or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any such
Judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and
that prohibits, prevents or restricts the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or to have such Judgment repealed, rescinded,
or made inapplicable so as to permit the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

 **6.5** **No Solicitation**

 



 

Seller has been in negotiations with other parties concerning a possible sale
of the Business and such other parties have obtained certain information
relating thereto. Seller agrees to immediately terminate, and to cause its
Affiliates, representatives, agents, officers, employees, attorneys and
accountants to terminate, all existing negotiations or activities concerning a
possible sale of the Business with any party other than Purchaser, its
Affiliates and its and their respective representatives. Seller shall not, and
shall not authorize, permit or direct any of its Affiliates or any of its or
their respective representatives to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit the
submission of proposals, inquiries or offers, (b) enter into discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any confidential information to, any person, or
(c) enter into any agreement or agreement in principle, in each case in
connection with any divestiture or similar transaction involving the Business
(other than, with respect to Purchaser or its Affiliates, the Acquisition) or
the Transferred Assets (other than Inventory and obsolete equipment) in each
case in the ordinary course of business or, with respect to Purchaser or its
Affiliates, the Acquisition.

 



 

 **6.6** **Employees**

 



 

(a) **Continuation of Employment**

 



 

(i) The Business Employees will remain in employment with Seller under their
current terms and conditions of employment pursuant to the Employee Services
Agreement during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the
Employee Transfer Date. Effective as of the Employee Transfer Date, Purchaser
shall offer employment in accordance with this Section 6.6 (A) to each Active
Employee effective as of the Employee Transfer Date and (B) with respect to
each Business Employee who is not an Active Employee because such Business
Employee is on an authorized leave of absence on the Employee Transfer Date,
to such Business Employee effective as of the date on which such Business
Employee presents himself or herself to Purchaser for active employment upon
such Business Employees return from such authorized leave of absence within
12 months following the Closing Date (or, if later, to the same extent, if

 



      
 

 



 

any, as Seller or its Affiliates would be required to re-employ such Business
Employee in accordance with applicable Law or the Ankeny Collective Bargaining
Agreement) (each Business Employee who accepts Purchasers offer of employment
pursuant to this Section 6.6(a) is referred to herein as a **Transferred
Employee** ). Nothing herein shall constitute a representation or guarantee by
Seller that any or all of the Business Employees shall accept the offer of
employment from Purchaser.

 



 

(ii) Except as specifically provided for in this Section 6.6, Purchaser shall
be solely responsible for all employment and employee-benefit related matters
and all obligations, liabilities and commitments in respect thereof that are
earned and payable with respect to any Transferred Employee and that arise out
of or relate to the employment or service provider relationship between
Purchaser or its Affiliates and any such individual on or after the Employee
Transfer Date.

 



 

(iii) From the Employee Transfer Date until the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide each
Transferred Employee with (A) base compensation that is not less than the base
compensation paid to such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date, (B) cash bonus opportunities under annual, long-term and other
bonus and incentive plans that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
cash bonus opportunities provided to such Transferred Employee immediately
prior to the Closing Date and (C) employee benefits (other than equity
compensation) that are no less favorable than the employee benefits (other
than equity compensation) provided to similarly situated employees of
Purchaser.

 



 

(b) **Credit for Prior Plans**

 



 

On and after the Employee Transfer Date, Purchaser shall give each Transferred
Employee full credit for all purposes (including for purposes of eligibility
to participate, level of benefits and vesting) under any employee benefit
plans or arrangements (except for purposes of (i) benefit accrual under
defined benefit plans, other than as provided in Section 6.6(f), and (ii)
equity incentive plans) maintained by Purchaser and its Affiliates for such
Transferred Employees service with Seller (and with any predecessor employer)
to the same extent recognized by Seller immediately prior to the Employee
Transfer Date.

 



 

(c) **Severance**

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser
shall provide each Transferred Employee whose employment is terminated by
Purchaser or its Affiliates during the 12-month period immediately following
the Employee Transfer Date with severance benefits (taking into account for
such purpose such Transferred Employees service and compensation with Seller
prior to the Employee Transfer Date and any additional service and
compensation with Purchaser from and after the Employee Transfer Date) that
are comparable to those provided to Business Employees pursuant to Sellers
severance plan set forth in Section 6.6(c)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule.
Seller and Purchaser intend that each Transferred Employee will be deemed to
have continuous and uninterrupted employment immediately before and
immediately after the Employee Transfer Date for purposes of any severance
benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of Seller. For the
avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall have no obligation to provide severance
benefits to any Business Employee who is not a Transferred Employee.

 



       
 

 



 

(ii) Purchaser shall assume and be solely responsible for all obligations,
liabilities and commitments in respect of Transferred Employees under the
severance benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements and arrangements of
Seller in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date and set forth in
Section 6.6(c)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule in respect of claims made by any
Business Employees for severance or other separation benefits that are
directly attributable to Purchasers failure to offer employment to any
Business Employee in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Seller shall
remain responsible for all obligations, liabilities and commitments in respect
of Business Employees (other than Transferred Employees) under the severance
benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements and arrangements of Seller in
effect immediately prior to the Employee Transfer Date in respect of claims
made by any Business Employees for severance or other separation benefits
(including claims for wrongful dismissal, notice of termination of employment
or pay in lieu of notice) arising out of, relating to or in connection with
(A) any Business Employee who declines Purchasers offer of employment;
_provided_ , _however_ , such offer is made in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, and (B) Sellers termination of employment of any Business
Employee on or prior to the Employee Transfer Date.

 



 

(d) **Tax-Qualified Savings Plans**

 



 

(i) Not later than the Employee Transfer Date, Purchaser shall establish or
maintain, or cause to be established or maintained, a defined contribution
plan (or plans) that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within
the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code, which is qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code and the trust which is a part of such plan must be exempt
from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code ( **Purchaser s 401(k) Plan**), on
terms no less favorable than those provided to Transferred Employees pursuant
to Sellers 401(k) Plans. Purchaser shall cause each Transferred Employee to
be a participant in Purchasers 401(k) Plan as soon as reasonably feasible
following the Employee Transfer Date.

 



 

(ii) Not later than 60 days following the Employee Transfer Date, Seller shall
cause the transfer of an amount of cash equal to the full account balance
(including promissory notes evidencing all outstanding loans and subject to
any qualified domestic relations orders) as of the valuation date immediately
before the actual date of transfer for each Transferred Employee participating
in Sellers 401(k) Plans immediately prior to the Employee Transfer Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not transfer any assets until such
time as Seller has been provided evidence reasonably satisfactory to Seller
that Purchaser has established or maintains a trust as part of Purchasers
401(k) Plan and that Purchasers 401(k) Plan satisfies the requirements for a
qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code and that such trust is exempt
from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code.

 



 

(e) **Tax-Qualified Pension Plans**

 



 

(i) As soon as reasonably feasible following the Employee Transfer Date,
Purchaser shall establish or maintain, or cause to be established or
maintained, a defined benefit pension plan (the **Purchaser s Pension Plan**)
for the benefit of each current or former employee of the Business identified
on Section 6.6(e) of the Disclosure Schedule who participates in Sellers
Pension Plan immediately prior to the Employee Transfer Date (the **Current
Participants** ), which is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and the
trust which is

 



      
 

 



 

a part of such plan must be exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code.
Purchasers Pension Plan and such plans trust (and any successor to such plan
or trust) must provide in accordance with applicable Law that (A) assets
transferred to Purchasers Pension Plan from the Sellers Pension Plan be held
by the Purchasers Pension Plan trust for the exclusive benefit of the
participants in such plan, (B) the accrued benefits as of the Employee
Transfer Date of each Current Participant not be decreased by amendment or
otherwise and (C) each Current Participant has the right to receive his or her
benefit accrued through the Employee Transfer Date under the Sellers Pension
Plan in any optional form provided under the Sellers Pension Plan.

 



 

(ii) Seller shall cause the transfer of an amount of cash equal to the Pension
Transfer Amount (as defined below) from the Sellers Pension Plan to
Purchasers Pension Plan, but not later than 90 days following the Employee
Transfer Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not transfer any
assets until such time as (A) Seller has been provided evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Seller that Purchaser has established a trust as part of
Purchasers Pension Plan and that Purchasers Pension Plan satisfies the
requirements for a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code and that
such trust is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code, and (B) 30
days have elapsed from the filing of Form 5310-A with respect to the transfer.
Sellers actuary shall be responsible for the required actuarial certification
under Section 414(1) of the Code. Upon the transfer of such assets, Purchaser
shall cause Purchasers Pension Plan to assume all liabilities and obligations
with respect to the accrued benefits of the Current Participants accrued prior
to the Employee Transfer Date under Sellers Pension Plan.

 



 

(iii) As used herein, the term **Pension Transfer Amount** means an amount of
cash equal to the portion of assets in the Sellers Pension Plan allocable to
the Current Participants as calculated in accordance with Section 414(l) of
the Code and the related regulations (including the safe harbor PBGC
assumptions and methodologies as of the Employee Transfer Date) to the extent
necessary for any governmental approval (including the IRS and the PBGC) and
to satisfy Section 414(l) of the Code and the related regulations as well as
Section 4044 of ERISA and the related regulations. The Pension Transfer Amount
shall be adjusted to reflect an investment return for the period from the
Employee Transfer Date to the date of the transfer of assets that is equal to
the average rate of the 90-day Treasury bill on the auction date coincident
with the first day of the calendar month in which the transfer occurs or, if
there is no auction on such date, on the next immediately preceding auction
date, and shall be decreased by any benefit payments made under the Sellers
Pension Plan during such period to Current Participants.

 



 

(iv) The amount of the Pension Transfer Amount shall be determined by an
enrolled actuary designated by Seller, and Seller shall provide any actuary
designated by Purchaser with information reasonably necessary to review any
calculations made under Section 4044 of ERISA in all material respects to
verify that such calculations have been performed in a manner consistent with
the terms of this Agreement. If there is a good faith dispute between Sellers
actuary and Purchasers actuary as to the Pension Transfer Amount and such
dispute remains unresolved for 30 days, Seller and Purchaser shall select and
appoint a third actuary who is mutually satisfactory to both Seller and
Purchaser. The reasoned written decision of such third party actuary shall be
rendered within 30 days and shall be conclusive as to any dispute for which
such actuary was appointed. The cost of

 



      
 

 



 

such third party actuary shall be divided equally between Seller and
Purchaser. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall be responsible for the cost of
its own actuary.

 



 

(v) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to qualify Purchasers
Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, and Seller and Purchaser shall
reasonably cooperate to make any and all filings and submissions to the
appropriate Governmental Entities required to be made by Seller or Purchaser
as are appropriate in effectuating the provisions of this Section 6.6(e).

 



 

(f) **Certain Welfare Benefits Matters**

 



 

(i) With respect to the Purchaser Welfare Plans, Purchaser shall take all
reasonably practicable steps to (A) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods and actively-at-work requirements
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
Transferred Employees and their dependents under such Purchaser Welfare Plans
to the extent satisfied under the applicable corresponding Seller Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Employee Transfer Date and (B) provide each
Transferred Employee and his or her eligible dependents with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Employee Transfer Date in the
plan year in which the Employee Transfer Date occurs for purposes of
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any
such Purchaser Welfare Plans in which the Transferred Employees participate.

 



 

(ii) Seller shall be responsible in accordance with its applicable welfare
plans (and the applicable welfare plans of its Affiliates) in effect prior to
the Employee Transfer Date for all reimbursement claims (such as medical and
dental claims) for expenses incurred, and for all non-reimbursement claims
(such as life insurance claims) incurred, under such plans prior to the
Employee Transfer Date by Transferred Employees and their dependents.
Purchaser shall be responsible in accordance with the applicable welfare plans
of Purchaser and its Affiliates for all reimbursement claims (such as medical
and dental claims) for expenses incurred, and for all non-reimbursement claims
(such as life insurance claims) incurred, on or after the Employee Transfer
Date by Transferred Employees and their dependents. For purposes of this
Section 6.6(f)(ii), a claim will be deemed to have been incurred on (A) the
date of death or dismemberment in the case of claims under life insurance and
accidental death and dismemberment policies, (B) the date of disability in the
case of claims under disability policies, or (C) the date on which the charge
or expense giving rise to such claim is incurred (without regard to the date
of inception of the related illness or injury or the date of submission of a
claim related thereto) in the case of all other claims.

 



 

(iii) Effective as of the Employee Transfer Date, Purchaser shall assume all
liabilities and obligations of Seller to Transferred Employees and their
eligible dependents, in respect of health insurance under COBRA, the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and applicable state Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall remain obligated to provide any
applicable COBRA notices in respect of events occurring on or prior to the
Employee Transfer Date.

 



 

(iv) Seller shall be responsible for all claims for workers compensation
benefits which are incurred prior to the Employee Transfer Date by Transferred
Employees that are payable under the terms and conditions of Sellers workers
compensation programs. Purchaser

 



      
 

 



 

shall cause its workers compensation program to be responsible for all claims
for benefits which are incurred from and after the Employee Transfer Date by
Transferred Employees that are payable under the terms and conditions of
Purchasers workers compensation program, including with respect to
Transferred Employees who became eligible for workers compensation benefits
prior to the Employee Transfer Date. If the Workers Compensation Event occurs
over a period both preceding and following the Employee Transfer Date, the
claim shall be the joint responsibility and liability of Seller and Purchaser
and shall be equitably apportioned between Seller, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand, based upon the relevant periods of time that the
Workers Compensation Event transpired preceding and following the Employee
Transfer Date.

 



 

(g) **Collectively Bargained Employees**

 



 

Purchaser agrees to assume the liabilities and obligations of Seller set forth
in the Ankeny Collective Bargaining Agreement effective on the Employee
Transfer Date and, if necessary to effect such assumption, to accept an
assignment of all or a portion of such liabilities and obligations. Prior to
the Employee Transfer Date, Seller shall provide the Union with all required
notices relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall
comply with and discharge all of Sellers bargaining obligations with respect
to the Union relating to such transactions.

 



 

(h) **Accrued Vacation**

 



 

For purposes of determining the number of vacation days to which each
Transferred Employee will be entitled following the Employee Transfer Date,
Purchaser shall assume and honor all vacation days accrued or earned but not
yet taken by such Transferred Employee as of the Employee Transfer Date. To
the extent that a Transferred Employee is entitled under any applicable Law,
the Ankeny Collective Bargaining Agreement or any policy of Seller to be paid
for any vacation days accrued or earned but not yet taken by such Transferred
Employee as of the Employee Transfer Date, Seller shall discharge the
liability for such vacation days.

 



 

(i) **WARN Act**

 



 

Provided that, no later than the Employee Transfer Date, Seller provides to
Purchaser a complete and accurate list of all employment losses (as defined in
the WARN Act) by all Business Employees occurring within 90 days of the
Employee Transfer Date, Purchaser agrees to provide any required notice under
the WARN Act and to otherwise comply with any such applicable Law with respect
to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) or group
termination or similar event affecting Business Employees (including as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
and occurring on or after the Employee Transfer Date. Purchaser shall not take
any action after the Employee Transfer Date that would cause any termination
of employment of any employees by Seller that occurs on or before the Employee
Transfer Date to constitute a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" or group

 **9.4** **Indemnification Procedures**

 



 

(a) **Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Third Party Claims**

 



 

If any party (the **Indemnified Party** ) receives written notice of the
commencement of any Proceeding or the assertion of any claim by a third party
or the imposition of any penalty or assessment for which indemnity may be
sought under Section 9.2 or 9.3 (a **Third Party Claim** ), and such
Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity pursuant to this Article 9, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly provide the other party (the **Indemnifying
Party** ) with written notice of such Third Party Claim, stating the nature,
basis and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies of the
relevant documents evidencing such Third Party Claim and the basis for
indemnification sought. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its obligations under this
Article 9, except if and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have 45 days from receipt of
any such notice of a Third Party Claim to give notice of its intent to assume
the defense thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party
shall not be entitled to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim that seeks
the imposition of criminal penalties or other sanctions that would be
reasonably expected to materially and adversely affect the Business or the
Transferred Assets, taken as a whole. If notice to the effect set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence is given by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of the
Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice,
which counsel must be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. So long
as the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in
accordance herewith and is fulfilling its obligations with respect thereto,
(i) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and
expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim,

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) the Indemnified Party shall not file any papers or consent to the entry
of any Judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party and (iii)
the Indemnifying Party shall not (A) admit to any wrongdoing or (B) consent to
the entry of any Judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the
Third Party Claim, in each case, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (such written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). The parties shall use reasonable best efforts to
minimize Losses from Third Party Claims and shall act in good faith in
responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with such
claims. The parties shall also cooperate in any such defense and give each
other reasonable access to all information relevant thereto. Whether or not
the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder for any
settlement entered into or any Judgment that was consented to without the
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent.

 



 

(b) **Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims**

 



 

The Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing promptly
of its discovery of any matter that does not involve a Third Party Claim being
asserted against or sought to be collected from the Indemnified Party if the
Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity with respect to such matter
pursuant to this Article 9\. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such
notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its obligations under
this Article 9, except if and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have 60 days from
receipt of any such notice to give notice of dispute of the claim to the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate and assist
the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity
by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such
assistance and cooperation shall include providing reasonable access, in a
manner that does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operation of the business
of the Indemnified Party, to and copies of information, records and documents
relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the investigation,
defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and business
assistance with respect to such matters.

 



 

 **9.5** **Limits on Indemnification**

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 9, Seller and
Purchaser acknowledge and agree:

 



 

(i) Seller shall not be liable for any Losses suffered by any Purchaser
Indemnitee and Purchaser shall not be liable for any Losses suffered by any
Seller Indemnitee, in each case to the extent arising or resulting from a
breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty herein of Seller,
Purchaser, Seller Parent or Purchaser Parent, as applicable, unless
Proceedings with respect to a claim therefor are initiated within the
applicable survival period set forth in Section 9.1, failing which such claim
shall be deemed waived and extinguished;

 



 

(ii) Seller shall not be liable pursuant to Section 9.2(a) for any Losses
suffered by any Purchaser Indemnitee unless the aggregate of all indemnifiable
Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees exceeds, on a cumulative basis,
an amount equal to $2,737,500 (the **Deductible** ), and then Seller will only
be liable to the extent of any such excess;

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Purchaser shall not be liable pursuant to Section 9.3(a) for any Losses
suffered by any Seller Indemnitee unless the aggregate of all indemnifiable
Losses suffered by the Seller Indemnitees exceeds, on a cumulative basis, an
amount equal to the Deductible, and then Purchaser will only be liable to the
extent of any such excess;

 



 

(iv) Seller shall not be liable pursuant to Section 9.2(a) for any Losses
suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees to the extent that the aggregate
liability of Seller pursuant to Section 9.2(a) would exceed $54,750,000 (the
**Cap** );

 



 

(v) Purchaser shall not be liable pursuant to Section 9.3(a) for any Losses
suffered by the Seller Indemnitees to the extent that the aggregate liability
of Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.3(a) would exceed the Cap;

 



 

(vi) neither party shall be liable to the other for any portion of the such
other partys Losses attributable to (A) punitive damages or (B) indirect,
special, incidental or consequential damages to the extent such damages were
not reasonably foreseeable (in each case of clause (A) and (B), other than
those paid or payable to third parties) by such other party;

 



 

(vii) in no event will Seller be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnitees or any other person for any matter arising or resulting from a
breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty in Sections 4.4(a)
(Financial Statements) or 4.17 (Inventory) to the extent that such matter was
specifically set forth in and addressed by the Closing Statement; and

 



 

(viii) the aggregate liability of Seller pursuant to Section 9.2(a) shall in
no event exceed the Purchase Price.

 



 

None of the limitations set forth in Sections 9.5(a)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv),
(v), (vi) or (vii) shall apply to claims of, or causes of action arising from,
a breach of the Specified Representations or any representation or warranty
set forth in Section 4.10 (Taxes) or fraud committed by the Indemnifying Party
against the Indemnified Party. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in
resolving any indemnifiable Loss, including by using commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate upon and after becoming aware of any event giving rise to
such Losses; _provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence shall not require
Purchaser to (a) initiate or pursue litigation or other claims against third
parties in respect of such Loss, (b) seek recovery under any insurance policy
in respect of such Loss ( _provided_ , _however_ , that any amounts actually
received by Purchaser under any insurance policy shall be taken into account
for purposes of Section 9.6) or (c) take any other action that could
reasonably be expected to be detrimental to the business, assets or
liabilities of Purchaser (including the Business, the Transferred Assets and
the Assumed Liabilities). Subject to the other terms of this Article 9, the
costs and expenses of such mitigation efforts shall be included in the Losses
for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder.

 



 

(b) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (i) none of Seller, any of its
Affiliates or any other person has made any express or implied representation
or warranty (A) with respect to the Business, the Transferred Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements or (B) as to the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding the Business, the Transferred Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the
Ancillary Agreements furnished or made

 



       
 

 



 

available to Purchaser and its representatives, other than, in the case of
clauses (A) and (B), the representations and warranties of Seller and Seller
Parent specifically set forth in this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or
any certificate or document delivered hereunder or thereunder; and (ii) other
than with respect to Retained Liabilities, Purchaser has no claim or right to
indemnification pursuant to this Article 9 against Seller, any of its
Affiliates or any other person, and none of Seller, any of its Affiliates or
any other person shall have or be subject to any liability to Purchaser or any
other person, with respect to any information, documents or materials
furnished by Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors to Purchaser, including the
Confidential Information Presentation dated May 2016 prepared by Moelis and
Company LLC and any information, documents or material made available to
Purchaser and its representatives in certain "data rooms" (whether electronic
or otherwise), management presentations or any other form in expectation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements
(it being understood that this clause (ii) does not supersede or otherwise
affect the representations and warranties of Seller and Seller Parent
specifically set forth in this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any
certificate or document delivered hereunder or thereunder).

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.5(b), Purchaser acknowledges
and agrees that, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements or any certificate or document delivered hereunder or
thereunder, Seller makes no representations or warranties with respect to the
maintenance, repair, condition, design, performance or marketability of any
Transferred Asset, including merchantability or fitness for a particular
purpose.

 



 

(d) Each of Purchaser and Seller further acknowledges and agrees that, should
the Closing occur, the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Indemnitees
and the Seller Indemnitees with respect to any and all claims relating to this
Agreement, the Business, the Transferred Assets, the Excluded Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities, the Retained Liabilities or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (other than with respect to (i)
a claim arising from the Ancillary Agreements, (ii) a claim for injunctive
relief or other equitable relief, (iii) a claim arising from Article 10 or
(iv) a claim for payment due pursuant to Section 3.3(d)) is pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article 9 and the guarantees set
forth in Article 13\. None of the limitations set forth in this Article 9
shall apply to claims of, or causes of action arising from, Sellers or Seller
Parents fraud.

 



 

 **9.6** **Calculation of Indemnity Payments**

 



 

(a) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this
Article 9 shall be (i) reduced by any amounts actually received by the
Indemnified Party under third party insurance policies with respect to such
Loss, (ii) increased by any Tax cost actually incurred by the Indemnified
Party arising from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up for
such increase) in the taxable year in which the indemnity payment is received
and (iii) reduced by any Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified
Party (in the form of a cash refund or reduction in cash Taxes otherwise
payable) as a result of such Loss by the Indemnified Party in the taxable year
such Loss is incurred or the immediately succeeding taxable year. In computing
the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax benefit, the Indemnified Party shall be
deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit
before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment
hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any indemnified amount. In computing
the amount of any such Tax benefit actually realized, such Tax benefit shall
be net of any Tax detriment arising from the receipt of any indemnification
payment. For purposes of calculating the amount of Losses incurred out of or
relating to any breach or

 



      
 

 



 

inaccuracy of a representation or warranty in this Agreement or any
certificate or document delivered hereunder, but not for purposes of
determining whether or not a breach or inaccuracy has occurred, the references
to "Business Material Adverse Effect," "Purchaser Material Adverse Effect,"
"material" or other materiality qualifications (or correlative terms), shall
be disregarded.

 



 

(b) If the Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third party in respect
of Losses that are the subject of indemnification hereunder after all or a
portion of such Losses have been paid by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this Article 9, the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying
Party the indemnity payment actually received from the Indemnifying Party up
to the amount received by the Indemnified Party from such third party, net of
any applicable premium adjustments and any costs or expenses incurred in the
collection thereof.

 



 

 **9.7** **Tax Treatment of Indemnification**

 



 

For all Tax purposes, Seller and Purchaser shall treat (and shall cause each
of their respective Affiliates to treat) any indemnity payment under this
Agreement and any payment pursuant to Section 2.4(c) as an adjustment to the
Final Purchase Price unless a final determination by the IRS or other
applicable Taxing Authority (which must include, in the case of the IRS, the
execution of an IRS Form 870-AD or successor form) provides otherwise.

 **10.** **TAX MATTERS**

 



 

 **10.1** **Tax Matters**

 



 

(a) **Allocation of Certain Taxes**

 



 

In the case of any Straddle Period, (i) Property Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax
Period equal the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during
the Straddle Period that is in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and will be a
Retained Liability and (ii) Property Taxes for the Post-Closing Tax Period
equal the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during
the Straddle Period that is in the Post-Closing Tax Period and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and will be an
Assumed Liability. The party that has the primary obligation to do so under
applicable Law shall file any Tax Return that is required to be filed in
respect of Taxes described in this Section 10.1(a), and that party shall pay
the Taxes shown on such Tax Return. To the extent any such Taxes paid by
Purchaser (or any refund of Taxes received by Purchaser) is allocable to the

 



      
 

 



 

Pre-Closing Tax Period, or any such Taxes paid by Seller (or any refund of
Taxes received by Seller) is allocable to the Post-Closing Tax Period,
Purchaser or Seller (as applicable) shall pay to the other party such
proportionate amount promptly after the payment of such Taxes (or the receipt
of any such refund).

 



 

(b) **Purchase Price Allocations**

 



 

(i) At least seven days prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide
Seller with an estimate of the allocation of the total consideration
(including liabilities assumed) among the Transferred Assets, with a single
number for all of the Transferred Assets of Seller. This estimate will be used
at the Closing (including, if necessary, for the payment of any applicable
Transfer Taxes). If Seller does not agree with such estimate, Seller and
Purchaser shall use good faith efforts to agree on an estimate prior to the
Closing Date. If the parties cannot agree on such estimate prior to the
Closing Date, Purchasers estimate will be used for allocating the total
consideration pursuant to this Agreement at the Closing.

 



 

(ii) Without regard to the estimate determined pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(i),
within 60 days after the determination of the Final Purchase Price, Purchaser
shall provide Seller a proposed allocation (the **Allocation** ) of the total
consideration (including liabilities assumed and any other amounts required to
be taken into account under applicable Law) among the Transferred Assets, as
well as with a single amount for all of the Transferred Assets of Seller. The
Allocation will be supported by a valuation report from a nationally
recognized appraiser selected by Purchaser (the **Valuation Firm** ). The
valuation report provided by the Valuation Firm shall be modified, as
appropriate, by the Valuation Firm to reflect any adjustments in the total
consideration made following the Closing in accordance with this Agreement.
The Allocation will become final and binding 20 days after Purchaser provides
the Allocation to Seller, unless Seller objects on the grounds that there is
no reasonable basis for the Allocation (in which case, Seller shall propose an
allocation). If the parties cannot agree on the Allocation, each party shall
be entitled to use its own valuation.

 



 

(iii) If the parties agree on the Allocation or the Allocation becomes final
and binding pursuant to the penultimate sentence of Section 10.1(b)(ii),
Seller (and its Affiliates) and Purchaser (and its Affiliates) agree to file
all Tax Returns consistent with the final version of the Allocation described
in Section 10.1(b)(ii) unless otherwise required to do so by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) **Transfer Taxes**

 



 

Seller and Purchaser shall each be responsible for and bear 50% of the amount
of any Transfer Taxes payable as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in timely paying all Transfer
Taxes and timely preparing and filing, or causing to be timely prepared and
filed, filings, returns, reports and forms as may be required in connection
with Sellers and Purchasers payment of Transfer Taxes. Seller and Purchaser
shall use reasonable efforts to avail themselves of any available exemptions
from any such Transfer Taxes.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) **Cooperation**

 



 

Seller and Purchaser agree to retain all records relating to the finances and
Taxes of the Transferred Assets for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods until the
expiration of the statutes of limitation (including any extensions thereof)
for the taxable period or periods to which such records relate. Seller and
Purchaser shall provide each other with such information and assistance as is
reasonably necessary, including access to records and personnel, for the
preparation of any Tax Returns or for the defense of any Tax claim or
assessment, whether in connection with an audit or otherwise. Seller and
Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate in obtaining any clearance certificates
or similar documents from any applicable Taxing Authority that are required or
permitted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **11.** **ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**

 



 

 **11.1** **Publicity**

 



 

Each of Purchaser and Seller shall consult with the other to the extent
reasonably practicable with respect to any press release that such party or
any of its Affiliates chooses to make upon announcement of the execution of
this Agreement. Other than any such initial Purchaser or Seller (or Purchaser
Affiliate or Seller Affiliate) press release, from the date of this Agreement
through the Closing Date, neither party or any of its Affiliates shall make
any other public press release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as
such press release or announcement may be required by Law or the rules or
regulations of any United States or foreign securities exchange, in which case
the party required to make the release or announcement shall, to the extent
practicable, use commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) each of the parties and its
Affiliates may make internal announcements to their respective employees that
are consistent with the parties prior public disclosures regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby and (b) each of the parties or its Affiliates
may issue one or more releases or announcements (including filing this
Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement with the United States Securities
Exchange Commission or other foreign securities exchange) in connection with
the execution of this Agreement, so long as such party permits the other party
reasonable notice and time to review any such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance or filing. Seller acknowledges that Purchasers
Affiliates may be required to disclose the material terms of this Agreement
in, and file a copy of this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement as
attachments to, a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the United States
Securities Exchange Commission. Nothing in this Section 11.1 shall prohibit
(or require prior consent for) (x) ordinary course communications with
customers, suppliers, regulators and other persons that reference the
transactions contemplated hereby, (y) communications necessary to comply with
obligations under this Agreement (including Section 2.3) and (z) disclosure
regarding the transactions contemplated hereby in regularly scheduled earnings
announcements or as otherwise required to comply with applicable periodic
reporting requirements, so long as, with respect to clauses (x) and (y), such
communications do not disclose any material information regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby that has not previously been publicly
disclosed.

references to the Names and (ii) within 270 days after the Closing, to change
signage and stationery and otherwise discontinue use of the Names except as
otherwise permitted by this Section 11.2; _provided_ , _however_ , that for a
period of (A) 270 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser and its Affiliates
may continue to distribute product literature relating to the Business that
uses any Names to the extent such product literature exists as of the Closing,
and (b) 18 months after the Closing, Purchaser and its Affiliates may continue
to distribute Products with labeling that uses any Names to the extent that
such product literature and labeling exists on the Closing Date or is ordered
no more than 90 days after the Closing Date. Neither Purchaser nor the
Business shall use any Names after the Closing in any manner or for any
purpose different from the use of such Names by Seller during the 90-day
period preceding the Closing. With respect to the Transferred Inventory,
Seller shall permit Purchaser and its Affiliates to continue to sell such
Transferred Inventory, notwithstanding that it bears one or more of the Names,
for up to 18 months following the Closing.

 



 

(b) Seller shall promptly, and in any event (i) within 180 days after the
Closing, revise print advertising, product labeling and all other information
or other materials, including any internet or other electronic communications
vehicles, to delete all references to the Transferred Trademarks and (ii)
within 270 days after the Closing, to change signage and stationery and
otherwise discontinue use of the Transferred Trademarks; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that for a period of 270 days after the Closing Date, Seller may
continue to distribute product literature relating to the Excluded Products
that uses any Transferred Trademarks and distribute Excluded Products with
labeling that uses any Transferred Trademarks to the extent that such product
literature and labeling exists on the Closing Date. Seller shall not use any
Transferred Trademarks after the Closing in any manner or for any purpose
different from the use of such Transferred Trademarks by Seller during the
90-day period preceding the Closing.

 



 

 **11.3** **Universal Product Codes**

 



 

For all UPCs of the Products that are not Transferred UPCs, to the extent
permitted by GS1 US, Seller hereby grants Purchaser the limited right to use
such UPCs that, as of the Closing Date, appear on the existing Product
packaging of the Business for a period of 18 months after the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the right to use such UPCs is non-exclusive
with respect to the manufacturer codes, (b) the scope of the right is limited
to using such UPCs solely for the sale of existing Products, (c) Purchaser may
not materially alter any Product packaging or make any new Product packaging
designs that use such UPCs and (d) Purchaser may not use such UPCs in any
other manner without the prior written consent of Seller.

 



 

 **11.4** **Support Services**

 



 

Purchaser acknowledges that as of the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of
its Affiliates shall have any obligation to provide any support or other
services to Purchaser relating to the Business other than those services
expressly required to be provided pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement.

 



 

 **11.5** **Post-Closing Information**

 



 

(a) Following the Closing, upon reasonable advance written notice to
Purchaser, Purchaser shall afford or cause to be afforded to Seller and its
Affiliates reasonable access to Purchasers personnel, properties, books,
Contracts, commitments and records exclusively relating to the pre-Closing
activities of the Business for any reasonable business purpose, including in
respect of

 



      
 

 



 

litigation, insurance matters and financial reporting of Seller and its
Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access does not unreasonably
disrupt the normal operations of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 11.5(a), neither Purchaser
nor its Affiliates shall be required to breach any duty of confidentiality
owed to any person whether such duty arises contractually, statutorily or
otherwise.

 



 

(b) Following the Closing, upon reasonable advance written notice to Seller,
Seller shall afford to Purchaser and its Affiliates reasonable access to
Sellers personnel, properties, books, Contracts, commitments and records
exclusively relating to the Business for any reasonable business purpose,
including in respect of litigation, insurance matters and financial reporting
of Purchaser and its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access
does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of Seller or any of its
Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 11.5(b),
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to breach any duty
of confidentiality owed to any person whether such duty arises contractually,
statutorily or otherwise.

 



 

 **11.6** **Records**

 



 

Purchaser recognizes that certain records may contain information relating to
Subsidiaries, divisions or businesses of Seller and its Affiliates other than
the Business and that Seller and its Affiliates, subject to Sellers
obligations under Section 11.10, may retain copies thereof.

 



 

 **11.7** **Bulk Transfer Laws**

 



 

Purchaser hereby waives compliance by Seller with the provisions of any so-
called "bulk transfer laws" of any jurisdiction in connection with the sale of
the Transferred Assets to Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this Section 11.7 shall derogate from Sellers responsibilities under Article
9.

 



 

 **11.8** **Refunds and Remittances**

 



 

(a) After the Closing, if Seller or any of its Affiliates receive any refund
or other amount which is a Transferred Asset or is otherwise properly due and
owing to Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Seller
promptly shall remit, or shall cause to be remitted, such amount to Purchaser
at the address set forth in Section 12.4. After the Closing, if Purchaser or

responsible hereunder, and which amount is not a Transferred Asset, or is
otherwise properly due and owing to Seller in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, Purchaser promptly shall remit, or cause to be remitted, such
amount to Seller at the address set forth in Section 12.4. After the Closing,

promptly shall remit, or cause to be remitted, such amount to Purchaser at the
address set forth in Section 12.4.

Promptly after the Closing, Seller (or its financial advisor, as applicable)
shall request in writing the destruction or erasure of all confidential
information of the Business provided to any person in connection with such
other persons interest in a possible transaction to acquire the Business (or
any portion thereof).

 



 

 **11.10** **Post-Closing Confidentiality**

 



 

From and after the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
keep confidential and protect, and not divulge, allow access to or use in any
way any and all information concerning the business and affairs of the
Business, including the Transferred Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, that
is not generally known to the public.

 



 

 **11.11** **Further Assurances**

 



 

After the Closing, each party shall take such further actions and execute such
further documents as may be reasonably necessary or reasonably requested by
the other party (including with respect to filings for Transferred
Intellectual Property) in order to effectuate the intent of this Agreement and
to provide such other party in all material respects with the intended
benefits of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

 **11.12** **Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation**

 



 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

 **Competing Activities** means the business of manufacturing (or having
manufactured), packaging, marketing, distributing or selling Competing
Products for sale in the Restricted Territory.

 



 

 **Competing Products** means spices, seasoning blends, dried sauces, dried
soups, dried gravies and barbeque sauces; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Competing Products shall not include any pastes or "meal solutions" products
that include spices, seasoning blends, dried sauces, dried soups or dried
gravies that, if offered on a standalone basis, would constitute Competing
Products but that are packaged (either directly or in so-called spice cap
products format) with noodles, rice, vegetables, sauces or similar products.

 



 

 **Restricted Period** means a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending
on the third anniversary thereof.

 



 

 **Restricted Territory** means the United States of America, Canada and
Mexico.

 



 

(b) During the Restricted Period, Seller will not, and will ensure that each
of its Affiliates will not, directly or indirectly, as owner, operator,
contractor, consultant, partner, joint venture or otherwise, engage in
Competing Activities; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller and any of its
Affiliates may own or acquire, directly or indirectly, (i) the securities of
any person that engages in any of the Competing Activities if Seller and its
Affiliates do not, directly or indirectly,

 



      
 

 



 

collectively own more than 20% of the aggregate outstanding equity securities
of such person and (ii) any person (or any business acquired from any such
person) that engages in any of the Competing Activities if such Competing
Activities account for less than 15% of the consolidated annual revenues or
assets of such person.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.12 to the contrary, Seller and
its Affiliates shall not be prevented from continuing to engage in any
business currently conducted by Seller or its Affiliates (other than the
Business), including manufacturing, marketing, distributing and selling
Competing Products outside the Restricted Territory. Purchaser acknowledges
and agrees that nothing in this Section 11.12 shall restrict the activities or
business of Stratas Foods LLC and that neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any liability to Purchaser with respect to any
activities of Stratas Foods LLC that are Competing Activities; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Stratas Foods LLC and its business and activities shall be
deemed to have been acquired by Seller, and become subject to the terms of
this Section 11.12 if, at any time during the Restricted Period, Seller or any
of its Affiliates individually or collectively own or acquire greater than 50%
of the economic or voting interests in Stratas Foods LLC or otherwise control
the management or operations of Stratas Foods LLC by virtue of having the
right to elect a majority of the board (or similar governing body) of Stratas
Foods LLC or otherwise.

 



 

(d) During the Restricted Period, Seller will not, and will ensure that each
of its Affiliates will not, directly or indirectly, engage, solicit, induce or
attempt to engage, solicit or induce, whether or not for consideration, any
person who is (or was within one year prior to the Closing Date) employed
primarily in connection with the Business at the Transferred Real Property in
the position of manager (or any more senior position) unless (i) such person
is terminated by Purchaser or (ii) more than one year shall have passed since
such person terminated his or her employment with the Business. The foregoing
covenant shall not prevent general solicitations for employees or public
advertisements of employment opportunities (including any recruitment efforts
conducted by any recruitment agency); _provided_ , _however_ , that such
general solicitations, public advertisements and recruitment efforts are not
directed at any person who is (or was within one year prior to the Closing
Date) employed primarily in connection with the Business in the position of
manager (or any more senior position).

 



 

(e) Seller recognizes that the territorial, time and scope limitations set
forth in the applicable provisions in this Section 11.12 are reasonable and
are properly required for the protection of Purchasers and the Businesss
legitimate interests in client relationships, goodwill and trade secrets, and
in the event that any such territorial, time or scope limitation is deemed to
be unreasonable by a court of competent jurisdiction, Purchaser and Seller
agree to submit to the reduction of any or all of said territorial, time or
scope limitations to such an area, period or scope as said court shall deem
reasonable under the circumstances, and in its reduced form, such provision
shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced.

 



 

(f) Seller agrees that the Restricted Period shall be tolled, and shall not
run, during any period of time in which Seller is in breach of this Section
11.12, in order that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have all of the
agreed-upon temporal protections recited herein.

 



 

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 11.12 may be enforced as provided
in Sections 12.10 and 12.12.

 



       
 

 



 

 **11.13** **Financial Information Cooperation**

 



 

From and after the Closing Date (provided that Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to begin compliance with this covenant as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement), Seller shall cooperate with
Purchaser in the preparation, review and audit of financial statements and
other financial information regarding the Business that may be, in the sole
discretion of Purchaser, required to be included in the financial reports and
other public disclosures of Purchasers Affiliates pursuant to Regulations S-X
and S-K promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in connection with the
transaction contemplated hereby. Such cooperation shall include assistance
with the preparation of financial statements and all other financial
information necessary for the accounting firm responsible for reviewing and
auditing such financial statements to perform its review and audit, including
the execution and delivery by Seller of a customary representation letter to
such accounting firm (if and to the extent reasonably required by such
accounting firm). Such cooperation by Seller shall be provided in a timely
manner such that the preparation of the financial statements and other
financial information can be completed and the audit report thereon delivered
to Purchaser no later than 60 days after the Closing Date. The accounting firm
responsible for the review and audit of such financial statements shall be
KPMG LLP unless otherwise determined by Purchaser. All out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Section 11.13 shall be paid by
Purchaser.

 



 

 **11.14** **Archival Copy of Data Room**

 



 

Promptly following the Closing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver to Purchaser a DVD, CD, flash drive or similar electronic
storage medium containing the documents that Purchaser has previously granted
access in the "data room" created and maintained by Seller in connection with
Purchasers review of the Business.

 



 

 **11.15** **Transferred Real Property Separation**

 



 

Purchaser acknowledges that Seller and its Affiliates currently use the
Transferred Real Property for certain operations unrelated to the Business.
Following the Closing, each of Seller and Purchaser will use commercially
reasonable efforts at the request of the other party to facilitate the orderly
transition of the unrelated operations of Seller and its Affiliates from the
Transferred Real Property. Such commercially reasonable efforts will, to the
extent requested by Seller, include permitting Seller and its Affiliates
reasonable access to the Transferred Real Property to remove assets unrelated
to the Business and the use of the Transferred Real Property from the Closing
Date through the expiration or earlier termination of the Transition Services
Agreement to perform, on a transitional basis, those same functions performed
at the Transferred Real Property immediately before the Closing and to fulfill
its obligations under the Transition Services Agreement. Following execution
of this Agreement and prior to the Closing, if requested by either party,
Purchaser and Seller will cooperate to create a joint plan for such
transitional arrangements relating to the Transferred Real Property.

The descriptive headings of the several Articles and Sections of this
Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement and the Table of
Contents to this Agreement are inserted for convenience only, do not

construed to have the same meaning as the word "shall". Unless the context
indicates otherwise, the word "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the

of such terms and to the masculine as well as the feminine and neuter genders
of such terms. Any agreement, instrument or applicable Law defined or referred
to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means

This Agreement, including the Disclosure Schedule (and the Introduction

hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in
full herein. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit but not
otherwise defined therein are defined as set forth in this Agreement. There
are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, agreements or
undertakings of any party to this Agreement with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements other than those set forth herein or therein or in any other
document required to be executed and delivered hereunder or thereunder. In
evaluating and entering into this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,
neither party has relied upon nor is it relying upon any representations,
warranties or other statements, whether oral or written, except those
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this
Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedule (and the Introduction thereto)
and Exhibits hereto), on the one hand, and the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements (including the schedules
and exhibits thereto), on the other hand, the provisions of this Agreement
control.

 



      
 

 



 

 **12.8** **Severability; Enforcement**

 



 

The invalidity of any portion of this Agreement will not affect the validity,
force or effect of the remaining portions hereof. If it is ever held that any
restriction hereunder is too broad to permit enforcement of such restriction
to its fullest extent, each party agrees that a court of competent
jurisdiction may enforce such restriction to the maximum extent permitted by
Law, and each party hereby consents and agrees that such scope may be
judicially modified accordingly in any proceeding brought to enforce such
restriction.

 



 

 **12.9** **Governing Law**

 



 

The laws of the State of New York, without reference to its conflicts of law
principles (other than Section 5-1401 of the General Obligations Law of the
State of New York), govern all matters arising out of this Agreement and any
disputes arising under or related hereto (whether for breach of contract,
tortious conduct or otherwise).

 



 

 **12.10** **Jurisdiction; Service of Process**

 



 

Each party irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding against it arising out of or
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or disputes relating hereto (whether for breach of contract,
tortious conduct or otherwise) must be brought exclusively in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, or, if such court
does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the state courts of New York
located in New York County and hereby irrevocably accepts and submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the aforesaid courts _in personam_ , with
respect to any such Proceeding. Each party irrevocably agrees that service of
any process, summons, notice or document by United States registered or
certified mail to such partys address set forth in Section 12.4 will be
effective service of process for any Proceeding in New York with respect to
the matters for which it has submitted to jurisdiction pursuant to this
Section 12.10.

 



 

 **12.11** **Waiver of Jury Trial**

 



 

Each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly
or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or disputes relating hereto.
Each party (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver
and (b) acknowledges that it and the other party hereto have been induced to
enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this Section 12.11.

 



 

 **12.12** **Specific Performance**

 



 

Each party hereby agrees that irreparable damage would occur and it would not
have an adequate remedy at law if any provision of this Agreement is not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or otherwise breached.
Accordingly, each party hereby agrees that the other party will be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the provisions of this Agreement, including the
obligation to consummate the Acquisition, in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York or any state court of New York located
in New York County, this being in addition to any other remedy to

 



      
 

 



 

which they are entitled at law or in equity, whether pursuant to this
Agreement or otherwise. In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties hereby
waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) any and all
defenses to any action for specific performance hereunder, including any
defense based on the claim that a remedy at law would be adequate, and (b) any
requirement to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to seeking or
obtaining equitable relief. In the event of any Proceedings for the
enforcement of a partys rights under this Section 12.12, the costs and
expenses incurred by the prevailing party and its representatives in
connection therewith, including reasonable third party legal fees and
expenses, shall be reimbursed by the non-prevailing party.

 



 

 **12.13** **Amendments**

 



 

This Agreement may be amended, modified, superseded or canceled and any of the
terms, covenants, representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be
waived only by an instrument in writing signed by an officer of each of the
parties hereto or, in the case of a waiver, by or on behalf of the party
waiving compliance.

this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including the payment obligations
of Seller set forth in Section 3.3 and Article 9 (the **Guaranteed Seller
Obligations** ).

 



 

(b) Seller Parent guarantees that the Guaranteed Seller Obligations will be
satisfied strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The
liabilities and obligations of Seller Parent under or in respect of this
Section 13.1 are independent of any liabilities or obligations of Seller under
or in respect of this Agreement, and a separate action or actions may be
brought and prosecuted against Seller Parent to enforce its obligations under
this Section 13.1, irrespective of whether any action is brought against
Seller or whether Seller is joined in any such action or actions.

 



 

(c) Seller Parents obligations under this Section 13.1 shall not be released
or discharged by any or all of the following: (i) any change in the time,
manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the
Guaranteed Seller Obligations or any other liabilities or obligations of
Seller under or in respect of this Agreement; (ii) any express amendment or
modification of or supplement to this Agreement, or any assignment or transfer
of any of the Guaranteed Seller Obligations; (iii) any failure on the part of
Seller to perform or comply with this Agreement; (iv) any waiver, consent,
change, extension, indulgence or other action or any action or inaction under
or in respect of this Agreement; (v) any bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, arrangement, readjustment, composition, liquidation or similar
Proceeding with respect to Seller Parent or Seller or their respective
properties, or any action taken by any trustee or receiver or by any court in
any such Proceeding, subject, as to enforceability, to the effect of any
applicable Laws relating to bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential transfer or similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and to the effect of
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a

 



      
 

 



 

proceeding in equity or at law); or (vi) any change in the name or ownership
of Seller or any other person referred to herein.

 



 

(d) Seller Parent hereby waives (i) notice of acceptance of this guarantee,
(ii) presentment and demand concerning the liabilities of Seller Parent and

other person, or to require that Purchaser seek enforcement of any performance
against Seller or any other person prior to any action against Seller Parent
under the terms hereof.

 



 

(e) Except as to applicable statutes of limitation, no delay of Purchaser in
the exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights under this Section 13.1
shall operate as a waiver of such rights, a waiver of any other rights, or a
release of Seller Parent from any obligations hereunder.

 



 

(f) Seller Parent hereby warrants to Seller as follows:

 



 

(i) Seller Parent is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has full power and authority and
possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and
approvals necessary to enable it to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement, other than such franchises, licenses,
permits, authorizations and approvals the lack of which would not reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on its ability to perform its
obligations hereunder.

 



 

(ii) Seller Parent has the requisite power and authority to execute this
Agreement and has taken all action required by its organizational documents to
authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

 



 

(iii) Seller Parent has duly executed and delivered this Agreement, and this

against it in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to the
effect of any applicable Laws relating to bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential transfer or
similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and to the
effect of general principles of equity and the availability of equitable
remedies (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

 



 

(iv) The execution and delivery by Seller Parent of this Agreement do not
conflict with or result in any breach of or constitute a default under, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of
Seller Parent under, any provision of (A) the organizational documents of
Seller Parent, (B) any Contract to which Seller Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their respective properties or
assets is bound or (C) any Judgment or applicable Law applicable to Seller
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets,
other than, in the case of clauses (B) and (C) above, any such items that
would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its
ability to perform its obligations hereunder.

 



 

(g) This Section 13.1 shall remain in full force and effect until all of the
Guaranteed Seller Obligations are fully and finally performed. For the
avoidance of doubt, the obligation and liability of Seller Parent, as a
primary obligor and not as surety, under this Section 13.1 is specifically
limited to payment (and not of collection) and performance of the Guaranteed
Seller

 



      
 

 



 

Obligations required to be made by Seller under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, subject to any and all rights, limitations,
qualifications and other defenses, solely to the extent that each of the
foregoing are available to Seller under this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements, as the case may be.

 



 

 **13.2** **Purchaser Parent Guarantee**

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser Parent, as a primary obligor

obligations of Purchaser set forth in Section 3.3 and Article 9 (the
**Guaranteed Purchaser Obligations** ).

 



 

(b) Purchaser Parent guarantees that the Guaranteed Purchaser Obligations will
be satisfied strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The
liabilities and obligations of Purchaser Parent under or in respect of this
Section 13.2 are independent of any liabilities or obligations of Purchaser
under or in respect of this Agreement, and a separate action or actions may be
brought and prosecuted against Purchaser Parent to enforce its obligations
under this Section 13.2, irrespective of whether any action is brought against
Purchaser or whether Purchaser is joined in any such action or actions.

 



 

(c) Purchaser Parents obligations under this Section 13.2 shall not be
released or discharged by any or all of the following: (i) any change in the
time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of
the Guaranteed Purchaser Obligations or any other liabilities or obligations
of Purchaser under or in respect of this Agreement; (ii) any express amendment
or modification of or supplement to this Agreement, or any assignment or
transfer of any of the Guaranteed Purchaser Obligations; (iii) any failure on
the part of Purchaser to perform or comply with this Agreement; (iv) any
waiver, consent, change, extension, indulgence or other action or any action
or inaction under or in respect of this Agreement; (v) any bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, readjustment, composition,
liquidation or similar Proceeding with respect to Purchaser Parent or
Purchaser or their respective properties, or any action taken by any trustee
or receiver or by any court in any such Proceeding, subject, as to
enforceability, to the effect of any applicable Laws relating to bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential
transfer or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally
and to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); or (vi) any
change in the name or ownership of Purchaser or any other person referred to
herein.

 



 

(d) Purchaser Parent hereby waives (i) notice of acceptance of this guarantee,
(ii) presentment and demand concerning the liabilities of Purchaser Parent and
(iii) any right to require that any action be brought against Purchaser or any
other person, or to require that Seller seek enforcement of any performance
against Purchaser or any other person prior to any action against Purchaser
Parent under the terms hereof.

 



 

(e) Except as to applicable statutes of limitation, no delay of Seller in the
exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights under this Section 13.2 shall
operate as a waiver of such rights, a waiver of any other rights, or a release
of Purchaser Parent from any obligations hereunder.

 



 

(f) Purchaser Parent hereby warrants to Purchaser as follows:

permits, authorizations and approvals the lack of which would not reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on its ability to perform its
obligations hereunder.

 



 

(ii) Purchaser Parent has the requisite power and authority to execute this
Agreement and has taken all action required by its organizational documents to

enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject, as to
enforceability, to the effect of any applicable Laws relating to bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential
transfer or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally
and to the effect of general principles of equity and the availability of
equitable remedies (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law).

 



 

(iv) The execution and delivery by Purchaser Parent of this Agreement do not
