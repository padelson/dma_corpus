organized, validly existing, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). All of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is owned directly or indirectly by Parent. Merger Sub has outstanding no option, warrant, right, or any other agreement pursuant to which any person other than Parent may acquire any equity security of Merger
Sub. Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to the date of this Agreement and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to

contemplated hereby, including the Merger, have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or

Law) contained in this Agreement by Parent as sole stockholder of Merger Sub and the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of Delaware. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger
Sub and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance
with its terms, except that (a)&nbsp;such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors&#146; rights generally and
