interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time all such

3 ARTICLE II

DISSENTING SHARES; PAYMENT FOR SHARES; OPTIONS

SECTION 2.01. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders properly exercising
appraisal rights available under Section 262 of the Corporation Law (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holders shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their
rights to appraisal under the Corporation Law. Dissenting Shares shall be
treated in accordance with Section 262 of the Corporation Law. If any such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost such right to appraisal, such holders Shares shall thereupon be
converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of
the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right to
appraisal shall have been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger
Consideration, without interest. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub
(a) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the Corporation Law and received by the Company relating to rights
to be paid the "fair value" of Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 262
of the Corporation Law and (b) the opportunity to participate in and control
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
the Corporation Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisals of capital stock of the Company, offer to settle
or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

 

SECTION 2.02. _Payment for Shares_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
will deposit or cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company
designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying
Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares, sufficient cash
to make the payments due pursuant to  _Section 1.06_ on a timely basis to
holders of Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (such amounts being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment
Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make
the payments provided for in the preceding sentence out of the Payment Fund.
Such funds may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , that (i) no such investment gains or
losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of
Shares and following any losses that result in the amount of funds in the
Payment Fund being insufficient to pay the portion of the aggregate Merger
Consideration that remains unpaid, Parent shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the former stockholders of the
Company to the extent of such insufficiency and (ii) such investments
shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America.
The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except as provided
in this Agreement.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
Person (as defined below) who, as of the Effective Time, was the record holder
of Shares whose Shares were converted into the

 



4  Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.06_: (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-
Entry Shares_ ") in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Following surrender
to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof
and bond as provided in _Section 2.02(c)_) or Book-Entry Shares, together
with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares shall be paid in exchange therefor cash in an amount
(subject to any applicable withholding Tax (as defined below)) equal to the
product of the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by the Merger
Consideration, and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it
shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. From and after the Effective
Time and until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
2.02_, each Certificate shall represent for all purposes solely the right to
receive, in accordance with the terms hereof, the Merger Consideration in
cash multiplied by the number of Shares evidenced by such Certificate, without
any interest thereon.

 

(c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares
formerly represented thereby. 

(d) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments
thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company for
one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation. Any former stockholders of the Company who have not complied with
this _Section 2.02_ prior to the end of such one (1) year period shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) but only as general creditors thereof
for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder of Shares for any amounts (whether in respect of such Shares or
otherwise) delivered from the Payment Fund or otherwise to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificates shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date
that such unclaimed funds would otherwise become subject to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law, any unclaimed funds payable with respect to
such Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, and any former holder of Shares who has
not theretofore complied with this  _Section 2.02_ shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon.

 



5 SECTION 2.03. _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
no transfer of Shares shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in
this _Article II_.

SECTION 2.04. _Existing Equity Awards_. (a) Each unvested option to purchase
Shares granted pursuant to the terms of the Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc.
2011 Incentive Compensation Plan (together with the Motorola Mobility
Holdings, Inc. Legacy Incentive Plan, the " _Stock Plans_ ") (each such
unvested option, an " _Existing Rollover Stock Option_ ," and collectively,
the " _Existing Rollover Stock Options_ ") that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall, as of the Effective Time, be converted
into an option (an " _Assumed Stock Option_ ") to acquire the number of shares
of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Parent (" _Parent
Common Stock_ ") (rounded down to the nearest whole share) that is equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of Shares subject to the
holders Existing Rollover Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, by (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the Merger Consideration
by (B) the average closing price per share of Parent Common Stock on the
Nasdaq Global Select Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") for the five (5) trading day period
ending on the trading day preceding the date of Closing (the " _Closing Date_
") or, if Parent Common Stock was not available for trading on the NASDAQ on
the day preceding the Closing Date, on the last day prior to the day preceding
the Closing Date that Parent Common Stock was available for trading on the
NASDAQ (the " _Parent Stock Price_ " and such quotient, the " _Exchange Ratio_
"), which option shall have an exercise price per share of Parent Common
Stock equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained
by dividing (x) the exercise price per Share of such Existing Rollover Stock
Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange
Ratio. The term, vesting schedule and all of the other terms of each Assumed
Stock Option shall otherwise remain unchanged and identical, subject to the
rights of Parent to amend or modify any such Assumed Stock Option in
accordance with the terms of the corresponding Existing Rollover Stock Option
and applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Existing Rollover Stock
Options shall not include any option granted in respect of director service
and no such option shall be subject to the terms of this _Section 2.04(a)_.

(b) Each option to purchase Shares granted pursuant to the Stock Plans, other
than any Existing Rollover Stock Option, whether vested or unvested (each, an
" _Existing Cash-Out Stock Option_ ," and collectively, the " _Existing Cash-
Out Stock Options_ ," and together with the Existing Rollover Stock
Options, the " _Existing Stock Options_ ") that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully
vested and be converted into the right at the Effective Time to receive an
amount, payable in cash, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
total number of Shares subject to such Existing Cash-Out Stock Option, by (ii)
the excess, if any, of the amount of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of the Shares subject to the Existing Cash-Out Stock
Option (with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded to the nearest cent)
less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law

 



6  with respect to the making of such payment. The Surviving Corporation shall
pay to the holders of Existing Cash-Out Stock Options the cash payments
described in this _Section 2.04(b)_ on or as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Closing Date, but in any event within ten (10) Business Days
following the Closing Date.

(c) Each award of restricted Shares granted pursuant to the Motorola Mobility
Holdings, Inc. 2011 Incentive Compensation Plan (each, an " _Existing
Restricted Stock Award_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (after giving effect to the relevant accelerated vesting requirements
contained in the Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc. 2011 Incentive Compensation
Plan and the grant agreements pursuant thereto) shall, as of the Effective
Time, be converted into an award (an " _Assumed Restricted Stock Award_ ")
with respect to the number of restricted shares of Parent Common Stock
(rounded to the nearest whole share) that is equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the number of Shares subject to the holders Existing
Restricted Stock Award, by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. The vesting schedule and
all of the other terms of each Assumed Restricted Stock Award shall otherwise
remain unchanged and identical to the terms of the corresponding Existing
Restricted Stock Award, subject to the rights of Parent to amend or modify any
such Assumed Restricted Stock Award in accordance with the terms of the
corresponding Existing Restricted Stock Award and applicable Law.

(d) Each restricted stock unit award with respect to Shares granted pursuant
to the terms of the Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc. 2011 Incentive
Compensation Plan which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each, an " _Existing Rollover RSU Award_ ," and collectively, the "
_Existing Rollover RSU Awards_ ") shall, as of the Effective Time, be
converted into a restricted stock unit award (an " _Assumed RSU Award_ ") with
respect to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded to the nearest
whole share) that is equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
number of Shares subject to the holders Existing Rollover RSU Award by (ii)
the Exchange Ratio. The vesting schedule, and all of the other terms of each
Assumed RSU Award shall otherwise remain unchanged and identical to the terms
of the corresponding Existing Rollover RSU Award, subject to the rights of
Parent to amend or modify any such Assumed RSU Award in accordance with the
terms of the corresponding Existing Rollover RSU Award and applicable Law.
Existing Rollover RSU Awards shall not include any restricted stock unit award
granted in respect of service as a director that by its terms would be settled
at the Effective Time or upon a directors departure from the Board of
Directors of the Company and no such restricted stock unit award shall be
subject to the terms of this _Section 2.04(d)_.

respect of each Share underlying

 



7  such Existing Cash-Out Stock Award, less such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. The Surviving
Corporation shall pay to the holders of Existing Cash-Out Stock Awards the
cash payments described in this _Section 2.04(e)_ on or as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event within ten (10) Business
Days following the Closing Date.

(f) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company or the appropriate committee of the Board of

reasonably apparent upon reading the disclosure in such other Section that
such disclosure is responsive to the appropriate Section of this _Article
III_ ) and (ii) as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports (as defined below)
filed or furnished by the Company to the U.S. Securities and Exchange

the date hereof (to the extent such disclosure does not constitute a "risk
factor" or forward-looking statement), the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

SECTION 3.01. _Organization and Qualification_. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is (a) a duly organized and validly existing entity in good

as currently conducted and is duly licensed, qualified and in good standing as
a foreign corporation authorized to do business in each of the jurisdictions
in which the character of the properties owned or held under lease by it or
the nature of the business transacted by it makes such qualification
necessary, except (i) in the case of (a), with respect to the Subsidiaries,
where the failure to be so duly organized or validly existing, individually or
in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below), and (ii) in the case of (b), where
the failure to have such corporate power or authority, or to be so licensed,
qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has heretofore made available to Parent copies that are true, correct
and complete of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries owns, directly or indirectly, any interest in any Person, other
than interest in the Companys Subsidiaries and immaterial interests.

Company consists of 900,000,000 Shares and 500,000 shares of preferred stock,

capital stock, other than Shares issuable upon exercise of the Existing Stock
Options, upon the settlement of Existing Restricted Stock Awards, Existing
RSU Awards or the Existing DSU Awards. All of the Shares outstanding have been
duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and
are free of preemptive rights. 

(b) Except for the Existing Stock Options, the Existing Restricted Stock

Securities.

(c) The Company or another of its Subsidiaries is the record and beneficial
owner of all the outstanding shares of capital stock of each material
Subsidiary of the Company (except for directors qualifying shares or the
like), free and clear of any lien, mortgage, pledge, charge, irrevocable
proxy, security interest or encumbrance of any kind (each, but excluding any

the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a

Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for shares
of capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests in any
Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) options, restricted stock, warrants, rights or

and (iv) neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company,

individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(d) To the knowledge of the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries own or
have a valid right to use all Intellectual Property Rights that are used in or

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the assignment to
Parent by operation of law or otherwise of any contracts to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, will cause any of the following
(collectively referred to as " _Section 3.14(f) Events_ "): (i) Parent or any
of its current affiliates to grant or to be obligated to grant to any third
party (A) any covenant not to sue with respect to, or (B) any right to or with
respect to, any material Intellectual Property Rights owned by, or licensed
to, any of them, (ii) Parent or any of its current affiliates to be bound by,
or subject to, any material non-compete or other material restriction on the
operation or scope of their respective businesses, or (iii) Parent, any of its
Affiliates or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be obligated to
pay any material royalties or other material fees or consideration with
respect to Intellectual Property Rights of any third party in excess of those
payable by the Company or its Subsidiaries in the absence of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing clause (iii) is not intended to cover a request from a
third party for remuneration in exchange for the granting of a consent that
may be required in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless such third party is entitled to such
remuneration by an express provision of such contract.

in good faith in connection with, all promises, declarations and commitments
granted, made or committed in writing by the Company or its Subsidiaries to
standard-setting bodies or industry groups, and all membership agreements, by-
laws or policies of standard-setting bodies or industry groups in which the

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the foregoing,
the participation by the Company and its Subsidiaries in any standard settings
or other industry organization is in material compliance with all rules,
requirements, and other obligations of any such organization, except as,

 



25  individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company used its reasonable
best efforts to ensure that none of the promises, declarations and
commitments or other obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries referred
to above require the royalty-free licensing of any Company Intellectual
Property except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Real
Property Lease is valid, binding and in full force and effect, and all rent

to any property leased pursuant to any of the Real Property Leases.

Merger, could materially restrict or purport to restrict such ability of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, except: (A) that the representations or
warranties being made with respect to Parent are made to the knowledge of the
Company to the extent such limit or restriction results from facts or

SECTION 4.01. _Organization_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a duly
organized and validly existing corporation in good standing under the Law of
the jurisdiction of its organization and has all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted, and is
qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in
each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so organized, validly existing, qualified or in good
standing, or to have such power or authority, would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect
(as defined below). All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger
Sub is owned directly or indirectly by Parent. Merger Sub has outstanding no
option, warrant, right, or any other agreement pursuant to which any person
other than Parent may acquire any equity security of Merger Sub. Merger Sub
has not conducted any business prior to the date of this Agreement and has no,
and prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or
obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and

Corporation Law) contained in this Agreement, by Parent and Merger Sub and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, have been duly and validly authorized by the
Board of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub and no other corporate proceedings
on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement
or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or to perform their
obligations hereunder, other than, with respect to completion of the Merger,
the adoption of the agreement of merger (as such term is used in Section 251
of the Corporation Law) contained in this Agreement by Parent as sole

Secretary of State of Delaware. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming this Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company, constitutes
a legal, valid and binding agreement of each of Parent and Merger Sub,

bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now
or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights generally and (b)
equitable remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of
equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of

rights (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, modification
or acceleration, or trigger any requirement or option for additional
consideration, or any event that, with the giving of notice, the passage of
time or otherwise, would constitute a default or loss or reduction of any
rights or give rise to any such right) under any of the terms, conditions or

Agreement (as defined below) entered into in accordance with _Section
5.02(b)_) (a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ "). It is understood that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.02(a)_ by any
director, officer or a financial advisor of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a 

 



39  breach of this _Section 5.02(a)_ by the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this _Section 5.02(a)_ would prevent the Company from
taking any of the actions listed above with respect to any proposal or other
matter that is not an Acquisition Proposal and does not constitute a breach of
_Section 5.01_.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 5.02_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, but subject to the limitations set forth in
this _Section 5.02(b)_ and  _Section 5.02(c)_, at all times during the
period commencing on the date of this Agreement and continuing until the
Companys receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of the Company may, directly or indirectly through one or more
Representatives, (i) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with
any Person that has made a _bona fide_ unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal after the date hereof which did not result from a knowing breach of
this _Section 5.02_, and/or (ii) furnish any non-public information relating
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to the
personnel of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, to any Person that has made a _bona fide_
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof which did not
result from a knowing breach of this _Section 5.02_; _provided_ , that (A)
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that
such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined
below) or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and at
the time of taking such action, such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute or remains reasonably expected to result in a Superior Proposal,
(B) contemporaneously with furnishing any non-public information to such
Person, the Company makes available such non-public information to Parent (to
the extent such information has not been previously made available to Parent;
_provided_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall require the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to make available any information that would cause a
violation of any contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party as in effect on the date hereof or any contract entered into by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in compliance with _Section 5.01_ (in
either case, an " _Allowed Contract_ ", which term shall not include any
contract entered into compliance with _Section 5.01_ if such term is included
in such contract for the purpose of creating violations of such type), would
cause a loss of privilege to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or would
constitute a violation of applicable Laws, it being understood that the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to enter into an additional joint
defense arrangement if necessary to avoid the application of the
foregoing restrictions on disclosure and shall use reasonable best efforts to
avoid entry into any arrangement that would cause such restrictions to apply
to disclosures to Parent), (C) upon receipt of such Acquisition Proposal, the
Company promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) provides
Parent (1) a copy of any such Acquisition Proposal made in writing or (2) a
summary of the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal not made in
writing, together with information known to the Company relating to the
identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal including if it is not
an issuer with equity securities registered with the SEC, its direct and
indirect investors, and (D) the Company gives Parent prior written notice
(which prior written notice shall be given, to the extent practicable, at
least twelve (12) hours in advance), of the Companys intention to participate
or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish non public-
information or afford access to, such Person.

 



40 (c) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed of any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding
any Acquisition Proposal received by the Company and, upon the request of
Parent, shall reasonably promptly apprise Parent of the status of such
Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries shall
not enter into any agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof
which prohibits the Company from complying with its obligations under this
_Section 5.02_.

 

(d) Subject to _Section 5.02(e)_, _Section 5.02(f)_, _Section 5.02(g)_ and
_Section 5.02(h)_, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i) fail
to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (ii)
withhold, withdraw, amend, change, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent, or authorize or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend,
change, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board
Recommendation, (iii) approve, adopt or recommend to the stockholders of the
Company any Acquisition Proposal, or authorize or publicly propose to
approve, adopt or recommend to the stockholders of the Company any Acquisition
Proposal, or (iv) make any public statement regarding any Acquisition Proposal
or tender or exchange offer that fails to include a reaffirmation of the
Company Board Recommendation (other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication by the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act in connection with a tender offer or exchange
offer provided such statement includes a reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation) (each, a " _Recommendation Change_ ").

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary provided
herein, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, subject to compliance with  _Section 5.02(g)_, the Board of
Directors of the Company may effect a Recommendation Change if (i) (A) an
event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence (an " _Intervening Event_
") that affects the business, assets or operations of the Company that is
unknown to the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date of this
Agreement becomes known to the Board of Directors of the Company prior to
obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval and (B) the Board of Directors
of the Company has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure of the Board of
Directors to effect a Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary obligations to
the Companys stockholders under applicable Law or (ii) (A) the Board of
Directors of the Company has concluded in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (B) the Board of Directors of the Company
has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) that the failure of the Board of Directors to
effect a Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with the directors exercise of their fiduciary obligations to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary provided
herein, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, subject to compliance with _Section 5.02(g)_ and _Section
7.01(g)_, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.01(g)_ in order to enter into a definitive, written Company Acquisition
Agreement for a Superior Proposal if the Board of Directors of the Company has
received an Acquisition Proposal that it determines in good faith (after
consultation with its 

 



41  financial advisors and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior
Proposal and the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary obligations to
the Companys stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company
has not committed a Willful and Intentional Breach (as defined below) of this
_Section 5.02_ in connection with such Acquisition Proposal.

(g) Prior to taking any action permitted by _Section 5.02(e)_ or  _Section
5.02(f)_, (i) the Company shall give Parent at least three (3) Business Days
prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall
specify the reasons for any Recommendation Change or the material terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal, as applicable) and, in the case of
an Intervening Event involving a proposed transaction or in the case of a
Superior Proposal, no later than the time of such notice, provide Parent
an unredacted copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreement and other
material documents contemplated with or by the party making such proposal or
Superior Proposal, (ii) if requested by Parent, the Company and its
Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent during such notice
period to enable Parent to propose changes to the terms of this Agreement
intended to eliminate the need for the Board of Directors of the Company to
effect a Recommendation Change or to cause such Superior Proposal to no
longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (iii) the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have considered in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) any changes to this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent and determined that such Intervening Event would
continue to require a Recommendation Change if such changes were to be given
effect or that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal if such changes were to be given effect, as applicable, and
(iv) in the event of any change to the material facts and circumstances
relating to such Intervening Event or in any change to the form or amount of
consideration or any material terms of the transaction in the case of an
Intervening Event involving a potential transaction any change to any of the
financial terms (including the form or amount of consideration) or any
material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case,
have delivered to Parent an additional notice and a summary of the relevant
proposed transaction agreement and other material documents and a new three
(3) Business Day notice period shall commence during which time this _Section
5.02(g)_ shall apply.

(h) Nothing set forth in _Section 5.02_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company from (i) taking and disclosing
to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under
the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys
stockholders that the Board of Directors of the Company determines to make in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) in order
to fulfill its fiduciary duties or satisfy applicable state or federal
securities Laws; _provided_ , that any such position or disclosure under
clause (i) or (ii) will be deemed to be a Recommendation Change unless such
position or disclosure is either a "stop, look and listen" communication by
the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the
Exchange Act in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer, or such
position or disclosure includes a reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation.

 



42 (i) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " shall mean any confidentiality
agreement entered into after the date of this Agreement that contains
provisions restricting disclosure and use that are no less favorable in the
aggregate to the Company than those in the Mutual Confidentiality and Non-
Disclosure Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2011, as amended on August 11,
2011, between the Company and Parent (as it may be further amended, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(ii) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any offer or proposal (other than
an offer or proposal by Parent or Merger Sub), whether or not in writing, to
engage in an Acquisition Transaction from any Person or group (as such term
is used in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act).

(iii) " _Acquisition Transaction_ " shall mean (A) any transaction or series
of related transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) with one or more third parties involving (1) the purchase or
other acquisition from the Company (whether by way of a merger, share
exchange, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction) by any
Person or "group" (as defined in or under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act),
directly or indirectly, of twenty percent (20%) or more of the total
outstanding Shares, (2) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in any Person or "group" (as defined in or under
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning twenty percent (20%)
or more of the total outstanding Shares, (3) any merger, consolidation,
business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or (4) any sale, acquisition, transfer or disposition of
assets (including equity of Subsidiaries of the Company) that constitute
twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated non- "cash or cash
equivalent" assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or (B) any
liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

(iv) " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer,
exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination or similar
acquisition transaction, (A) all or substantially all of the non-"cash or
cash equivalent" assets of the Company or (B) more than fifty percent (50%) of
the outstanding Shares, with respect to which the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the Acquisition Transaction
contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal (x) would be more favorable to the
stockholders of the Company (solely in their capacity as such) than the
Merger, after taking into account all the terms and conditions of such
proposal (including the financial aspects of such proposal, the form of
consideration, the likelihood, ability to finance, conditionality and timing
of consummation of such proposal, any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions and any other aspects of the transaction described in such
proposal, including the identity of the Person or "group" (as defined in or
under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) making such proposal) and this
Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed in
writing by Parent to the Company in response to such proposal or otherwise)
and (y) would not be subject to any due diligence or financing condition.

 



43 SECTION 5.03. _Access to Information_. (a) From and after the date of

Company to incur costs and time to produce such information outside of the
ordinary course of its business; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in
this Agreement shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to permit
any inspection or disclose any information to Parent that would cause a
violation of any Allowed Contract, would cause a risk of a loss of privilege
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would constitute a violation of
applicable Laws, that is competitively sensitive information or to permit the
other party or any of its Representatives to perform any onsite procedure with
respect to any of its or its Subsidiaries properties; _provided_ , _further_
, that the Company shall take any and all reasonable action necessary to
permit such disclosure without such loss of privilege or violation of
agreement or Law. Parent hereby agrees that it shall treat any such
information in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be
obligated to grant any access or make any disclosure in violation
of applicable Laws or regulations or if it would unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of the Companys business. The Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.

 

(b) Information obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to _Section

below and except with regard to matters related to the Antitrust Laws and

Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly (i)
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and
assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as

Laws and to remove any court or regulatory orders under the Antitrust Laws
impeding the ability to consummate the Merger by the Outside Date (as defined
below).

(c) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best
efforts to certify compliance with any "second request" for additional
information or documentary material from the Department of Justice or the
Federal Trade Commission pursuant to the HSR Act within four (4) months after
receipt of such second request and to produce documents on a rolling basis.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

 

(i) Subject to _Section 5.04(b)_, Parent shall have the unilateral right to
determine whether or not the parties will litigate with any Governmental
Entities to oppose any enforcement action or remove any court or regulatory
orders impeding the ability to consummate the Merger.

 

(ii) Parent shall, on behalf of the parties, control and lead all
communications and strategy relating to the Antitrust Laws and litigation

with Governmental Entities with respect to any discussion related to the
Merger under the Antitrust Laws.

agree to use good faith efforts to (A) give each other reasonable advance
notice of all meetings with any Governmental Entity relating to the Antitrust

Governmental Entity regarding the Antitrust Laws and (F) promptly provide each
other with copies of all written communications to or from any Governmental
Entity relating to the Antitrust Laws. The parties may, as they deem
advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials
provided to the other under this _Section 5.04 _as "outside counsel only."
Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
outside counsel and previously-agreed outside economic consultants of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel or outside
economic consultants to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient
without the advance written consent of the party providing such materials.

SECTION 5.05.  _Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) Parent and Merger Sub
shall cause the surviving corporation to agree that all rights to exculpation
and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the
current or former director or officers (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") or
employees, as the case may be of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided
in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws or in any
agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect. For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time (the "
_Post-Closing Indemnification Period_ "), Parent and the Surviving Corporation
or its successor shall cause the Surviving Corporations or its successors
certificate of incorporation and bylaws to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification and exculpation of, and advancement of expenses to, the
Indemnified Parties that are at least as favorable as the
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions contained
in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws for the benefit of officers and
directors of the Company as of the date hereof, and during the Post-Closing
Indemnification Period, such provisions shall not, unless required by
applicable Law, be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, and
maintain any indemnification agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
with any of their respective directors, officers and employees existing as on
the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , that in the event that due to
dissolution of the Surviving Corporation or divestiture of its assets, Parent
is the successor, the Indemnified Parties shall have the benefit of the
provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation of, and advancement
of expenses to the Indemnified Parties in Parents certificate
of incorporation and bylaws through the Post-Closing Indemnification Period.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation or its successor to maintain in effect the Companys
current directors and officers liability insurance covering those persons
who are currently covered by the Companys

 



46  directors and officers liability insurance policy (copies of which have
been delivered by the Company to Parent and its representatives prior to the
date hereof) for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time on
terms comparable to those of such policy in effect on the date hereof;
_provided_ , that (i) the Company may, at its election, substitute therefor a
single premium tail policy with respect to such directors and officers
liability insurance with policy limits, terms and conditions at least as
favorable to the directors and officers covered under such insurance policy as
the limits, terms and conditions in the existing policies of the Company; or
(ii) if the Company does not elect to substitute as provided in clause (i)
above, then Parent may (A) substitute therefor policies of Parent, from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier, containing terms with respect to coverage
(including as coverage relates to deductibles and exclusions) and amounts no
less favorable to such directors and officers or (B) request that the
Company obtain (and, if so requested, the Company shall obtain) such extended
reporting period coverage under its existing insurance programs (to be
effective as of the Effective Time); _provided_ , _further_ , that in
connection with this  _Section 5.05(b)_, neither the Company nor Parent
shall pay a one-time premium (in connection with a single premium tail policy
described above) in excess of the amount set forth in Section 5.05(b) of the
Disclosure Letter or be obligated to pay annual premiums (in connection with
any other directors and officers insurance policy described above) in excess
of the annual premiums set forth in Section 5.05(b) of the Disclosure Letter.
It is understood and agreed that in the event such coverage cannot be
obtained for such amount or less, then the Company shall obtain the maximum
amount of coverage as may be obtained for such amount.

(c) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section 5.05_ shall
survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her
personal representatives, successors or assigns and in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by contract or otherwise. Parent shall pay all
reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be
incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this _Section 5.05_.

 

(d) The rights of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal
representatives under this _Section 5.05_ shall be in addition to any rights
such Indemnified Parties may have under the Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any agreements between such
persons and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any applicable Laws,
or under any insurance policies.

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into any other Persons, or (B)
transfers fifty percent (50%) or more of its properties or assets to any
Person, then and in each case, subject to the proviso in _Section 5.05(a)_,
proper provision shall be made so the applicable successors and assigns or
transferees assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.05_.

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation or its successor shall be subject to any
limitation imposed by applicable Law (including any limitation on the
Companys ability to indemnify its own directors and officers) and (ii) Parent
shall have no obligation to maintain the existence of the Surviving
Corporation for any specified period following the Effective Time. The
provisions of this _Section 5.05_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger.

 



47 SECTION 5.06. _Employee Matters_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, except
as set forth below, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to,
and, from and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor, in accordance with their terms, all existing
Company Employee Plans and International Employee Plans.

(b) For a one (1) year period following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each active employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Employees_ ") (i) base
compensation and bonus opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable
than were provided to the Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (ii) other employee benefits (excluding equity or equity-based
awards) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the employee
benefits (excluding equity or equity-based awards) that were provided to the
Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation from terminating the employment of any Company
Employee.

(c) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, as of
the Closing Date, each Company Employee receives credit for service with the
Company (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides such past
service credit under the Company Employee Plans and the International Employee
Plans) for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, vacation
entitlement and level of severance benefits under each of the comparable
employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the relevant Subsidiary, as applicable (" _Parent Plans_ "),
in which such Company Employee becomes a participant; _provided_ , that no
such service recognition shall result in any duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any and all Parent Plans in which such Company Employee
becomes entitled to participate to the extent coverage under such Parent Plan
is comparable to a Company Employee Plan or International Employee Plan in
which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective
Time. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, as of the Closing Date,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or relevant Subsidiary
to, credit to Company Employees the amount of vacation time that such
employees had accrued under any applicable Company Employee Plan or
International Employee Plan as of the Closing Date. With respect to each
health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent for the benefit of any
Company Employees, the Surviving Corporation or the relevant Subsidiary and
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Parent
Plan to be waived for each Company Employee and his or her covered dependents,
unless and to the extent the individual, immediately prior to entry in the
Parent Plans, was subject to such conditions under the comparable Company
Employee Plan or International Employee Plan, as applicable, and (ii) to cause
each Company Employee to be given credit under such plan for all amounts paid
by such Company Employee under any similar Company Employee Plan or
International Employee Plan for the plan year that includes the Closing Date
for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums
as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the applicable plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the relevant Subsidiary, as applicable, for the plan year in
which the Closing Date occurs.

 



48 (d) Parent and the Company agree (i) that prior to the Closing the Company may
adopt a retention program for employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth on Section 5.06(d) of
the Disclosure Letter and (ii) to the terms and conditions set forth on
Section 5.06(d) of the Disclosure Letter relating to payment of 2011 annual
bonuses.

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
but in no event later than seventy-five (75) days following the date of this
Agreement, with respect to each Section 16 Officer and each other
"disqualified individual" of the Company (as defined in Section 280G(c) of
the Code) who is entitled to a gross-up for excise Taxes paid pursuant to
Section 4999 of the Code, the Company shall furnish (i) a schedule that sets
forth (A) the Companys reasonable, good faith estimate of the maximum amount
that could be paid to such disqualified individual as a result of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination with any
other event), and (B) the "base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of
the Code) for each such individual, and (ii) underlying documentation on which
such calculations are based if such information is reasonably requested by
Parent. The Company and the Parent agree to use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate to update the foregoing information prior to Closing as
reasonably requested by Parent.

(f) The provisions of this _Section 5.06_ are for the sole benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Company Employee), other than the
Parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable or other rights or remedies under or by reason of
any provision of this Agreement. No provision in this Agreement shall modify
or amend any Company Employee Plan, International Employee Plan or Parent Plan
unless this Agreement explicitly states that the provision "amends" such
Company Employee Plan, International Employee Plan or Parent Plan. This shall
not prevent the parties entitled to enforce this Agreement from enforcing any
provision in this Agreement, but no other party shall be entitled to enforce
any provision in this Agreement on the grounds that it is an amendment to
such Company Employee Plan, International Employee Plan or Parent Plan. If a
party not entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a lawsuit or other action
to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to such Company
Employee Plan, International Employee Plan or Parent Plan and that provision
is construed to be such an amendment despite not being explicitly designated
as one in this Agreement, that provision shall lapse retroactively as of its
inception, thereby precluding it from having any amendatory effect.

(g) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
but no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date, the Company shall use good faith, commercially reasonable efforts to
provide or make available to Parent (to the extent such information can be
provided in accordance with applicable data privacy Laws): (i) a true, correct
and complete list of (A) with respect to each Existing Stock Option, the name
of the applicable holder, the grant date of such Existing Stock Option, the
number of Shares such holder is entitled to receive upon the exercise of such
Existing Stock Option and the

 



49  corresponding exercise price, vesting schedule and plan pursuant to which
such Existing Stock Option was granted, (B) with respect to each Existing
Restricted Stock Award, the name of the applicable holder, the number of
Shares subject to such Existing Restricted Stock Award, the grant date of such
Existing Restricted Stock Award, the vesting schedule of such Existing
Restricted Stock Award and the plan pursuant to which such Existing
Restricted Stock Award was granted, (C) with respect to each Existing RSU
Award, the name of the applicable holder, the number of Shares subject to such
Existing RSU Award, the grant date of such Existing RSU Award, the
vesting schedule of such Existing RSU Award and the plan pursuant to which
such Existing RSU Award was granted, and (D) with respect to each Existing DSU
Award, the name of the applicable holder, the number of Shares subject to such
Existing DSU Award, the grant date of such Existing DSU Award, the vesting
schedule of such Existing DSU Award and the plan pursuant to which such
Existing DSU Award was granted; and (ii) true, correct and complete copies of
each material International Employee Plan.

(h) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all necessary
action in order to comply with all applicable notification, consultation, and
consent requirements with respect to all unions, works councils, employee
committees and similar bodies in respect of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and Parent agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of the foregoing.

 

SECTION 5.07. _Takeover Laws_. The Company shall take all reasonable steps to
exclude the applicability of, or to assist in any challenge by Parent or
Merger Sub to the validity or applicability to the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement of, any Takeover Laws.

Statement (the " _Preliminary Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the Merger as
required by the Exchange Act. The Company shall obtain and furnish the
information required to be included in the Preliminary Proxy Statement, shall
provide Parent with, and consult with Parent regarding, any comments that may
be received from the SEC or its staff with respect thereto, shall, subject to
the prior review of Parent, respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any such comments made by the SEC or its staff with respect to the Preliminary
Proxy Statement, shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys
stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable after the resolution of any
such comments and shall use its reasonable best efforts (subject to the right
to make a Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 5.02_) to obtain
the necessary approval of the Merger by its stockholders. If, at any time
prior to the Special Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger), should be discovered
by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be prepared by the Company and

 



50  subject to review and approval by Parent (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld) filed with the SEC, and to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. Except as
_Section 5.02_ expressly permits, the Proxy Statement shall include the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company that the stockholders

or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement, in accordance with customary timing in consultation
with Parent, take all action necessary to establish a record date for, duly
call, give notice of, and, after the mailing of the Proxy Statement, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Special Meeting_ ") for the
purpose of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval required in connection
with this Agreement and the Merger, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause such meeting to occur as soon as reasonably practicable. Except as
specifically permitted by _Section 5.02_, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall continue to recommend that the Companys stockholders vote
in favor of the adoption of the agreement of merger (as such term is used in
Section 251 of the Corporation Law) contained in this Agreement and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite
Stockholder Approval in order to consummate the Merger.

SECTION 5.09. _Securityholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate, subject to a customary joint defense
agreement, in, but not control, the defense or settlement of any litigation
against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and no settlement shall be agreed to without
Parents prior consent.

SECTION 5.10. _Press Releases_. Except with respect to any Recommendation
Change made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent will consult with and provide each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon any press release or other public statement or comment prior to
the issuance of such press release or other public statement or comment
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated in this Agreement
and shall not issue any such press release or other public statement or
comment prior to such consultation except as may be required by Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange. Parent and the Company agree to issue a joint press release
announcing this Agreement.

prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted to take such
steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause disposition
of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-Action
Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters.

 



51 SECTION 5.12. _Parent Approval_. Immediately following the execution of
this Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver, in accordance with Section
228 of the Corporation Law and in its capacity as the sole stockholder of
Merger Sub, a written consent adopting the agreement and plan of merger (as
such term is used in Section 251 of the Corporation Law) contained in this
Agreement.

SECTION 5.13. _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
Companys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

SECTION 5.14. _Certain Transfer Taxes_. Parent shall pay the amount of any
documentary, sales, use, real property transfer, real property gains,
registration, value-added, transfer, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes,
fees, and costs together with any interest thereon, penalties, fines, costs,
additions to Tax or additional amounts with respect thereto, imposed in
connection with this Agreement or the Merger.

SECTION 5.15. _Intellectual Property_. If either party learns of the existence
of any potential Section 3.14(f) Event, including any contract with the
potential to cause a Section 3.14(f) Event, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to eliminate the occurrence of or, if not possible,
reduce the effect of such situation, and in all instances shall cooperate with
the reasonable direction of Parent in connection therewith. Without limiting
the foregoing, the Company shall not enter into any contract nor make any
other commitment or obligation that may give rise to a potential Section
3.14(f) Event without the prior written consent of Parent.

Effective Time (with any termination by Parent also being an effective
termination by Merger Sub):

 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if any court of competent jurisdiction or

true and correct, breach or failure to perform is not cured by Parent or
Merger Sub within thirty (30) days following written notice to Parent, or
which by its nature or timing is not capable of being cured;

(g) by the Company, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite

Company enters into a Company Acquisition Agreement (unless consented to
by Parent).

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),

of such termination to the other party in accordance with _Section 8.04_,
specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such
termination is effected. The party electing to extend the Outside Date
pursuant to clause (b) of this _Section 7.01_ shall give written notice of
such election to the other party in accordance with _Section 8.04_, and (1)
in the case of Parent electing to extend the Outside Date, such notice shall
specify that Parent has determined to extend the Outside Date; (2) in the case

Merger is abandoned pursuant to _Section 7.01_, this Agreement, except for
the provisions of _Section 5.03_, _Section 7.02_, _Section 7.03_ and
_Article VIII_ , shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability on the part of any party or its directors, officers or stockholders.
Nothing in this _Section 7.02_ shall relieve any party to this Agreement of
liability for any Willful Breach (as defined below) of this
Agreement occurring prior to such termination. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, after the termination of this Agreement, and
irrespective of whether or not there is a payment of the Parent Termination
Fee, the Company may nonetheless pursue, and Parent and Merger Sub shall be
responsible for as damages, damages (subject to any limitations on amount set
forth in _Section 8.03(c)_) arising or resulting from any Willful Breach by
Parent of this Agreement and, in any determination of such damages, the court
shall be permitted to take into account any damages to, and the Company shall
be entitled to seek such stockholder damages on behalf of the stockholders as
a group, as if such stockholders had been able to bring an action on their
own behalf. Without limiting the Companys rights pursuant to the previous
sentence, the parties confirm that nothing in this _Section 7.02_ or in
_Section 8.07_ is intended to permit any stockholders to bring any action as
third party beneficiaries.

SECTION 7.03. _Fees and Expenses_. (a) Whether or not the Merger is
consummated, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions

such expenses.

 



56 (b) The Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the Company Termination
Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by Parent, as follows:

 

(i) if (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (1) _Section 7.01(c)_
prior to a vote by the stockholders of the Company at the Special Meeting on
the adoption of the agreement of merger (as such term is used in Section 251
of the Corporation Law) and the conditions in _Section 6.01(b)_ (with respect
to Orders under the Antitrust Laws) and _Section 6.01(c)_ shall have been
satisfied, (2) _Section 7.01(d)_ or (3) _Section 7.01(e)_; (B) following
the date hereof and prior to the termination of this Agreement, a
proposal for an Acquisition Transaction shall have been made to the Company
or shall have been made directly to the stockholders of the Company generally
or shall have otherwise become publicly known or any Person shall have
publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make such a
proposal, in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 7.01(d)_, and
such proposal or announcement of an intention to make such proposal shall not
have been publicly and irrevocably withdrawn at least ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Special Meeting shall have been made to the Company or the
stockholders of the Company; and (C) within twelve (12) months following the
termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into an agreement providing
for, or consummates, a Qualifying Acquisition Transaction (as defined below),
then the Company shall pay or cause to be paid the Company Termination Fee to
Parent upon the consummation of a Qualifying Acquisition Transaction;

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.01(h)_,
then the Company shall pay or cause to be paid the Company Termination Fee
promptly, and in any event not more than two (2) Business Days following such
termination; or

 

(iii) if this Agreement is terminated (A) by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.01(g)_ or (B) pursuant to _Section 7.01(d)_ and a Recommendation Change in
response to an Intervening Event shall have been in effect at the time of the
Special Meeting, then concurrently with (and as a condition to) such
termination, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid the Company
Termination Fee to Parent.

(iv) As used herein " _Company Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount
equal to $375 million.

(v) As used herein, " _Qualifying Acquisition Transaction_ " means any
Acquisition Transaction involving (A) fifty percent (50%) or more of the non-
"cash or cash equivalent" assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole; or (B) acquisition by any person (other than Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates) of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding
Shares.

(vi) Notwithstanding, anything to the contrary in this Agreement, payment of
the Company Termination Fee shall constitute liquidated damages, and from and
after 

 



57  such termination as described in this _Section 7.03(b)_, the Company shall
have no further liability of any kind for any reason in connection with this
Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby other than as provided under
this _Section 7.03(b)_. In no event shall Parent be entitled to the Company
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the
Company (i) (A) pursuant to  _Section 7.01(b)_, only in connection with any
Order or action by a Governmental Entity with respect to the Antitrust Laws,
or (B) pursuant to _Section 7.01(c)_ and, in the case of this clause (B), at
the time of such termination, the conditions set forth in at least one of
_Section 6.01(b)_ (as a result of an Order or Law under the Antitrust Laws)
or _Section 6.01(c)_ shall not have been satisfied, (ii) the failure of one
or more of the conditions in _Section 6.01(b)_ or _Section 6.01(c)_ to be
satisfied is not primarily caused by any material Willful and Intentional
Breach of _Section 5.04_ of this Agreement by the Company, and (iii) all
other conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the Merger set forth in _Section 6.01_ and _Section 6.02_ have been
satisfied or waived (and, in the case of those conditions that by their terms
are to be satisfied at the Closing, such conditions would be satisfied if the
Closing were to occur), then Parent shall pay to the Company or the Companys
designee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by the Company, a cash amount (the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ ") equal to $2.5 billion (subject to adjustment as provided
in _Section 8.03(c)_) within two (2) Business Days of termination, it being
understood that in no event shall the Company be entitled to the Parent
Termination Fee referred to in this _Section 7.03(c)_ on more than one
occasion (it being further understood that any amount actually paid of the
Parent Termination Fee is subject to a credit pursuant to _Section
8.03(c)_).

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this  _Section
7.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor the Company would have
entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to
promptly pay any amounts due pursuant to this _Section 7.03_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent or the Company, respectively, commences a suit
which results in a judgment against the Company or Parent, respectively, for
the amount of the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee,
respectively, set forth in this _Section 7.03_, the Company or Parent,
respectively, shall pay the Parents or the Companys, respectively,
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses of enforcement) in connection with such suit, together with interest
on the amounts owed at the prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as
published in the _Wall Street Journal_ from the date such amounts were
required to be paid until the date actually received by Parent or the Company,
as applicable.

SECTION 7.04. _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, at any time
before or after receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval but, after
receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, no amendment shall be made
which decreases the Merger Consideration or which adversely affects the rights
of the Companys stockholders hereunder without the approval of the
stockholders of the Company. This Agreement may not be amended, changed,
supplemented or otherwise modified except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of all of the parties.

 



58 SECTION 7.05. _Extension; Waiver; Remedies_. (a) At any time prior to
the Effective Time, each party hereto may (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein by any other applicable party or in any document,
certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto by any other applicable party

conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in

remedy provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof
at law or in equity, or to insist upon compliance by any other party hereto
with its obligations hereunder, and any custom or practice of the parties at
variance with the terms hereof, shall not constitute a waiver by such party of
its right to exercise any such or other right, power or remedy or to demand
such compliance.

 

ARTICLE VIII

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

SECTION 8.01. _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (including the
exhibits and schedules to this Agreement) and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement and supersedes all oral agreements and
understandings and all written agreements prior to the date hereof between or
on behalf of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by operation of law or
otherwise without the prior written consent of the other parties _provided_ ,
that Parent or Merger Sub may assign any of their respective rights and
obligations to any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, but no such
assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, of its
obligations hereunder.

SECTION 8.02. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 



59 SECTION 8.03. _Enforcement of the Agreement; Jurisdiction; Certain
Limitations_. (a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively
in the Delaware Court of Chancery, or in the event (but only in the event)
that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such action or
proceeding, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware
or another court sitting in the state of Delaware, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In addition,
each of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably agrees that any legal action
or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising under this Agreement, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
under this Agreement brought by the other party to this Agreement or its
successors or assigns shall be brought and determined exclusively in the
Delaware Court of Chancery, or in the event (but only in the event) that such
court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such action or
proceeding, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware
or another court sitting in the state of Delaware. Each of the parties to this
Agreement hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim
or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-
named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with
this _Section 8.03_, (b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter of this
Agreement, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of any process, summons,
notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective addresses set
forth in _Section 8.04_ shall be effective service of process for any
proceeding arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

 

(b) EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR 

 



60  OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 8.03(B)_.

 

(c) In addition to and without prejudice to the Companys right to obtain an
injunction or specific performance of this Agreement, the Company agrees
that, to the extent it makes claims (" _Antitrust Efforts Claims_ ") in
respect of breaches by Parent or Merger Sub of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement that constitutes or
results in a breach of _Section 5.04_ to the extent related to or resulting
in the failure of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.01(b)_ (as a result
of an Order or Law under the Antitrust Laws) or  _Section 6.01(c)_ to have
been satisfied, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to all Antitrust
Efforts Claims shall be (x) subject to and in accordance with _Section 7.02_
and (y) limited to a maximum amount equal to the excess of $3.5 billion _over_
the amount of the Parent Termination Fee previously paid to the Company. To
the extent any amounts are paid to the Company pursuant to Antitrust Efforts
Claims before the payment of the Parent Termination Fee, the amount of the
Parent Termination Fee shall be reduced to the extent (if any) so that the sum
of all amounts previously paid pursuant to the Antitrust Efforts Claims
_plus_ the amount of the Parent Termination Fee will equal the same aggregate
amounts as would have been payable pursuant to the previous sentence if the
Parent Termination Fee had been paid prior to all payments with respect
to Antitrust Efforts Claims.

SECTION 8.04. _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be given (and shall be deemed to have been
duly received if given) by hand delivery in writing or by facsimile or
