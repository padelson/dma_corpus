                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

          THIS ACQUISITION AGREEMENT AND AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this

Family Clothing, Inc., a Tennessee corporation (the "Company"), GFC Enterprises,
Inc., a Tennessee corporation ("Acquisition Corp."), and GFC Holding Corp., a
Delaware corporation ("Parent").

                                    RECITALS

          WHEREAS, a special committee consisting solely of disinterested
directors (the "Special Committee") of the board of directors of the Company
(the "Company Board") has recommended to the Company Board that it approve of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

          WHEREAS, the Company Board, and the board of directors of each of
Parent and Acquisition Corp. have approved, and deem it advisable and in the
best interests of their respective shareholders to consummate, the acquisition
of the Company by Parent upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein;

          WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, it is proposed that Acquisition Corp.
make the Offer (as defined in Section 1.01(a)) to acquire all of the shares of
the Company's common stock, no par value per share (the "Common Shares"), issued
and outstanding for $8.00 per Common Share in cash, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein;

          WHEREAS, subject to any additional conditions set forth herein, also
in furtherance thereof, if Acquisition Corp. purchases pursuant to the Offer at
least fifty-one percent (51%) of the Common Shares determined on a Fully-Diluted
Basis, it is proposed that the parties hereto consummate the merger of
Acquisition Corp. into the Company on the terms set forth herein;

          WHEREAS, also in furtherance of such acquisition, the Special
Committee and board of directors of each of Parent and Acquisition Corp. have
approved this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger following the Offer in
accordance with the Tennessee Business Corporation Act (the "TBCA") and the
Tennessee Investor Protection Act (together with the TBCA, the "Tenn. Acts")
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

          WHEREAS, the Special Committee and the Company Board have each
determined that the consideration to be paid for each Common Share in the Offer
and the Merger is fair to the holders of the Common Shares and has resolved to
recommend that the holders of the Common Shares accept the Offer and approve
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, in
each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

          WHEREAS, Parent, Acquisition Corp. and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with
the Offer and the Merger;
<PAGE>
          WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parent and Acquisition Corp.
entering into this Agreement and incurring the obligations set forth herein, the
Company, concurrently herewith, is entering into a Stock Option Agreement (the
"Acquisition Corp. Stock Option Agreement"), dated as of the date hereof, with
Parent and Acquisition Corp. pursuant to which the Company is granting to
Acquisition Corp. an option to purchase Common Shares upon the terms and subject
to the conditions as set forth in the Acquisition Corp. Stock Option Agreement;
and

          WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parent and Acquisition Corp.
entering into this Agreement and incurring the obligations set forth herein,
certain shareholders of the Company ("Certain Principal Shareholders") have
entered into an agreement with Parent and Acquisition Corp. (the "Support
Agreement" and, together with this Agreement and the Acquisition Corp. Stock
Option Agreement, the "Transaction Agreements") pursuant to which Certain
Principal Shareholders have agreed to take specified actions in furtherance of
the Offer and the Merger.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE 1

                                    THE OFFER

     1.01 The Offer.

          (a) Subject only to any Laws or Orders preventing commencement of the
Offer, provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Article 8 hereof and that the Company complies with its covenants set forth
in this Agreement, then Acquisition Corp. shall, as promptly as practicable, but
not later than the tenth (10th) Business Day after the date hereof (unless due
to a Force Majeure Event), commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) an offer (the
"Offer") to purchase all of the Common Shares at a price of $8.00 per share in
cash (such price, or such higher price per Common Share as may be paid in the
Offer, the "Offer Price"), subject to the condition that the holders of Common
Shares have validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the
Offer a number of Common Shares which, together with the Common Shares
beneficially owned by Parent or Acquisition Corp., represents at least 51% of
the Common Shares determined on a Fully-Diluted Basis (the "Minimum Condition")
and subject to the other conditions set forth in Annex A hereto. Subject to the
prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the prior satisfaction (or
waiver in writing by Acquisition Corp.) of the other conditions of the Offer set
forth in Annex A, Acquisition Corp. shall use reasonable best efforts to
consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and to accept for payment and
pay for all of the Common Shares that are tendered pursuant to the Offer as soon
as it is legally permitted to do so under applicable Law. The date on which all
of the Common Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn
have been accepted for payment and paid for is referred to herein as the "Offer
Payment Date" The obligations of Acquisition Corp. to


                                       2
<PAGE>
commence the Offer and to accept for payment and pay for the Common Shares
validly tendered on or prior to the expiration of the Offer and not withdrawn
shall be subject only to the Minimum Condition and the other conditions set
forth in Annex A hereto. The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to
purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") containing the terms set forth in this
Agreement, the Minimum Condition and the other conditions set forth in Annex A
hereto. The Offer shall remain open until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
day immediately following the twentieth Business Day of the Offer (as such term
is defined in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act), unless Acquisition Corp.
shall have extended the time for which the Offer is open pursuant to this
Section 1.01 or as may be required by Law. Parent and Acquisition Corp.
expressly reserve the right to modify the terms of the Offer, except that,
without the prior written consent of the Company, neither Parent nor Acquisition
Corp. shall decrease the Offer Price, decrease the number of Common Shares
sought, increase or decrease the required percentage of, or waive, the Minimum
Condition, change the form of or reduce the consideration in the Offer or add to
or amend any of the conditions of the Offer set forth in Annex A hereto in any
manner which would be adverse to the holders of the Common Shares (other than
with respect to insignificant changes or amendments); provided, however, (i) if
on the initially scheduled expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended)
any of the conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied or waived,
Acquisition Corp. may, from time to time, in its sole discretion, extend the
Offer (provided that no such extension pursuant to this sentence shall extend
the Offer beyond the date of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article 8), (ii) if on or before the initially scheduled expiration date of the
Offer (as it may be extended) any of the conditions to the Offer have not been
satisfied or waived, the Company shall have the option to require Acquisition
Corp. to extend the Offer for a period of up to the number of Business Days
equal to (X) ten minus (Y) the number of Business Days of any Force Majeure
Period and minus (Z) the number of Business Days of any Commencement Delay
Election, if the Company is not in material breach of its covenants under this
Agreement, the Company provides notice to Parent and Acquisition Corp. of its
election to extend the expiration date of the Offer pursuant to clause (ii) of
this Section 1.01 and the Company pays certain Expenses of Parent and
Acquisition Corp. pursuant to Section 9.01 (the "Company Extension Election")
and (iii) Acquisition Corp. may, in its sole discretion, provide a subsequent
offering period in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. In
addition, the Offer Price may be increased, and, in connection therewith, the
Offer may be extended, to the extent required by applicable federal securities
laws, in each case without the consent of the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if, as of immediately prior to the expiration date of the Offer (as
it may be extended), the Common Shares tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer constitute less than 90% of the Common Shares determined on a
Fully-Diluted Basis, Acquisition Corp. may, from time to time in its sole
discretion, extend the Offer for a period not to exceed twenty Business Days in
the aggregate, notwithstanding that all conditions to the Offer are satisfied as
of such expiration date of the Offer.

          (b) On the date the Offer is commenced, Parent and Acquisition Corp.
shall file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with
all amendments and supplements thereto and including the exhibits thereto, the
"Schedule TO"). The Schedule TO will include, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase
and a form of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (collectively,
together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the "Offer Documents").
Parent and Acquisition Corp. further agree to take all steps necessary to cause
the


                                       3
<PAGE>
Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Common Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. Each of Parent and Acquisition Corp., on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, agrees promptly to correct any information provided
by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect and Acquisition Corp. further
agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected
to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Common Shares, in
each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws;
provided that the costs and expenses of filing and disseminating the corrected
Offer Documents shall be borne by the Company if any such corrections are
required as a result of information provided by the Company becoming false and
misleading in any material respect. The Company and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO before it is
filed with the SEC. In addition, Parent and Acquisition Corp. agree to provide
the Company and its counsel in writing with any written comments Parent,
Acquisition Corp. or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such
comments, and shall provide the Company and its counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to comment on the proposed responses thereto.

          (c) Parent shall engage D.F. King & Co., Inc. or another information
agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as information agent in
connection with, and through the consummation of, the Offer.

     1.02 Company Actions.

          (a) The Company hereby approves and consents to the Offer, the Merger
and the other Transactions and represents that (i) the Company Board has, at a
meeting duly called and held, unanimously (A) approved each of the Transaction
Agreements and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, (B)
recommended that the holders of Common Shares accept the Offer, tender their
Common Shares pursuant to the Offer and approve and adopt this Agreement and the
Merger, (C) determined that each of the Transaction Agreements and the
Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best
interests of the shareholders of the Company, (D) determined that the
consideration to be paid for each Common Share in the Offer and the Merger is
fair to the shareholders of the Company, and (E) declared that each of the
Transaction Agreements is advisable, and (ii) Rothschild Inc. has delivered to
the Company Board its written opinion that the consideration to be received by
the Company's shareholders other than Robert M. Goodfriend and his immediate
family and family trusts in respect of each Common Share pursuant to the Offer
and the Merger is fair to such shareholders from a financial point of view.

          (b) Concurrently with the commencement of the Offer, the Company shall
file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including the exhibits
thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") which shall, subject to the fiduciary duties of
the Company's directors under applicable Law and to the provisions of this
Agreement, contain the recommendation referenced in clause (v) of Section 4.21
hereof (the "Company Tender Recommendation"). The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion of the Company Tender Recommendation in the Offer Documents. The
Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9
to be filed with


                                       4
<PAGE>
the SEC and to be disseminated to all holders of Common Shares, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Each of the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition Corp., on the other hand,
agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false and
misleading in any material respect and the Company further agrees to take all
steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the
SEC and to be disseminated to all holders of the Common Shares, in each case as
required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent, Acquisition Corp. and
their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment thereto before it is filed with the SEC. In
addition, the Company agrees to provide Parent, Acquisition Corp. and their
counsel in writing with any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from
time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9
promptly after the receipt of such comments, and shall provide Parent and
Acquisition Corp. with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposed
responses thereto.

          (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly (but in
any event within five Business Days) after the date hereof, furnish or cause to
be furnished to Acquisition Corp. mailing labels, security position listings and
any available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of the
record holders of the Common Shares as of the most recent practicable date prior
to delivery of such information and all updates to such information, and shall
furnish Acquisition Corp. with such information and assistance as Acquisition
Corp. or any of its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to
the record and beneficial holders of the Common Shares. Subject to applicable
law or legal process and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate
the Offer Documents, Parent and Acquisition Corp. shall hold in confidence the
information contained in any of such labels and lists and the additional
information referred to in the preceding sentence, shall use such information
only in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, and,
if this Agreement is terminated, shall upon the request of the Company deliver
or cause to be delivered to the Company, or cause to be destroyed, all copies of
such information then in its possession or the possession of its agents or
representatives.

     1.03 Directors.

          (a) Promptly upon the purchase of and payment for any Common Shares by
Parent, Acquisition Corp. and/or any of their Affiliates pursuant to the Offer,
Parent shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to
the next whole number, on the Company Board as is equal to the product of the
total number of directors on such Company Board (giving effect to the directors
designated by Parent pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage
that the aggregate number of Common Shares beneficially owned by Parent,
Acquisition Corp. and/or any of their respective Affiliates bears to the total
number of Common Shares then issued and outstanding. The Company shall, upon the
request of Parent, use its best efforts to promptly (but in any event within two
Business Days after receipt of such request) either increase the size of the
Company Board, including by amending the by-laws of the Company if necessary to
so increase the size of the Company Board, or secure the resignations of such
number of its incumbent directors, or both, as is necessary to enable Parent's
designees to be so elected or appointed to the Company Board, and shall cause
Parent's designees to be so elected or appointed at such time. At such time, the
Company shall, upon the request of Parent,


                                       5
<PAGE>
also cause Persons designated by Parent to constitute the same percentage
(rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of (i) each
committee of the Company Board, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body)
of each Subsidiary (as defined in Section 3.01 hereof) of the Company (each a
"Sub Board") and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each Sub Board, in
each case only to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the rules of any
stock exchange or quotation system on which the Common Shares are listed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the Effective Time (as defined in Section
2.02 hereof), neither Parent nor Acquisition Corp. shall remove (other than for
cause) any of the Designated Company Directors (as defined in Section 1.03(b)
below) or request that any of the Designated Company Directors resign from the
Company Board; provided that, subsequent to the purchase of and payment for
Common Shares pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall always be entitled to have its
designees represent a majority of the entire Company Board. The Company's
obligations under this Section 1.03(a) shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly
take all actions required pursuant to such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order
to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.03(a), including mailing to
shareholders the information required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is
necessary to enable Parent's designees to be elected or appointed to the Company
Board. Parent or Acquisition Corp. will supply the Company any information with
respect to either of them and their nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates
required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. The provisions of this Section
1.03(a) are in addition to and shall not limit any rights which Acquisition
Corp., Parent or any of their Affiliates may have as a holder or Beneficial
Owner of Common Shares as a matter of Law with respect to the election of
directors or otherwise.

          (b) Prior to the purchase of and payment for any Common Shares by
Parent, Acquisition Corp. and/or any of their Affiliates pursuant to the Offer,
(i) to effect the transactions contemplated by Section 1.03(a) hereof, the
Company Board shall approve, and shall not have withdrawn or amended,
resolutions (x) to increase the number of members of the Company Board from five
to up to ten directors (as determined by Parent in its sole discretion), to be
effective at such time as Parent, Acquisition Corp. and/or any of their
Affiliates purchases any Common Shares, and (y) to elect Persons designated by
Parent prior to consummation of the transactions contemplated by Section 1.03(a)
to fill the vacancies created by such increase in the number of directors,
effective upon such increase and (ii) each of the directors of the Company prior
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by Section 1.03(a) hereof,
other than three directors of the Company determined by Acquisition Corp. in its
sole and absolute discretion (the "Designated Company Directors"), shall deliver
to the Company a letter stating that such director has irrevocably resigned from
the Company Board, and from each committee thereof, effective at such time as
Parent, Acquisition Corp. and/or any of their Affiliates purchases Common Shares
to the extent such resignations are necessary to permit all of Parent's
designees to which Parent is entitled pursuant to Section 1.03(a) hereof to be
elected or appointed to the Company Board.

          (c) In the event that Parent's designees are elected or appointed to
the Company Board, until the Effective Time, the Company Board shall have at
least such number of directors as may be required by the rules of the Nasdaq
National Market, Inc. ("Nasdaq") or the federal securities laws and the SEC
rules and regulations thereunder who are considered independent directors within
the meaning of the rules of Nasdaq ("Independent Directors"),


                                       6
<PAGE>
provided that, in such event, if the number of Independent Directors shall be
reduced below the number of directors as may be required by such rules and
regulations and the federal securities laws and the SEC rules and regulation
thereunder for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Independent Director(s)
shall be entitled to designate persons to fill such vacancies who shall be
deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no
other Independent Director then remains, the other directors shall designate
such number of directors as may be required by the rules of Nasdaq and the
federal securities laws and the SEC rules and regulation thereunder, to fill
such vacancies who shall not be shareholders or affiliates of Parent or
Acquisition Corp., and such Persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors
for purposes of this Agreement.

          (d) From and after the time, if any, that Parent's designees
constitute a majority of the Company Board, any amendment of this Agreement, any
termination of this Agreement by the Company, any extension of time for
performance of any of the obligations of Parent or Acquisition Corp. hereunder,
any waiver of any condition or any of the Company's rights hereunder or other
action by the Company hereunder that adversely affects the holders of Common
Shares may be effected only by the action of a majority of the Independent
Directors, including, for these purposes, the vote of a majority of the
Designated Company Directors, which action shall be deemed to constitute the
action of the full Company Board; provided that, if there shall be no Designated
Company Directors, such actions may be effected by majority vote of the entire
Company Board.

Shares, the Company or Acquisition Corp., each Common Share that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than those Common
Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.01(b) shall be canceled and
extinguished and converted into the right to receive the Offer Price (the
"Merger Consideration"), payable to the holder thereof, without interest or
dividends thereon, less any applicable withholding of taxes, in the manner
provided in Section 3.03. All such Common Shares, when so converted, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and each holder of a
certificate or certificates representing any such Common Shares shall cease to

consideration specified in the preceding sentence.

          (b) Cancellation of Certain Common Shares. As of the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
Common Shares, the Company or Acquisition Corp., each Common Share that is owned
by the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary as treasury stock or otherwise or
owned by Acquisition Corp. or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor.

          (c) Capital Stock of Acquisition Corp.. As of the Effective Time, each
share of common stock, no par value per share, of Acquisition Corp.
("Acquisition Corp. Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holders of Acquisition Corp. Common Stock, the Company or
Acquisition Corp., be converted into three hundred thirty thousand (330,000)
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock, no par
value per share, of the Surviving Corporation ("Surviving Corporation Common
Stock"). Each certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
represented issued and outstanding shares of Acquisition Corp. Common Stock
shall, from and after the Effective Time, automatically and without the
necessity of presenting the same for exchange, represent the shares of the
Surviving Corporation capital stock into which such shares have been converted
pursuant to the terms hereof; provided, however, that the record holder thereof
shall receive, upon surrender of any such certificate, a certificate
representing the shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock into which the
shares of Acquisition Corp. Common Stock formerly represented thereby shall have
been converted pursuant to the terms hereof.

     3.02 Options; Stock Plans.

          (a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Option" means each
outstanding unexercised option to purchase Common Shares, whether or not then
vested or fully


                                       9
<PAGE>
exercisable, granted on or prior to the date hereof to any current or former
employee or director of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or any
other person, whether under any stock option plan or otherwise (including,
without limitation, under the 1991 Stock Incentive Plan (the "1991 Plan"), the
1993 Stock Option Plan, the Discounted Stock Option Plan for Directors (the
"Director Plan"), the 1997 Stock Option Plan and the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan)
(collectively, the "Stock Plans").

          (b) Prior to the Offer Payment Date, (i) the Company shall clarify its
interpretations of the 1991 Plan and the Director Plan and take such other
actions reasonably requested by Parent or Acquisition Corp. to clarify that at
the Effective Time, all Options issued under the 1991 Plan and the Director Plan
shall be converted into the right to receive Option Consideration (as defined
below) and (ii) the Company shall take all actions necessary so that (A)
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding Option granted under
the Stock Plans, including each outstanding Option held by those holders of
record listed on the Options Schedule attached hereto, shall become immediately
vested and exercisable in full and (B) at the Effective Time, all Options shall
be canceled, in each case, in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of the
Stock Plans under which such Options were granted. In consideration of such
cancellation, each holder of an Option canceled in accordance with this Section
3.02(b) will be entitled to receive in settlement of such Option as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than 10 Business
Days after the Effective Time, a cash payment from the Payment Fund (as defined
in Section 3.03), subject to any required withholding of taxes, equal to the
product of (i) the total number of Common Shares otherwise issuable upon
exercise of such Option and (ii) the amount, if any, by which the Merger
Consideration per Common Share exceeds the applicable exercise price per Common
Share otherwise issuable upon exercise of such Option (the "Option
Consideration"); provided, however, that with respect to any person subject to
Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any such amount shall be paid as soon as
practicable after the first date payment can be made without liability to such
person under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.

          (c) If requested by Parent or Acquisition Corp., the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each holder of an Option issued
pursuant to the Stock Plans to execute a written acknowledgment of such holder
that effective as of the Effective Date, (i) the payment of the Option
Consideration, if any, will satisfy in full the Company's obligation to such
person pursuant to such Option and (ii) subject to the payment of the Option
Consideration, if any, all Options held by such holder shall, without any action
on the part of the Company or the holder, be deemed terminated, canceled, void
and of no further force and effect as between the Company and the holder and
neither party shall have any further rights or obligations with respect thereto.
Such written acknowledgment shall be substantially in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit D.

          (d) Prior to the consummation of the acquisition of Common Shares by
Acquisition Corp. pursuant to the Offer, the Company shall take all actions
(including, if appropriate, amending the terms of the relevant Stock Plans or
amending or waiving relevant agreements providing for vesting conditions on
Common Shares or Options therefor) that are necessary to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Section 3.02.


                                       10
<PAGE>
          (e) Except as otherwise provided herein or agreed to in writing by
Parent and the Company or as may be necessary to administer Options remaining
outstanding following the Effective Time, the Stock Plans shall terminate
effective as of the Effective Time and no participant in the Stock Plans shall
thereafter be granted any rights thereunder to acquire any equity securities of
the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any Subsidiary of any of the
foregoing.

          (f) The Company covenants that prior to the Effective Time it will
take all actions necessary under that certain SEC no-action letter, dated
January 12, 1999, to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, to provide that the
cancellation, cash-out and conversion of Options, pursuant to this Section 3.02,
will qualify for exemption under Rule 16b-3(d) or (e), as applicable, under the
Exchange Act.

     3.03 Payment for Common Shares and Options in the Merger.

          (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Acquisition Corp. shall appoint a
commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
exchange and paying agent, registrar and transfer agent (the "Agent") for the
purpose of (i) exchanging certificates representing, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Common Shares for the aggregate Merger Consideration and (ii)
making payment of the aggregate Option Consideration in exchange for the
cancellation of all then-outstanding Options. Subject to the Company's
obligations to deposit cash in the Payment Fund described in this Section
3.03(a), at or prior to the Effective Time, Acquisition Corp. shall deposit, or
Acquisition Corp. shall otherwise take all steps necessary to cause to be
deposited, in trust with the Agent for the benefit of the holders of Common
Shares and Options, as the case may be, cash in an aggregate amount equal to the
sum of (i) the product of (A) the number of Common Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 3.01(a) and (B) the Merger
Consideration and (ii) the amount necessary for the payment in full of the
Option Consideration (such aggregate amount described in (i) and (ii) being
hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Fund"). The Company shall, as of the
Offer Payment Date, have sufficient unrestricted domestic cash on hand to pay
any unpaid Expenses contemplated by Section 4.27 (including, without limitation,
those incurred or which may be incurred by the Financial Advisor and counsel to
the Company (including Expenses incurred in connection with any litigation with
respect to, arising from or related to the Transactions)) and at the request of
Acquisition Corp. or Parent, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
deposit all other available domestic cash of the Company (taking into account
the reasonable short-term working capital needs of the Company) with the Agent
for deposit into the Payment Fund prior to the Effective Time. The Agent shall,
pursuant to instructions provided by Acquisition Corp., make the payments
provided for in Section 3.01 and Section 3.02 of this Agreement out of the
Payment Fund (it being understood that any and all interest earned on funds made
available to the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned over to the
party depositing such funds with the Agent). The Payment Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose except as provided in this Agreement.

          (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event later than 10
Business Days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Agent to mail to each record holder of certificates (the "Certificates")
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Common Shares (i) a
notice of the effectiveness of the Merger, (ii) a form letter of


                                       11
<PAGE>
transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Agent, and (iii) instructions for use in surrendering such
Certificates and receiving the Merger Consideration in respect thereof.

          (c) Upon surrender to the Agent of a Certificate, together with such
letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive, within 10 Business Days after such surrender, in exchange therefor, in
the case of Common Shares (other than Common Shares to be canceled pursuant to
Section 3.01(b)), cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of
Common Shares formerly represented by such Certificate and (ii) the Merger
Consideration, which amounts shall be paid by Agent by check or wire transfer in
accordance with the instructions provided by such holder. No interest or
dividends will be paid or accrued on the consideration payable upon the
surrender of any Certificate. If the consideration provided for herein is to be
delivered in the name of a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of such delivery
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such delivery shall pay
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of such delivery to a person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate, or that such person shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 3.03, each Certificate (other than Common Shares to
be canceled pursuant to Section 3.01(b)) shall represent, for all purposes, in
the case of Certificates representing Common Shares (other than Common Shares to
be canceled pursuant to Section 3.01(b)), only the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Common Shares
formerly evidenced by such Certificate without any interest or dividends
thereon.

          (d) The consideration issued upon the surrender of Certificates in
accordance with this Agreement shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Common Shares formerly represented
thereby. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of any Common Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 3.

          (e) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including any amounts that may be
payable to the former shareholders of the Company in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement) which remains unclaimed by the former shareholders of the
Company upon the 180th day immediately following the Closing Date shall be
returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former shareholders
of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article 3 shall,
subject to Section 3.03(f), thereafter look to the Surviving Corporation only as
general unsecured creditors thereof for payment of any Merger Consideration,
without any interest or dividends thereon, that may be payable in respect of
each Common Share held by such shareholder. Following the Closing, the Agent
shall retain the right to invest and reinvest the Payment Fund on behalf of the
Surviving Corporation in securities listed or guaranteed by the United States
government or certificates of deposit of commercial banks that have, or are


                                       12
<PAGE>
members of a group of commercial banks that has, consolidated total assets of
not less than $500,000,000 and the Surviving Corporation shall receive the
interest earned thereon.

          (f) None of Acquisition Corp., the Company or Agent shall be liable to
a holder of Certificates or any other person in respect of any cash delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered upon the second
anniversary of the Closing Date (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which any Merger Consideration, dividends (whether in cash, stock or property)
or other distributions with respect to Common Shares in respect of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority (as defined in Section 4.06(b)), any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interests of any person previously entitled
thereto.

          (g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in form and substance acceptable to
the Surviving Corporation) of that fact by the person (who shall be the record
owner of such Certificate) claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the agreement to indemnify the Surviving Corporation against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in
such amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

          (h) Each of the Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any
holder of Common Shares or Options pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
may be required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such
payment or any other payment in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority by Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

Subsidiaries (as described in Section 4.05) is a corporation, limited liability
company or limited partnership, as the case may be, duly organized or formed, as
the case may be, validly existing and in good standing (to the extent
applicable) under the laws of its state or jurisdiction of incorporation or
formation, as the case may be, and has the requisite power and authority to

set forth in Section 4.01 of the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Acquisition Corp. and Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the
"Company Disclosure Schedule"), the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good
standing (to the extent applicable), in each jurisdiction where the nature of
its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing (to the extent
applicable) would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, the term "Company Material Adverse
Effect" means any effect, event, or change that (i) is, or is reasonably likely
to be, materially adverse to the business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii)
prevents or materially delays, or is reasonably likely to prevent or materially
delay, the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to perform in all
material respects their obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Transactions") in accordance with the
terms hereof, except for any effect, event or change (w) that is generally
applicable to the industry or markets in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
operate and not affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any
materially more adverse manner or degree therefrom, (x) that is generally
applicable to the United States economy or securities markets or the world
economy or international securities markets, (y) the public announcement or
existence of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, or (z) the
failure by the Company to meet any internal or published projections, forecasts
or predictions of financial performance for any period ending on or after July
30, 2005 (but any underlying facts causing the Company to fail to meet such
projections, forecasts or predictions shall not constitute an exception to the
definition of Company Material Adverse Effect).

     4.02 Charter Documents and Bylaws. The charter attached as Exhibit 3.1 of
the SEC Report for the period ending July 29, 1995 is a complete and correct
copy of the Charter and the bylaws attached as Exhibit 3.2 of the SEC Report for
the period ending January 29, 1995 is a complete and correct copy of the bylaws

respect of any of the provisions of its charter or bylaws (or equivalent

other equity interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company have been duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable, are owned
by either the Company or another of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, free and
clear of all Liens (as defined in Section 4.06(a)) other than Permitted Liens
(as defined in Section 4.24(d)). There are no outstanding options, warrants,
calls, subscriptions, convertible securities or other rights, or other
agreements or commitments, obligating any Subsidiary of the Company to issue,
transfer or sell any shares of its capital stock or other equity interests.
There are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of, or
other equity interests in, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.

          (b) To the knowledge of the Company, without having made inquiry of
any of its shareholders, except for estate planning and similar trust

Schedule, there exist no employment, severance, retention, termination or
change-of-control agreements, arrangements or understandings between the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and any individual current or former director or
officer with a title of vice president or higher (or any dependent, beneficiary
or relative of any of the foregoing) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Employees") other than the Company's obligations to former


                                       22
<PAGE>
employees under the health care continuation requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle
B of Title I of ERISA, Section 4980B of the Code or any similar state law
("COBRA").

          (b) Section 4.13(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a
complete and correct list of all existing (i) "employee pension benefit plans"
(as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA")) (collectively, the "Pension Plans"), including any
such Pension Plans that are "multiemployer plans" (as such term is defined in
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (collectively, the "Multiemployer Pension Plans"),
(ii) "employee welfare benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and
(iii) other bonus, deferred compensation, severance pay, pension,
profit-sharing, retirement, insurance, stock purchase, stock option, vacation
pay, sick pay or other fringe benefit plan or arrangement maintained, or
contributed to, by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of any
of the Employees or with respect to which the Company has any liability other
than immaterial plans or arrangements (the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
collectively, the "Benefit Plans"). The Company has made available to
Acquisition Corp. correct and complete copies of (i) each Benefit Plan document
(or a written description of such Benefit Plan if no such formal document
exists), (ii) the three most recent annual reports on Form 5500 as filed with
the Internal Revenue Service with respect to each Benefit Plan (and all
attachments thereto), (iii) the most recent summary plan description for each
Benefit Plan for which such summary plan description is required, (iv) the most
recent determination letter received from the Internal Revenue Service, if
applicable, and (v) each trust agreement, insurance contract, group annuity
contract or funding arrangement relating to any Benefit Plan, if applicable.

          (c) Except as disclosed in Section 4.13(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, all Pension Plans intended to be qualified plans under Section 401(a)
of the Code may either rely on opinion letters issued for the form of plan or
have been the subject of favorable determination letters from the Internal
Revenue Service to the effect that such Pension Plans are qualified and exempt
from Federal income taxes under Section 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the
Code (taking into account the laws commonly referred to as "GUST"), no such
determination or opinion letter has been revoked and, to the knowledge of the
Company, nothing has occurred since the date of such determination that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualification of such Benefit
Plan.

          (d) None of the Benefit Plans is, and neither the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains, contributes to or has any
liability or potential liability with respect to (i) a "single employer plan"
(as such term is defined in Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) subject to Section 412
of the Code or Section 302 of Title I of ERISA or Title IV of ERISA, (ii) a
"multiple employer plan" (as such term is defined in ERISA), (iii) a
Multiemployer Pension Plan or (iv) a funded welfare benefit plan (as such term
is defined in Section 419 of the Code). Each Benefit Plan and all of its related
trusts have been maintained, funded and administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms, the terms of any applicable collective bargaining
agreement and each Benefit Plan in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable laws. With respect
to each Benefit Plan, all contributions (including all employer contributions
and employee salary reduction contributions) that are due have been made within
the time periods prescribed by ERISA and the Code, and all contributions for any
period ending on or before the Closing Date that are not yet due have been made
or properly accrued. All premiums or other


                                       23
<PAGE>
payments for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date have been paid
or properly accrued with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan that is an
employee welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA). Except as
set forth in Section 4.13(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material unfunded liabilities with
respect to any deferred compensation, retirement or other Benefit Plan that is
not accurately reflected on the Company's balance sheet. For purposes of Section
4.13, "ERISA Affiliate" means each entity that is treated as a single employer
with the Company or any Subsidiary for purposes of Section 414 of the Code.

          (e) None of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a
"prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code) or any other breach of fiduciary responsibility with
respect to any Benefit Plan subject to ERISA that reasonably could be expected
to subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Employee to (i) any
material tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 or
(ii) any liability under Section 502(i) or Section 502(l) of ERISA. Except as
disclosed in Section 4.13(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as of the date
of this Agreement, with respect to any Benefit Plan: (i) no filing or
application is pending with the Internal Revenue Service, the Pension Benefit

contemplated by this Agreement and the Acquisition Corp. Stock Option Agreement

(potential or otherwise) with respect to any "employee benefit plan" (as defined
in Section 3(3) of ERISA) solely by reason of being treated as a single employer
under Section 414 of the Code with any other entity.

     Parent and Acquisition Corp. represent and warrant to the Company that:

     5.01 Organization and Qualification. Each of Acquisition Corp. and Parent
is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the
extent such concept is relevant in such jurisdiction) under the laws of its
jurisdiction of formation and has the requisite power and authority to carry on
its business as now being conducted, except where the failure to be in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Acquisition Corp.
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Each of Acquisition Corp. and Parent
is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in
good standing, in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Acquisition Corp. Material Adverse Effect. As used in this
Agreement, the term "Acquisition Corp. Material Adverse Effect" means any
effect, event or change that prevents or materially delays, or is reasonably
likely to prevent or materially delay, the ability of Parent and Acquisition
Corp. to perform in all material respects their obligations under this Agreement
or to consummate the Transactions in accordance with the terms hereof.

of Acquisition Corp. and Parent, and (assuming this Agreement constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of the Company) constitutes the valid and binding
obligations of each of Acquisition Corp. and Parent, enforceable against them in
accordance with its respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to
creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity. The Acquisition
Corp. Stock Option Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by

advisors, that such action is necessary for the Company Board to comply with its
fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable law, (B) the
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 6.08(g)) and (C) prior to furnishing

Acquisition Proposal or the Transactions with, such Person, the Company receives
from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement (which agreement shall be
provided to Parent for information purposes) with terms no less favorable to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.

          (b) From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective
Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 8, if the Company

Company Board may, prior to the approval of this Agreement by the shareholders
of the Company at the Shareholders Meeting, terminate this Agreement in respect
of any Acquisition Proposal pursuant to the termination provisions set forth in
Article 8 hereof if (A) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and (B) the Company Board, based upon the recommendation of the Special

regard to any tender offer; provided, however, that none of the Company, the
Company Board or the Special Committee shall, except as permitted by Section
6.08(b) propose to approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Company Representative,

by this Agreement.

          (g) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii)
of the definition thereof, by a Person (i) on terms that the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with the Company's financial

the Company's shareholders than the Offer and the Merger (including any
adjustment to the terms and conditions thereof proposed in writing by Parent in
response to any such Acquisition Proposal), and (ii) that the Company Board,
based upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisors, that is of such a
nature that they must accept such Acquisition Proposal in order for the Company
Board to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under
applicable Law, taking into account for this purpose, whether such Acquisition
Proposal is reasonably capable of being consummated in a timely manner (taking
into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal

termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 8 or the Effective Time, the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to file on a timely basis all SEC
Reports required to be filed by it with the SEC under the Exchange Act, the

losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees,
costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements (collectively,
"Costs") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising
out of actions taken by them in their capacity as officers or directors at or

whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the

advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit,

          (c) On or prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company has
received confirmation notices with respect to offers, on the terms and
conditions set forth on Section 6.20(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
which the Company believes to be binding on the insurance carriers, subject to
the absence of a material change in this Agreement and to the consummation of
the Offer (the "Binder"), for "run-off" insurance policies for directors' and
officers' liability insurance, plan purchaser protection, employee practices and
fiduciary liability coverage (which shall provide for the Side A, B and C
coverage for Indemnified Directors and Officers), on terms and conditions that
have been made available to Parent and Acquisition Corp., with a claims period
of at least six years from the Offer Payment Date with respect to directors' and
officers' liability insurance, employee practices and fiduciary liability
coverage, and with a claims period of at least three years from the Offer
Payment Date with respect to plan purchaser protection from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier
with respect to all such coverage in an amount and scope at least as favorable
as the Company's existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Offer Payment Date (the "Run-Off Policy"). Prior to the
earlier of (i) the Offer Payment Date or (ii) the date such Run-Off Policy is
cancelled due to non-payment, the Company shall obtain and fully pay for the
Run-Off Policy. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
honor and perform under all indemnification agreements entered into by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary set forth in Section 6.20(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. In the event that the carriers do not make the Run-Off
Policy available to the Company for any reason other than a breach of this
Agreement by the Company and Acquisition Corp. acquires shares of Common Stock
on the Offer Payment Date pursuant to the Offer, the Company shall endeavor to
(and if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to (after the Offer Payment Date) obtain and fully pay (up to a maximum cost of
300% of the current annual premium paid by the Company for its existing coverage
for directors' and officers' liability insurance, plan purchaser protection,
employee practices and fiduciary liability coverage in the aggregate (the
"Maximum Amount")) for "tail" insurance policies (which shall provide for the
Side A, B and C coverage for Indemnified Directors and Officers where the
existing policies also include coverage for the Company) with a claims period of
at least six years from the Offer Payment Date for directors' and officers'
liability insurance, plan purchaser protection, employee practices and fiduciary
liability coverage and three years from the Offer Payment Date for plan
purchaser protection, from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to all such
coverage in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the Company's existing
policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Offer
Payment Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Offer Payment Date, if
the amount of the annual premium necessary to maintain or procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, the Company or the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain or procure, for such six (6) year period or three (3) year
period, as appropriate, the most advantageous policy of insurance for the
Indemnified Directors and Officers obtainable for an annual premium equal to the
Maximum Amount.

          (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after
the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Director or Officer or any
other party covered by directors' and officers' liability insurance, on or prior
to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section
6.20 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation.

expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Director and Officer in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this Section 6.20.

                                       59
<PAGE>
of (x) the Company's own funds, (y) the proceeds of a debt financing provided by
a senior lender or mezzanine lender and (z) the proceeds of a sale-leaseback
transaction, which, in the case of clauses (y) or (z) above would not result in
the acquisition or transfer of any of the capital stock (or securities
exercisable or convertible into capital stock) of the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company and would not result in the acquisition or transfer of 5% or more
of the capital stock (or securities exercisable or convertible into capital
stock) of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to such lender or
acquiror or any of their respective affiliates.

          (c) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement,
if this Agreement is terminated for any reason, the Company shall promptly pay
to Acquisition Corp. the lesser of (x) the aggregate amount of Parent's and
Acquisition Corp.'s Expenses and (y) $3,000,000 unless (I) this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.02, Section 8.03(b) or Section 8.04(b) solely
as a result of the failure of the expiration or termination of any waiting
period under the HSR Act or an injunction issued by or at the request of the
Federal Trade Commission or Department of Justice in connection with antitrust
violations, (II) the breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or the
failure of Parent and Acquisition Corp. to perform any covenant or obligation
under this Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the
Merger to have been consummated on or before the Termination Date, (III) this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.02(b), Section 8.03(b) or Section
8.04(b) solely as a result of a Force Majeure Event or (IV) this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.02, Section 8.03(b) or Section 8.04(b) solely
as a result of (a) an injunction in connection with a shareholder derivative
action or a purported class action against the Company by its shareholders with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (b) any delay in
the commencement of the Offer or the acquisition of Common Shares pursuant to
the Offer on the Offer Payment Date by the SEC or Nasdaq which was not caused by
a breach of this Agreement by the Company; provided however, that in the event
of a termination of this Agreement described in clause (IV) above, the Company
shall promptly pay to Acquisition Corp. the lesser of (x) the aggregate amount
of Parent's and Acquisition Corp.'s Expenses and (y) $1,500,000. In the event
that the Company exercises the Commencement Delay Election and/or the Company
Extension Election, the Company shall immediately pay to Acquisition Corp. cash
in an amount (the "Company Election Payment") equal to the lesser of (x)
one-half of Parent's and Acquisition Corp.'s Expenses as of the first date that
the Company exercises either the Commencement Delay Election or the Company
Extension Election and (y) $1,500,000 and the Company shall acknowledge in
writing the aggregate amount of Parent's and Acquisition Corp.'s Expenses as of
such date. In the event this Agreement is subsequently terminated, the Company
shall promptly pay to Acquisition Corp. an amount equal to (A) the lesser of (x)
the aggregate amount of Parent's and Acquisition Corp.'s Expenses and (y)
$3,000,000 minus (B) the aggregate amount of Expenses paid by the Company to
Acquisition Corp. pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event this Agreement is subsequently
terminated pursuant to Section 8.04(a), then Acquisition Corp. will promptly pay
to the Company an amount equal to the Company Election Payment.

          (d) All amounts payable by under this Section 9.01 shall be paid in
cash and in immediately available funds to such account as Parent or Acquisition
Corp. may designate in writing to the other party.

          (e) The parties agree that the agreements contained in this Section
9.01 and the amounts payable as provided in this Section 9.01 are an integral
part of the Transactions, that such amounts represent the damages that the party
receiving such payment will incur if the conditions giving rise to such payments
occur and that such payments constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty and
that the right to receive said amounts shall constitute such party's sole and
exclusive remedy for termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03(b)
or Section 8.04(b).

     9.02 No Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements.
None of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made in this
Agreement shall survive beyond the Effective Time except for the agreements set
forth in Article 1, Article 2 and Article 3, Section 6.07, Section 6.10, Section
6.19, Section 6.20 and Article 9 shall survive the Effective Time and those set
forth in Section 8.05 shall survive termination.

     9.03 Modification or Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto at any time before or after approval of this Agreement by the
shareholders of the Company; provided, however, that after any such approval,
there shall not be made any amendment that by law requires the further approval
by such shareholders without such further approval. Without limiting the
foregoing, this Agreement may not be amended or modified except by an instrument
in writing signed by the parties hereto.

     9.04 Entire Agreement; Assignment; Termination of Confidentiality
Agreement. This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred

without limitation the Exclusivity Agreement between Sun Capital Partners IV,
Inc. and the Company, dated as of August 19, 2005, as amended. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder will be
assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other party (except that each of Parent
and Acquisition Corp. may assign its rights, interests and obligations to any of
their respective Affiliates or direct or indirect Subsidiaries or to any lender
for collateral security without the consent of the Company). Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of
and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.
At the Effective Time, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate and be of
no further force and effect.

     9.05 Validity. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this
Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision
of this Agreement, each of which shall remain in full force and effect.

     9.11 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage

omission of a cross reference thereto.

     9.15 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, unless the effects of such


                                       64
<PAGE>
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability would prevent the parties from
realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of the Merger that they
currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, all other conditions and provisions of
this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable
of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

hereto submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States district court
for the Eastern District of Tennessee, Knoxville Division in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and agrees that all
claims in respect of the action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any
such court. Each of the parties hereto also agrees not to bring any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court. Each
of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety,
or other security that might be required of any other party with respect
thereto. Any party hereto may make service on any other party by sending or
delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address and in
the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 9.06 above. Nothing in
this Section 9.16, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by law or at equity. Each party hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall be
conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law or at equity. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL
RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING INSTITUTED BY
OR AGAINST SUCH PARTY IN RESPECT OF ITS, HIS OR HER OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

          (c) there shall be Law enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated or

giving effect to any disclosures made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
after the parties execute this Agreement or to any "materiality" or "Company
Material Adverse Effect" limitations contained therein, except where the failure

a Company Material Adverse Effect, either individually or in the aggregate, or
any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section
4.03(a) (Capitalization) of this Agreement shall not be true and correct in all
respects as of the date of this Agreement or as of the scheduled expiration of

written notice to the Company of such breach, except in the case of the
Company's covenants contained in Section 6.01(r) if the breach of such covenants
was not intentional or willful and would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

          (g) there shall have occurred any events or changes (whether or not
described in any notice delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 6.8 hereof)
which have had or which are reasonably likely to have or constitute,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

Offer, this Agreement, or the Merger, (ii) shall have recommended another
proposal or offer, (iii) shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing or (iv)
shall have taken a neutral position or made no recommendation with respect to
another proposal or offer (other than by Parent or Acquisition Corp.) after a
reasonable amount of time (and in no event more than ten Business Days following
receipt thereof) has elapsed for the Company Board or any committee thereof to
review and make a recommendation with respect thereto;

          (j) the Company shall not have received and delivered to Parent all of
the consents and approvals by third parties with respect to the Contracts set
forth on Annex I attached hereto or made any notifications required to be given
to any third parties with respect to any Contract, in each case on terms
satisfactory to Parent or any consents, approvals, permits of, authorizations
from, notifications to and filings with any Governmental Authorities required to
be made or obtained prior to the consummation of the Offer shall not have been
made or obtained; or

          (k) any party to the Support Agreement or the Acquisition Corp. Stock
Option Agreement (other than Acquisition Corp. or Parent) shall have (i)
breached or failed to perform any obligations to tender Common Shares, (ii)
breached any representations and warranties or failed to perform any other
obligations which would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or have a material adverse effect on the parties' abilities to
consummate the Transactions, or (iii) any of such agreements shall not be valid,
binding and enforceable, which in each case in the sole judgment of Parent makes
it inadvisable to proceed with the Offer or with such acceptance for payment or
payments.

          The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Acquisition Corp.
and Parent and may be waived by Parent and Acquisition Corp., in whole or in
part at any time and from time to time in the sole collective discretion of
Parent and Acquisition Corp. The failure by Parent or Acquisition Corp. at any
time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any
such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

                          GOODY'S FAMILY CLOTHING, INC.

                             A Tennessee Corporation

                             ADOPTED _________, 2005

                                    ARTICLE I

                                     OFFICES

          Section 1. Registered Office. The registered office of the corporation
in the State of Tennessee shall be located at 800 S. Gary Street, Suite 2021,
Knoxville, County of Knox 37929. The name of the corporation's registered agent
at such address shall be CT Corporation System. The registered office and/or
registered agent of the corporation may be changed from time to time by action
of the Board of Directors.

          Section 2. Other Offices. The corporation may also have offices at
such other places, both within and without the State of Tennessee, as the Board
of Directors may from time to time determine or the business of the corporation
may require.

                                   ARTICLE II

                            MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

          Section 1. Place and Time of Meetings. The date, time and place of the
annual meeting shall be determined by the Board of Directors of the corporation.

          Section 2. Special Meetings. Special meetings of stockholders may be
called for any purpose and may be held at such time and place, within or outside
of the State of Tennessee, as shall be stated in a notice of meeting or in a
duly executed waiver of notice thereof. Except as otherwise provided in the
certificate of incorporation, such meetings may only be held on call of the
Board of Directors or if the holders of at least ten percent (10%) of all the
votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the proposed
special meeting sign, date and deliver to the Corporation's highest ranking
officer then in office (the "Ranking Officer") one (1) or more written demands
for the meeting describing the purpose or purposes for which such special
meeting is to be held. On such written request, the Ranking Officer shall fix a
date and time for such meeting within two (2) days of the date requested for
<PAGE>
such meeting in such written request. Business transacted at any special meeting
of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice.

          Section 3. Place of Meetings. The Board of Directors may designate any
place, either within or outside of the State of Tennessee, as the place of
meeting for any annual meeting or for any special meeting. If no designation is
made, the place of meeting shall be the principal executive office of the
corporation, which initially shall be 400 Goody's Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee
37922.

          Section 4. Notice. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to
take action at a meeting, written or printed notice stating the place, date,
time, and, in the case of special meetings, the purpose or purposes, of such
meeting, shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting. All such
notices shall be delivered, either personally or by mail, by or at the direction
of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the Secretary, and if
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United
States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the stockholder at his, her or its
address as the same appears on the records of the corporation. A shareholder may
waive any notice required by law, the certificate of incorporation or these
bylaws before or after the date and time stated in such notice. Except as
provided in the next sentence, the waiver must be in writing, be signed by the
shareholder entitled to the notice and be delivered to the Corporation for
inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records. A shareholder's
attendance at a meeting: (1) waives objection to lack of notice or defective
notice of the meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting
(or promptly upon his arrival) objects to holding the meeting or transacting
business at the meeting; and (2) waives objection to consideration of a
particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes
described in the meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering
the matter when it is presented.

          Section 5. Record Date. The Board of Directors shall fix as the record
date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of a shareholders'
meeting, to demand a special meeting, to vote or to take any other action, a
date not more than seventy (70) days before the meeting or action requiring a
determination of shareholders.

          A record date fixed for a shareholders' meeting is effective for any
adjournment of such meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record
date, which it must do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than four (4)
months after the date fixed for the original meeting.

          Section 6. Stockholders List. The officer having charge of the stock
ledger of the corporation shall make, at least 10 days before every meeting of
the stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at such
meeting arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each stockholder,
the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder and the class or
series of shares held by such stockholder, if applicable. Such list shall be
open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the
meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least 10 days prior
to the annual meeting at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list
shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the
whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
<PAGE>
A shareholder or his agent or attorney is entitled on written demand to inspect
and, subject to the requirements of the Tennessee Business Corporation Act (the
"Act"), to copy the list, during regular business hours and at his expense,
during the period it is available for inspection.

          Section 7. Quorum. The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of capital stock entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders, except as
otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If the
corporation has issued more than one class or series of stock, then a majority
of the outstanding shares entitled to vote and be counted together collectively
with respect to the matter at issue shall constitute a quorum. Once a share is
represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is deemed present for quorum
purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that
meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for that adjourned meeting.
If a quorum is not present, the holders of a majority of the shares of capital
stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting, and entitled to
vote at the meeting, may adjourn the meeting to another time and/or place.

          Section 8. Conduct of Meetings. The Chairman, if any, and in his
absence or discretion, any person chosen by the stockholders present shall call
the meeting of the stockholders to order and shall act as chairman of the
meeting, and the Secretary of the corporation shall act as secretary of all
meetings of the stockholders, but, in the absence or upon the request of the
Secretary, the presiding officer may appoint any other person to act as
secretary of the meeting.

          Section 9. Adjourned Meetings. When a meeting is adjourned to another
time and place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time
and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business which
might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for
more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed
for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to
each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

          Section 10. Vote Required. When a quorum is present, the affirmative
vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the
stockholders, unless the question is one upon which by express provisions of an
applicable law or of the certificate of incorporation a different vote is
required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the
decision of such question.

          Section 11. Voting Rights. Except as otherwise provided by the Act or
by the certificate of incorporation of the corporation or any amendments thereto
and subject to Section 3 of Article VI hereof, every stockholder shall at every
meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for
each share of common stock held by such stockholder and no votes for any other
class or series of capital stock held by such stockholder.

          Section 12. Proxies. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of
stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him, her or
it by proxy. An appointment of a
<PAGE>
proxy is effective when received by the Secretary or other officer or agent
authorized to tabulate votes. An appointment is valid for eleven (11) months
unless another period is expressly provided in the appointment form. An
appointment of a proxy is revocable by the shareholder unless the appointment
form conspicuously states that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled
with an interest.

          Section 13. Action by Written Consent. Unless otherwise provided in
the certificate of incorporation, any action required to be taken at any annual
or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any action which may
be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken
without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or
consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken and bearing the dates of
signature of the stockholders who signed the consent or consents, shall be
signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and
shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in
the state of Tennessee, or the corporation's principal place of business, or an
officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book or books in which
proceedings of meetings of the stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the
corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested. All consents properly delivered in accordance
with this section shall be deemed to be recorded when so delivered. No written
consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein
unless, within sixty days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the
corporation as required by this section, written consents signed by the holders
of a sufficient number of shares to take such corporate action are so recorded.
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less
than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not
consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would
have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for such meeting
had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders
to take the action were delivered to the corporation. Any action taken pursuant
to such written consent or consents of the stockholders shall have the same
force and effect as if taken by the stockholders at a meeting thereof. If the
Act or the certificate of incorporation requires that notice of a proposed
action be given to nonvoting shareholders and the action is to be taken by
consent of the voting shareholders, then the Corporation shall give its
nonvoting shareholders written notice of the proposed action at least ten (10)
days before such action is taken. Such notice shall contain or be accompanied by
the same material that would have been required to be sent to nonvoting
shareholders in a notice of a meeting at which the proposed action would have
been submitted to the shareholders for action.

          Section 14. Acceptance of Shareholder Documents.

          If the name signed on a shareholder document (a vote, consent, waiver,
or proxy appointment) corresponds to the name of a shareholder, the Corporation,
if acting in good faith, is entitled to accept such shareholder document and
give it effect as the act of the shareholder. If the name signed on such
shareholder document does not correspond to the name of a shareholder, the
Corporation, if acting in good faith, is nevertheless entitled to accept such
shareholder document and to give it effect as the act of the shareholder if:
<PAGE>
          (i)  the shareholder is an entity and the name signed purports to be
               that of an officer or agent of the entity;

          (ii) the name signed purports to be that of a fiduciary representing
               the shareholder and, if the Corporation requests, evidence of
               fiduciary status acceptable to the Corporation has been presented
               with respect to such shareholder document;

          (iii) the name signed purports to be that of a receiver or trustee in
               bankruptcy of the shareholder and, if the Corporation requests,
               evidence of this status acceptable to the Corporation has been
               presented with respect to the shareholder document;

          (iv) the name signed purports to be that of a pledgee, beneficial
               owner or attorney-in-fact of the shareholder and, if the
               Corporation requests, evidence acceptable to the Corporation of
               the signatory's authority to sign for the shareholder has been
               presented with respect to such shareholder document; or

          (v)  two or more persons are the shareholder as co-tenants or
               fiduciaries and the name signed purports to be the name of at
               least one (1) of the co-owners and the person signing appears to
               be acting on behalf of all the co-owners.

          The Corporation is entitled to reject a shareholder document if the
Secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes, acting in good
faith, has a reasonable basis for doubt about the validity of the signature on
such shareholder document or about the signatory's authority to sign for the
shareholder.

                                   ARTICLE III

                                    DIRECTORS

          Section 1. General Powers. The business and affairs of the corporation
shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors.

          Section 2. Number, Election and Term of Office. The Board of Directors
of the corporation shall consist of that number of directors as determined from
time to time by the Board of Directors, but shall in no event exceed ten. The
directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in
person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote in the
election of directors. The directors shall be elected in this manner at the
annual meeting of the stockholders, except as provided in Section 4 of this
Article III. Each director elected shall hold office until a successor is duly
elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal
as hereinafter provided. The provisions contained in this Article III shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of any stockholders agreement then in effect
by and among the corporation and any of its stockholders (the "Stockholders
Agreements") and the certificate of incorporation.
<PAGE>
          Section 3. Removal and Resignation. Subject to the provisions of the
Stockholders Agreements, any director or the entire Board of Directors may be
removed at any time, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the
shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors. Whenever the holders
of any class or series are entitled to elect one or more directors by the
provisions of the corporation's certificate of incorporation or the Stockholders
Agreements, the provisions of this section shall apply, in respect to the
removal without cause of a director or directors so elected, to the vote of the
holders of the outstanding shares of that class or series and not to the vote of
the outstanding shares as a whole. Any director may resign at any time upon
written notice to the corporation.

          Section 4. Vacancies. Subject to the provisions of the Stockholders
Agreements, vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any
increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by the remaining
Board of Directors, even if less than a quorum, and in accordance with the
Stockholders Agreements. Each director so chosen shall hold office until a
successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death,
resignation or removal as herein provided.

          Section 5. Annual Meetings. An annual meeting of the Board of
Directors may be held without other notice than this by-law immediately after,
and at the same place as, the annual meeting of stockholders.

          Section 6. Other Meetings and Notice. Regular meetings, other than the
annual meeting, of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such
time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by resolution of
the board. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by or at the
request of the Ranking Officer on at least twenty-four (24) hours notice to each
director, either personally, by telephone, by mail, or by facsimile; in like
manner and on like notice the Ranking Officer must call a special meeting on the
written request of at least two of the directors. The Board of Directors may
permit any or all directors to participate in a regular or special meeting by,
or conduct the meeting through the use of, any means of communication by which
all directors participating may simultaneously hear each other during the
meeting. A director participating in a meeting by this means is deemed to be
present in person at the meeting.

          Section 7. Quorum, Required Vote and Adjournment. Each director shall
be entitled to one vote except as otherwise provided in the certificate of
incorporation. Directors then in office (and specifically excluding any
vacancies) holding a majority of the votes of all directors (or such greater
number required by applicable law) shall constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business. The vote of directors holding a majority of votes present at a
meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors.
If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, the
directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without
notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.

          Section 8. Conduct of Meetings. The Chairman, if any, and in his
absence or discretion, any person chosen by the directors present shall call
meetings of the Board of Directors to order and shall act as chairman of the
meeting. The Secretary of the corporation shall act as secretary of all meetings
of the Board of Directors, but, in the absence or upon the
<PAGE>
request of the Secretary, the presiding officer may appoint any other person to
act as secretary of the meeting.

          Section 9. Committees. The Board of Directors may, by resolution
passed by a majority of the whole board, designate one or more committees, each
committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation, which
to the extent provided in such resolution or these by-laws shall have and may
exercise the powers of the Board of Directors in the management and affairs of
the corporation except as otherwise limited by law. The Board of Directors may
designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may
replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. Such
committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be determined from
time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. Each committee
shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the Board of
Directors when required.

          Section 10. Committee Rules. Each committee of the Board of Directors
may fix its own rules of procedure and shall hold its meetings as provided by
such rules, except as may otherwise be provided by a resolution of the Board of
Directors designating such committee.

          Section 11. Communications Equipment. Members of the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof may participate in and act at any meeting of
such board or committee through the use of a conference telephone or other
communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the
meeting can hear each other, and participation in the meeting pursuant to this
section shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.

          Section 12. Waiver of Notice and Presumption of Consent. Any member of
the Board of Directors or any committee thereof who is present at a meeting
shall be conclusively presumed to have waived notice of such meeting except when
such member attends for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the
meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully
called or convened. Such member shall be conclusively presumed to have consented
to any action taken unless his or her dissent shall be entered in the minutes of
the meeting or unless his or her written dissent to such action shall be filed
with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before the adjournment
thereof or shall be forwarded by registered mail to the Secretary of the
corporation immediately after the adjournment of the meeting. Such right to
dissent shall not apply to any member who voted in favor of such action.

          Section 13. Action by Written Consent. Unless the certificate of
incorporation otherwise provides, any action required or permitted by the Act to
be taken at a Board of Directors meeting may be taken without a meeting. If all
directors consent to taking such action without a meeting, the affirmative vote
of the number of directors that would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting is the act of the Board of Directors. Such action must be
evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken, at least
one of which is signed by each director, indicating the director's vote or
abstention on the action, which consents shall be included in the minutes or
filed with the corporate records reflecting the action taken. Action taken by
consent is effective when the last director signs the consent, unless the
consent specifies a different effective date.

          Section 14. Compensation.

          Directors and members of any committee created by the Board of
Directors shall be entitled to such reasonable compensation for their services
as directors and members of such committee as shall be fixed from time to time
by the Board, and shall also be entitled to reimbursement for any reasonable
expenses incurred in attending meetings of the Board or of any such committee
meetings. Any director receiving such compensation shall not be barred from
serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving reasonable
compensation for such other services.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                    OFFICERS

          Section 1. Number. The officers of the corporation shall be elected by
the Board of Directors and may consist of a chief executive officer, a
president, any number of vice presidents, a secretary, any number of assistant
secretaries, a treasurer, any number of assistant treasurers and such other
officers and assistant officers as may be deemed necessary or desirable by the
Board of Directors. One person may simultaneously hold more than one office,
except the President may not simultaneously hold the office of Secretary. If the
Corporation has only one shareholder, such shareholder may simultaneously hold
the offices of President and Secretary. In its discretion, the Board of
Directors may choose not to fill any office for any period as it may deem
advisable, except that the offices of chief executive officer, president and
secretary shall be filled as expeditiously as possible.

          Section 2. Election and Term of Office. The officers of the
corporation shall be elected annually by the Board of Directors at its first
meeting held after each annual meeting of stockholders or as soon thereafter as
conveniently may be. Vacancies may be filled or new offices created and filled
at any meeting of the Board of Directors. Each officer shall hold office until a
successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death,
resignation or removal as hereinafter provided.

          Section 3. Removal and Resignation. Any officer or agent elected by
the Board of Directors may be removed by the Board of Directors whenever in its
judgment the best interests of the corporation would be served thereby, but such
removal shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of the person
so removed. An officer may resign at any time by delivering notice to the
Corporation. Such resignation is effective when such notice is delivered unless
such notice specifies a later effective date. An officer's resignation does not
affect the Corporation's contract rights, if any, with the officer.

          Section 4. Vacancies. Any vacancy occurring in any office because of
death, resignation, removal, disqualification or otherwise, may be filled by the
Board of Directors for the unexpired portion of the term by the Board of
Directors then in office.

          Section 5. Compensation. Compensation of all officers shall be fixed
by the Board of Directors, and no officer shall be prevented from receiving such
compensation by virtue of his or her also being a director of the corporation.

Directors may also choose Co-Chairmen of the Board, each individually authorized
to perform all duties of the Chairman of the Board set forth herein. In the
event that any member of the Board disagrees with the manner in which the
Chairman of the Board is discharging the duties incident to the office of the
Chairman of the Board, such member shall have the right to call a vote of the
Board of Directors, the vote of a majority of whom shall prevail.

          Section 7. Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors may from
time to time designate the Chairman of the Board, if any, or the President of
the corporation as the Chief Executive Officer of the corporation. The President
shall be the Chief Executive Officer whenever the office of Chairman of the
Board of the corporation is vacant. The Board of Directors may also designate
the Chairman of the Board, if any, and any officer of the corporation as
Co-Chief Executive Officers, each individually authorized to perform all duties
of the Chief Executive Officer set forth herein. Subject to the control of the
Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer shall in general supervise and
control all of the business and affairs of the corporation. He or she shall have
authority, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors,
to appoint and remove such agents and employees of the corporation as he or she
shall deem necessary to prescribe their powers, duties and compensation, and to
delegate authority to them. He or she shall have authority to sign, execute and
acknowledge, on behalf of the corporation, all deeds, mortgages, securities,
contracts, leases, reports, and all other documents or other instruments
necessary or proper to be executed in the course of the corporation's regular
business, or which shall be authorized by resolution of the Board of Directors;
and, except as otherwise provided by law or the Board of Directors, he or she
may authorize any elected President, Vice President or other officer or agent of
the corporation to sign, execute and acknowledge such documents or instruments
in his or her place and stead. In general, he or she shall perform all duties
incident to the office of Chief Executive Officer of the corporation and such
other duties as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors from time to time.

          Section 8. President. Unless the Board of Directors otherwise
provides, in the absence of the Chairman of the Board, in the event of his
inability or refusal to act, or in the event of a vacancy in the office of the
Chairman of the Board, the President shall perform the duties of the Chairman of
the Board, and when so acting shall have all the powers of and be subject to all
the restrictions upon the Chairman of the Board. Unless the Board of Directors
otherwise provides, in the absence of the Chief Executive Officer or in the
event of his or her inability or refusal to act, or in the event of a vacancy in
the office of the Chief Executive Officer, the President shall perform the
duties of the Chief Executive Officer, and when so acting shall have all the
powers of and be subject to all the restrictions upon the Chief Executive
Officer. The President shall have authority, subject to such rules as may be
prescribed by the Board of Directors, to appoint such agents and employees of
the corporation as he or she shall deem necessary, to prescribe their powers,
duties and compensation, and to delegate authority to them. He or she shall have
authority to sign, execute and acknowledge, on behalf of the corporation, all

the Board of Directors; and, except as otherwise provided by law or the Board of
Directors, he or she may authorize any Vice President or other officer or agent
of the corporation to sign, execute and acknowledge such documents or
instruments in his or her place and stead. In general he or she shall perform
all duties incident to the office of the President and such other duties as may
be prescribed by the Board of Directors from time to time.

          Section 9. Vice-Presidents. The Vice-President, or if there shall be
more than one, the Vice-Presidents in the order determined by the Board of
Directors, shall, in the absence or disability of the President, act with all of
the powers and be subject to all the restrictions of the President. The
Vice-Presidents shall also perform such other duties and have such other powers
as the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or these By-laws may,
from time to time, prescribe.

          Section 10. The Secretary and Assistant Secretaries. The Secretary
shall attend all meetings of the Board of Directors, all meetings of the
committees thereof and all meetings of the stockholders and record all the
proceedings of the meetings in a book or books to be kept for that purpose.
Under the Chief Executive Officer's supervision, the Secretary shall give, or
cause to be given, all notices required to be given by these By-laws or by law;
shall have such powers and perform such duties as the Board of Directors, the
Chief Executive Officer or these By-laws may, from time to time, prescribe; and
shall have custody of the corporate seal of the corporation. The Secretary, or
an Assistant Secretary, shall have authority to affix any corporate seal to any
instrument requiring it and when so affixed, it may be attested by his or her
signature or by the signature of such Assistant Secretary. The Board of
Directors may give general authority to any other officer to affix the seal of
the corporation and to attest the affixing by his or her signature. The
Assistant Secretary, or if there be more than one, the Assistant Secretaries in
the order determined by the Board of Directors, shall, in the absence or
disability of the Secretary, perform the duties and exercise the powers of the
Secretary and shall perform such other duties and have such other powers as the
Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the Secretary may, from time
to time, prescribe.

          Section 11. The Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer. The Treasurer shall
have the custody of the corporate funds and securities; shall keep full and
accurate accounts of receipts and disbursements in books belonging to the
corporation; shall deposit all monies and other valuable effects in the name and
to the credit of the corporation as may be ordered by the Board of Directors;
shall cause the funds of the corporation to be disbursed when such disbursements
have been duly authorized, taking proper vouchers for such disbursements; and
shall render to the Chief Executive Officer and the Board of Directors, at its
regular meeting or when the Board of Directors so requires, an account of the
corporation; shall have such powers and perform such duties as the Board of
Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or these By-laws may, from time to time,
prescribe. If required by the Board of Directors, the Treasurer shall give the
corporation a bond (which shall be rendered every six (6) years) in such sums
and with such surety or sureties as shall be satisfactory to the Board of
Directors for the faithful performance of the duties of the office of Treasurer
and for the restoration to the corporation, in case of death, resignation,
retirement, or removal from office, of all books, papers, vouchers, money, and
other property of whatever kind in the possession or under the control of the
Treasurer belonging to the
<PAGE>
corporation. The Assistant Treasurer, or if there shall be more than one, the
Assistant Treasurers in the order determined by the Board of Directors, shall in

powers of the Treasurer. The Assistant Treasurers shall perform such other
duties and have such other powers as the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive
Officer or Treasurer may, from time to time, prescribe.

          Section 12. Other Officers, Assistant Officers and Agents. Officers,
assistant officers and agents, if any, other than those whose duties are
provided for in these By-laws, shall have such authority and perform such duties

                                    ARTICLE V

                INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND OTHERS

          Section 1. Nature of Indemnity. Each person who was or is made a party
or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person
of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer,
of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director, officer, employee, fiduciary, or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall be indemnified and
held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent which it is empowered to
do so unless prohibited from doing so by the Act, as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent
that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification
rights than said law permitted the corporation to provide prior to such
amendment) against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees
actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such
proceeding) and such indemnification shall inure to the benefit of his or her
heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided
in Section 2 hereof, the corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking
indemnification in connection with a proceeding initiated by such person only if
such proceeding was authorized by the board of directors of the corporation. The
right to indemnification conferred in this Article V shall be a contract right
and, subject to Sections 2 and 5 hereof, shall include the right to be paid by
the corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in
advance of its final disposition. The corporation may, by action of its board of
directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the corporation
with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and
officers.

          Section 2. Procedure for Indemnification of Directors and Officers.
Any indemnification of a director or officer of the corporation under Section 1
of this Article V or
<PAGE>
advance of expenses under Section 5 of this Article V shall be made promptly,
and in any event within 30 days, upon the written request of the director or
officer. If a determination by the corporation that the director or officer is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article V is required, and the
corporation fails to respond within sixty days to a written request for
indemnity, the corporation shall be deemed to have approved the request. If the
corporation denies a written request for indemnification or advancing of
expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant to such request is
not made within 30 days, the right to indemnification or advances as granted by
this Article V shall be enforceable by the director or officer in any court of
competent jurisdiction. Such person's costs and expenses incurred in connection
with successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification, in whole or
in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the corporation. It
shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a
claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where the required undertaking, if any, has been tendered to the
corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make
it permissible under the Act for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for
the amount claimed, but the burden of such defense shall be on the corporation.
Neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors,
independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination
prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is
proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the Act, nor an actual determination by the corporation
(including its board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct,
shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has
not met the applicable standard of conduct.

          Section 3. Article Not Exclusive. The rights to indemnification and
the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its
final disposition conferred in this Article V shall not be exclusive of any
other right which any person (and his heirs, executors and administrators) may
have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of
incorporation, by-law, agreement, insurance, purchased by the corporation or
otherwise, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

          Section 4. Insurance. The corporation may purchase and maintain
insurance on its own behalf and on behalf of any person who is or was a
director, officer, employee, fiduciary, or agent of the corporation or was
serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him
or her in any such capacity, whether or not the corporation would have the power
to indemnify such person against such liability under this Article V. The
corporation may enter into contracts with any director, officer, partner,
trustee, employee or agent of the corporation in furtherance of the provisions
of this Section and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use
other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the
payment of the amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification as provided
in this Section.

          Section 5. Expenses. Expenses incurred by any person described in
Section 1 of this Article V in defending a proceeding shall be paid by the
corporation in advance of such proceeding's final disposition unless otherwise
determined by the board of directors in the specific case upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay
<PAGE>
such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled
to be indemnified by the corporation. Such expenses incurred by other employees
and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the board
of directors deems appropriate.

          Section 6. Employees and Agents. Persons who are not covered by the
foregoing provisions of this Article V and who are or were employees or agents
of the corporation, or who are or were serving at the request of the corporation
as employees or agents of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise, may be indemnified to the extent authorized at any time or
from time to time by the board of directors.

          Section 7. Contract Rights. The provisions of this Article V shall be
deemed to be a contract right between the corporation and each director or
officer who serves in any such capacity at any time while this Article V and the
relevant provisions of the Act or other applicable law are in effect, and any
repeal or modification of this Article V or any such law shall not affect any
rights or obligations then existing.

          Section 8. Merger or Consolidation. For purposes of this Article V,
references to "the corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or
was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this Article V
with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would have
with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had
continued.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                       CERTIFICATES OF STOCK; RECORD DATE

          Section 1. Form. Every holder of stock in the corporation shall be
entitled to have a certificate, signed by, or in the name of the corporation by
the Chief Executive Officer or a Vice-President and the Secretary or an
Assistant Secretary of the corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by
such holder in the corporation. If such a certificate is countersigned (1) by a
transfer agent or an assistant transfer agent other than the corporation or its
employee or (2) by a registrar, other than the corporation or its employee, the
signature of any such Chief Executive Officer, Vice-President, Secretary, or
Assistant Secretary may be facsimiles. In case any officer or officers who have
signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures have been used on, any such
certificate or certificates shall cease to be such officer or officers of the
corporation whether because of death, resignation or otherwise before such
certificate or certificates have been delivered by the corporation, such
certificate or certificates may nevertheless be issued and delivered as though
the person or persons who signed such certificate or certificates or whose
facsimile signature or signatures have been used thereon had not ceased to be
such officer or officers of the corporation. All certificates for shares shall
be consecutively
<PAGE>
numbered or otherwise identified. Each individual certificate shall include the
following on its face: (i) the Corporation's name, (ii) the fact that the
Corporation is organized under the laws of the State of Tennessee, (iii) the
name of the person to whom the certificate is issued, (iv) the number of shares
represented thereby, (v) the class of shares and the designation of the series,
if any, which the certificate represents, and (vi) such other information as
applicable law may require or as may be lawful. If the Corporation is authorized
to issue different classes of shares or different series within a class, the
designations, relative rights, preferences and limitations determined for each
series (and the authority of the Board of Directors to determine variations for
future series) shall be summarized on the front or back of each certificate.
Alternatively, each certificate shall state on its front or back that the
Corporation will furnish the shareholder this information in writing, without
charge, upon request. The name of the person to whom the shares represented
thereby are issued, with the number of shares and date of issue, shall be
entered on the books of the corporation. Shares of stock of the corporation
shall only be transferred on the books of the corporation by the holder of
record thereof or by such holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, upon
surrender to the corporation of the certificate or certificates for such shares
endorsed by the appropriate person or persons, with such evidence of the
authenticity of such endorsement, transfer, authorization, and other matters as
the corporation may reasonably require, and accompanied by all necessary stock
transfer stamps. In that event, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue
a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate or
certificates, and record the transaction on its books. The Board of Directors
may appoint a bank or trust company organized under the laws of the United
States or any state thereof to act as its transfer agent or registrar, or both
in connection with the transfer of any class or series of securities of the
corporation.

          Section 2. Lost Certificates. The Board of Directors may direct a new
certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any certificate or
certificates previously issued by the corporation alleged to have been lost,
stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen, or destroyed. When
authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates, the Board of
Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen, or destroyed certificate or
certificates, or his, her or its legal representative, to give the corporation a
bond sufficient to indemnify the corporation against any claim that may be made
against the corporation on account of the loss, theft or destruction of any such
certificate or the issuance of such new certificate.

          Section 3. Fixing a Record Date for Stockholder Meetings. In order
that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to
vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than
ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the
Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be the close of business
on the next day preceding the day on which notice is given, or if notice is
waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the
meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of
or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting;
<PAGE>
provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the
adjourned meeting.

          Section 4. Fixing a Record Date for Action by Written Consent. In
order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a
record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and
which date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If no
record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by
statute, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth
the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by
delivery to its registered office in the State of Tennessee, its principal place
of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the
book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery
made to the corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by
the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by
statute, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business
on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such
prior action.

          Section 5. Fixing a Record Date for Other Purposes. In order that the
corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any
dividend or other distribution or allotment or any rights or the stockholders
entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange
of stock, or for the purposes of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors
may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which
the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be
not more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed,
the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at
the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the
resolution relating thereto.

          Section 6. Registered Stockholders. Prior to the surrender to the
corporation of the certificate or certificates for a share or shares of stock
with a request to record the transfer of such share or shares, the corporation
may treat the registered owner as the person entitled to receive dividends, to
vote, to receive notifications, and otherwise to exercise all the rights and
powers of an owner. The corporation shall not be bound to recognize any
equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of
any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof.

          Section 7. Subscriptions for Stock. Unless otherwise provided for in
the subscription agreement, subscriptions for shares shall be paid in full at
such time, or in such installments and at such times, as shall be determined by
the Board of Directors. In case of default in the payment of any installment or
call when such payment is due, the corporation may proceed to collect the amount
due in the same manner as any debt due the corporation. All calls for payment on
subscriptions shall be uniform as to all shares of the same class or of the same
series, unless the subscription agreement specifies otherwise.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

          Section 1. Dividends. Dividends upon the capital stock of the
corporation, subject to the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, if
any, may be declared by the Board of Directors at any regular or special
meeting, pursuant to law. The record date for the determination of shareholders
entitled to receive the payment of any dividend shall be determined by the Board
of Directors, but which in any event shall not be less than ten (10) days prior
to the date of such payment. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in
shares of the capital stock, subject to the provisions of the certificate of
incorporation. Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of any
funds of the corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the
directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper as a
reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for
repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation, or any other purpose
and the directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which
it was created.

          Section 2. Checks, Drafts or Orders. All checks, drafts, or other
orders for the payment of money by or to the corporation and all notes and other
evidences of indebtedness issued in the name of the corporation shall be signed
by such officer or officers, agent or agents of the corporation, and in such
manner, as shall be determined by resolution of the Board of Directors or a duly
authorized committee thereof.

          total number of Common Shares otherwise issuable upon exercise of such
          Option, which number of Common Shares are set forth opposite the

                          MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT

     This MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), dated as of _________
___, 2005, is entered into by and between Goody's Family Clothing, Inc., a
Tennessee corporation (the "Company"), and Sun Capital Partners Management IV,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Manager").

     WHEREAS, the Company is party to that certain Acquisition Agreement and
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the "Transaction
Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company agreed, concurrently with its
execution of the Transaction Agreement, to enter into this Agreement;

     WHEREAS, the Company and the Manager have agreed that this Agreement shall
be effective as of the Offer Payment Date as defined in the Transaction
Agreement (the "Commencement Date");

     WHEREAS, commencing as of the Commencement Date, the Company desires to
receive financial and management consulting services from the Manager and to
obtain the benefit of the experience of the Manager in business and financial
management;

     WHEREAS, commencing as of the Commencement Date, the Manager desires to
provide financial and management consulting services to the Company pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement; and

     WHEREAS, the compensation arrangements set forth in this Agreement are
designed to compensate the Manager for providing such financial and management
consulting services to the Company.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements hereinafter set
forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     1.   Agreement; Term.

          (a) The Company hereby retains the Manager to perform, and the Manager
agrees to render to the Company, on the terms herein set forth, management and
consulting services regarding the business of the Company and such other
services relating to the Company as may from time to time be reasonably
requested by the executive officers of the Company and agreed to by the Manager.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties currently
contemplate that these services shall include advice regarding improvements to
the Company's financial reporting, accounting and management information systems
and staffing.

          (b) It is expressly understood and agreed that the Manager shall
devote only so much time, and shall consult with and advise the officers and
managers of the Company only to such extent and at such times and places as may
be mutually convenient to the Company and the Manager. The Manager shall be free
to provide similar services to such other business


                                       1
<PAGE>
enterprises or activities as the Manager may deem fit without any limitation or
restriction whatsoever.

          (c) The term of this Agreement shall commence as of the Commencement
Date and shall terminate on the tenth anniversary of the Commencement Date.
Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, (i) the Company's obligation to pay
amounts due with respect to periods prior to the termination hereof and (ii) the
provisions of Sections 3 through 18 hereof shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.

     2.   Compensation and Expenses.

          (a) For the services to be rendered by the Manager hereunder, the
Manager shall receive an annual fee (the "Management Fee") to be determined by
the mutual agreement of the Manager and the Company after the Commencement Date
or the Effective Time (as defined in the Transaction Agreement). From and after
the Commencement Date, the Company shall pay the Management Fee in quarterly
installments in advance in the manner determined by the mutual agreement of the
Manager and the Company after the Commencement Date or the Effective Time based
upon the greater of a percentage of EBITDA and a fixed dollar amount; provided
that any amount payable with respect to the period from the Commencement Date
until the Effective Time shall not be paid to the Manager until the consummation
of the Merger. At the end of each fiscal year during the term of this Agreement,
following an audit of the Company's financial statements for such fiscal year:
(x) in the event the Company paid the Manager an amount less than the Audited
Management Fee (as determined by the Company and the Manger after the
Commencement Date or the Effective Time), the Company shall promptly pay to the
Manager the difference between the Audited Management Fee and the Management Fee
actually paid with respect to such fiscal year (the "Actual Management Fee");
and (y) in the event the Actual Management Fee is greater than the Audited
Management Fee for such fiscal year, the Company shall receive a credit against
the immediately succeeding quarterly installment or installments, as applicable,
for the difference between the Actual Management Fee and the Audited Management
Fee. Upon consummation of the Merger, the Company shall also pay the Manager the
pro rata portion of the Management Fee for the period from the Effective Time
until the next fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2005, March 31, 2006 or June
30, 2006. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "EBITDA" means, for any
period, the sum of the amounts for such period of (A) net income (or loss) after
taxes of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis ("Net Income"), plus (B) interest expense which has been deducted in the
determination of Net Income, plus (C) federal, state and local taxes which have
been deducted in determining Net Income, plus (D) depreciation and amortization
expenses which have been deducted in determining Net Income, including without
limitation amortization of capitalized transaction expenses incurred in
connection with the acquisition of certain shares of capital stock of the
Company by GFC Enterprises, Inc. and the merger of GFC Enterprises, Inc. with,
and into, the Company (the "Goody's Transaction"), plus (E) extraordinary losses
which have been deducted in the determination of Net Income, plus (F)
uncapitalized transaction expenses incurred in connection with the Goody's
Transaction, plus (G) all other non-cash charges, minus (H) extraordinary gains
which have been included in the determination of Net Income. Each item used in
calculating EBITDA shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, consistent with that used in prior periods.


                                      -2-
<PAGE>
          (b) The Company shall reimburse the Manager for the cost of all
reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Manager and its
affiliates in the performance of the services hereunder and all matters related
thereto.

          (c) In connection with additional management services required in
connection with certain corporate events, the Manager shall also be entitled to
additional customary and reasonable fees for management consulting services
provided to the Company or to any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or
shareholders, including with respect to, without limitation, refinancings,
restructurings, equity or debt offerings, acquisitions, mergers, consolidations,
business combinations, sales and divestitures (each a "Management Consulting
Event"). In the event that at any time during the term hereof, there shall occur
a Management Consulting Event involving the Company or any of the Company's
direct or indirect subsidiaries or shareholders, the Company shall pay the
Manager a management consulting fee, in cash, equal to a percentage, to be
determined by the Company and the Manager after the Commencement Date or the
Effective Time, of the aggregate consideration (including assumed debt and
long-term liabilities) paid to or by the Company or to or by any of its direct
or indirect subsidiaries or shareholders in consideration for the Manager's
performance of management consulting services in connection with such Management
Consulting Event. The Manager and the Company acknowledge and agree that upon
consummation of the Merger, the Manager shall receive a management consulting
fee equal to an amount to be determined by the Company and the Manager after the
Commencement Date or the Effective Time.

          (d) If for any reason the Company is unable to pay any or all of the
amounts otherwise owed to the Manager pursuant to this Agreement, the Company
shall make such payments as soon as the Company is able to do so.

     3. Relationship of the Parties. The Manager is providing services hereunder
as an independent contractor, retaining control and responsibility for its
operations and personnel. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
constitute the parties hereto joint venturers, partners or participants in an
unincorporated business or other separate entity, nor in any manner create any
employer-employee relationship between the Company on the one hand, and the
Manager or any of the Manager's employees on the other hand.

     4. Managing Member and Officers. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed to relieve the managing member or officers of the Company from the
performance of their respective duties or limit the exercise of their powers in
accordance with the Company's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, any
applicable provisions of the applicable corporate law, or otherwise. The
activities of the Company shall at all times be subject to the control and
direction of its managing member and officers. The Company reserves the right to
make all decisions with regard to any matter upon which the Manager has rendered
its advice and consultation.

     5. Limitation of Liability. Neither the Manager nor any of its affiliates,
members, managers, partners, directors, officers, employees, agents and
controlling persons (collectively, the "Manager Indemnitees") shall be liable to

without limitation, reasonable legal fees and expenses) arising out of, related
to or in connection with (a) any act or omission of, or on behalf of, the
Company, the Manager or any of the Manger Indemnitees, except to the extent
proven to result directly from the willful misconduct of the person seeking
indemnification, or (b) any act or omission made at the direction of the
Company.

     10. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and
enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to principles of conflicts of law or choice of law that would compel the
application of the substantive laws of any other jurisdiction. EACH PARTY HERETO
HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY LITIGATION IN ANY COURT WITH RESPECT TO, IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING

parties hereto with regard to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and
replaces all prior agreements, understandings and representations, oral or
written, with regard to such matters.

     13. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or application thereof
under any circumstances is adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision or application of this Agreement which can be given effect without the
invalid or unenforceable provision or application and shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision or application in any other jurisdiction. If
any provision is held void, invalid or unenforceable with respect to particular
circumstances, it shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect in all
other circumstances.

efforts to obtain all consents and approvals, and to do all other things,
necessary for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties agree
to take such further action and to deliver or cause to be delivered any
additional agreements or instruments as any of them may reasonably request for
the purpose of carrying out this Agreement and the agreements and transactions
contemplated hereby.

     16. Attorneys' Fees. In any action or proceeding brought to enforce any
provision of this Agreement, or where any provision hereof is validly asserted
as a defense, the prevailing party, as determined by the court, shall be
entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees in addition to any other
available remedy.

     17. Outside Activities. The Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that one
or more of the Manager Indemnitees have had, and from time to time may have,
outside activities or interests that conflict or may conflict with the best
interests of the Company (collectively, "Outside Activities"), including
(without limitation) investment opportunities or investments in, ownership of,
or participation in entities that are or could be complementary to, or
competitive with, the Company. The Company hereby consents to all such Outside
Activities.
