periodically shall be prorated based on the number of days in the applicable
period falling on or before, or after, the Effective Time. Production Taxes

36 2.4 _Estimated Consideration and Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Tema shall
prepare and deliver to KLRE a preliminary settlement statement (the "
_Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Temas good faith estimate of
all adjustments set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ (the " _Estimated
Adjustments_ ") and of the Consideration, after giving effect to such
Estimated Adjustments (the " _Estimated Consideration_ "), along with
reasonable supporting information with respect thereto. The Estimated Closing
Statement shall also include (i) the Persons, accounts and amounts of
disbursements that Tema designates to receive the Estimated Consideration and
(ii) the wiring and transfer instructions for all such payments and
disbursements. For purposes of calculating the Estimated Consideration, if
the aggregate dollar amount of the Estimated Adjustments is negative, such
negative amount shall offset against the Consideration as follows: (A) first,
the Unadjusted Cash Consideration shall be reduced by the absolute value of
the Estimated Adjustments up to a maximum adjustment under this clause (A) of
Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000), (B) second, if the aggregate dollar
amount of the Estimated Adjustments is greater than Twenty Million Dollars,
the number of shares of Unadjusted Equity Consideration shall be reduced by an
amount of shares rounded to the nearest share equal to the quotient of (1) an
amount equal to the Estimated Adjustments _minus_ Twenty Million
Dollars ($20,000,000), _divided by_ (2) the Equity Consideration Share Value
(and the Company shall cancel an equivalent number of Company Units), and (C)
if the Unadjusted Equity Consideration is reduced to zero shares pursuant to
the foregoing clause (B), then the remainder of the Unadjusted Cash
Consideration shall be reduced by the absolute value of any portion of the
Estimated Adjustments not already accounted for pursuant to the foregoing
clauses (A) and (B). If the aggregate dollar amount of the Estimated
Adjustments is positive, then the Unadjusted Cash Consideration shall be
increased by such positive dollar amount up to Fifty Million Dollars
($50,000,000) and then the Unadjusted Equity Consideration shall be increased
by a number of shares equal to the surplus _divided by_ the Equity
Consideration Share Value. Tema shall consider in good faith KLREs comments
to the Estimated Closing Statement, which comments KLRE shall deliver to Tema
no less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and revise such
Estimated Closing Statement to incorporate any changes Tema determines in good
faith are necessary or appropriate given such comments. In connection with
the preparation, review or adjustment of the Consideration provided in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_, KLRE and Tema shall provide to each other all
information reasonably requested by KLRE or Tema, as applicable, and Tema
shall provide KLRE with access to its employees as reasonably necessary in
connection with the matters addressed by this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_.

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date but not later
than the later of (i) the ninetieth (90th) day following the Closing Date and
(ii) five (5) days after the date on which the Parties or the applicable
Defect Referee finally determines all Defect Amounts and Benefit Amounts under
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_, KLRE shall prepare and deliver to Tema a draft final

 



37  statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the final calculation
of all adjustments set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ based on the most
recent actual figures for each adjustment (the " _Final Adjustments_ ") and
of the Consideration after giving effect to such Final Adjustments, along with
reasonable supporting information with respect thereto. In the event KLRE
does not deliver the Closing Statement within the period specified in the
immediately preceding sentence, the Estimated Consideration shall become final
and binding upon the Parties as the Final Consideration. As used herein, the "
_Final Consideration_ " means the amount of the Consideration as determined
by this _Section 2.4(b)_ or if disputed, as finally determined by _Section_ __
_ 2.4(c)_.

 

(c) If Tema objects to the Closing Statement provided by KLRE, then it shall
provide KLRE with written notice within fifteen (15) days after receiving the
Closing Statement, setting forth Temas good faith objections. KLRE shall make
available to Tema copies of all relevant documentation used in KLREs
documentation, if any, and shall provide Tema with access to its employees as
reasonably necessary in connection with the matters addressed by this
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_. KLRE may deliver a written report to Tema during this
same period reflecting any changes that KLRE proposes to be made in
the Closing Statement as a result of additional information received after
the Closing Statement was prepared. The Parties shall undertake to agree on
the Closing Statement and any changes thereto no later than thirty (30) days
following Temas receipt of the Closing Statement. In the event the Parties
cannot reach agreement as to the Closing Statement within such period of time,
any Party may refer the items remaining in dispute to Grant Thornton LLP or,
if that firm declines or is unable to act as provided in this _Section_ __ _
2.4_, another nationally-recognized firm of independent public accountants
mutually acceptable to KLRE and Tema (the " _Independent Accountant_ "),
for review and final determination by arbitration. The Independent Accountant
shall conduct the arbitration proceedings in Houston, Texas in accordance with
the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to
the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this _Article II_.
The Independent Accountants determination shall be made within fifteen (15)
days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding
on all Parties, without the right of appeal. In determining the amount of the
Final Adjustments and the Final Consideration, the Independent Accountant
shall be bound by the terms of this _Article II_ and may not increase the
Final Consideration more than the increase proposed by Tema nor decrease the
Final Consideration more than the decrease proposed by KLRE, as applicable.
The Independent Accountant shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed aspects of the Final Adjustments submitted
by any Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to any Party
with respect to any matter. The Independent Accountant shall include in the
calculation of the Consideration the Defect Amounts and Benefit Amounts
either determined by KLRE and Tema pursuant to _Section 2.5_ if agreed upon,
or if disputed, determined by the Defect Referee pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.5(g)_. The Independent Accountant shall have no right to adjust or
investigate any Defect Amount or Benefit Amount. Unless Tema and KLRE settle
the dispute by written agreement prior to the decision of the Independent
Accountant, the determination of the Independent Accountant shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties, and no such Person shall seek further
recourse from any other Person or Governmental Entity other than to enforce
the determination of the Independent Accountant. Tema and KLRE shall each bear
their own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Tema shall bear
one-half and KLRE shall bear one-half of the fees, costs and expenses of the
Independent Accountant.

 



38 (d) If the Final Consideration is less than the Estimated Consideration (in
each case, valuing the Estimated Equity Consideration using the Equity
Consideration Share Value), then, within five (5) days of determination of the
Final Consideration, Tema shall pay to the Company an amount in cash equal to
the absolute value of such shortfall pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.7_.

(e) If the Final Consideration is greater than the Estimated
Consideration (in each case, valuing the Estimated Equity Consideration using
the Equity Consideration Share Value), then, within five (5) days of
determination of the Final Consideration, the Company shall pay to Tema an
amount in cash equal to such surplus by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts specified in writing by Tema.

2.5 _Title and Environmental Matters_.

(a) _General Disclaimer of Title_ __ _ and Environmental Warranties and
Representations_. Subject to and without limiting KLREs remedies for Defects
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ or KLREs remedies with respect to any
breach of the representations and warranties of Tema or the Company set forth
herein, NEITHER TEMA NOR THE COMPANY MAKES ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION OF
TEMA AND THE COMPANY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT
TO (i) TEMAS, THE COMPANYS OR ANY OTHER PERSONS TITLE TO ANY OF THE
CONTRIBUTED ASSETS, (ii) ANY MATTERS WITH RESPECT TO THE EXISTENCE OF ANY
ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT, RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES OR ANY OTHER
ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION WITH RESPECT TO THE OWNERSHIP OR OPERATION OF THE
COMPANY OR THE CONTRIBUTED ASSETS OR (iii) WHETHER THE COMPANY OR ANY OF THE
CONTRIBUTED ASSETS (OR THE OWNERSHIP OR OPERATION THEREOF) ARE IN COMPLIANCE
WITH ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. KLRE hereby acknowledges and agrees that KLREs
sole remedy for any defect of title, including any Title Defect, with respect
to any of the Contributed Assets (i) on or before the Defect Deadline, shall
be as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ and (ii) without duplication,
from and after the Defect Deadline, shall be pursuant to the special warranty
of title set forth in _Section 3.1(n)(i)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that KLRE
further acknowledges and agrees that KLRE shall not be entitled to protection
under the special warranty of title provided in _Section 3.1(n)(i)_ for any
Title Defect reported by KLRE prior to the Defect Deadline under this
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_. The special warranty of title contained in _Section
3.1(n)(i)_ shall be subject to the terms and provisions of this _Section
2.5(a)_, and the recovery on a breach of the Companys special warranty of
title contained in _Section 3.1(n)(i)_ shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
the affected Subject Formation of the affected Oil and Gas Property. Claims
for indemnification under _Section 3.1(n)(i)_ shall be resolved in accordance
with _Article VII_ (but without regard or giving effect to the Defect
Deadline, the Title Defect Deductible or the Title Threshold).

(b) _Defect Notices_. KLRE shall deliver to Tema written notice meeting the
requirements of this  _Section 2.5(b)_ (each, a " _Defect Notice_ ") with
respect to each alleged Defect to Tema as soon as reasonably practicable after
identifying such Defect but in any event at or 

 



39  before 5:00 p.m. Houston. Texas time, February 18, 2017 (the " _Defect
Deadline_ "). For all purposes of this Agreement and notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, KLRE shall be deemed to have waived, and Tema shall
have no liability for, any Defect that KLRE fails to assert as a Defect
through delivery of a Defect Notice received by Tema before the Defect
Deadline. To be effective, each Defect Notice shall include, as to each
alleged Defect alleged therein:

(i) a description of the alleged Defect that is reasonably sufficient for
Tema to investigate or determine the basis of the alleged Defect;

(ii) the Contributed Asset(s) subject to such Defect;

(iii) the Allocated Value of the Oil and Gas Properties subject to the alleged
Defect;

 

(iv) KLREs good faith reasonable estimate of the Defect Amount attributable
to such Defect and the computations and information upon which KLREs
estimate is based; and

(v) to the extent available, documents and information reasonably necessary
for Tema (as well as any title attorney, examiner or environmental consultant
hired by such Parties) to verify, investigate or be put on notice as to the
existence of the alleged Defect.

 

(c) _Option to Cure Defects and Remedies for Defects_. Tema may notify KLRE in
writing on or before the Closing Date that Tema elects to cure any validly
asserted Defect. Tema shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
attempt, at Temas sole cost, to cure or remove, on or prior to the Closing
Date, any Defects asserted in a Defect Notice. Tema shall be deemed to
have cured or removed a validly asserted Defect on or prior to the Closing
Date if the Oil and Gas Properties affected by such asserted Defect are free
of all Defects as of the Closing Date. With respect to any Defect that has not
been waived by KLRE, or cured on or before the Closing Date, then, subject to
Temas right to dispute the existence of such Defect, there shall be a
downward adjustment to the Unadjusted Consideration equal to the Defect Amount
for such Defect, subject, however, in each case as applicable, to the Title
Defect Threshold, Environmental Defect Threshold, Title Defect Deductible, and
Environmental Defect Deductible; _provided_ , _however_ that if the Defect
Amount for any Defect exceeds the amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the
Allocated Value of the Subject Formation of the Oil and Gas Property that is
subject to such Defect, then Tema shall have the right, in its sole
discretion, to elect to retain such Oil and Gas Property, in which case the
Unadjusted Consideration shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such
Subject Formation of such Oil and Gas Property and such Oil and Gas Property
shall not be conveyed to the Company under the Contribution Agreement.

 

(d) _Defect Amounts_. With respect to a particular Defect, the diminution in
value of the Oil and Gas Property attributable to such Defect (the " _Defect
Amount_ ") shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms, and conditions:

 

(i) if KLRE and Tema agree in writing on the Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Defect Amount;

 



40 (ii) if a Title Defect is an Encumbrance (other than a Permitted
Encumbrance) that is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Defect
Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid to remove such Title Defect
from Temas and the Companys interest in the affected Oil and Gas Property;

 

(iii) if a Title Defect as to any Well or Future Well represents a negative
discrepancy between (A) the actual Net Revenue Interest of Tema or the
Company for such Well or Future Well (with respect to the Subject Formation
set forth for such Well or Future Well) and (B) the "Net __ Revenue Interest"
percentage stated on _Exhibit_ __ _ F-2_ for such Well or _Exhibit_ __ _
F-3_ for such Future Well, as applicable (with respect to the Subject
Formation set forth for such Well or Future Well), then the Defect Amount for
such Title Defect shall be equal to the product of (1) the Allocated Value of
the affected Subject Formation of such Well or Future Well _multiplied_ _
____by_ (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is (x) the remainder of (I)
the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on _Exhibit_ __ _ F-2_ for such
Well or _Exhibit_ __ _ F-3_ for such Future Well, as applicable _minus_ (II)
the actual Net Revenue Interest of Tema or the Company for such Well or Future
Well, and the denominator of which is (y) the "Net Revenue Interest"
percentage stated on _Exhibit_ __ _ F-2_ for such Well or _Exhibit_ __ _
F-3_ for such Future Well, as applicable; _provided_ that if the Title Defect
does not affect the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on _Exhibit_ __ _
F-2_ for such Well or _Exhibit_ __ _ F-3_ for such Future Well throughout its
entire productive life, the Defect Amount determined under this _Section
2.5(d)(iii)_ shall be reduced to take into account the applicable time period
only; 

(iv) if a Title Defect as to any Undeveloped Lease represents a negative
discrepancy between (A) the actual Net Revenue Interest of Tema or the
Company for such Undeveloped Lease (with respect to the Subject Formation set
forth for such Undeveloped Lease) and (B) the "Net Revenue Interest"
percentage stated on _Exhibit F-1_ for such Undeveloped Lease (with respect to
the Subject Formation set forth for such Undeveloped Lease), then the Defect
Amount for such Title Defect shall be equal to the product of (1) the number
of Net Mineral Acres subject to such Title Defect, _multiplied by_ (2) the
Net Mineral Acre Price of such Undeveloped Lease _multiplied_ _ ____by_ (3) a
fraction, the numerator of which is (x) the remainder of (I) the "Net Revenue
Interest" stated in _Exhibit_ __ _ F-1_ for such Undeveloped Lease _minus_
(II) the actual Net Revenue Interest of Tema or the Company for
such Undeveloped Lease, and the denominator of which is (y) the "Net Revenue
Interest" stated in _Exhibit_ __ _ F-1_ for such Undeveloped Lease;
_provided_ that if the Title Defect does not affect the "Net Revenue
Interest" percentage stated on _Exhibit_ __ _ F-1_ for such Undeveloped Lease
throughout its entire productive life, the Defect Amount determined under
this _Section 2.5(d)(iv)_ shall be reduced to take into account the applicable
time period only;

(v) if a Title Defect constitutes a reduction in the number of Net Mineral
Acres as to any Undeveloped Lease (or portion thereof) (with respect to the
Subject Formation set forth for such Undeveloped Lease), then the Defect
Amount for 

 



41  such Title Defect shall be equal to the product of (1) the Net Mineral Acre
Price thereof, _multiplied_ _ ____by_ (2) the remainder of (x) the number of
Net Mineral Acres purported to be included in such Undeveloped Lease as set
forth on _Exhibit F-1_ _minus_ (y) the actual number of Net Mineral Acres
included in such Undeveloped Lease after giving effect to such Defect;

(vi) if a Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or charge
upon or other defect in title to the affected Oil and Gas Property of a type
not described in _Section 2.5(d)(i)_ through _(v)_ , the Defect Amount
therefor shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the
affected Subject Formation of the Oil and Gas Property so affected, the
portion of Temas or the Companys Undivided Interest in the Oil and Gas
Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect,
the potential present value economic effect of the Title Defect over the life
of the affected Oil and Gas Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect
by KLRE and Tema, the estimated capital and operational costs and expenses (or
reduction or increases thereof) attributable thereto and the Company Working
Interest therein, and such other factors as are necessary to make an
evaluation and determination of such value;

 

(vii) if a Defect is an Environmental Defect, the Defect Amount shall be equal
to the estimated present value of the costs and expenses to Remediate the
Contributed Asset subject to such Environmental Defect in the lowest-cost
effective manner available, consistent with applicable Environmental Laws
taking into account that non-permanent remedies (including mechanisms to
contain or stabilize Hazardous Substances, including monitoring site
conditions, natural attenuation, risk-based corrective action, institutional
controls, or other appropriate restrictions on the industrial use of the
property, caps, dikes, encapsulation, leachate collection systems, and the
like) may be the most cost-effective manner, consistent with the continued
safe and prudent long-term operation of the affected Contributed Asset
reasonably available and, where applicable, to the satisfaction of the
applicable Governmental Entity;

 

(viii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
aggregate adjustment to the Unadjusted Consideration for all Title Defect
Amounts attributable to Title Defects as to an individual Oil and Gas Property
shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Oil and Gas Property; _provided_
, _however_ , that the foregoing limitations shall in no event apply to
Defect Amounts with respect to Environmental Defect; and

(ix) the amount of any adjustment to the Unadjusted Consideration shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in any other
adjustments for Defects hereunder or for which KLRE otherwise receives a
downward adjustment to the Unadjusted Consideration.

 



42 (e) _Threshold and Defect Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement:

(i) There shall be no adjustments to the Unadjusted Consideration for any
Title Defect or Title Benefit to the extent the Defect Amount of such Title
Defect or the Benefit Amount of such Title Benefit is less than the Title
Defect Threshold;

 

(ii) With respect to all valid Title Defects where the Defect Amount thereof
exceeds the Title Defect Threshold, there shall be no adjustment to the
Unadjusted Consideration with respect to any and all such Title Defects unless
and until the aggregate Defect Amounts thereof exceeds the Title Defect
Deductible and then only to the extent such aggregate amount exceeds
the Title Defect Deductible.

(iii) There shall be no adjustment to the Unadjusted Consideration for any
Environmental Defect to the extent the Defect Amount of such Environmental
Defect is less than the Environmental Defect Threshold;

(iv) With respect to all valid Environmental Defects where the Defect Amount
thereof exceeds the Environmental Defect Threshold, there shall be no
adjustment to the Unadjusted Consideration with respect to any and all such
Environmental Defects unless and until the aggregate Defect Amounts thereof
exceeds the Environmental Defect Deductible and then only to the extent such
aggregate amount exceeds the Environmental Defect Deductible;

 

(v) With respect to all valid Title Benefits where the Benefit Amounts thereof
exceeds the Title Defect Threshold, there shall be no adjustment or offset to
the Unadjusted Consideration with respect to any and all such Title Benefits
unless and until the aggregate Benefit Amounts thereof exceeds the Title
Defect Deductible and then only to the extent such aggregate amount exceeds
the Title Defect Deductible; and

(vi) Any adjustment to the Unadjusted Consideration with respect to a
Title Defect that affects an Oil and Gas Property shall be offset by an
amount equal to the increase (if any) in the Allocated Value of such Oil and
Gas Property as a result of any Title Benefit that affects such Oil and Gas
Property, but only to the extent (A) each such Benefit Amount thereof exceeds
the Title Defect Threshold and (B) the aggregate Benefit Amounts thereof
exceeds the Title Defect Deductible and then only to the extent such aggregate
amount exceeds the Title Defect Deductible.

(f) _Title Benefits_.

 

(i) Tema shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to KLRE
written notice meeting the requirements of this  _Section 2.5(f)_ (each, a "
_Benefit Notice_ ") with respect to each Title Benefit discovered by Tema as
soon as reasonably practicable after identifying such Title Benefit but in any
event at or before the Defect Deadline. KLRE shall promptly notify Tema in
writing of each Title Benefit that KLRE discovers before the Defect Deadline.
To be effective, each Benefit Notice shall include, as to each Title Benefit
alleged therein:

 

(A) a description of the alleged Title Benefit that is reasonably sufficient
for KLRE to determine or investigate the basis of the alleged Title Benefit;

 



43 (B) the Oil and Gas Property subject to such Title Benefit;

 

(C) the Allocated Value of the Oil and Gas Property subject to the alleged
Title Benefit;

 

(D) Temas good faith reasonable estimate of the Benefit Amount attributable
to such Title Benefit and the computations and information upon which Temas
estimate is based; and

(E) to the extent available, all documents and information reasonably
necessary for KLRE (as well as any title attorney, examiner or environmental
consultant hired by KLRE) to verify, investigate or be put on notice as to the
existence of the alleged Title Benefit.

 

(ii) With respect to a particular Title Benefit, the amount by which the
Allocated Value of the Subject Formation of the Oil and Gas Property affected
by such Title Benefit is increased as a result of the existence of such Title
Benefit (the " _Benefit Amount_ ") shall be determined in accordance with the
following methodology, terms and conditions: 

(A) if KLRE and Tema agree on the Benefit Amount, then that amount shall be
the Benefit Amount;

 

(B) if a Title Benefit as to any Well or Future Well represents a positive
discrepancy between (1) the actual Net Revenue Interest of Tema or the
Company for such Well or Future Well (with respect to the Subject Formation
set forth for such Well or Future Well) and (2) the "Net Revenue Interest"
percentage stated on _Exhibit_ __ _ F-2_ for such Well or _Exhibit_ __ _
F-3_ for such Future Well, as applicable (with respect to the Subject
Formation set forth for such Well or Future Well), then the Benefit Amount
for such Title Benefit shall be equal to the product of (x) the Allocated
Value of the affected Subject Formation of such Well or Future Well
_multiplied by_ (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is (I) the remainder
of the actual Net Revenue Interest of Tema or the Company for such Well or
Future Well _minus_ the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on 
_Exhibit_ __ _ F-2_ for such Well or _Exhibit_ __ _ F-3_ for such Future
Well, as applicable, and the denominator of which is (II) the "Net Revenue
Interest" percentage stated on _Exhibit_ __ _ F-2_ for such Well or _Exhibit_
__ _ F-3_ for such Future Well, as applicable; _provided_ that if the Title
Benefit does not affect the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on
_Exhibit_ __ _ F-2_ for such Well or  _Exhibit_ __ _ F-3_ for such Future
Well throughout its entire productive life, the Benefit Amount determined
under this _Section 2.5(f)(ii)B)_ shall be adjusted to take into account
the applicable time period only;

 



44 (C) if a Title Benefit as to any Undeveloped Lease represents a
positive discrepancy between (1) the actual Net Revenue Interest of Tema or
the Company for such Undeveloped Lease (with respect to the Subject Formation
set forth for such Undeveloped Lease) and (2) the "Net Revenue Interest"
percentage stated on _Exhibit_ __ _ F-1_ for such Undeveloped Lease (with
respect to the Subject Formation set forth for such Undeveloped Lease), then
the Benefit Amount for such Title Benefit shall be equal to the product of
(x) the Allocated Value of the affected Subject Formation of such Undeveloped
Lease _multiplied by_ (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is (I) the
remainder of the actual Net Revenue Interest of Tema or the Company for such
Undeveloped Lease minus the "Net Revenue Interest" stated in _Exhibit_ __ _
F-1_ for such Undeveloped Lease, and the denominator of which is (II)
the "Net Revenue Interest" stated in _Exhibit_ __ _ F-1_ for such
Undeveloped Lease; _provided_ that if the Title Benefit does not affect the
"Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on _Exhibit_ __ _ F-1_ for such
Undeveloped Lease throughout its entire productive life, the Benefit Amount
determined under this _Section 2.5(f)(ii)(C)_ shall be adjusted to take into
account the applicable time period only; and

(D) if a Title Benefit constitutes an increase in the number of Net Mineral
Acres as to any Undeveloped Lease (or portion thereof) (with respect to the
Subject Formation set forth for such Undeveloped Lease), then the Benefit
Amount for such Title Benefit shall be equal to the product of (1) the Net
Mineral Acre Price thereof, _multiplied by_ (2) the remainder of (x) the
actual number of Net Mineral Acres included in such Undeveloped Lease after
giving effect to such Title Benefit _minus_ (y) the number of Net Mineral
Acres purported to be included in such Undeveloped Lease as set forth on
_Exhibit_ __ _ F-1_.

 

(g) _Disputed Defects_.

 

(i) Tema and KLRE shall use good faith efforts to agree on the validity and
determination of all Defects and Defect Amounts (or the cure thereof) and all
Title Benefits and Benefit Amounts before the Closing Date. If Tema and KLRE
are unable to agree on the scope, interpretation and effect of this _Section_
__ _ 2.5_ or the existence, cure or amount of any Defect or Defect Amount or
the existence or amount of any Title Benefit or Benefit Amount by the Closing
Date, then, Temas good faith estimate shall be used to determine the
Estimated Consideration pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_. If Tema and KLRE
are unable to agree on the scope, interpretation and effect of this _Section_
__ _ 2.5_ or existence, cure or amount of any Defect or Defect Amount or the
existence or amount of any Title Benefit or Benefit Amount before the Closing
Date, then such disputed interpretations and effects shall be exclusively and
finally resolved pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ and this  _Section_ __ _
2.5(g)_ and Tema and KLRE shall submit such disputes for determination through
arbitration to (A) with respect to unresolved Title Defects and Title
Benefits, a title attorney that has at least ten (10) years of experience in
oil and gas titles in the State of Texas as selected by mutual agreement of
KLRE and Tema (the " _Title_ __ _ Referee_") and (B) with respect to
unresolved Environmental Defects, a nationally recognized independent
environmental consulting firm mutually acceptable to

 



45  both Tema and KLRE (the " _Environmental Referee_ " and collectively with
the Title Referee, each a " _Defect Referee_ "). No Defect Referee shall have
worked as an employee, environmental consulting firm, or outside counsel for
any Party or any Affiliate of any Party during the ten (10) year period
preceding the arbitration or have any financial interest in the dispute.

 

(ii) Within ten (10) Business Days after the selection of the applicable
Defect Referee, the Parties shall provide to the applicable Defect Referee
only the documents and materials described in this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, as
applicable:

 

(A) KLREs Defect Notice and all documentation provided therewith with respect
to each disputed Defect and Temas Benefit Notice and all documentation
provided therewith with respect to each disputed Title Benefit;

(B) such evidence as each Party deems appropriate to explain and dispute the
existence, waiver and cure of each disputed Defect or the Defect Amount
assigned thereto by any Party, together with such Partys good faith estimate
of the Defect Amount, if any, with respect to each such disputed Defect; and

(C) existence or waiver of each disputed Title Benefit or the Benefit
Amount assigned thereto by any Party, together with such Partys good faith
estimate of the Benefit Amount, if any, with respect to each such disputed
Title Benefit;

 

(D) this _Article_ __ _ II_, _Schedule 1.1-AV_, and  _Exhibit_ __ _ F_
(including _Exhibits F-1_, _F-2_ , _F-3_ and  _F-4_ ), together with any
definitions of terms used in this _Article_ __ _ II_ and such Exhibits and
schedule, but no other provisions of this Agreement.

 

(iii) The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be
conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the
terms of this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_. The applicable Defect Referees
determination shall be made within fifteen (15) days after such Defect
Referees receipt of the documents and materials submitted pursuant to the
foregoing _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ and shall be final and binding upon the
Parties, without right of appeal. In making a determination, the Defect
Referee shall be bound by the rules set forth in this _Article_ __ _ II_ and
may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the applicable Defect
Referee are necessary or helpful to make a determination.

(iv) In no event shall the Defect Referees determination of any Defect Amount
with respect to any Defect be any lower than the amount asserted by Tema for
such Defect or any greater than the amount asserted by KLRE for such Defect.
In no event shall the Defect Referees determination of any Benefit Amount
with respect to any Title Benefit be any greater than the amount asserted by
Tema for such Title Benefit or

 



46  any lesser than the amount asserted by KLRE for such Title Benefit.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Defect Referee shall have
exclusive, final and binding authority with respect to the scope of the
Defect Referees authority with respect to any dispute arising under or
related to this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ or any disputed Defect, Defect Amount,
Title Benefit or Benefit Amount and in no event shall any dispute as to the
authority of the Defect Referee to determine any such disputes be subject to
resolution or the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 9.7_. The applicable Defect
Referee shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the
interpretation and effect of this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ and any and all
specific disputed Defect Amounts and Benefit Amounts submitted by any Party
and may not award any damages, interest or penalties to any Party with
respect to any matter. Tema and KLRE shall each bear its own legal fees and
other costs of presenting its case. KLRE shall bear one-half of the fees,
costs and expenses of the applicable Defect Referee, and Tema shall be
responsible for the remaining one-half of the fees, costs and expenses of the
applicable Defect Referee.

 

(v) Promptly following the determination of the Defect Amounts pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.5(g)_, KLRE and Tema shall deliver written notice of
such Defect Amounts to the Independent Accountant for inclusion in the Final
Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4_.

 

2.6 _Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,

thereof), at the offices of Vinson and Elkins, L.L.P., 1001 Fannin Street,
Suite 2500, Houston, Texas 77002, unless another date or place is agreed to in

Date_ "). In lieu of a physical Closing, the Parties agree that all requisite
Closing documents may be exchanged electronically at the Closing, and that
documents so exchanged shall be binding for all purposes upon explicit release
of the same by the applicable Parties.

contributing the Consideration and the additional Available Cash set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 2.1_ to the Company Partnership in exchange for an interest in
the Company Partnership in a transaction qualifying for nonrecognition of
gain or loss pursuant to Section 721(a) of the Code, (b) Rosemore will be
treated as contributing the Contributed Assets to the Company Partnership in
exchange for an interest in the Company Partnership, the Consideration and
the assumption by the Company Partnership of the liabilities of the Company
(other than the Retained Liabilities) in a transaction qualifying for
nonrecognition of gain or loss under Section 721(a) of the Code, subject to
Section 707 of the

 



49  Code and Treasury Regulations thereunder, (c) the distribution of the

Agreement). KLRE and Tema and its Affiliates agree to treat the transaction
consistently with the foregoing statement of intent for U.S. federal and
applicable state income Tax purposes to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law. For purposes of the foregoing, the " _Company Partnership_ "
shall mean the Company from and after its classification as a partnership for
U.S. federal income tax purposes (in which KLRE and Rosemore are treated as
partners) that is created upon the purchase by KLRE of the Acquired Units, in
accordance with Treasury Regulation § 301.7701-3.

qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure so

obligations and liabilities incurred in connection with its formation and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements

Company Act) and are not subject to preemptive rights or any other
Encumbrances (except arising pursuant to applicable securities Laws or
arising under the Organizational Documents of the Company or the Ancillary

and are in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of
COBRA. 

(viii) Neither the execution of this Agreement, the stockholder approval of
this Agreement, nor the consummation of the Transactions (either alone or in
combination with any other event) will (A) give rise to any liability under
any Employee Benefit Plan, including liability for severance pay, termination
pay or withdrawal liability, (B) accelerate the time of payment, funding or
vesting or increase the amount of compensation or benefits due to any
employee, officer, director, stockholder or other service provider of Tema,

any employee, officer, director, stockholder or other service provider of
Tema, the Company or their respective Affiliates (whether current, former or
retired) or their beneficiaries being classified as a "parachute payment" as
defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code. Each Business Employee Benefit Plan
that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation" arrangement under Section 409A
of the Code has been established, maintained and operated in compliance with
Section 409A of the Code, and no service provider is entitled to a tax gross-
up or similar payment for any tax or interest that may be due under Sections
409A or 4999 of the Code.

as presently conducted and the Company as conducted at such
time (collectively, the " _Company Intellectual Property_ "), free and clear
of any and all Encumbrances, except for Permitted Encumbrances and (B) the
Company Intellectual Property owned by the Tema (in connection with
the Contributed Assets) and that will be owned by the Company is subsisting
and in full force and effect and valid and, to the Knowledge of Tema and the
Company, enforceable.

 



58 (ii) To the Knowledge of Tema and the Company and except as would not
be reasonably likely to have a Tema Material Adverse Effect, the use of the
Company Intellectual Property by the Company and the operation of the business
of the Company and Tema (to the extent relating to the Contributed Assets)
does not and will not conflict with, infringe upon, violate, interfere with
or otherwise misappropriate any intellectual property right of any other
Person.

 

(iii) Except as would not be reasonably likely to have a Tema Material Adverse
Effect, the Company Systems (A) operate in accordance with their
documentation and functional specifications and as otherwise required by the
Company and Tema and have not materially malfunctioned or failed within the
last two (2) years and (B) are sufficient for the immediate and reasonably
foreseeable needs of Tema (in connection with the Contributed Assets) and the
Company, including as to capacity and ability to process current volumes in a
timely manner. Except as would not be reasonably likely to have a Tema
Material Adverse Effect, Tema and the Company have implemented commercially
reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of
the Company Systems and all information and data stored therein or transmitted
thereby (including any sensitive or protected information, which includes
personally identifiable information and payment card information) against any
unauthorized use, access, interruption, modification or corruption. Except as
would not be reasonably likely to be material to Tema and the Company, to the
Knowledge of the Company, during the past twelve (12) months, neither the

unauthorized access to, theft of, breaches of security with respect to or
corruption, loss, or destruction of any of the Company Systems or the
information and data stored therein or transmitted thereby.

interference with the ownership or operation of the Contributed Assets or
the business of the Company. KLRE shall have the right to perform visual site
inspections and environmental compliance evaluations (including the use of

the ambient air, soil, surface water, groundwater, or other media on or
relating to the Contributed Assets necessary to confirm the presence of such
Environmental Defects. KLRE shall furnish to Tema, free of costs, a copy of

soon as reasonably possible after such report is prepared. KLRE shall obtain
all permits necessary to conduct any approved invasive activities from any
applicable Governmental Entities; _provided_ that, upon request, Tema and the

or the Company) as reasonably requested by KLRE that may be necessary to
secure such permits. The Company shall have the right, at its option, to split
with KLRE any samples collected pursuant to approved invasive activities. KLRE
shall furnish to Tema, free of costs, a copy of any written drafts and final
reports prepared prior to the Defect Deadline by or for KLRE related to any
such Phase I, or relating to the Company or any of the Contributed Assets as

Deadline. If the Closing does not occur, (i) KLRE shall promptly return to the
Company or, at the Companys request, destroy all copies of any records,
reports, summaries, evaluations, opinions, due diligence memos and derivative
materials related thereto in the possession or control of KLRE or any of
KLREs Representatives, (ii) KLRE shall keep and shall cause each KLRE
Representative to keep, any and all information obtained by or on behalf of

solely for legal, regulatory and compliance purposes and (B)
electronic copies with its or their customary electronic record retention and
retrieval practices.

(c) KLRE shall abide by Temas, the Companys and any Third Party operators

(including the execution and delivery of any documentation or paperwork, such
as confidentiality agreements or liability releases, required by Third Party
operators with respect to KLREs access

 



80  to any of the Contributed Assets) while conducting its due diligence
evaluation of the Contributed Assets. KLRE shall provide Tema with at least
two Business Days written notice before the Contributed Assets are proposed
to be accessed pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_, which notice will
include a description of the activities KLRE intends to undertake.

 

(d) In connection with the rights of access, examination and inspection
granted to KLRE under this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_, (i) KLRE WAIVES AND RELEASES
ALL CLAIMS AGAINST EACH TEMA INDEMNIFIED PARTY, THE COMPANY AND EACH THIRD
PARTY OPERATOR ARISING IN ANY WAY THEREFROM OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED THEREWITH
AND (ii) KLRE HEREBY AGREES TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS EACH TEMA
INDEMNIFIED PARTY, THE COMPANY AND EACH THIRD PARTY OPERATOR FROM AND AGAINST
ANY AND ALL DAMAGES ATTRIBUTABLE TO PERSONAL INJURY, DEATH OR PHYSICAL
PROPERTY DAMAGE, OR VIOLATION OF THE TEMA INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, THE COMPANYS
OR ANY THIRD PARTY OPERATORS WRITTEN RULES, REGULATIONS, OR OPERATING
POLICIES, ARISING OUT OF, RESULTING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY FIELD VISIT OR
OTHER DUE DILIGENCE ACTIVITY CONDUCTED BY KLRE WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY OR
THE CONTRIBUTED ASSETS, EVEN IF SUCH LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM,
SOLELY OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW BY ANY TEMA
INDEMNIFIED PARTY, THE COMPANY OR ANY THIRD PARTY OPERATOR; BUT EXCLUDING ANY
DAMAGES OR LIABILITIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE (I) GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT ON THE PART OF ANY TEMA INDEMNIFIED PARTY, THE COMPANY OR ANY THIRD

5.3 _Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_.

 

(a) KLRE shall call, hold and convene a meeting of its stockholders to
consider the Transaction Proposals, to be held as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the mailing of the Proxy Statement to KLREs stockholders,
subject to applicable Law. In connection with the meeting, (i) the Board of
Directors of KLRE shall recommend that the stockholders of KLRE vote in favor
of the approval of each of the Transaction Proposals at KLREs stockholders
meeting and the Board of Directors of KLRE shall use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit from stockholders of KLRE proxies in favor of the adoption
of each of the Transaction Proposals and (ii) the Proxy Statement shall
include a statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of KLRE has
recommended that KLREs stockholders vote in favor of adoption of each of the
Transaction Proposals at KLREs stockholders meeting. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, KLRE may adjourn or
postpone KLREs stockholders meeting (A) to the extent necessary to ensure
that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided
to KLREs stockholders or, if as of

 



81  the time for which KLREs stockholders meeting is originally scheduled (as
set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of KLRE Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct business at such meeting; _provided_ that no adjournment
may be to a date on or after two (2) Business Days prior to the Termination
Date or (B) by ten (10) Business Days in order to solicit additional proxies
from stockholders of KLRE in favor of the adoption of each of the Transaction
Proposals.

(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, neither the
Board of Directors of KLRE nor any committee thereof shall (i) fail to include
the KLRE Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (ii) withdraw, qualify
or withhold, amend or modify or publicly propose to withdraw or withhold,
amend, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Tema, the KLRE Board
Recommendation or (iii) resolve, agree or publicly propose to do any of the
foregoing (any action or failure to act described in this _Section 5.3(b)_
being referred to herein as a " _KLRE Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of KLRE may after the date hereof and prior to the time the KLRE
Stockholder Approval is obtained, make a KLRE Adverse Recommendation Change
only (x) in response to an Intervening Event and (y) if the Board of Directors
of KLRE (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that the failure to take such action in response to such Intervening
Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law;  _provided_ that, prior to making such a KLRE
Adverse Recommendation Change, (i) KLRE provides Tema prior written notice of
its intent to make any KLRE Adverse Recommendation Change at least three (3)
Business Days prior to taking such action, which notice shall specify the
basis for such KLRE Adverse Recommendation Change, including a reasonably
detailed description of the facts and circumstances relating to such
Intervening Event (a " _Notice_ ") (it being understood that such Notice
shall not in itself be deemed a KLRE Adverse Recommendation Change and that
any material change to the facts or circumstances relating to such Intervening
Event shall require a new Notice and, in such case, all references to three
(3) Business Days in this _Section 5.3(c)_ shall be deemed to be two (2)
Business Days (each such two or three Business Day Period, a " _Notice Period_
")); (ii) during such Notice Period, if requested by Tema, KLRE shall, and
shall make available and direct its necessary Representatives to, discuss and
negotiate in good faith with Tema any proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement; and (iii) following such Notice Period, the
Board of Directors of KLRE, after taking into account any modifications to the
terms of this Agreement and the Transactions to which Tema would agree,
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, that failure to effect such KLRE Adverse Recommendation
Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit KLRE or the Board of
Directors of KLRE (or a duly authorized committee thereof) from making any
disclosure to the stockholders of KLRE if the Board of Directors of KLRE (or a
duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with applicable
Law.

 



82  No disclosures under this _Section 5.3(d)_ shall be, in themselves, a breach
of this _Section 5.3(d)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section 5.3(d)_ shall be deemed to modify or supplement the definition of
(or the requirements pursuant to this _Section 5.3(d)_ with respect to) a
"KLRE Adverse Recommendation Change," and any public disclosure by KLRE or the
Board of Directors of KLRE or any committee thereof relating to any
determination, position or other action by the Board of Directors of KLRE or
any committee thereof with respect to any Intervening Event shall be deemed to
be a KLRE Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors of KLRE
expressly publicly reaffirms the recommendation of the Board of Directors in
such disclosure.

5.4  _Antitrust Approvals and Other Approvals; Efforts_.

(a) Each of the Parties shall: (i) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate
with each other in timely making all filings required under this Agreement to
complete the Transactions, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with
each other in timely making all other filings with, and timely seeking
all other consents, permits, authorizations or approvals from, Governmental
Entities as necessary or appropriate to consummate the Transactions, and (iii)
supply to any Governmental Entity as promptly as practicable any additional
information or documents that may be requested pursuant to any Law or by such
Governmental Entity. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_ shall require
either Party to share information reflecting the value of the Transactions or
subject to any applicable privilege unless the Parties have entered into a
mutually agreeable joint defense agreement.

(b) If a filing is required by the HSR Act, KLRE shall or shall cause its
ultimate parent entity and Tema shall or shall cause its ultimate parent
entity to: (i) as promptly as practicable and in any event no later than
fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, file, or cause
to be filed (and not withdraw), a Notification and Report Form under the HSR
Act with the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust
Division_ ") in connection with the Transactions; and (ii) use its reasonable
best efforts to (A) respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries
received from the FTC or the Antitrust Division for additional information or
documentation, (B) cause the waiting period under the HSR Act to terminate or
expire at the earliest possible date but in no event later than the
Termination, and (C) avoid each and every impediment under the HSR Act with
respect to the Transactions so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible (and in any event not later than the Termination Date).

 

(c) Tema and KLRE shall not take any action that would hinder or delay the
obtaining of clearance or the expiration of the required waiting period under
the HSR Act.

5.5 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

(a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person (as defined
below) may have pursuant to any employment agreement, indemnification
agreement or otherwise, from and after the Closing, solely to the extent of
indemnification contained in the organizational documents of the Company, any
employment agreement or indemnification agreement effective as of the date
hereof, KLRE shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each

 



83  Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement or who becomes prior to the Closing, subject to the terms hereof, a
director or officer of the Company or who acts as a fiduciary under any
Employee Benefit Plan of the Company or any predecessor thereof (the "
_Indemnified Persons_ ") against all Losses, claims, damages, costs, fines,
penalties, expenses (including attorneys and other professionals fees and
expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement
with the approval of the Indemnifying Party (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) of or in connection with any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in
whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such
Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or a predecessor
thereof, a fiduciary under any Employee Benefit Plan of the Company or a
predecessor thereof or is or was serving at the request, which request was
made prior to the date hereof, of the Company or a predecessor thereof as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, Employee Benefit Plan, trust or
other enterprise or by reason of anything done or not done by such Person in
any such capacity whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or
existing prior to, at or after the Closing and whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Closing (" _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), including
all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole
or in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the Transactions, in
each case to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and KLRE shall
cause the Company to, jointly and severally, pay expenses in advance of
the final disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, subject to a requirement to repay such advances if such
Indemnified Person is adjudicated to have not been entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this terms hereof or otherwise). Without limiting
the foregoing, in the event any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation is brought against any Indemnified Persons (whether arising
before or after the Closing), (i) the Indemnified Persons may retain the
Companys regularly engaged legal counsel or other counsel satisfactory to
them, and KLRE shall cause the Company to pay all reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel for the Indemnified Persons promptly following receipt of
statements therefor and (ii) KLRE shall reasonably assist in the defense of
any such matter, _provided_ that KLRE shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Any Indemnified Person wishing
to claim indemnification under this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, upon learning of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify KLRE (but
the failure to so notify shall not relieve a Party from any liability that it
may have under this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices such Partys position with respect to such claims) and
shall deliver to KLRE any undertaking required by applicable Law, but, subject
to applicable Law, without any requirement for the posting of a bond or any
other terms or conditions other than those expressly set forth herein.

(b) KLRE shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify the Organizational
Documents of KLRE or the Company in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder or under the Organizational Documents of the Company
with respect to periods prior to the Closing of individuals who at and at any
time prior to the Closing were directors or officers of the Company or a
predecessor thereof, except to the extent required by Law. KLRE shall fulfill
and honor any indemnification agreements between the Company or a predecessor
thereof and any of its respective directors, officers or employees existing
as of the date hereof, solely to the extent such indemnification agreement has
been provided or made available to KLRE prior to the date hereof.

 



84 (c) KLRE shall indemnify any Indemnified Person against all reasonable costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses), such amounts to be
payable in advance upon request as provided in _Section_ __ _ 5.5(a)_,
relating to the enforcement of such Indemnified Persons rights under this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.5_ or under any charter, bylaw or contract subject to an
undertaking by such Indemnified Person to return such advance if such
Indemnified Person is ultimately determined to not be entitled to
indemnification hereunder or thereunder.

(d) The Company will cause to be put in place and shall fully prepay
immediately prior to the Closing "tail" insurance policies with a claims
period of at least six (6) years from the Closing from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance
carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance in an
amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies with
respect to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the
Closing.

 

(e) In the event that KLRE or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of KLRE shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _
5.5_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
Parties and each Person entitled to indemnification or insurance coverage or
expense advancement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, and his heirs and
representatives.

 

5.6 _Agreement to Defend_. In the event any claim, action, suit, investigation
or other legal or administrative proceeding by any Governmental Entity or
other Person is commenced that questions the validity or legality of the
Transactions or seeks damages in connection therewith, the Parties agree to
cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend against and
respond thereto.

5.7 _Public Announcements_. The Parties will not, and each Party will cause
its Representatives not to, issue any public announcements or make other
public disclosures regarding this Agreement (including with respect to the
execution of this Agreement) or the Transactions, without the prior written
approval of the Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Party or its
Representatives may issue a public announcement or other public disclosures
required by applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that the restrictions set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ shall not apply to any release or public
statement made or proposed to be made with respect to a KLRE Adverse
Recommendation Change or any action taken pursuant or in response thereto;
_provided_ , _further_ , that such Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to afford the other Party an opportunity to first review the
content of the proposed disclosure and provide reasonable comment regarding
same. For the avoidance of doubt, communications by KLRE, Tema or the Company
to their respective Affiliates, and to their and their respective Affiliates
employees, directors, managers, members, partners, current or prospective
equityholders, investors and advisors in connection with entrance into this
Agreement and in the ordinary course of business, in each case, who are
subject to customary confidentiality restrictions, shall not be considered
public announcements or disclosures subject to restriction under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7_.

 



85 5.8 _Advice of Changes; SEC Filings_. Subject to compliance with all
applicable Laws, Tema and KLRE, as the case may be, shall confer on a regular
basis with each other, report on operational matters and shall promptly advise
each other orally and in writing of any change or event having, or which would
be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Tema
Material Adverse Effect or KLRE Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.
The Company and KLRE shall promptly provide each other (or their respective
counsel) copies of all filings made by such Party or its Subsidiaries with
the SEC or any other Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and
the Transactions. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give KLRE,
directly or indirectly, rights to control or direct the Companys operations
prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, Tema shall exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision of the Companys operations.

BE AT ITS SOLE RISK.

Tema and KLRE agree that, to the extent required by applicable Law, the
disclaimers of certain representations and warranties contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.9_ are "conspicuous" disclaimers for the purpose of any
applicable Law. Nothing in this Agreement (including this _Section_ __ _
5.9_) shall relieve any Party of any liability for or limit any Persons
ability to seek any remedy in the event of Fraud.

 

5.10 _Financing; Cooperation_. Prior to the Closing and in connection with the
private placement or placements to be consummated by KLRE in connection with
the Closing and the Transactions (the " _Equity Financing_ "), Tema shall use
its reasonable best efforts to provide to KLRE, and shall cause the Company to
use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and the Companys representatives, including legal and
accounting representatives, to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested
by KLRE that is customary in connection with completing any financing
activities, or with obtaining such consents as are required to be obtained
under Temas revolving credit facility and any other Indebtedness of the
Company that would become due and payable at the Closing as a result of
the consummation of the Transactions, or obtaining new replacement debt
financing to replace such Indebtedness (such consent or new replacement debt
financing, the " _Debt Financing_ "), which reasonable efforts shall include,
among other things, (a) furnishing KLRE, reasonably promptly following KLREs
request, with information regarding the Company (including information to be
used in the preparation of one or more information packages regarding the
business, operations, financial projections and prospects of the Company)
customary for such financing activities, to the extent reasonably available to
the Company, (b) causing the management and other representatives with
appropriate seniority and expertise of Tema and the Company to participate in
a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with
the parties acting as lead arrangers, bookrunners or agents for, and
prospective

 



90  lenders of, such financing), presentations, due diligence sessions, drafting
sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with such financing
activities, (c) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, bank information memoranda, and similar documents required in
connection any such financing activities, (d) using reasonable efforts to
obtain legal opinions reasonably requested by KLRE in order to consummate
such financing activities, (e) taking all corporate actions, subject to the
occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by KLRE or any financing
sources of KLRE or the Company to permit the consummation of such financing
activities and (f) cooperating with requests for due diligence to the extent
customary and reasonable.

5.11 _Nasdaq Listing_. From the date of this Agreement through the Closing,
KLRE shall take all reasonable efforts which are necessary or reasonably
desirable for (a) KLRE to remain listed as a public company on, and for shares
of KLRE Common Stock to be tradable over, the Nasdaq Capital Market (the "
_Nasdaq_ ") and (b) the shares of KLRE Common Stock to be issued pursuant to
the AandR LLC Agreement to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq.

 

5.12 _Transaction Litigation_. Each Party shall give the other Party the
opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any
proceeding commenced following the date hereof related to this Agreement or
the Transactions at such Partys sole cost and expense. Prior to the Closing
Date, no Party shall compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or
agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any such
litigation or consent to the same unless the other Party shall have consented
in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

5.13 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. Any transfer, documentary, sales, use, real property
transfer or gain, gross receipts, goods and services, purchase, excise,
stamp, registration, retailer occupation or other similar Taxes (" _Transfer
Taxes_ ") payable by reason of the consummation of the Transactions shall be
paid fifty percent (50%) by KLRE and fifty percent (50%) by Tema when due,
whether levied on KLRE, any Subsidiary thereof, Tema or the Company, and the
Company shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to any such Transfer Taxes. The Parties will cooperate in good faith
to minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, the amount of
any such Transfer Taxes.

(b) _Proration of Straddle Period Taxes_. In the case of Taxes that are
payable with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes
that is attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and
including the day before the Effective Date shall be:

 

(i) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
assets or capital (such as Property Taxes), deemed to be the amount of such
Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined
on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding
period), _multiplied by_ a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the portion of the period ending on and including the day
before the Effective Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire period; and

 

(ii) in the case of Production Taxes and sales and use Taxes, deemed equal to
the amount that would be payable if the Straddle Period ended on and included
the day before the Effective Date.

 



91 (c) _Cooperation on Tax Returns and Tax Proceedings_. Tema and its Affiliates
and KLRE shall, and shall cause the Company to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate fully, and to the extent reasonably requested by the
other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding (each a " _Tax Proceeding_ "), with respect to
Taxes imposed on or with respect to the assets, operations or activities of
the Company or the Contributed Assets. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax
Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Notwithstanding the above, the control and conduct of any Tax
Proceeding that is an Asserted Liability shall be governed by _Section_ __ _
7.5_.

 

5.14 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) KLRE or one of its post-Closing Affiliates shall make an offer of
employment to each Business Employee which shall be on substantially the same
base salary or regular hourly rate of pay, as applicable, and bonus
opportunities as currently provided to each Business Employee prior to the
Closing, as reflected on _Schedule 3.1(l)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, other than with respect to defined benefit pension, retiree
medical, incentive and equity plans or arrangements. Such offers shall be for
employment as of the Closing Date or, if later, such date on which the
applicable Business Employee returns from a leave of absence (so long as such
return occurs within ninety (90) days after the Closing or such later time as
may be required by applicable Law). Such offers of employment shall be on
terms and conditions determined by KLRE or its applicable Affiliate in its
discretion. Tema and its Affiliates shall not interfere with any such
employment offer or negotiations by KLRE or its Affiliates to employ any
Business Employee or discourage any Business Employee from accepting
employment with KLRE or its Affiliate. The date on or following the Closing
Date on which a Business Employee commences active employment with KLRE or its
Affiliate is referred to herein as his or her " _Hire Date_."

 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Transferred Employee_ " is a Business
Employee who accepts an offer of employment made pursuant to _Section
5.14(a)_ and becomes employed by KLRE or one of its Affiliates. With respect
to each Transferred Employee and effective as of the time immediately prior to
such Transferred Employees Hire Date, Tema or its Affiliate shall (i)
terminate the employment of such Transferred Employee and (ii) waive and
release any confidentiality, non-competition, non-disclosure or other
agreements between Tema or any of its Affiliates and such Transferred Employee
that would restrict or encumber such Transferred Employees ability to perform
any of his or her duties as an employee of KLRE or its Affiliate.

 



92 (c) On or before the Hire Date of each Transferred Employee, Tema or its
Affiliate shall take any necessary action to fully vest as of such date such
Transferred Employees account balances and other benefits under all Business
Employee Benefit Plans, if any, that (i) are employee pension benefit plans
(as such term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), (ii) provide nonqualified
deferred compensation benefits or (iii) provide equity-based awards.

(d) Tema shall provide COBRA continuation coverage (within the meaning of
Section 4980B of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder) to all
individuals who are M and A qualified beneficiaries (within the meaning assigned
to such term under QandA-4 of Treasury Regulation § 54.4980B-9) with respect to
the Transactions for the duration of the period to which such individuals are
entitled to such coverage. Tema shall take any and all necessary actions to
ensure that KLRE and its Affiliates are not required to provide such
continuation coverage to any such individual at any time.

 

The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ are solely for the benefit of the
Parties and nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.14_, express or implied, shall
confer upon any Business Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary
thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or
continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of
any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section_
__ _ 5.14_, express or implied, shall be (i) deemed an amendment of any
Business Employee Benefit Plan, or (ii) construed to prevent KLRE or its
Affiliates from terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any
employee benefit plan that KLRE or its Affiliates may establish or maintain.

 

5.15 _Non-Competition_.

 

(a) Tema acknowledges that KLRE is entering into this Agreement, in
contemplation of undertaking substantial further development of the Oil and
Gas Properties. As a material inducement to KLRE entering into this Agreement,
from and after Closing Tema shall not, and shall ensure and cause each
Affiliate of Tema not to, directly or indirectly, acquire in any capacity
during the period from and after the Execution Date and ending on the date
that is two (2) years after the Closing Date (the " _Non-Compete Period_"),
any interest in any Restricted Opportunity, whether alone or as a partner,
joint venturer or equity interest holder of any Person acquiring such
interest.

(b) As used herein " _Restricted Opportunity_ " means any opportunity for,
including an opportunity to finance, the leasing, acquisition, farm-in,
exploration, development, production, gathering or marketing or any
combination of the foregoing, of oil, gas or other Hydrocarbons leases,
Hydrocarbon interests, royalty interests, overriding royalty interests,
Hydrocarbon interests payable out of production, production payments or any
other rights to acquire any of the foregoing interests in or attributable to
any lands covering or burdening any lands burdened by the Leases or lands
located within the counties set forth on _Schedule 5.15(b)_ ; _provided_ that
"Restricted Opportunity" shall not include any transaction where the assets
involved that are located in the area described above include less than ten
percent (10%) of the assets involved (either as to the number of acres or
wells subject thereto or the value of such assets) in the transaction, and
any assets in the area described above that are acquired as

 



93  described in this provision shall be exempted from the restrictions in this
_Section 5.15(b)_ ; _provided_ further that, if Tema or any of its Affiliates
acquires any assets in the area described above, Tema or any of its
Affiliates shall not subsequently acquire any additional oil and gas leases or
mineral interests in production of Hydrocarbons in such area during the Non-
Compete Period, except as permitted pursuant to this _Section 5.15(b)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not be Restricted
Opportunities: (i) the operation of and the exercise of any rights or the
participation (whether as a non-operator or operator) and exploration,
development, production, gathering or marketing in any Hydrocarbon interests
included in any assets owned by Tema or its Affiliates that are not
Contributed Assets and were owned prior to the Execution Date (including the
Excluded Assets) (and, upon request by KLRE, Tema shall provide reasonable
evidence indicating that such assets were owned by Tema or its Affiliates
prior to the Execution Date) and (ii) the operation of Gateway Gathering and
Marketing Company.

(c) The Parties agree that the limitations contained in this  _Section_ __ _
5.15_ with respect to time, geographical area and scope of activity are
reasonable in all respects and necessary to preserve the value of the goodwill
of the Company and the Contributed Assets. However, if any court shall
determine that the time, geographical area or scope of activity of any
restriction contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_ is unenforceable, it is
the intention of the Parties that such restrictive covenant set forth
herein shall not thereby be terminated but shall be deemed amended to the
extent required to render it valid and enforceable.

(d) The Parties recognize that, because of the nature and subject matter of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_, it would be impractical and extremely difficult to
determine KLREs and the Companys actual damages in the event of a breach of
its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_. Without prejudice to the
rights and remedies otherwise available to KLRE and the Company hereunder,
Tema agree that money damages would not be an adequate remedy for breach of
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.15_ by Tema or any of its respective Affiliates and
that if any Tema or its Affiliate commits a breach, or threatens to commit a
breach, of this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_, KLRE and the Company shall each have
the right to have the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_ specifically
enforced by any court having jurisdiction, without any requirement for the
posting of a bond or any other terms or conditions, it being acknowledged and
agreed by Tema that any such breach or threatened breach will cause
irreparable injury to KLRE and the Company and that an injunction may be
issued against Tema and any Affiliate of any Tema, as applicable, to stop or
prevent any such breach or threatened breach. The remedies set forth in the
preceding sentence shall be in addition to all other remedies available to
each of KLRE and the Company at law or in equity arising in connection with
the matters contemplated in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.15_. In the event that an
action shall be instituted to specifically enforce any obligations of Tema or
any Affiliate of any Tema under this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_, Tema agrees to
waive, and shall cause its Affiliates to waive, the defense that KLRE or the
Company has an adequate remedy at law. Provided that the Closing occurs, from
and after Closing until the date that is three (3) years after the Closing
Date, Tema shall enforce, and cause any of Temas existing or future
Affiliates to enforce, the terms of agreements with their respective
employees, independent contractors, consultants, representatives and agents to
the extent such terms restrict or prohibit the direct or indirect acquisition
of any Restricted Opportunity by any such Person.

 



94 5.16 _Certain Indebtedness_. From and after the Execution Date, Tema shall
negotiate and obtain (a) releases of all Encumbrances securing any
Indebtedness of Tema, the Company or its Affiliates that are burdening the
Company Units or the Contributed Assets, (b) authorizations to file UCC-3
termination statements releases in all applicable jurisdictions to evidence
the release of all such Encumbrances on the Company Units or the Contributed
Assets securing any Indebtedness of Tema, the Company or its Affiliates, and
(c) all instruments and agreements reasonably requested by, and in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to, KLRE to effect and file of record the
release of all Encumbrances securing any Indebtedness of Tema, the Company or
its Affiliates that are burdening the Company Units or the Contributed Assets.
Tema and the Company shall deliver all notices and take all other actions
necessary to obtain execution, delivery and filing of all release of all of
the foregoing-described Encumbrances, charges, mortgages, charges and other
encumbrances in connection therewith on the Closing Date.

5.17  _Notice of Inaccuracy of Breach; Supplement to Disclosure Schedules._

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, each Party (in such
capacity, the " _Reporting Party_ ") shall give prompt notice to the other
Party (in such capacity, the " _Receiving Party_ ") upon acquiring Knowledge
of (i) any false or inaccurate statement in any representation or warranty or
in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the KLRE Disclosure Schedule made or
provided herein or pursuant hereto by such Party or (ii) any material breach
of any covenant or agreement made herein by such Party.

(b) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the Reporting Party
may deliver to the Receiving Party one or more supplements or amendments to
the Company Disclosure Schedule (where Tema is the Reporting Party) or the
KLRE Disclosure Schedule (where KLRE is the Reporting Party) (collectively,
the " _Disclosure Schedules_ " and singly, a " _Disclosure Schedule_ ") with
respect to any matter of which such Reporting Party becomes aware, and could
only reasonably have become aware, after the date of this Agreement or which
arises after the date of this Agreement (each such supplement or amendment, a
" _Disclosure Schedule Supplement_ ") that is required to be set forth or
described in the applicable Disclosure Schedule delivered on the date of this
Agreement in order to make the representations and warranties made by such
Reporting Party true and correct as of the Closing such that the conditions
set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ (where Tema is the Reporting Party) or _Section
6.3(a)_ (where KLRE is the Reporting Party) would be satisfied. Each delivery
of a Disclosure Schedule Supplement shall be accompanied by a certificate
signed by an authorized officer of the Reporting Party setting forth such
Reporting Partys good faith determination as to whether the matters
disclosed in such Disclosure Schedule Supplement (when added to matters
disclosed in any Disclosure Schedule Supplements previously provided by such
Reporting Party) have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a KLRE
Material Adverse Effect (where KLRE is the Reporting Party) or a Tema
Material Adverse Effect (where Tema is the Reporting Party) (in which case,
such Disclosure Schedule Supplement, together with any matters disclosed in
any Disclosure Schedule Supplements previously provided by such Reporting
Party which, based on the certificate and additional information provided by
the Reporting Party, formed a part of the determination as to whether the
matters disclosed amounted to a KLRE Material Adverse Effect or the Tema
Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, shall be deemed a " _Material
Disclosure_

 



95   _Schedule Supplement_ ") or have not had and are not reasonably likely to
have (when added to matters disclosed in any Disclosure Schedule Supplement
previously provided by such Reporting Party) a KLRE Material Adverse Effect
(where KLRE is the Reporting Party) or a Tema Material Adverse Effect (where
Tema is the Reporting Party) (in which case, such Disclosure Schedule
Supplement shall be deemed a " _Non-Material Disclosure Schedule
Supplement_"). The Reporting Party shall deliver to the Receiving Party
reasonable documentation or information relating to each Disclosure Schedule
Supplement delivered by such Reporting Party and shall promptly provide any
additional information reasonably requested by the Receiving Party.

(c) Each Non-Material Disclosure Schedule Supplement delivered prior to
Closing shall (i) amend and supplement the Disclosure Schedule(s) to which
such Non-Material Disclosure Schedule Supplement relates and (ii) be deemed
to cure any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the Reporting
Party as a result of the matter disclosed on the applicable Non-
Material Disclosure Schedule Supplement, in each case solely for purposes of
_Section 6.2(a)_ where Tema is the Reporting Party and of _Section 6.3(a)_
where KLRE is the Reporting Party. For the avoidance of doubt, Non-Material
Disclosure Schedule Supplements shall not limit or otherwise affect either
Partys ability to seek indemnification from the other Party for breach of
representations or warranties pursuant to  _Article VII_.

(d) At any time within fifteen (15) days after delivery of a Material
Disclosure Schedule Supplement and supporting documentation by a Reporting
Party to a Receiving Party, the Receiving Party may elect to terminate this
Agreement by delivering a written termination notice to the Reporting Party.
If the Receiving Party does not so elect to terminate this Agreement by the
end of such fifteen (15) day Period, then such Material Disclosure Schedule
Supplement shall (i) amend and supplement the Disclosure Schedule(s) to which
such Material Disclosure Schedule Supplement relates and (ii) be deemed to
cure any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the Reporting
Party as a result of the matter disclosed on the applicable Material
Disclosure Schedule Supplement, in each case for purposes of (x)
_Section 6.2(a)_ where Tema is the Reporting Party and of _Section 6.3(a)_
where KLRE is the Reporting Party and (y) determining the Reporting Partys
indemnification obligations under _Article VII_.

 

5.18 _Post-Closing Information_. From and after the Closing, KLRE shall cause
the Company to (a) retain all books and records relating to the Company and
its business, in each case, with respect to the period before the Closing, for
a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date (or such longer period as may
be required under applicable Law) and (b) afford to Tema and its
Representatives (i) reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable prior notice, to the personnel and the books, records and other
data relating to the Contributed Assets and the Company with respect to
the period before the Closing and in the Companys possession, and (ii) the
right to make copies and extracts therefrom, in the case of clause (a) and (b)
to the extent such access may be reasonably required by Tema in connection
with litigation related to the Retained Liabilities.

 



96 5.19 _Further Assurances; Consents_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at any time or from
time to time after the Closing, at either Partys request and without further
consideration, the other Party shall execute and deliver to the requesting
Party such other instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment and
confirmation, provide such materials and information and take such
other actions as such Party may reasonably request in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, no such
instruments, materials, information or actions shall increase either Partys
liability, or decrease its rights, under this Agreement.

(b) No later than ten days after the Execution Date, Tema shall send to each
holder of any right to consent to assignment or consent to a change of
control pertaining to any Oil and Gas Property that is applicable to the
Transactions, including those set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 3.1(d)(i)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, a request, in material compliance with the
contractual provisions applicable to such right, seeking such holders consent
to the Transactions (or the portion of the Transactions to which such right
applies). Between the date hereof and the Closing, Tema shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable to obtain or
cause to be obtained all consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
registrations, filing or permits referred to on _Schedule_ __ _ 3.1(d)(i)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule and upon receipt of any of the foregoing,
shall deliver copies or other evidence of the receipt of such consents to
KLRE. Following the Closing, Tema and KLRE shall jointly take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or
desirable to obtain or cause to be obtained all Customary Post-Closing
Consents and upon Temas receipt of any Customary Post-Closing Consent, Tema
shall deliver copies or other evidence of such consents to KLRE. For purposes
of this _Section 5.19(b)_ , Tema shall not be required to, and "commercially
reasonable efforts" shall not include, the payment of any material amount by
Tema or the Company, provided, however, that, if any material payment or fee
is requested or required by a Third Party or Governmental Entity in connection
with receipt of a Customary Post-Closing Consent or a consent, approval,
order, authorization, registration, filing or permit referred to on _Schedule_
__ _ 3.1(d)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, Tema shall provide
written notice of such request or requirement to KLRE and KLRE may, at its
discretion, pay such amount for receipt thereof.

(c) If Tema fails to obtain any Required Consent before the Contribution
occurs and KLRE has waived in writing the condition under _Section 6.2(g)_
with respect to such Required Consent (if applicable), then the Oil and Gas
Property or Oil and Gas Properties (or portion thereof) that are subject to
such Required Consent shall be excluded from the Contributed Assets to be
conveyed by Tema to the Company under the Contribution Agreement, such Oil and
Gas Properties (or portion thereof) shall be deemed Excluded Assets for all
purposes under the Contribution Agreement and this Agreement, and the
Unadjusted Consideration shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of each such
Oil and Gas Property (or portion thereof). If any such Required Consent that
was not obtained before the Contribution is obtained within 120 days after
the Closing, then, within 15 Business Days after such Required Consent is
obtained, Tema and KLRE shall cause the Company to purchase from Tema (on the
terms and conditions of this Agreement) the Oil and Gas Property (or portion
thereof) that is subject to such Required Consent and to pay to Tema an amount
equal to the Allocated Value of

 



97  such Oil and Gas Property (or portion thereof), and such Oil and Gas
Property (or portion thereof) shall no longer be an Excluded Asset for
purposes of this Agreement. If Tema fails to obtain any consent under a Lease
that is not a Required Consent before the Contribution, then such Lease shall
be conveyed to the Company under the Contribution Agreement and such Lease
shall be included in the Contributed Assets for purposes of this Agreement,
and Tema shall have no liability under this Agreement or the Contribution
Agreement for the failure to obtain such consent.

 

(d) If any consent or approval referred to on _Schedule_ __ _ 3.1(d)(i)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule (other than a consent or approval required
under a Lease or other agreement or instrument governing the development,
exploration, or operation of the Oil and Gas Properties which shall be
addressed pursuant to the preceding clause (c)) is not received on or
prior to the Closing, (a) the Parties shall cooperate in good faith and use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent or approval as
promptly as practicable thereafter, and (b) with the intent to put KLRE and
the Company in substantially the same position as if the such consent or
approval had been obtained at or prior to Closing, Tema shall (i) continue to
be bound by, and operate in the ordinary course with respect to, any
applicable contract requiring such consent or approval pursuant to, and in
accordance with, its terms pending receipt of such consent or approval, (ii)
at the direction and expense of KLRE or the Company, pay, perform and
discharge fully all of its obligations in respect of the applicable contract
requiring such consent or approval after the Closing and prior to receipt of
the consent or approval, (iii) without further consideration therefor, pay,
assign and remit to the Company promptly all monies, rights and
other consideration received in respect of the applicable contract requiring
such consent or approval and (iv) exercise or exploit its rights and options
in respect of the applicable contract requiring such consent or approval, when
and as directed by KLRE or the Company.

5.20 _Retention of Assets_. Following the Closing and until the date that is
fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date, Tema shall not (a) sell, transfer
or otherwise dispose of any Excluded Assets to any of its Affiliates or (b)
declare, set aside or pay any dividends on, or make any other distribution in
respect of its outstanding capital stock or other equity interests out of
funds obtained from the sale, transfer or other disposition of any Excluded
Assets. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing sentence shall not prevent
Tema from selling, transferring or otherwise disposing of Excluded Assets to
Third Parties.

5.21 _Transfer of Cash_. No later than immediately prior to Closing,
Tema shall transfer to the Company the cash resulting from the operations of
the Contributed Assets attributable to the period beginning on January 1, 2017
and ending on the Closing Date.

this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the
Closing Date (except that, in each case, representations and warranties that
speak as of a specified date shall have been true and correct only on such
date) except for failures that would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a KLRE Material Adverse Effect.

complied with in all material respects all obligations required to be

7.1  _Survival_.

(a) The representations and warranties of the Parties set forth in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and terminate and expire on the date that
is fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date, except that (i) the
representations and warranties in _Section 3.1(k)_ (Taxes) shall survive
Closing and terminate and expire on the date that thirty (30) days after
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and (ii) the Fundamental
Representations shall survive the Closing and terminate and expire on the date
that is five (5) years after the Closing. All covenants and agreements that
by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the
Closing will survive for the period provided in such covenants and agreements,
if any, or until fully performed. Representations, warranties and
covenants shall be of no further force and effect after the date of their
expiration (if any), after which time no claim may be made thereunder,
_provided_ , that there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim
asserted in writing pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement prior to its expiration
date.

(b) Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_, the indemnities in _Section_ __ _
7.2(a)(ii_) and _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)(ii_) shall terminate as of the
termination date of each respective representation or warranty that is
subject to indemnification thereunder, except in each case as to matters for
which a specific written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Person
or Persons having an obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with
respect to Losses pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ VII_. The indemnities in
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)(i)_, _7.2(a)(iii)_ , _7.2(b)(i)_ and _7.2(b)(iii)_
shall continue without time limit.

 

7.2 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Subject to the limitations on recourse and recovery set forth in this _
Article_ __ _ VII_, from and after Closing, Tema shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless KLRE, KLRE Sponsor and their respective employees, directors and
officers (in each case, solely in their capacity as such) (each such Person, a
" _KLRE Indemnified Party_ "), from and against, any and all Losses of any
KLRE Indemnified Party after the Closing, arising out of or relating to (i)
Temas breach of any of Temas covenants or agreements under this Agreement,
(ii) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Tema contained
herein or (iii) the Retained Liabilities (any of such Losses, a " _KLRE
Indemnification Claim_ "); _provided_ that Materiality Qualifiers in any such
representation or warranty shall be disregarded for purposes of determining
whether any such breach or inaccuracy thereof has occurred and the ultimate
amount of any Losses subject to indemnification hereunder. To the extent it is
finally determined that any Losses are subject to indemnification hereunder,
such Losses shall be payable within five (5) Business Days of such final
determination by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
or accounts designated by the KLRE Indemnified Party.

 



101 (b) Subject to the limitations on recourse and recovery set forth in this
_Article VII_ , from and after Closing, KLRE shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Tema, Rosemore and their respective employees, directors and officers
(in each case, solely in their capacity as such) (each such Person, a " _Tema
Indemnified Party_ " and, together with the KLRE Indemnified Parties, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against any and all Losses of any Tema
Indemnified Party after the Closing, arising out of or relating to (i) KLREs
breach of any of KLREs covenants or agreements under this Agreement, (ii) any
breach of any representation or warranty made by KLRE contained herein, or
(iii) the ownership, use, maintenance or operation of the Contributed Assets,
whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time, except for KLRE
Indemnification Claims and any Losses incurred by Tema that are shared by Tema
as a result of Temas equity ownership of the Company, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
SUCH LOSSES MAY BE ATTRIBUTABLE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO THE STRICT LIABILITY
OR NEGLIGENCE OF TEMA, ITS AFFILIATES OR ANY THIRD PARTIES AND WHETHER SUCH
NEGLIGENCE IS ACTIVE OR PASSIVE (BUT NOT GROSS), JOINT, CONCURRENT OR SOLE
(collectively, the " _Assumed Liabilities_ "); _provided_ , that with respect
to any claim for indemnification brought in connection with an Assumed
Liability brought by a Tema Indemnified Party, such Tema Indemnified Party
shall only be indemnified for a percentage of such claim equal to the KLRE
Interest Percentage at the time such claim is brought (any of such Losses, a "
_Tema Indemnification Claim_ " and, together with the KLRE Indemnified Claims,
the " _Indemnified Claims_ "); _provided_ , _further_ that Materiality
Qualifiers in any such representation or warranty shall be disregarded for
purposes of determining whether any such breach or inaccuracy thereof
has occurred and the ultimate amount of any Losses subject to indemnification
hereunder. To the extent it is finally determined that any Losses are subject
to indemnification hereunder, such Losses shall be payable within five (5)
Business Days of such final determination by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts designated by the Tema Indemnified
Party.

 

7.3 _Limitations_.

 

(a) _De Minimis; Threshold_. Except in the case of fraudulent breaches of this
Agreement and breaches of Fundamental Representations and the representations
and warranties in _Section 3.1(k)_ (Taxes), neither Party shall be entitled
to be indemnified for claims brought pursuant to this _Article VII_ for
breaches of representations and warranties under this Agreement or any
Transaction Document (i) for any individual item where the Loss relating
thereto is less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) and (ii) unless
the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds a cumulative aggregate of
Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000), at which time the applicable Party
shall be entitled to recover the entire amount of such Losses subject to
indemnification hereunder.

 

(b) _Maximum Liability_. Except in the case of fraudulent breaches of this
Agreement and breaches of Fundamental Representations and the representations
and warranties set forth in _Section 3.1(k)_ (Taxes), the maximum liability
of each of Tema and KLRE for claims of any breaches of representations or
warranties brought against such Party pursuant to 

 



102   _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)(ii)_ and _Section 7.2(b)(ii)_ , respectively, shall
not exceed an amount equal to Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000) in the
aggregate. In no event shall the maximum liability of Tema for any claims
brought under this Agreement exceed the Consideration actually distributed by
the Company to Tema in accordance with this Agreement; _provided_ , that
claims brought in connection with Retained Liabilities shall not be included
in calculating Temas aggregate liability under this _Section 7.3(b)_ , and
that claims brought in connection with Retained Liabilities shall not be
subject to any maximum liability. In no event shall the maximum liability of
KLRE for any claims brought under this Agreement exceed an amount equal to the
Consideration; _provided_ , that claims brought in connection with Assumed
Liabilities arising from the ownership, use, maintenance or operation of the
Contributed Assets after the Effective Time shall not be included in
calculating KLREs aggregate liability under this _Section 7.3(b)_, and that
claims brought in connection with Assumed Liabilities shall not be subject to
any maximum liability.

(c) _Exclusive Remedy_. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that from
and after the Closing, the indemnification provisions in this _Article_ __ _
VII_ will be the sole and exclusive remedy and recourse for any breach of this
Agreement by Tema or KLRE, except with respect to claims based upon Fraud or
criminal conduct, claims seeking injunctive relief or specific performance
(including pursuant to _Sections_ __ _ 9.6_, and _9.10_ ), and the rights and
remedies contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 5.15_.

 

(d) _Losses Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other Third Party Recoveries_. All
Losses for which any Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification under this _Article_ __ _ VII_ shall be reduced by the net
amount of insurance proceeds, indemnification payments and other Third Party
recoveries actually received by any Indemnified Party in respect of any
Losses incurred by such Indemnified Party. In the event any Indemnified Party
or any of its Affiliates is entitled to any insurance proceeds, indemnity
payments or any Third Party recoveries in respect of any Losses (or any of the
circumstances giving rise thereto) for which such Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)_, such
Indemnified Party shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain, receive or
realize such proceeds, benefits, payments or recoveries. In the event that
any such insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or other Third Party
recoveries not previously taken into account are obtained by a Indemnified
Party subsequent to receipt by such Indemnified Party of any indemnification
payment hereunder in respect of the claims to which such insurance proceeds,
indemnity payments or other Third Party recoveries relate, appropriate refunds
shall be made promptly by the relevant Indemnified Parties of all or the
relevant portion of such recovery, and appropriate payments shall be made
promptly by the relevant Indemnified Parties. To the extent of the
indemnification obligations in this Agreement, each Party waives for
themselves and their respective successors and assigns, including any
insurers, any rights to subrogation for Losses for which such Party is liable
or against which such Party indemnifies any other Person under this Agreement.
If required by applicable insurance policies, each Party shall obtain a
written waiver of such subrogation from its insurers.

(e) _Losses Included in Final Cash Consideration_. No KLRE Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses in respect of any
liability included as an adjustment to the Unadjusted Consideration pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ and then only to the extent of the amount so deducted
or increased.

 



103 (f) _No Duplicate Claims_. In the event an Indemnified Party recovers Losses
in respect of an Indemnification Claim, no other Indemnified Party may
recover the same Losses in respect of a claim for indemnification under this
Agreement.

 

(g) _Proper Parties for Indemnity Claims_. Any claim for indemnity under this
_Article VII_ by any current or former Affiliate, stockholder, member,
officer, director, employee, agent, lender, advisor, representative,
accountant, attorney and consultant of any Party must be brought and
administered by the applicable Party to this Agreement. No Indemnified Party
other than Tema and KLRE shall have any rights against either Tema or KLRE
under the terms of this _Article VII_ except as may be exercised on its behalf
by Tema or KLRE, as applicable, pursuant to this _Article VII_. Tema and KLRE
may elect to exercise or not exercise indemnification rights hereunder on
behalf of the other Indemnified Parties affiliated with them in their sole
discretion and shall have no liability to any such other Indemnified Parties
for any action or inaction hereunder.

(h) _Investigations and Audits_. The representations, warranties and covenants
of each of the Parties set forth in this Agreement, subject to the express
exceptions thereto, shall not be affected by any information furnished to, or
any investigation or audit conducted before or after the Closing Date by, any
Person in connection with the Transactions. In order to preserve the benefit
of the bargain otherwise represented by this Agreement, each Party shall be
entitled to rely upon the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the other Party set forth herein notwithstanding any
investigation or audit conducted or any knowledge acquired (or capable of
being acquired) before or after the Closing Date or the decision of any Party
to complete the Closing. The right to indemnification or other remedy based on
any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this
Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation or audit conducted with
respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any
time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance
with, any such representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement.

 

(i) _No Waiver_. Except to the extent of claims and rights expressly included
as part of the Contributed Assets, nothing in this Agreement is intended to
limit or otherwise waive any recourse, rights, defenses or causes of action
that any Party may have against any Third Party for any Losses, obligations or
liabilities that may be incurred with respect to the Retained Liabilities or
the ownership or operation of the Contributed Assets.

7.4 _Characterization of Payments_. For Tax purposes, the Parties agree to
treat (and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to treat) any
indemnity payment under this _Article VII_ as an adjustment to the Final Cash
Consideration payable pursuant to  _Article_ __ _ II_.

 



104 7.5 _Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) Promptly after receipt by any Indemnified Party of notice of the
commencement or assertion of any action, proceeding, demand, claim
or investigation by a third party (an " _Asserted Liability_ ") that may
result in a Loss which is indemnifiable under this _Article_ __ _ VII_, such
Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice with respect thereto to the
indemnifying party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "); _provided_ that a failure
to provide such Claim Notice promptly shall not amount to a waiver of such
claim unless and only to the extent that the resulting delay materially
prejudices the position of the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of the
Claim Notice (or less if the nature of the claim requires and such necessary
shortened deadline is specified in the Claim Notice) (the " _Claim_ ___Notice
Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Party in writing (i) whether or not the
Indemnifying Party disputes the liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder
with respect to the Loss, and (ii) whether or not the Indemnifying Party
desires at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party to defend the
Indemnified Party against such Asserted Liability (regardless of whether or
not it disputes the liability with respect to such Asserted Liability).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled
to assume control of the defense of an Asserted Liability without the
Indemnified Partys written consent (in its sole discretion) if (A) such
Asserted Liability relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, indictment, allegation or investigation of the Indemnified Party
or any of its Subsidiaries by a Governmental Entity, (B) the Asserted
Liability seeks to impose any material liability, obligation or restriction
upon the Indemnified Party or any of its Subsidiaries, other than for money
damages, or (C) counsel to the Indemnified Party has advised the Indemnified
Party in writing that there are one or more defenses available to the
Indemnified Party that are not available to the Indemnifying Party or a
conflict of interest exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party, in the opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, in respect of such
Asserted Liability.

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice
Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against an Asserted
Liability, subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.5(b)_ (such notice, a " _Defense
Assumption Notice_ "), the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend
all appropriate proceedings with counsel of its own choosing (but reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) and such proceedings shall be
diligently prosecuted by it. If the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to
undertake any such defense against any Asserted Liability, (i)
the Indemnified Party shall provide reasonable cooperation to the
Indemnifying Party in such defense, at the Indemnifying Partys cost and
expense, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party
appraised of material developments regarding such Asserted Liability and
(iii) the Indemnified Party may elect, at such Indemnified Partys sole cost
and expense, to participate in such defense with separate counsel of its
choice. If at any time during the defense against an Asserted Liability, the
Indemnifying Party discovers or identifies new facts or circumstances that
lead the Indemnifying Party to reasonably determine that such Asserted
Liability is not an indemnifiable claim entitling the Indemnified Party
to recovery pursuant to this _Article VII_ , the Indemnifying Party may
notify the Indemnified Party in writing of such facts or circumstances,
indicating that the Indemnifying Party no longer wishes to defend 

 



105  such third party claim and thereby rescind the Defense Assumption Notice
with sufficient advance notice to prevent the Indemnified Party from being
prejudiced by such rescission (and in any event, not less than 30 days
advance notice). If the Indemnifying Party rescinds a Defense Assumption
Notice in accordance with the preceding and to the extent that either the
Indemnified Party agrees that the Indemnifying Party is not liable for such
third party claim or it is judicially determined that the Indemnifying Party
is not liable for such third party claim, then the formerly Indemnified Party
shall promptly pay and reimburse the formerly Indemnifying Party for all
reasonable costs and expenses (including legal fees) that it paid or incurred
in the defense of the Indemnified Party with respect to the third party claim
that is the subject of the rescinded Defense Assumption Notice. The
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will cooperate to transition the
defense of such matter.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend the Indemnified
Party against an Asserted Liability or does not provide an answer within the
Notice Period or the Indemnified Party does not consent to the Indemnifying
Party assuming control of the defense under _Section_ __ _ 7.5(b)_, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume control of and appoint lead
counsel for defense of such Asserted Liability and all reasonable fees and
expenses of one firm of attorneys (in addition to local counsel to the extent
reasonably necessary) in connection thereof shall be considered Losses for
purposes of this _Article VII_ and shall be subject to indemnification
hereunder, subject to the limitations set forth herein. If the Indemnified
Party undertakes the defense of any Asserted Liability in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 7.5(d)_, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall provide
reasonable cooperation to the Indemnified Party in such defense, (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party appraised of material
developments regarding such Asserted Liability, and (iii) the Indemnifying
Party may elect, at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense, to
participate in such defense with separate counsel of its choice. 

7.6 _Direct Claims_. In any case in which an Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification hereunder which is not subject to  _Section_ __ _ 7.5_, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the Indemnifying Party a Claim
Notice. Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article VII_, the
failure of an Indemnified Party to provide prompt notice of such claim shall
not amount to a waiver of such claim unless and only to the extent that the
resulting delay materially prejudices the position of the Indemnifying Party
with respect to such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have the Claim
Notice Period to notify the Indemnified Party in writing whether or not the
Indemnifying Party disputes the liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder
with respect to the Loss. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to
the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will
use good faith efforts to resolve such dispute. If such dispute is not
resolved within sixty (60) days following the delivery of the Indemnifying
Party of its response, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
each have the right to submit such dispute to a court of competent
jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 9.7_.

 

7.7 _Attorneys_ __ _Fees_. Except as provided in _Sections 2.4(c)_ and
_2.5(g)(iv)_ , any Party who is the prevailing party in any legal,
arbitration or equitable proceeding against the other Party brought under this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements shall be entitled to recover out-of-
pocket court costs and reasonable attorneys fees from the non-prevailing
party. The

 



106  Indemnifying Party shall reimburse all such costs and expenses of the
Indemnified Party relating to the enforcement of the Indemnified Partys
rights under this _Article VII_ , such amounts to be payable as incurred by
the Indemnified Party upon request, to return such advance if the Indemnified
Party is ultimately determined to not be the prevailing party or entitled to
indemnification hereunder. For purposes of this Agreement, "prevailing party"
shall include, without limitation, a party obtaining substantially the relief
sought, whether by compromise, settlement, arbitration award or judgment.

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges that it has been represented by counsel
of its choice throughout all negotiations that have preceded the execution of
this Agreement and that it has executed the same with the advice of said
independent counsel. Each Party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and
preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any
and all drafts relating thereto exchanged between the Parties shall be deemed
the work product of the Parties and may not be construed against any Party by
reason of its preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision
that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement
against any Party that drafted it is of no application and is hereby expressly
waived.

 



110 (b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or
KLRE Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment,
in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in
the Company Disclosure Schedule or KLRE Disclosure Schedule, as applicable,
that such information is required to be listed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or KLRE Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, or that such items are
material to Tema, the Company or KLRE, as the case may be. The headings, if
any, of the individual sections of each of the KLRE Disclosure Schedule and
Company Disclosure Schedule are inserted for convenience only and shall not be
deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Company
Disclosure Schedule and KLRE Disclosure Schedule are arranged in sections
corresponding to those contained in this Agreement merely for convenience, and
the disclosure of an item in one section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or
KLRE Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a particular representation
or warranty shall not be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with
respect to any other representations or warranties unless the relevance of
such item to such representations or warranties is reasonably apparent,
including by inclusion of such item in the relevant corresponding section of
the Company Disclosure Schedule or KLRE Disclosure Schedule or including an
appropriate cross-reference to the relevant item.

 

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company
Disclosure Schedule or KLRE Disclosure Schedule is not intended and shall not
be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such
amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy
between the Parties to determine whether any obligation, item or matter
(whether or not described herein or included in any schedule) is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement.

 

(d) All references in this Agreement to Exhibits, Schedules, Articles,
Sections, subsections and other subdivisions refer to the
corresponding Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections and other
subdivisions of this Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise. Titles
appearing at the beginning of any Articles, Sections, subsections or other
subdivisions of this Agreement are for convenience only, do not constitute
any part of such Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions, and
shall be disregarded in construing the language contained therein. The words
"this Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof" and words of
similar import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
subdivision unless expressly so limited. The words "this Section,"
"this subsection" and words of similar import, refer only to the Sections or
subsections hereof in which such words occur. The word "including" (in its
various forms) means "including, without limitation." Pronouns in
masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall be construed to state and include
any other gender and words, terms and titles (including terms defined herein)
in the singular form shall be construed to include the plural and vice versa,
unless the context otherwise expressly requires. The word "or" is not
exclusive. Unless expressly stated herein to the contrary, reference to a
document means such document as amended or modified and as in effect from time
to time in accordance with the terms thereof. Unless the context otherwise
requires, all defined terms

 



111  contained herein shall include the singular and plural and the conjunctive
and disjunctive forms of such defined terms. Unless the context otherwise
requires, all references to a specific time shall refer to Houston, Texas
time.

9.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts
(including by electronic means), all of which shall be considered one and the
same agreement and shall become effective when two (2) or more counterparts
have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Party, it
being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart.

9.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement (together with the Ancillary Agreements, the Confidentiality
Agreement and any other documents and instruments referred to herein)
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. The provisions of (i) _Sections 5.5_ and _9.10_ and,
from and after the Closing, the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 9.13_, _Article_
__ _ I_ and  _Article VII_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable after the Closing by, the Persons referred to therein and their
respective heirs and representatives and (ii) _Article VII_ are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable after the Closing by, KLRE
Sponsor. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, this
Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties any
rights or remedies hereunder.

 

9.6 _Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy expressly conferred hereby, and the exercise
by a Party of any one such remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
such remedy.

 

(b) The Parties understand and agree that the covenants and undertakings on
each of their parts herein contained are uniquely related to the desire of
the Parties and their respective Affiliates to consummate the Transactions,
that the Transactions represent a unique business opportunity at a unique time
for each of the Parties and their respective Affiliates and further agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with its terms and further agree
that, although monetary damages may be available for the breach of such
covenants and undertakings, monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy
therefor. Accordingly, each Party agrees, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by Tema or
the Company, on the one hand, or KLRE, on the other hand, of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, Tema or the
Company, on the one hand, or KLRE, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the other under this Agreement. Any Party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or
to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not
be 

 



112  required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction. In the event that any litigation should be brought in
equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no Party shall allege,
and each Party waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

(c) To the extent any Party brings an action, suit or proceeding to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
(other than an action to enforce specifically any provision that expressly
survives termination of this Agreement) when expressly available to such
Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Termination Date shall
automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following
the resolution of such action, suit or proceeding or (ii) such other time
period established by the court presiding over such action, suit or
proceeding.

9.7 _Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of
conflicts of law thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , (a) in connection with the
determination of the existence of any Title Defect or Title Benefit or with
respect to conveyancing matters as to any Oil and Gas Property, the Laws of
the state where such Contributed Asset is located shall govern and control
such determination and (b) in connection with the determination of the
existence of any Environmental Defect, the federal Laws of the United States
and the Laws of the state or commonwealth where such Contributed Asset is
located shall govern and control such determination.

 

(b) EXCEPT AS TO ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, MATTERS, OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR
IN RELATION TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE CALCULATION OR DETERMINATION OF THE
FINAL CONSIDERATION PURSUANT TO _ARTICLE II_ (WHICH SHALL BE RESOLVED
EXCLUSIVELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH _SECTION_ __ _ 2.4_), OR THE SCOPE OF SECTION
2.5 OR THE EXISTENCE, CURE, OR AMOUNT OF ANY TITLE BENEFITS, BENEFIT AMOUNTS,
DEFECTS, OR DEFECT AMOUNTS (WHICH, IN EACH CASE, SHALL RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY IN
ACCORDANCE WITH _SECTION_ __ _ 2.5_), THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE
JURISDICTION OF THE COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND THE
FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA LOCATED IN THE STATE OF
DELAWARE SOLELY IN RESPECT OF THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE
PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO IN THIS AGREEMENT
AND IN RESPECT OF THE TRANSACTIONS, AND HEREBY WAIVE, AND AGREE NOT TO
ASSERT, AS A DEFENSE IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING FOR INTERPRETATION OR
ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR ANY SUCH DOCUMENT THAT IS NOT SUBJECT THERETO OR THAT
SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING MAY NOT BE BROUGHT OR IS NOT MAINTAINABLE IN
SAID COURTS OR THAT VENUE THEREOF MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE OR THAT THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY SUCH DOCUMENT MAY NOT BE ENFORCED IN OR BY SUCH COURTS, AND
THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ACTION,
SUIT OR PROCEEDING

 



113  SHALL BE HEARD AND DETERMINED BY SUCH A DELAWARE STATE OR FEDERAL COURT. THE
PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT TO AND GRANT ANY SUCH COURT JURISDICTION OVER THE
PERSON OF SUCH PARTIES AND OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER OF SUCH DISPUTE AND AGREE
THAT MAILING OF PROCESS OR OTHER PAPERS IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ACTION, SUIT
OR PROCEEDING IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN _SECTION_ __ _ 9.2_ OR IN SUCH OTHER
MANNER AS MAY BE PERMITTED BY LAW SHALL BE VALID AND SUFFICIENT SERVICE
THEREOF.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (ii) SUCH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (iii)
SUCH PARTY MAKES THE FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) SUCH PARTY HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.7_.

 

9.8 _No Remedy in Certain Circumstances_. Each Party agrees that, should any
court or other competent authority hold any provision of this Agreement or
part hereof to be null, void or unenforceable, or order any Party to take any
action inconsistent herewith or not to take an action consistent herewith or
required hereby, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions and obligations contained or set forth herein shall not in any way
be affected or impaired thereby, unless the foregoing inconsistent action or
the failure to take an action constitutes a material breach of this Agreement
or makes this Agreement impossible to perform, in which case this Agreement
shall terminate. Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, to the
extent that a Party took an action inconsistent herewith or failed to take
action consistent herewith or required hereby pursuant to an order or
judgment of a court or other competent authority, such Party shall not incur
any liability or obligation unless such Party breached its obligations under
the Confidentiality Agreement or did not in good faith seek to resist or
object to the imposition or entering of such order or judgment.

9.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
Party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns. Any purported assignment in violation of
this _Section_ __ _ 9.9_ shall be void. Unless expressly agreed to in
writing by the Parties, no permitted assignment of any Partys rights or
duties that is subject to the consent of the other Party shall relieve or
release

 



114  the assigning Party from the performance of such Partys rights or
obligations hereunder and such assigning Party shall be fully liable to the
other Party for the performance of all such rights and duties.

9.10 _Affiliate Liability; Release_. Except to the extent a named Party to
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree
that neither (a) any past, present or future member of the KLRE Group nor (b)
Rosemore or any of its Affiliates (each of the foregoing a " _Non-Recourse
Party_"), in such capacity, shall have any liability or obligation (in
contract, tort, or otherwise) to any Party of any nature whatsoever in
connection with or under this Agreement or the Transactions, and each of the
Parties (on behalf of itself, its Affiliates, and its equityholders, managers,
officers, directors, employees and agents) hereby waives and releases all
claims of any such liability and obligation. This Agreement may only be
enforced against, and any action based upon, arising out of, or related to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement, may only be brought against the entities that are expressly named
as Parties and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth
herein or therein with respect to such Party. Each Non-Recourse Party is
expressly intended as a third party beneficiary of this  _Section_ __ _
9.10_.

9.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties, at any time
before or after the receipt of the KLRE Stockholder Approval, but, after any
such adoption, no amendment shall be made which by Law would require the
further approval by such stockholders without first obtaining such further
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed (including by electronic means) on behalf of each of the
Parties.

9.12 _Trust Account Waiver_. Reference is made to the final prospectus of
KLRE, filed with the SEC (File No. 333-209041) (the " _Prospectus_ "), and
dated as of March 10, 2016. Tema warrants and represents, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, that it has read the Prospectus and understands that KLRE
has established the Trust Account containing the proceeds of its initial
public offering (the " _IPO_ ") and from certain private placements occurring
simultaneously with the IPO initially in an amount of approximately Eighty
Million Dollars ($80,000,000) for the benefit of KLREs public stockholders
and certain parties (including the underwriters of the IPO) and that KLRE may
disburse monies from the Trust Account only: (a) to KLREs public stockholders
in the event they elect to redeem the shares of common stock of KLRE in
connection with the consummation of KLREs Business Combination, (b) to
KLREs public stockholders if KLRE fails to consummate a Business Combination
within eighteen (18) months from the closing of the IPO, (c) any interest
earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account necessary to pay any income
taxes or (d) to KLRE after or concurrently with the consummation of a Business
Combination. For and in consideration of KLRE entering into this Agreement
with Tema regarding the Transactions, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,
Tema hereby agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that it does not now
and shall not at any time hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim
of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account or distributions
therefrom, or make any claim against, the Trust Account, regardless of whether
such claim arises as a result of, in connection with or relating in any way
to, any proposed or actual business relationship between KLRE and Tema, this
Agreement or any other matter, and regardless of whether such claim

 



115  arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal
liability. Tema hereby irrevocably waives any such claims it may have against
the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) now or in the
future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or
agreements with KLRE and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account
(including any distributions therefrom) for any reason whatsoever
(including, without limitation, for an alleged breach of this Agreement).
Tema agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this
Agreement and specifically relied upon by KLRE to induce it to enter in this
Agreement, and Tema further intends and understands such waiver to be valid,
binding and enforceable under applicable law. To the extent Tema commences any
action or proceeding based upon, in connection with, relating to or arising
out of any matter relating to KLRE, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in
part, monetary relief against KLRE, Tema hereby acknowledges and agrees its
sole remedy shall be against funds held outside of the Trust Account and that
such claim shall not permit Tema (or any party claiming on Temas behalf or
in lieu of Tema) to have any claim against the Trust Account (including any
distributions therefrom) or any amounts contained therein. In the event Tema
or any of its Affiliates commences any action or proceeding based upon,
in connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to
KLRE, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, relief against the Trust
Account (including any distributions therefrom) or KLREs public stockholders,
whether in the form of money damages or injunctive relief, KLRE shall be
entitled to recover from Tema the associated legal fees and costs in
connection with any such action, in the event KLRE prevails in such action or
proceeding.

 

9.13 _Role of Norton Rose Fulbright US LLP; Waiver of Conflicts and
Privilege_.

 

(a) KLRE waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause the Company to waive
and to not assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the
potential representation, after the Closing (the " _Post-Closing
Representation_ "), of Tema or any officer, employee, director or manager of
Tema (any such Person, a " _Designated Person_ ") in any matter involving
this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Transactions, by Norton Rose
Fulbright US LLP (" _Seller Counsel_ "), to the extent such conflict would
arise solely by virtue of Seller Counsels current representation of Tema and
the Company in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions (the "
_Current Representation_ ").

 

(b) The Parties agree that, following the Closing, with respect to any
communication between Seller Counsel, on the one hand, and any of Tema, the
Company, any Designated Person, or their respective Affiliates, on the other
hand, occurring during the Current Representation in connection with this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Transactions (collectively, the "
_Privileged Communications_ "), the attorney-client privilege and expectation
of client confidence shall, as between Tema, on the one hand, and KLRE and the
Company, on the other hand, be vested in and belong to, and may be controlled
by, Tema and shall not pass to or be claimed by KLRE or the Company.
Accordingly, following the Closing, (i) KLRE and the Company will not have
access to any such Privileged Communications or the files of Seller Counsel or
other advisor relating to the Current Representation to the extent such files
constitute property of the client during the Current Representation, without
the prior written consent of Tema, (ii) to the extent such files constitute
property of the client during the Current Representation, only Tema (and not
the Company) shall hold such property rights, (iii) Seller

 



116  Counsel and other advisors shall have no duty to reveal or disclose any such
Privileged Communications to KLRE or the Company by reason of any Post-Closing
Representation, (iv) Tema may use the Privileged Communications in any
dispute that relates in any way to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements,
or the Transactions (including in any claim for indemnification brought by
KLRE or its representatives) and (v) neither KLRE nor the Company may use or
rely on any of the Privileged Communications in any action against or
involving Tema.

(c) This  _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ is intended for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, Seller Counsel. This _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ shall be
irrevocable, and no term of this _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ may be amended,
waived, or modified, without the prior written consent of Seller Counsel.
