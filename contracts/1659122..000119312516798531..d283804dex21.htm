absolute value of the Estimated Adjustments up to a maximum adjustment under this clause (A)&nbsp;of Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000), (B) second, if the aggregate dollar amount of the Estimated Adjustments is greater than Twenty Million

foregoing clause (B), then the remainder of the Unadjusted Cash Consideration shall be reduced by the absolute value of any portion of the Estimated Adjustments not already accounted for pursuant to the foregoing clauses (A)&nbsp;and (B). If the
aggregate dollar amount of the Estimated Adjustments is positive, then the Unadjusted Cash Consideration shall be increased by such positive dollar amount up to Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) and then the Unadjusted Equity Consideration shall
be increased by a number of shares equal to the surplus <U>divided by</U> the Equity Consideration Share Value. Tema shall consider in good faith KLRE&#146;s comments to the Estimated Closing Statement, which comments KLRE shall deliver to Tema no
