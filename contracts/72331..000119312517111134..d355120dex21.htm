and "hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to any
particular section or provision of this Agreement;

 

(f) the word "including" and any variation thereof means "including without

Schedule shall be deemed to be responsive to and to qualify the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in the corresponding
sections in this Agreement and any other representations and warranties in
this Agreement so long as the relationship between the disclosure and the
other representations and warranties are reasonably apparent on the face of
the disclosure. The inclusion of information in the Disclosure Schedule shall
not be construed as or constitute an admission or agreement that a violation,
right of termination, default, liability or other obligation of any kind

immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Canceled Shares_
") shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no payment shall be made in
connection with the Merger with respect thereto.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares
of Company Stock (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a
Common Stockholder that has not voted such shares in favor of the Merger (or
executed a written consent approving the Merger) and who is entitled to
demand, and has properly demanded, appraisal rights in the manner provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ "), shall not be
converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive any Merger
Consideration, but instead such Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to
payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL), unless
and until such Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively waived, withdrawn or lost its rights to appraisal under the
DGCL (or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
Stockholder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL). If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively waived, withdrawn or lost such right (or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL), such holders shares of Company
Stock, as the case may be, shall thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such share, in accordance
with _Section 2.5(a)_ , without any interest thereon. The Company 

 



-26-  shall give the Purchaser prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Stock, as the case may be. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Purchaser
(not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands with respect
to any holder of Dissenting Shares before the Effective Time. Each Person
holding of record or beneficially owning Dissenting Shares that becomes
entitled under the DGCL to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
shall receive payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation.

 

(e) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, the Company and its board of directors shall take all
necessary actions to provide that (i) all unvested In The Money Options will
become fully vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time, (ii) all
outstanding Options (whether vested or unvested) that have not been exercised
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be exercisable,
shall cease to exist and shall automatically be terminated and retired without
any further action of the Company, the Purchaser, Merger Sub or Option
Holder, and each Option Holder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except as provided in _Section 2.5(a)(ix)_ above and (iii) all Stock
Units (whether vested or unvested) outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and converted into shares
of Series B-1 Preferred Stock pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)(x)_ without any
further action of the Company, the Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Stock Unit
Holder, and each Stock Unit Holder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, each holder of an Option that is not an
In The Money Option shall not be entitled to receive any payment with respect
to such Option and, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each such Option
shall be canceled and the holder thereof shall cease to have rights with
respect thereto.

 

Section 2.6 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) Prior to receiving any portion of the Merger Consideration, each holder
of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented issued and outstanding shares of Company Stock (the
" _Certificates_ ") shall have delivered to the Paying Agent (i) a properly
completed and duly executed letter of transmittal in a form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser and the Paying Agent (a " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") and (ii) the Certificates held of record by such holder. Such
Letter of Transmittal shall have been previously delivered by the Paying
Agent to such holder along with instructions thereto and a notice to the
effect that delivery of the Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the
Paying Agent, together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificate shall
have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_ , and the Certificate so
surrendered shall be canceled. If the portion of the Merger Consideration to
be paid with respect to such shares is to be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, it shall be
a condition of exchange that such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such

 



-27-  exchange shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
exchange to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 2.6_, each Certificate shall be deemed as of the Effective
Time of the Merger to represent only the right or the contingent right, as
applicable, to receive, upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
this _Section 2.6(a)_ , the portion of the Merger Consideration into which the
shares of Company Stock shall have been converted pursuant to  _Section
2.5(a)_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Paying Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance of any Merger Consideration in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 2.5(a)_ , require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit or indemnity agreement with
respect to such Certificate.

 

(b) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this _ARTICLE II_ shall be deemed to have been
exchanged and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
represented by such Certificates and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of the Company Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time of the Merger. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration as provided in this _ARTICLE II_.

 

(c) Subject to applicable Laws, at any time following the six (6) month
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying
Agent and which have not been disbursed to the Stockholders, and thereafter,
such Stockholders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration
that would otherwise be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by
such Stockholders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any
interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such Stockholders at such
time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Laws, the property of the Purchaser, free and clear of all claims or interests
of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of the Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable
to any former Stockholders for any portion of the Merger Consideration or
interest thereon properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law.

(d) The Paying Agent, the Purchaser, Merger Sub, or the Surviving
Corporation (as appropriate) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Stockholders
such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law; _provided_ , that the Paying Agent must be provided with
prior written notice of any such required withholding at

 



-28-  least five (5) days prior to the date of such payment. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, (i) such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Stockholders in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made and (ii) the Paying Agent,
the Purchaser, the Company or the Surviving Corporation (as appropriate) shall
provide such Stockholders written notice of the amounts so deducted or
withheld.

(e) The applicable Stockholder Loan Amount will be deducted from the
consideration paid pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_ to each Stockholder Loan
Party, as applicable.

are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to the Estimated Closing
Statement, such dispute shall not under any circumstance delay the Closing,
and the amounts set forth therein shall be calculated as set forth in the
Estimated Closing Statement (as modified to reflect any revision mutually
agreed upon by the Purchaser and the Company), for the purposes of the
Closing; and

(b) a statement (the " _Closing Date Holder Payment Statement_ "), signed
by the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company

(b) The Lithotech Earnout Escrow Amount, as adjusted from time to

Section 3.6 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) No later than forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative the
draft closing statement of the Company as of the Closing Date (the " _Proposed
Closing Statement_ "), which shall include a calculation of each of the
Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Working Capital Surplus, if any, the
Working Capital Deficit, if any, the Closing Cash, the Cash Deficit, if any,
the Cash Surplus, if any, the Transaction Expenses, the Expense Overpayment,
if any, the Expense Underpayment, if any, the Final Shortfall, if any, and
the Final Surplus, if any. The calculation of the foregoing will be prepared
in accordance with the accounting methods, policies, principles, practices,
procedures, classifications and estimation methodologies (whether with regard
to reserves or otherwise) that were used in the preparation of _Exhibit
1.1(a)_ and shall not include any changes in assets or liabilities as a result
of purchase accounting adjustments or other changes arising from or resulting
as a consequence of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Parties agree that the purpose of preparing the Proposed Closing Statement and
determining Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Cash and Transaction
Expenses pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 3.6_ is to measure changes in
Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses
against the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital, Estimated Closing Cash
and Estimated Transaction Expenses amounts, and such process is not intended
to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting methods,
policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or estimation
methodologies (whether with regard to reserves or otherwise) for the purpose
of

 



-32-  preparing the Proposed Closing Statement or determining Closing Date Net
Working Capital, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses from those utilized by
the Company in the preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement.

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall have thirty (30) days following
receipt of the Proposed Closing Statement (the " _Evaluation Period_ ") during
which to notify the Purchaser in writing of any dispute of any item contained
in the Proposed Closing Statement, which written notice (the " _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
dispute. At any time within the Evaluation Period, the Stockholder
Representative shall be entitled to agree with any or all of the items set
forth in the Proposed Closing Statement. For purposes of the Stockholder
Representatives evaluation of the Proposed Closing Statement, the Purchaser
and the Surviving Corporation shall make available or provide reasonable
access to the Stockholder Representative and its Representatives, upon
advance notice and during normal business hours, all information, records,
data and working papers created or used in connection with the preparation of
the Proposed Closing Statement; and shall permit reasonable access, upon
advance notice and during normal business hours, to the Surviving
Corporations and its Subsidiaries facilities and personnel, as may be
reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative and
its Representatives to analyze the Proposed Closing Statement. The Evaluation
Period shall be tolled and thereby extended in respect of any delay of the
Stockholder Representatives evaluation by more than five (5) days arising out
of any failure of Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation to (x) timely and
substantively respond to any reasonable request or (y) act in good faith in
respect of the covenants contained in the foregoing sentence.

 

(c) If the Stockholder Representative does not deliver a Notice of
Disagreement to the Purchaser within the Evaluation Period, or notifies the
Purchaser of its agreement with the adjustments in the Proposed Closing
Statement prior to the expiration of the Evaluation Period, the Proposed
Closing Statement prepared by the Purchaser shall be deemed to be the Final
Closing Statement, and shall be final, conclusive and binding on all Parties.

(d) If the Stockholder Representative delivers a Notice of Disagreement to
the Purchaser within the Evaluation Period, the Final Closing Statement shall
be resolved as follows:

 

(i) The Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall cooperate in
good faith to resolve any such dispute as promptly as possible.

(ii) In the event the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative are
unable to resolve any such dispute within fifteen (15) days (or such longer
period as the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall mutually
agree in writing) after delivery to the Purchaser of the Notice of
Disagreement, such dispute and each Partys work papers related thereto shall
be submitted to Deloitte (the " _Arbitrator_ ") for resolution in accordance
with this _Section 3.6(d)(ii_ ). The Stockholder Representative and the
Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Arbitrator to render
a written decision resolving the matters submitted to

 



-33-  the Arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the making of such submission. The
scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Arbitrator shall be limited to
whether the items in dispute that were included in the Notice of Disagreement
were prepared in accordance with this Agreement and the Arbitrator shall
determine, on such basis, whether and to what extent, the Proposed Closing
Statement requires adjustment. The Arbitrator is not to make any other
determinations. The Arbitrators decision shall be based solely on written
submissions and presentations by the Stockholder Representative and the
Purchaser and their respective Representatives and not by independent review,
and shall be made in accordance with the accounting methods, policies,
principles, practices, procedures, classifications and estimation
methodologies (whether with regard to reserves or otherwise) that were used in
the preparation of _Exhibit 1.1(a)_ , to the extent applicable. The
Arbitrator shall address only those items in dispute and may not assign a
value greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or
smaller than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Party.
Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Arbitrator in any court
having jurisdiction over the Party against which such determination is to be
enforced. The fees, costs and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be allocated
between the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Holders), on the one
hand, and the Purchaser (or, at its election, the Surviving Corporation), on
the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the
disputed items submitted to the Arbitrator that is unsuccessfully disputed by
each such Party (as finally determined by the Arbitrator) bears to the total
amount of such disputed items so submitted. For example, if the Stockholder
Representative challenges the calculation of the Proposed Closing Statement
by an amount of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), but the Arbitrator
determines that the Stockholder Representative has a valid claim for only
Forty Thousand Dollars ($40,000), the Purchaser (or, at its election, the
Surviving Corporation) shall bear forty percent (40%) of the fees and expenses
of the Arbitrator and the Holders shall bear the other sixty percent (60%) of
such fees and expenses, with the Holders portion of such fees and expenses
paid solely out of the Stockholder Representative Reserve.

(e) The Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative jointly shall revise
the Proposed Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Date Net Working
Capital, the Working Capital Surplus, if any, the Working Capital Deficit, if
any, the Closing Cash, the Cash Deficit, if any, the Cash Surplus, if any,
the Transaction Expenses, the Expense Overpayment, if any, the Expense
Underpayment, if any, the Final Shortfall, if any, and the Final Surplus, if
any, as appropriate to reflect the resolution of the Stockholder
Representatives objections (as agreed upon by the Purchaser and the
Stockholder Representative or as determined by the Arbitrator) and deliver it
to the Stockholder Representative within ten (10) days after the resolution of
such objections. Such revised Proposed Closing Statement shall be the Final
Closing Statement, and shall be final, conclusive and binding on all Parties.

 

(f) To the extent there is a Final Shortfall on the Final Closing
Statement, the Purchaser shall be entitled to recover the amount of the Final
Shortfall solely from the Working Capital Escrow Fund in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement.

 



-34- (g) To the extent there is a Final Surplus on the Final Closing Statement,
the Purchaser shall pay the Paying Agent, on behalf of the Holders or, in the
case of the Option Holders, the Purchaser shall pay to the Company for the
benefit of the Option Holders (in accordance with their Pro
Rata Percentages), the amount of the Final Surplus by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days after the
Purchasers delivery of the Final Closing Statement to the Stockholder
Representative to an account or accounts designated by the Paying Agent. Upon
such payment, Paying Agent shall disburse promptly such amount to the Holders
in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentages.

 

(h) If there is no Final Shortfall and no Final Surplus, then no further
adjustments or payments shall be made.

director or consultant (or dependents of such Persons), or (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due to

Agreement to be consummated by the End Date, and the Company shall cooperate
with and assist the Purchaser in effectuating the foregoing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Purchaser shall not take any of the foregoing actions
without the consent of the Company if such actions would bind the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or the DMS Entities to take any action (including
paying money or entering into any other obligation) irrespective of whether
the Closing occurs. The Purchaser shall, subject to the provisions of this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_, use its reasonable best efforts to seek to lift, reverse
or remove any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction
or other order or decree that would otherwise give rise to a failure of any
condition to the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

required to take, or commit to take, any of the actions required to be taken
by the Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 6.3(d)_.

Subsidiaries not to, acquire or agree to acquire, by merging with or into or
consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or
equity in, or by any other manner, any business or any corporation,
partnership, association or other business organization or division thereof,
or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a
definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of such
acquisition, merger or consolidation, would reasonably be expected to: (i)
impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk
of not obtaining, any consents of any Governmental Entity necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) materially increase the
risk of any Governmental Entity seeking or entering any judgment decree or
order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

year in which the Closing occurs, any waiting periods, pre-existing condition

to any Company Benefit Plan or any Employee Benefit Plan of the Purchaser.

submit to a stockholder vote, in a manner that satisfies the stockholder
approval requirements under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and regulations
promulgated thereunder (a " _Stockholder Vote_ "), the right of any
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) to

connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation with
respect to any acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken

Persons to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date as provided in the
respective certificate of incorporation or bylaws or comparable organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as now in effect, and any
indemnification agreements or arrangements of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms. Such rights shall not be amended,
or otherwise modified in 

 



-63-  any manner that would adversely affect the rights of such indemnitees unless
such modification is required by applicable Law. In addition, the Purchaser
shall cause the Company to pay any expenses of any such indemnitee under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.7_ as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by
applicable Law.

(b) The Purchaser agrees that (i) the certificate of incorporation and the
bylaws or comparable organizational documents of the Company and its

organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries, respectively, on
the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date

respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Closing shall survive the
Closing.

the Closing "tail" coverage with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Closing Date for a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date
under the directors and officers liability insurance policy of the Company as
it relates to the Company, its Subsidiaries and the DMS Entities, as in effect
on the Closing Date. The aggregate amount necessary to purchase such "tail"

Subsidiaries, successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of

its properties and assets to any Person, the Purchaser shall use its

Subsidiaries (as applicable) assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.7_.

 

(e) This _Section_ __ _ 6.7_, which shall survive the Closing and shall

or entity referenced in this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ or indemnified hereunder,
each of whom may enforce the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ (whether
or not parties to this Agreement). The obligations of the Purchaser and the
Surviving Corporation under this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom
this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ applies without the express written consent of such
affected indemnitee (it being expressly

less than all of Companys stockholders and that appraisal rights may be
available with respect to their shares of Company Stock, which notice shall
include a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL as required by such section.

 

Section 6.9 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Tax Returns_. The Company shall, at the Companys expense, prepare or
cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax
Returns required to be filed by the Company or any Subsidiary (including such
Tax Returns filed pursuant to any valid extension of time to file) prior to
the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns_"), the Company shall
timely pay or cause to be timely paid all Taxes with respect to such Pre-
Closing Period Tax Returns, and all such Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns shall
be prepared in accordance with past practice unless otherwise required by
applicable Tax Law. The Company shall provide all Pre-Closing Period Tax
Returns to the Purchaser for the Purchasers review and comment at least
twenty (20) days before the due date (including any valid extension of time to
file) for any such Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns and shall reflect on such
Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns any reasonable comments provided by the
Purchaser prior to filing such Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns. The Purchaser
shall cause the Surviving Corporation, at the expense of the Stockholder
Representative with respect to Pre-Closing Periods and at the expense of the
Surviving Corporation with respect to Straddle Periods, to prepare in good
faith and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed all other Tax
Returns for Pre-Closing Periods and Straddle Periods for the Company and its
Subsidiaries and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to each such Tax
Return. With respect to Tax Returns filed with respect to the Section
338(h)(10) allocation agreed to with respect to the DMS Transaction, such Tax
Returns shall be filed consistent with the allocation of the purchase price
finally agreed to by the parties with respect to the DMS Transaction, it being
understood by the Company, on behalf of itself and VMAC, that the Purchaser
shall have the right to review and comment on such allocation and that VMAC
will reflect any reasonable comments provided by Purchaser in the final
allocation agreed to by VMAC in the DMS Transaction or submitted to the
arbitrator of such allocation, as the case may be. Such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in accordance with past practice unless otherwise required by
applicable Tax Law.

 



-65- (b) _Straddle Period_. In the case of any Straddle Period, for purposes
of determining the amount of any Tax liabilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in computing the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the amount of
such Taxes attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period shall be (i) in
the case of any Pre-Closing Period Taxes other than sales or use taxes, value-
added taxes, employment taxes, withholding taxes, and any Tax based on or
measured by income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period, be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the pre-Closing
Straddle Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of any sales or use taxes, value-added
taxes, employment taxes, withholding taxes, and any Tax based on or measured
by income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the Straddle Period ended on and
included the Closing Date. In the case of a Tax that is (x) paid for the
privilege of doing business during a period (a " _Privilege Period_ ") and
(y) computed based on business activity occurring during an accounting period
ending prior to such Privilege Period, any reference to a "Tax period," a "tax
period," or a "taxable period" shall mean such accounting period and not such
Privilege Period.

 

(c) _Amendments, Modifications, etc_. After the Closing Date, the
Purchaser and its Affiliates, shall not (and shall have no right to), without
the written consent of the Stockholder Representative, amend, modify or
otherwise change any Tax Return of the Company or its Subsidiaries for any
Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period if such amendment, modification or
change would reduce the amount of any Tax refund or credit that would
otherwise be owed to the Holders pursuant to _Section 6.9(e)_ or would reduce

change, the Purchaser shall provide notice thereof to the Stockholder
Representative no later than fifteen (15) days prior to such amendment,
modification or change.

 

(d) _Cooperation_. The Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation, on the one
hand, and the Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, shall cooperate,
as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection
with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section_ __ _

(" _Tax Proceeding_ "). Such cooperation shall include signing any Tax

information and explanation of any material provided hereby.

 

(e) _Refunds_. Except to the extent included as an asset in the
calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital or attributable to any Tax
attribute generated after the Closing Date, any Tax refund or credit
(including any interest paid or credited by any

 



-66-  Taxing Authority with respect thereto) of Taxes for any Pre-Closing Period
paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to Closing or that were
included as a current liability in determining Closing Date Net Working
Capital shall be solely the property of the Holders, but shall be reduced by
the Purchaser for any Taxes or other reasonable costs and expenses incurred by
the Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates in
connection with claiming or receiving such refund or credit. All other Tax
refunds or credits of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-
Closing Period shall be solely the property of the Purchaser. The Purchaser
shall, if the Stockholder Representative so requests, cause the Company to
file for, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and expedite the
receipt of, any Tax refund or credit to which the Holders are entitled under
this _Section 6.9(e)_ , and the Purchaser shall permit the Stockholder
Representative to participate in the prosecution of any such refund claim. If
received by the Purchaser or the Company, any amounts payable to the Holders
pursuant to this _Section 6.9(e)_ shall be paid, within ten (10) days after
receipt or entitlement thereto, to the Stockholder Representative, for the
benefit of the Holders in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentages (or, in
the case of the Option Holders, paid to the Company, for the benefit of the
Option Holders in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentages). For purposes of
this _Section 6.9(e)_ , any Tax refund or credit (including any interest paid
or credited by any Taxing Authority with respect thereto) for a Straddle
Period shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing
Period in accordance with the allocation principles set forth in _Section
6.9(b)_.

(f) _No Section_ __ _ 338 Election_. No election under Section 338(g) of
the Code, or any similar provision of state or local Law, may be made with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(g) _Documentation_. The Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation, on the
one hand, and the Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, further
agree, upon request from the other Party, to use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

 

(h) _Transfer Taxes_. Any sales, use, real estate transfer, stock transfer
or similar transfer Tax (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne by the Purchaser;
_provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser will not bear any
Transfer Taxes payable in connection with the DMS Transaction.

(i) _Certain Conventions for Determining Taxes_. The Parties agree for
purposes of determining the Holders obligation for Taxes (other than Transfer
Taxes) relating to the Pre-Closing Period and, as applicable, for purposes of
preparing Tax Returns of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries for
Pre-Closing Periods, to use the following conventions and procedures:

 

(i) All Transaction Tax Deductions accrued on or before the Closing Date
shall be treated as being incurred in a Pre-Closing Period.

 



-67- (ii) All elections and decisions with respect to whether to carryback
or carryforward a net operating loss or other Tax attribute or credit
incurred in any Pre-Closing Period shall be made such that the net operating
loss or other Tax attribute or credit is first carried back to the maximum
extent permitted under applicable Law prior to being carried forward to a
Post-Closing Period.

 

(iii) Any gains, income, deductions, losses or other items resulting from
any transactions outside of the ordinary course of business occurring on the
Closing Date, but after the Closing, and not contemplated by this Agreement
shall not be treated as occurring on the Closing Date.

 

(j) _Characterization of Certain Payments_. For all relevant Tax purposes,
the Parties agree to treat the Working Capital Escrow Fund as an asset of the
Purchaser and all interest and other earnings on the Working Capital Escrow
Fund as earnings of the Purchaser (it being understood that this tax
characterization shall not affect which Person is entitled to such earnings).
Unless otherwise required by a determination of a Governmental Entity that is
final, no Party hereto shall file a Tax Return, or take position during the
course of any audit or other proceeding, that is inconsistent with such
agreement.

(k) _Tax Benefits_. To the extent that the Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries (i) files a Tax Return (which, for
this purpose, shall not include any payment of estimated Taxes) on which a Tax
Benefit is reflected or (ii) receives a Tax refund or credit (including any
interest paid or credited by any Taxing Authority with respect thereto) of
Taxes paid for any Pre-Closing Period which Tax refund or credit is
attributable to the Transaction Tax Deductions (including as a result of
utilizing any net operating loss or other Tax attribute that was created as a
result of the Transaction Tax Deductions), or any net operating loss otherwise
existing as of the Effective Time as reflected on the Tax Returns
prepared pursuant to _Section 6.9(a)_ , the Purchaser shall, within ten (10)
days of filing such Tax Return, in the case of any Tax Benefit, or receiving
such Tax refund or utilizing such Tax credit, in the case of any Tax refund or
credit, pay to the Stockholder Representative, for the benefit of the Holders
in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentages, the full amount of such Tax
Benefit or the amount of such Tax refund or credit reduced by any Taxes or
other reasonable costs or expenses incurred by the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates in connection with claiming or receiving such Tax refund or credit,
in either case, that is in excess of the amount, if any, of such Tax Benefit
or Tax refund or credit that was included as an asset for purposes of the
Closing Date Net Working Capital, as finally determined; _provided_ , however,
that the Purchaser shall have the right to offset any payment due to the
Stockholder Representative pursuant to this _Section 6.9(k)_ by any amounts
owed by the Stockholder Representative to the Purchaser with respect to Taxes.
The obligations of the Holders, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries under this _Section 6.9(k)_ shall survive the Closing
indefinitely.

earlier termination of this Agreement, the Purchaser shall promptly notify
the Company in writing if the Purchaser becomes aware of (i) the occurrence or

(d) by written notice from the Company to the Purchaser, in the event the
Purchaser or Merger Sub (i) fails to perform in any material respect any of

and warranties contained herein, which failure or breach would result in the
failure of either of the closing conditions specified in _Section 7.3(b)_ or
_Section 7.3(a)_ , respectively, and which failure or breach, if capable of

ARTICLE X

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 10.1 _Stockholder Indemnification Obligation_. Subject to the
provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 10.3_, from and after the Closing, each
Stockholder, on a several and not joint basis (in accordance with their Pro
Rata Percentage), shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the Purchaser and
its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) and their respective
Representatives, successors and assigns (each, a " _Purchaser_ _Indemnitee_ ")
from and against any and all Damages sustained or incurred by any Purchaser
Indemnitee as a result of or arising from any Closing Date Indebtedness or
Transaction Expenses of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing
that is not fully paid or satisfied by the Company at or prior to the Closing,
or if paid by the Purchaser at or prior to the Closing, to the extent not
deducted in the determination of the Cash Consideration pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 3.1_; _provided_ , that the total amount of indemnification payable in
respect of such Damages shall be limited to the amount of the Stockholder
Representative Reserve. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, any Damages payable to a Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 10.1_ will be satisfied solely from the Stockholder
Representative Reserve.

 



-79- Section 10.2 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any third party shall notify a Purchaser
Indemnitee with respect to any matter (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") that may
give rise to a claim for indemnification by the Purchaser Indemnitee against
the Stockholder Representative with respect to Closing Date Indebtedness or
Transaction Expenses under this  _ARTICLE X_ , then the Purchaser Indemnitee
shall promptly notify the Stockholder Representative thereof in writing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of the Purchaser Indemnitee
in notifying the Stockholder Representative shall relieve the Stockholder
Representative from any obligation hereunder except to the extent the
Stockholders shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure. The Stockholder Representative will have the right to defend the
Purchaser Indemnitee against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser Indemnitee so long as (i) the
Stockholder Representative notifies the Purchaser Indemnitee in writing,
within five (5) Business Days after the Purchaser Indemnitee has given notice
of the Third Party Claim, that the Stockholder Representative will assume the
defense of the Third Party Claim, (ii) the Stockholder Representative provides
the Purchaser Indemnitee with evidence reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser
Indemnitee that the Stockholder Representative will have the financial
resources to defend against the Third Party Claim and fulfill the Stockholder
Representatives indemnification obligation hereunder, (iii) the Third Party
Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction or other
equitable relief, (iv) the Stockholder Representative expressly agrees in
writing to the Purchaser Indemnitee that, as between the two, the Stockholder
Representative is solely obligated to satisfy and discharge the claim and (v)
the Stockholder Representative conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim
actively and diligently. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Purchaser
Indemnitee reasonably determines based on the advice of counsel that there may
be a conflict between the positions of the Stockholder Representative and the
Purchaser Indemnitee in conducting the defense of such Action or that there
may be legal defenses available to such Purchaser Indemnitee different from or
in addition to those available to the Stockholder Representative, then counsel
for the Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to conduct the defense to the
extent necessary to protect the interests of the Purchaser Indemnitee, at the
expense of the Stockholder Representative.

 

(b) _Direct Claims_. In order for a Purchaser Indemnitee to be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_ with respect to Damages that do
not result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "), the Purchaser
Indemnitee shall notify the Stockholder Representative in writing reasonably
promptly after the Purchaser Indemnitee becomes aware of such Direct Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
Stockholders shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure. The Stockholder Representative shall have thirty (30) days after its
receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. The
Purchaser Indemnitee shall give the Stockholder Representative reasonable
access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the books,
records, personnel and assets of the Purchaser Indemnitee to investigate the
matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to such Direct Claim. If the
Stockholder Representative disputes its liability with respect to any such

 



-80-  claim, the Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser Indemnitee shall
proceed to negotiate in good faith a resolution of such dispute and, if not
resolved through negotiations within 30 days, the Purchaser Indemnitee shall
be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Purchaser
Indemnitee on the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.3 _Adjustment of the Merger Consideration_. Amounts paid for
indemnification under this _ARTICLE X_ shall be deemed to be an adjustment to
the Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
Law.

 

Section 10.4 _No Circular Recovery_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, no Stockholder shall make any claim pursuant to this Agreement
or pursuant to the constituent documents of the Company with respect to any
claim brought by any Purchaser Indemnitee against any Stockholder or relating
to this Agreement, the other documents contemplated hereby, or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

ARTICLE XI

shall be paid entirely by the Purchaser.

with respect to the performance on behalf of such Stockholder under the terms
and provisions hereof and to do or refrain from doing all such further acts

Representative to satisfy the obligations of the Stockholder Representative
set forth herein, including the indemnification obligation set forth in

Option Holders, the Stockholder Representative shall pay to the Company, for
the benefit of the Option Holders in accordance with their Pro Rata
Percentages (or the Stockholder Representative may deliver such amounts
directly to the Holders if the Paying Agent is no longer engaged or if the
Stockholder Representative otherwise so determines), any amounts remaining in
the Stockholder Representative Reserve.

 

(e) In furtherance of its role, the Stockholder Representative shall be
entitled to incur such reasonable costs and expenses as the Stockholder
Representative may deem appropriate under the circumstances, which expenses
may include, hiring attorneys, accountants, appraisers and other professional
advisors. Such expenses shall be reimbursed from the Stockholder
Representative Reserve from time to time upon demand by the Stockholder
Representative.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Paying Agent
Agreement is intended, and nothing in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or
the Paying Agent Agreement shall be interpreted as, imposing upon the
Stockholder Representative, solely in its capacity as the agent and attorney-
in fact for the Stockholders, any personal liability, personal economic
obligation or personal guarantee in favor of any Party to this Agreement or
any third party. The Stockholder Representative shall have no liability to the
Purchaser, the Company or the Stockholders with respect to actions taken or
omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Stockholder Representative.

 

Section 11.16 _Concerning the Company_ __ _s Counsel; Attorney Client
Privilege_.

 

(a) The Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of
the Stockholders), the Company and their respective Affiliates acknowledge
and agree that Hogan Lovells US LLP ( " _Prior Company Counsel_ ") have acted
as counsel for the Company, certain of its Affiliates and the DMS Entities for
several years and that, in the event of any post-Closing disputes between the
Parties, the Stockholders reasonably

 



-87-  anticipate that Prior Company Counsel may represent certain of them in such
matters. Accordingly, the Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Stockholder
Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders), the Company and their
respective Affiliates expressly consent to Prior Company Counsels
representation of one or more of the Stockholders (or the Stockholder
Representative) in any post-Closing matter in which the interests of the
Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company on the one hand, and the Stockholders
(or the Stockholder Representative) on the other hand, are adverse, whether or
not such matter is one in which Prior Company Counsel may have previously
advised the Company or its Affiliates and consent to the disclosure by Prior
Company Counsel to the Stockholders (or the Stockholder Representative) or any
of their Affiliates, directors, members, partners, officers or employees of
any information learned by Prior Company Counsel in the course of its
representation of the Company, its Affiliates or the DMS Entities, whether or
not such information is subject to attorney client privilege or Prior Company
Counsels duty of confidentiality. The Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company and
their respective Affiliates further covenant and agree that each shall not
assert any claim against Prior Company Counsel in respect of legal services
provided to the Company, its Affiliates or the DMS Entities by Prior
Company Counsel in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(b) The Parties understand and agree that the Company, its Affiliates and
the DMS Entities have been represented by Prior Company Counsel in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Engagement_ ").
The Parties further understand and agree that the Company, prior to Closing,
and the Stockholder Representative, after the Closing, shall have the sole
right to control, assert and waive the attorney-client privilege with respect
to any communications at any time between or among the Company, any of its
Affiliates or the DMS Entities and Prior Company Counsel relating to the
Engagement. Immediately prior to the Closing Date, all documents and
communications generated and maintained by the Company, any of its Affiliates
or the DMS Entities and Prior Company Counsel in connection with the
Engagement shall become the exclusive property of the Stockholder
Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders), notwithstanding whether any
such documents or communications may be retained in the Surviving
Corporations files or may come into the possession of the Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation after the Closing.

 

(c) The Parties understand and agree that nothing in this Agreement,
including the foregoing provision regarding the ownership and assertion of
privilege shall be deemed to be a waiver of any applicable attorney-client
privilege. The Parties further understand and agree that the Parties have each
undertaken reasonable best efforts to prevent the disclosure of confidential
or attorney-client privileged information. Notwithstanding those efforts, the
Parties further understand and agree that the consummation of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement may result in the inadvertent disclosure of
information that may be confidential or subject to a claim of privilege. The
Parties further understand and agree that any disclosure of information that
may be confidential or subject to a claim of privilege will not prejudice
or otherwise constitute a waiver of any claim of privilege. The Parties agree
to use reasonable best efforts to return promptly any inadvertently disclosed
information to the appropriate Party upon becoming aware of its existence.
This  _Section_ __ _ 11.16_ shall be irrevocable, and

 



-88-  no term of this _Section_ __ _ 11.16_ may be amended, waived or modified,
without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative and its
Affiliates and Prior Company Counsel affected thereby.

Section 11.17 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Without limitation of all of the cumulative rights and remedies that a
Party may have under this Agreement or to which it is entitled at law or in
equity, including the ability to seek recovery for monetary damages, during
the period from the date hereof until the earlier of (i) the Closing or (ii)
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _ARTICLE IX_ , the remedies of
each Party in the event of a breach by another Party shall include (A)
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _ARTICLE IX_ and (B) specific
performance in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 11.17_. The Parties
agree that irreparable damage would occur (for which monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy) in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, including a Party failing to take
actions as are required of it under the Agreement to consummate the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, it is agreed that
the Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement.

 

(b) The right to seek specific enforcement is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby and each Party hereby agrees not to raise
any objections to the availability of an injunction, the equitable remedy of
specific performance or other equitable remedy to prevent or restrain breaches
of this Agreement by such Party and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or
to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such Party under
this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this  _Section_ __ _
11.17_. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with such order or injunction all in accordance with the terms of
this _Section_ __ _ 11.17_. To the extent any Party brings an action, suit or
proceeding to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (other than an action to enforce specifically any
provision that expressly survives termination of this Agreement), the End Date
shall automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day
following the resolution of such action, suit or proceeding or (ii) such
other time period established by the court presiding over such action, suit or
proceeding.

 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit any Persons right to seek and
obtain any equitable relief to which such Person shall be entitled or to seek
any remedy on account of any Persons fraud or any intentional and willful
breach of this Agreement.

 

Section 11.18 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be
enforced against, and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out
of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may
only be brought against, the entities that are expressly named as Parties
through a Letter of Transmittal and then only with respect to the specific

 



-89-  obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party. Except to the
extent a named party to this Agreement (and then only to the extent of the
specific obligations undertaken by such named party in this Agreement and not
otherwise), no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
advisor or Representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have
any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or
more of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations or liabilities of any one or more of the Company or the Purchaser
under this Agreement or of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
