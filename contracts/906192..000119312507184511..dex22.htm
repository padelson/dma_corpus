days following the date on which the disputed items are referred to the
Independent Accounting Firm. In deciding any matter, the Independent
Accounting Firm (i) shall be bound by the provisions of _Section 2.3_, (ii)
may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either Purchaser or Seller Representative or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by Purchaser or Seller Representative,

absence of fraud or manifest error, the Determination shall be conclusive and
binding upon Purchaser, Seller Representative and Sellers. The Independent

based on the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded
to such party bears to the amount actually contested by the parties. By way of
example and not by way of limitation, if Seller Representative seeks a
$70,000 upward adjustment to Net Assets and the Independent Accounting Firm
determines that there shall be a $40,000 upward adjustment, then Sellers shall

Purchasers good faith determination of the Actual Net Assets and Actual
Surplus Cash as of the Closing Date, and identifying any adjustments to the
Purchase Price as a result of such amounts being greater or less than the
amount of Estimated Net Assets and Surplus Cash set forth on the Final
Certificate and Flow of Funds Memorandum. If Seller Representative does not

Price shall be adjusted as set forth in Purchasers certificate, and payment
made in accordance with _Section 2.4_. If Seller Representative objects to

2.4 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_.

(a) The Net Asset amount determined in accordance with _Section 2.3_ (the "
_Actual Net Assets_ ") shall be used to calculate the following post-Closing
adjustment to the Purchase Price. If the Actual Net Assets exceeds the Net
Asset Collar, then Purchaser shall pay Sellers and Option Holders an amount
equal to such excess (minus any Upward Closing Adjustment Amount or plus any
Downward Closing Adjustment Amount, as applicable) in accordance with
instructions received from Seller Representative. If the Net Asset Collar
exceeds the Actual Net Assets, then:

(i) the Seller Representative agrees to execute such documentation necessary
to instruct the Escrow Agent to pay Purchaser an amount equal to such
deficiency (plus any Upward Closing Adjustment Amount or minus any Downward
Closing Adjustment Amount, as applicable) from the Net Assets Escrow Account
(such deficiency, the " _Post-Closing Downward Adjustment Amount_ "), and

(ii) if the Post-Closing Downward Adjustment Amount is greater then the amount
in the Net Assets Escrow Account, the Seller Representative agrees to execute
such documentation necessary to instruct the Escrow Agent to pay Purchaser an
amount equal to such deficiency from the Escrow Account, provided that after
$1 million has been distributed from the Escrow Account, any additional
shortfall greater than the amount of the Net Assets Escrow Account plus $1
million shall be paid, at the option of the Purchaser, directly from the
Sellers pursuant to their Common Pro Rata Percentages or from the Escrow
Account.

(b) The Surplus Cash amount determined in accordance with  _Section 2.3_
(the " _Actual Surplus Cash_ ") shall be used to calculate the following post-
Closing adjustment to the Purchase Price. If the Actual Surplus Cash exceeds
the Surplus Cash, then Purchaser shall pay Sellers and Option Holders an
amount equal to such excess in accordance with instructions received from
Seller Representative. If the Surplus Cash exceeds the Actual Surplus Cash,
then:

(i) the Seller Representative agrees to execute such documentation necessary
to instruct the Escrow Agent to pay Purchaser an amount equal to such
deficiency from the Net Assets Escrow Account, and

(ii) if the amount of such deficiency (together with the Post-Closing
Downward Adjustment Amount) is greater then the amount in the Net Assets
Escrow Account, the Seller Representative agrees to execute such documentation
necessary to instruct the Escrow Agent to pay Purchaser an amount equal to
such deficiency from the Escrow Account, provided that after $1 million has
been distributed from the Escrow Account, any additional shortfall greater
than the amount of the Net Assets Escrow Account plus $1 million shall be
paid, at the option of the Purchaser, directly from the Sellers pursuant to
their Common Pro Rata Percentages or from the Escrow Account.



 

19 All payments to be made pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ shall be made by check
or by wire transfer of immediately available funds within three (3) Business
Days after the date on which Actual Net Assets and Actual Surplus Cash are
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.3_. To the extent that not all of
the funds from the Net Asset Escrow Account are released to the Purchaser
pursuant to this _Section 2.4_, Purchaser agrees to promptly sign and deliver
to the Escrow Agent instructions to release the remaining funds from the Net
Asset Escrow Account to Sellers and Option Holders in accordance with
instructions received from Seller Representative.

2.5  _Bonus Payments On or Before Closing_. Company shall pay, on or before
the Closing, any severance or bonus payments required to be paid to employees
for employees who cease their employment as of or prior to Closing.

2.6 _Form of Payments_. Except as expressly provided herein, all payments
hereunder shall be made by delivery to the recipient by depositing, by check
or wire transfer, the required amount (in immediately available funds) in an
account of the recipient, which account shall be designated by the recipient
in writing at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date of the required
payment.

2.7 _Allocation_. The allocation of assets shall be determined consistent
with applicable IRS regulations and subject to the involvement of an
independent, reputable valuation or accounting firm selected by the Parent.
Each of Parent and Seller Representative shall be provided with
reasonable access to such valuation or accounting firm in order to provide
input for the preparation of such allocation. The Parent shall provide a copy
of the final allocation, as determined by such valuation or accounting firm
and used in connection with Parents applicable Form 8594 that is filed for
the taxable year that includes the Closing Date. If Seller Representative
agrees with such allocation, Seller Representative shall notify Parent in
writing of such agreement; provided that for the avoidance of doubt, if
Seller Representative does not agree with such allocation, such disagreement
shall not limit in any way any tax position taken by Parent.

2.8 _Payment of Tax Refund_. If the Company receives all or part of the Tax
Refund within eighteen (18) months after the Closing and the Purchaser
determines in good faith that there is no reasonable legal basis for any
Taxing Authority to require the return of such Tax Refund, the Purchaser
hereby agrees to pay the amount of the Tax Refund actually received by the
Company to the Sellers and Option Holders as additional Purchase Price. Such
payment will be made by Purchaser by check to the Sellers and Option Holders
within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of the applicable Tax Refund
by the Company, and otherwise in a manner consistent with other payments to
Sellers and Option Holders under this Agreement. The Purchaser shall not be

duty to take any actions to collect the Tax Refund.

obligations under the Exchange Act) or otherwise expressly permitted
hereunder, each of Purchaser, Parent, Company and Sellers shall each keep
confidential and not directly or indirectly disclose or transfer any
Confidential



 

52  Information other than to its Representatives, and each will use such
Confidential Information solely in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and if the transactions contemplated hereby
are not consummated for any reason, each shall return to the other, without
retaining any copies thereof, any schedules, documents or other written
Confidential Information obtained from the other in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall cause all of its
Representatives to whom it may have disclosed such information to do the same.
Following the Closing, each Seller shall keep confidential and not directly
or indirectly disclose or transfer any Confidential Information other than to
its Representatives and will not use such information for its own benefit or
for the benefit of any other Person (other than Company, Purchaser
and Parent) and shall cause all of its Representatives to do the same;
provided that the obligations of the Sellers under this sentence shall
terminate (other than with respect to Intellectual Property) on the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations,
(a) any information may be disclosed by any party to this Agreement in
connection with the enforcement of its rights hereunder and the defense of any
claims made with respect to this Agreement or the operation of Company prior
to Closing (provided that any such disclosure shall be limited to the
narrowest extent possible), and (b) no party to this Agreement shall be
required to keep confidential or return any information that (i) is known or
available through other lawful sources not bound by a confidentiality
agreement with the disclosing party; (ii) is or becomes publicly known or
generally known in the industry through no fault of the receiving party or its
agents; (iii) is developed by the receiving party independently of the
disclosure by the disclosing party; (iv) is requested or required to be
disclosed pursuant to Law (including securities Laws of any jurisdiction and
rules and regulations of any applicable equity exchange), provided the other
parties are given reasonable prior notice or consent thereto; or (v) relates
solely to the income tax aspects and consequences of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.9 No _Inconsistent Action_. None of Purchaser, Parent, Company or Sellers
shall take any action which is materially inconsistent with its obligations
under this Agreement, that would cause any representation made by it hereunder
or any other Transaction Document to be untrue or misleading in any material
respect, that would make it impossible or impracticable for a condition
herein to any partys obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby to be satisfied, or that would materially hinder or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

6.10 _Permits_. Company shall maintain all Permits that continue to be
necessary in order for Company to own the Assets and continue to conduct
Companys business and its Subsidiaries businesses as they are then conducted
in full force and effect, and will file timely, all material reports,
statements, renewals applications and other filings that are required to keep
such Permits in full force and effect, and will pay timely all fees and
charges in connection therewith that are required to keep the Permits in full
force and effect.

6.11 _Obligations to Employees_. All obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries arising from any severance, retention or similar agreements
entered into prior to the Closing shall either be paid by Company prior to
Closing or be deemed to be liabilities on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet
and for the purposes of determining Net Assets. For the sake of clarity, the
Parent Retention Packages shall be deemed to have been entered into
simultaneously with the Closing and will therefore not be deemed to be
liabilities on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet for the purposes of
determining Net Assets. Nothing in this Agreement shall change the "at will"
nature of the employment arrangements with any employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, whether or not they become employees of the Parent or an
Affiliate of the Parent.

6.12 _Notification; Updates to Disclosure Schedule_. Company and Sellers, on
the one hand, and Purchaser and Parent on the other hand, shall promptly
notify the other in writing of: (a) the discovery of any event, condition,
fact or circumstance that constitutes a breach of any representation or



 

53  warranty made by such party in this Agreement, (b) any known breach of any
covenant or obligation of such party set forth in this Agreement; or (c) any
known event, condition, fact or circumstance that may make such partys timely
satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7_ or _Section
8_, as applicable, impossible or unlikely. In addition, the Company and
Sellers shall be required to update the Disclosure Schedules (and a
certificate as to the accuracy of such update) within three (3) Business Days
prior to Closing so that the representations set forth in _Section 3_ and
_Section 4_ are true and correct as of the Closing Date or, in the case of
representations and warranties that expressly relate to an earlier date, as of
such earlier date. Except as set forth in _Section 7.1_, no
such notification or updated Disclosure Schedules shall have the effect of
(i) amending the Disclosure Schedules provided in connection with the
execution of this Agreement or (ii) constitute a waiver of any rights of
Purchaser or Parent for any breach of any provision of this Agreement.

6.13 _Further Action; Efforts; HSR_.

 

(a) Each of the parties shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable. Each of the parties shall use its Reasonable Best
Efforts to achieve all of such partys applicable conditions to closing (which

plan year for the purpose of determining those participants eligible for
Company non-discretionary "employer matching contributions". Immediately prior
to such termination, Company will make all contributions: (i) necessary or
required to maintain the tax-qualified status of the Company 401(k) plan and
(ii) for elective deferrals made pursuant to the Company 401(k) plan for the
period prior to termination.

(d) Purchaser and Company shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, as soon as possible, confirmation from the Cognizant
Agency that they will not recommend that Companys or any of its Subsidiaries
security clearances be revoked, suspended or downgraded as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Company shall and shall
cause its employees to make all filings or notifications or such other actions
as are necessary or appropriate in order to prevent the security clearances of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and their respective employees, from
being revoked, suspended or downgraded.

(e) Each party hereto shall make an appropriate filing, if necessary,
pursuant to the HSR Act (and any applicable foreign antitrust laws) with

Business Days after the date hereof, and shall supply as promptly as  



 

54  practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act (and any applicable foreign antitrust laws). Without limitation of the
foregoing, the parties hereto and their respective Affiliates shall not enter
into any agreement with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, except with the prior written consent of
the other parties hereto. The parties shall use their Reasonable Best Efforts
to obtain early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR
Act. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of Parent,
Purchaser or any of their Affiliates shall be required to consent to any
divestiture or other structural or conduct relief in order to obtain clearance
from any Governmental Authority and none of Parent, Purchaser or any of their
Affiliates shall be obligated to contest, administratively or in court, any
ruling, order or other action of any Governmental Authority or private party
respecting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) The Company agrees that no later than seventeen (17) months following the
Closing, Constella Futures Nigeria Limited will be owned by Constella Futures
Holding, LLC and Constella Futures International, LLC.

(g) The Company agrees to take, or to cause to be taken, any and all actions
(including without limitation consents by the directors, managers, officers,

capitalization and the minute books and records of the proceedings of each
Subsidiary are true, correct and complete in all material respects.

6.15 _Termination of Operating Agreement_. The Sellers hereby agree that, upon
the Closing, the Operating Agreement shall be amended and restated without any
further liability of the Company to any Seller in their capacity as a Member,
and no Seller shall have any rights against, or obligations to, the Company or
Purchaser as a Member under the Operating Agreement; provided that, solely as
among the Sellers, the provisions of Articles III and IV of the Operating
Agreement shall continue to govern as to allocation of profits and losses and
distributions through the Closing.

6.16 _Earn-Outs_. (a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (i) the
Company may, in the future, owe Earn-Outs to the applicable third parties
identified on _Schedule EO_ (each, an " _Earn-Out Seller_ ") pursuant to
written agreements with the Earn-Out Sellers which agreements are identified
on _Schedule 3.13(a)(vii)_ (each, an " _Earn-Out Agreement_ ") and (ii) except
as otherwise expressly set forth in  _Section 6.16(d)_, the Earn-Outs, if
and when due, shall be satisfied in full from the Earn-Out Escrow Account.

(b) As promptly as reasonably practical, but in any event at least fifteen
(15) Business Days before the date (the " _Earn-Out Due Date_ ") that the
Company is required to provide its calculation of the Earn-Out payment (each
such payment, an " _Earn-Out Payment_ ") to the applicable Earn-Out Seller,
the Purchaser shall provide to or make available to the Seller Representative
all of the books, records and other documents  



 

55  (including work papers) within the possession of the Parent or its
Subsidiaries necessary for Seller Representative or his agents to calculate
the Earn-Out Payment. Except to the extent that disclosure is required by the
applicable Earn-Out Agreement, all such books, records and other documents
(including work papers) shall be treated as Confidential Information pursuant
to _Section 6.8_. At least five (5) Business Days before the Earn-Out Due
Date, the Seller Representative shall provide to the Purchaser its calculation
of the applicable Earn-Out Payment (the " _Earn-Out Calculation_ ")
accompanied by information sufficient to support the calculation of such
Earn-Out Payment, which shall not show an Earn-Out Payment that is greater
than the maximum amount that can be owed at that time to the applicable Earn-
Out Seller pursuant to the applicable Earn-Out Agreement. No later than the
Earn-Out Due Date, the Seller Representative shall provide to the applicable
Earn-Out Seller its calculation of the applicable Earn-Out Payment accompanied
by information required to be provided pursuant to the applicable Earn-Out
Agreement. The Seller Representative and the applicable Earn-Out Seller shall
then proceed to determine the amount of such Earn-Out Payment pursuant to the
procedures set forth the applicable Earn-Out Agreement.

(c) Subject to _Section 6.16(d)_ and _Section 6.16(e)_, upon the Earn-Out
Seller and the Seller Representative agreeing in writing in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Purchaser that the Earn-Out Calculation accurately reflects
the Earn-Out Payment required under the applicable Earn-Out Agreement (such
agreed upon amount, the " _Agreed Earn-Out Payment Amount_ ") or, in the
absence of such agreement, upon the determination of the amount of such Earn-
Out Payment pursuant to the procedures set forth in the applicable Earn-Out
Agreement (the " _Determined Earn-Out Payment Amount_ "), then the Seller
Representative and the Purchaser shall execute written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to release (i) the Agreed Earn-Out Payment Amount or the
Determined Earn-Out Payment Amount to the applicable Earn-Out Seller and (ii)
the amount by which the Earn-Out payment amount set forth on _Schedule EO_
with respect to such Earn-Out Payment exceeds the Agreed Earn-Out Payment
Amount (or, as the case may be, the Determined Earn-Out Payment Amount) to
Sellers and Option Holders pursuant to their Purchase Price Pro Rata
Percentages, together with interest allocable to such amount.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.16(c)_, if the
Company has the right, in the sole discretion of the Purchaser, to offset any
indemnity or other claims against the applicable Earn-Out Seller on the date
that the applicable Earn-Out Payment is to be made (the amount of any offset,
the " _Offset Amount_ "), upon the written request of the Purchaser to the
Seller Representative, the joint written instructions of the Purchaser and
the Seller Representative shall provide that the Escrow Agent release (i) the
Agreed Earn-Out Payment Amount (or, as the case may be, the Determined Earn-
Out Payment Amount) less the Offset Amount to the applicable Earn-Out Seller,
(ii) the Offset Amount to the Purchaser and (iii) the amount by which the
Earn-Out payment amount set forth on _Schedule EO_ with respect to such Earn-
Out Payment exceeds the Agreed Earn-Out Payment Amount (or, as the case may
be, the Determined Earn-Out Payment) to Sellers and Option Holders pursuant to
their Purchase Price Pro Rata Percentages, together with interest allocable to
such amount. If Purchaser requests that Seller Representative execute joint
written instructions which include the payment of an Offset Amount to the
Purchaser, then Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller
Representative, Sellers and the directors of the Company as of the date hereof
against and from and in respect of any and all Losses which are incurred by
virtue of or result from any claim by the applicable Earn-Out Seller that the
Offset Amount should have been paid to the applicable Earn-Out Seller.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.16(c)_ and
_Section 6.16(d)_, in connection with any Earn-Out Payment related to the
Earn-Out Agreement identified as Item 1 on _Schedule 3.13(a)_ (the " _LRA
Agreement_ "), unless all such amounts that would otherwise be paid to the
applicable Earn-Out Seller are paid to Purchaser as Offset Amounts, an amount
up to the first $1 million that would otherwise be paid to such Earn-Out
Seller shall be paid into an escrow account pursuant to LRA Agreement and the
documents executed in connection therewith. In such circumstances, Purchaser
and Seller Representative agree to execute joint written instructions that
include the payment of this $1 million into escrow.



 

56 (f) If the Earn-Out Seller and the Seller Representative do not agree
in writing in a form reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser that the Earn-Out
Calculation accurately reflects the Earn-Out Payment required under the
applicable Earn-Out Agreement, then all such disputed amounts shall remain in
the Earn-Out Escrow Fund until they do so agree or until such disputed
amounts are directed to be disbursed pursuant to the procedures in the
applicable Earn-Out Agreement.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.16_,
Purchaser and Parent acknowledge that the Seller Representative shall have the
right to negotiate a cash settlement of any Earn-Out following the date
hereof (whether prior or subsequent to the Closing), provided that Purchaser
approve all documents that any Purchaser Party must enter into in connection
therewith (such approval not to unreasonably be withheld) and no cash
settlement amount in connection with any individual Earn-Out shall exceed the
amount of the applicable Earn-Out listed on _Schedule EO_. In the event of any
such settlement, the Seller Representative and Purchaser shall execute
and deliver to Escrow Agent a joint written instruction to pay, in
immediately available funds, (i) the cash settlement amount with respect to
such Earn-Out to the applicable Earn-Out Seller and (ii) to Sellers and Option
Holders pursuant to their Purchase Price Pro Rata Percentages, the amount by
which the Earn-Out listed on _Schedule EO_ exceeds the settlement amount for
such Earn-Out, together with interests applicable to such amount.

of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date (the " _Effective Time_ ").

10\. TERMINATION.

10.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing Date:

(a) by mutual written agreement of Sellers and Purchaser;



 

61 (b) by Purchaser, if Sellers or Company have committed a material breach of
any provision of this Agreement that has not been cured within fifteen (15)
days of written notice of such material breach;

(c) by Company and Sellers, if Purchaser has committed a material breach of
any provision of this Agreement that has not been cured within fifteen (15)
days of written notice of such material breach;

 

(d) by either Purchaser or Seller Representative if an order, decree, ruling,
judgment or injunction has been entered by any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
limiting or prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling, judgment or injunction has
become final and non-appealable; or

(e) by Purchaser or Seller, upon written notice to the other party, if the
Closing has not occurred before 5 p.m., Fairfax, VA time, on August 20, 2007,
other than as a result of the terminating partys breach of this Agreement.

10.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated as provided in
_Section 10.1_, then all further obligations under this Agreement shall
terminate and no party hereto shall have any liability in respect of the
termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that the confidentiality
obligations of Purchaser, Parent, Sellers and Company described in _Section
6.8_ will survive any such termination; provided further that no such
termination will relieve Purchaser, Parent, Sellers or Company from liability
for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set
forth in this Agreement prior to such termination and in the event of such
breach the parties hereto shall be entitled to exercise any and all remedies
available under Law or equity in accordance with this Agreement.

11\. INDEMNIFICATION.

11.1 _Indemnification by the Sellers_.

(a) Sellers (pursuant to this Agreement) and Option Holders (pursuant to
their respective Option Amendment and Release Agreements), up to their
respective Purchase Price Pro Rata Percentages of the Escrow Account in

their respective Common Pro Rata Percentages of each applicable Loss in
connection with payments that are not from the Escrow Account, shall indemnify
and hold Purchaser, Parent, their Affiliates and Company (from and after
the Closing) and each of their respective shareholders, trustees, directors,
officers, employees and agents (collectively, the "Purchaser Parties")
harmless against and from and in respect of any and all Losses which are
incurred by virtue of or result from (i) the inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty made by Company in this Agreement or any
certificate executed in connection herewith, or (ii) the non-fulfillment by
the Company of any unwaived covenant, obligation or agreement required to be
performed by it prior to the Closing, in each case as contained in this
Agreement or in any of the other Transaction Documents or in any document or
instrument delivered at the Closing pursuant hereto or thereto.

(b) Sellers, up to their respective Common Pro Rata Percentages of the Escrow
Account in connection with payments that are from the Escrow Account, shall
indemnify and hold the Purchaser Parties harmless against and from and in

(i) the inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by any
Seller in this Agreement or any certificate executed in connection herewith or
(ii) the non-fulfillment or breach of any unwaived covenant, obligation or
agreement, in each case as made by or on behalf of any Seller in this
Agreement or in any of the other Transaction Documents or in any document or
instrument delivered at the Closing pursuant hereto or thereto.

(c) Each Seller, in connection with payments that are not from the Escrow
Account, shall indemnify and hold the Purchaser Parties harmless against and
from and in respect of any and all Losses not to be paid from the Escrow
Account, which are incurred by virtue of or result from (i) the inaccuracy in
or  



 

62  breach of any representation or warranty made by such Seller in this
Agreement or any certificate executed in connection herewith or (ii) the non-
fulfillment or breach of any unwaived covenant, obligation or agreement, in
each case as made by or on behalf of such Seller in this Agreement or in any
of the other Transaction Documents or in any document or instrument delivered
at the Closing pursuant hereto or thereto.

(d) For the sake of clarity and the avoidance of doubt, two examples of
the Sellers indemnification obligations are set forth on _Schedule 11.1(d)_.

11.2  _Indemnification by the Purchaser and Parent_. The Purchaser and
Parent, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify Company (prior to the
Closing, to the extent the Closing does not occur) and each Seller, its
Affiliates and each of their respective shareholders, trustees, directors,
officers, employees and agents (collectively, the "Seller Parties") harmless
against and from and in respect of any and all Losses which are incurred by
virtue of or result from (a) the inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty made by Purchaser or Parent in this Agreement or
any certificate executed in connection herewith or (b) the non-fulfillment or
breach of any unwaived covenant, obligation or agreement, in each case as
made by or on behalf of the Purchaser or Parent in this Agreement or in any of
the other Transaction Documents or in any document or instrument delivered at
the Closing pursuant hereto or thereto.

11.3 _Special Indemnities_. Sellers (pursuant to this Agreement) and Option
Holders (pursuant to their respective Option Amendment and Release
Agreements), up to their respective Purchase Price Pro Rata Percentages of the
Escrow Account in connection with payments that are from the Escrow Account,
and Sellers, up to their respective Common Pro Rata Percentages of each
applicable Loss in connection with payments that are not from the Escrow
Account, shall indemnify the Purchaser Parties for any Losses related to (a)
the payment of the Tax Refund to the Sellers and Option Holders pursuant to
Section 2.8 followed by the subsequent obligation of the Company to return all
or part of the Tax Refund to any Taxing Authority, (b) except in connection
with claims related to Offset Amounts paid the Purchaser, the payment
of Earn-Outs, (c) the matters set on (i) subject to the next sentence,

the failure to obtain any consent or approval listed on _Schedule 3.6_ or

do business in connection with the matters set forth on _Schedule 3.1(b)_ ,
item N, subsection (a) shall be part of a Special Items Indemnity Claim
related thereto



 

63 11.4 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. Notwithstanding any right
of the Purchaser and Parent fully to investigate the affairs of Company and
Sellers and notwithstanding any Knowledge of facts determined or determinable
by Purchaser pursuant to such investigation or right of investigation,
Purchaser has the right to rely fully upon the representations and warranties
of each of Sellers and Company contained in this Agreement. All
representations and warranties of the parties hereto contained in this
Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and the Closing
hereunder, and, after the Closing (a) the representations and warranties made
in _Sections 3.1, 3.2(a), 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3_, and any and all
claims based upon fraud shall survive indefinitely; (b) the representations
and warranties made in _Sections 3.17, 3.19, 3.21, 3.29 and 3.33_ shall
survive until fifteen (15) days after the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitation; and (c) all other representations and warranties shall survive
until the date eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date. Each
representation and warranty described in clauses (a), (b) and (c), and any
related indemnity claim or right, shall further survive if the party
asserting such claim shall have in good faith provided written notice of the
breach of or inaccuracy in such representation or warranty on or prior to the
applicable date referenced in clauses (a), (b) and (c) to the party against
which such claim is asserted, identifying such breach or inaccuracy in
reasonable detail. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive the
execution and delivery hereof and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby indefinitely.

11.5 _Certain Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_.

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this _Section 11_, the
Purchaser Parties and Seller Parties shall not be entitled to receive any
indemnification payments under _Section 11.1 or 11.2_ in connection with the
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty, until the
aggregate amount of Losses incurred by the Purchaser Parties or Seller
Parties, as the case may be, exceed Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000)
(the " _Deductible Amount_ "), and thereafter, the Sellers or the Purchaser
and Parent, as the case may be, shall only be liable for Losses greater than
the Deductible Amount.

(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this _Section 11_, the maximum
aggregate amount of indemnification payments under this _Section 11_ in
connection with the inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty
which the Purchaser Parties or Seller Parties shall be entitled to receive,
upon the triggering of any indemnification obligation hereunder, shall not
exceed Nineteen Million Five Hundred Thirty Seven Thousand Five Hundred
Dollars ($19,537,500).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any
indemnification payments based upon or any Losses related to (i) Special Items
Indemnity Claims, (ii) adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section
2.4_, and/or (iii) any and all breaches of the representations and warranties
in _Section 3.17_, _3.19_ , _3.29_ or _3.33_ or set forth in _Section
11.4(a)_ shall not be subject to either the Deductible Amount set forth in
_Section 11.5(a)_ or the maximum aggregate indemnification limitation set
forth in _Section 11.5(b)_ and shall not be used in calculating whether the
maximum aggregate indemnification limitation set forth in _Section 11.5(b)_
has been met, provided that any indemnification payments based upon or any
Losses related to the foregoing shall not exceed the Purchase Price.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any
indemnification payments based upon or any Losses related to any and all
claims of fraud shall not be subject to either the Deductible Amount set forth
in  _Section 11.5(a)_ or the maximum aggregate indemnification limitation
set forth in _Section 11.5(b))_ and shall not be used in calculating whether
the maximum aggregate indemnification limitation set forth in  _Section
11.5(b)_ has been met.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum
liability of any Seller under this _Section 11_ shall not exceed the Seller
Payment received by such Seller. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the maximum liability of any Option Holder under this 
_Section 11_ shall not exceed the Escrow Account (including any interest or
other increases thereon) that such Option Holder is deemed to have contributed
to the Escrow Account.



 

64 (f) Except in connection with certain adjustments to the Purchase
Price pursuant to _Section 2.4_ (which explicitly provides for certain
amounts, at the option of the Purchaser, to be paid directly by Sellers), any
indemnity claims of Purchaser Parties hereunder for breach of this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement that are finally determined to be due and owing by
the Seller Parties shall first be satisfied through disbursements from the
Escrow Account.

11.6 _Defense of Claims_. In the case of any claim for indemnification under
_Sections 11.1, 11.2 or 11.3_ arising from a claim of a third party
(including the IRS or any other Governmental Authority), an indemnified party
shall give prompt written notice and, subject to the following sentence, in no
case later than twenty (20) days after the indemnified partys receipt of
notice of such claim, to the indemnifying party of any claim, suit or demand
of which such indemnified party has Knowledge and as to which it may request
indemnification hereunder, which notice shall describe such claim in
reasonable detail. The failure to give such notice shall not, however,
relieve the indemnifying party of its indemnification obligations except to
the extent that the indemnifying party is actually harmed thereby. The
indemnifying party shall have the right to defend and to direct the
defense against any such claim, suit or demand in its name and at its
expense, and with counsel selected by the indemnifying party unless such
claim, suit or demand seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against
the indemnified party or alleges criminal misconduct or seeks damages greater
than the amounts that the Sellers are required to indemnify under this
Agreement; provided, however, the indemnifying party shall not have the right
to defend or direct the defense of any such claim, suit or demand if it
refuses to acknowledge fully its obligations to the indemnified party or
contests, in whole or in part, its indemnification obligations therefor
(subject to the limitations set forth herein). If the indemnifying party
elects, and is entitled, to compromise or defend such claim, it shall within
twenty (20) days (or sooner, if the nature of the claim so requires) notify
the indemnified party of its intent to do so, and the indemnified party shall,
at the request and expense of the indemnifying party, cooperate in the
defense of such claim, suit or demand; provided that the indemnified party
shall pay the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by it. If the
indemnifying party elects not to compromise or defend such claim, fails to
notify the indemnified party of its election as herein provided or refuses to
acknowledge or contests its obligation to indemnify under this Agreement, the
indemnified party may pay, compromise or defend such claim ( _provided_ that
the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in the defense
thereof at its own expense and with counsel selected by it). The indemnifying
party shall have no indemnification obligations with respect to any
such claim, suit or demand which shall be settled by the indemnified party
without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party shall not be required to
refrain from paying any claim which has matured by a court judgment or decree,
unless an appeal is duly taken therefrom and exercise thereof has been stayed,
nor shall it be required to refrain from paying any claim where the delay in
paying such claim would result in the foreclosure of a lien upon any of the
property or assets then held by the indemnified party or where any delay in
payment would cause the indemnified party material economic loss. The
indemnifying partys right to direct the defense shall include the right to
compromise or enter into an agreement settling any claim by a third party;
provided that no such compromise or settlement shall obligate the indemnified
party to agree to any settlement which requires the taking of any action by
the indemnified party other than the delivery of a release, except with the
consent of the indemnified party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed). The indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the
defense of any claim, suit or demand with counsel selected by it subject to
the indemnifying partys right to direct the defense. The fees and
disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified
party; provided, however, that, in the case of any claim, suit or demand which
seeks injunctive or other equitable relief against the indemnified party, the
fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of the
indemnifying party.



 

65 11.7 _Non-Third Party Claims_. Any claim which does not result from a third
party claim shall be asserted by a written notice to the other party or
parties and shall be identified as an "DIRECT INDEMNITY CLAIM NOTICE." The
recipient of such notice shall have a period of thirty (30) days after
receipt of such notice within which to respond thereto. During such thirty
(30) day period, the recipient shall have the right to cure any applicable
breach of this Agreement. If the recipient does not respond within such thirty
(30) days and does not cure the applicable breach, the recipient shall be
deemed to have accepted responsibility for the Losses set forth in such notice
and shall have no further right to contest the validity of such notice. If the
recipient responds within such thirty (30) days after the receipt of the
notice and rejects such claim in whole or in part, the party delivering shall
be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to it under contract or
applicable Law subject, in each case, to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement, including this _Section 11_.

11.8  _Liability of the Company_. Purchaser and Parent shall not be required
after the Closing to make any claim against Company in respect of any
representation, warranty, covenant or any other obligation of Company to
Purchaser or Parent hereunder or under any other Transaction Document to
which Company is a party. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Purchaser and Parent retain, and nothing contained in this _Section 11.8_
shall in any way waive or limit, their rights to bring claims against Sellers
in respect of a breach of any representation or warranty of Company or any
Seller, or the non-fulfillment by Seller of any covenant or agreement, in each
case to the extent described in _Section 11.1_. 

11.9 _Tax Treatment_. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, all
indemnification payments shall constitute adjustments to the Purchase Price
for all Tax purposes, and no party shall take any position inconsistent with
such characterization.

11.10 _Determination of Adverse Consequences_. For the purposes of this
_Section 11_, with respect to any claim for indemnification, indemnifiable
Losses shall be reduced by (a) any amounts related to such Losses already
reserved on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet for the purposes of computing
Actual Net Assets, (b) any amounts actually received by the claiming party in
respect of claims under any third party indemnification agreements (including
any agreement relating to the acquisitions of Prior Acquisition Entities), and
(c) to the extent such Losses relate to the payment of Taxes pursuant to the
Special Items Indemnity Claims set forth in _Sections 11.3(c)(i) or (iii)_ ,
the amount of any Tax credits that are under applicable Laws used by the
Purchaser Parties to reduce United States federal income tax in the year that
the payment of such Taxes is due. Upon making payment in full in respect of
any claim for indemnification, an indemnifying party shall, to the extent of
such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the claiming party against any
third party in respect of such claim; provided that the indemnifying party
hereby agrees that it will not file an legal action against any current
customer or current subcontractor of the Parent, the Company or their
Affiliates. In addition, Losses for which indemnification is provided pursuant
to  _Section 11_ of this Agreement shall be net of any amounts that are
actually recovered by the Purchaser Parties under any insurance policy with
respect to such Losses (and any such recovery related to Losses for which the
Purchaser Parties have previously been indemnified shall be repaid to the
Seller Parties, subject to the limitations set forth in _subsection (i)_
below); provided, however, that (i) amounts actually recovered by the
Purchaser Parties or Seller Parties under any insurance policy with respect
to such Losses shall be net of the cost of collection thereof, any retroactive
premium adjustment on account of such Losses, and the present value of any
increases in insurance premiums on the account of such Losses, (ii) Purchaser
Parties shall be obligated to use only the same efforts they would use to
pursue collection under insurance policies for themselves, consistent with
their past practices, (iii) any obligation to seek insurance coverage shall
not apply to any self-insurance programs or policies, (iv) if insurance is
available under the policy described in the definition of Seller Expenses, the
parties will look to coverage first under that policy, and (v) in connection
with claims involving less than $500,000, no party, under any circumstances,
shall be obligated to pursue litigation against the applicable insurer.



 

66 11.11 _No Waiver_. The foregoing indemnification provisions in this _Section
11_ (including the provisions of _Section 11.4_ and _Section 11.5_) do not
(a) waive or affect any claims for fraud or willful misconduct to which any
party may be entitled, or shall relieve or limit the liability of any party
from any liability arising out of or resulting from fraud or willful
misconduct in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or in connection with the delivery of any of the documents referred to herein
and (b) waive or affect any equitable remedies to which any party may be
entitled.

11.12 _No Right of Contribution_. Sellers shall have no right to seek
contribution from Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Purchaser or Parent with
respect to all or any part of any of a Sellers indemnification obligations
under this _Section 11_.

11.13 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as set forth in the next sentence, the
remedies provided for in this _Section 11_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of the parties hereto and their Affiliates and their respective
shareholders, trustees, officers, directors, employees,
agents, representatives, successors and assigns for any breach of or
inaccuracy in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. The foregoing shall not limit any partys
rights related to claims of fraud or willful misconduct or to seek equitable
remedies (which may be enforced without the posting of a bond or other
security) and shall not limit any claims related to the Transaction Documents
other than this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. 

11.14 _Other Indemnifications Matters_.

(a) Mr. Holzworth has full and complete control over Holzworth Holdings, Inc.,
a Seller, which is a substantial equity holder of the Company. As such, Mr.
Holzworth will receive material benefit from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. By execution of this
Agreement, Mr. Holzworth acknowledges that he receives a material benefit
under the terms and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, and accordingly, Mr. Holzworth
hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees full and prompt
performance (and, if applicable, payment) of the obligations of Holzworth
Holdings, Inc. under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to
which it is a party.

(b) The Trust is a substantial equity holder in Holzworth Holdings, Inc., a
Seller, which is a substantial equity holder of the Company. As such, the
Trust will receive material benefit from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. By execution of this Agreement,
the Trust acknowledges that it receives a material benefit under the terms
and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents, and accordingly, the Trust hereby absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees full and prompt performance (and,
if applicable, payment) of 15.5% of the obligations of Holzworth Holdings,
Inc. under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a
party for a period of three years. The conclusion of the foregoing three year
period shall not effect in any manner the guarantee of Mr. Holzworth set
forth in Section 11.14(a).

(c) Charles G. Lineberry and Cathy Frieden Lineberry (the " _LRA Individuals_
") are substantial equity holders of Sunrise Therapeutics, LLC, which is a
Seller. As such, the LRA Individuals will receive material benefit from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents. By execution of this Agreement, the LRA Individuals each
acknowledge that  



 

67  each will receive a material benefit under the terms and conditions of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, and accordingly, each hereby absolutely, unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees full and prompt performance (and, if applicable,
payments) of the obligations of Sunrise Therapeutics, LLC under this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party.

(d) Holzworth Holdings, Inc. has transferred Company Equity to the Charity
Sellers immediately prior to the date hereof. By execution of this Agreement,
(i) Mr. Holzworth and the Trust each acknowledge and agree that if the Charity
Sellers would otherwise be liable for any indemnity obligations under this
Agreement in an amount greater than the portion of the Escrow Account
(including any interest or other increases thereon) that the Charity Sellers
are deemed to have contributed to the Escrow Account (such greater amounts,
the " _Additional Charity Seller Indemnity Obligations_ "), then each of
Holzworth Holdings, Inc., Mr. Holzworth and the Trust will be absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably liable for the full and prompt performance
(and, if applicable, payments) of the Additional Charity Seller Indemnity
Obligations and (ii) the Purchaser and Parent agree that they will only seek
indemnity in connection with the Additional Charity Seller Indemnity
Obligations from Holzworth Holdings, Inc., Mr. Holzworth and the Trust and
not seek indemnity in connection with the Additional Charity Seller Indemnity
Obligations from the Charity Sellers, provided, however, that the Trust shall
only be liable for 15.5% of any obligations of Holzworth Holdings, Inc. under
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party for
a period of three years. The conclusion of the foregoing three year period
shall not effect in any manner the guarantee of Mr. Holzworth set forth in
this Section 11.14(d).

11.15 _Prohibited Losses_. No Purchaser Party shall pay any Taxes described
in the Special Items Indemnity Claims set forth in _Sections 11.3(c)(i) or
(iii)_ and seek indemnity for Losses related to such Taxes, unless such
Purchaser Party determines, in a good faith, that such Taxes are due
under applicable Law.

12\. POST CLOSING MATTERS. Following the Closing Date, the parties agree as
follows:

12.1 _Cooperation_. In case at any time after the Closing any further action
is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement each of the parties
will take such further action (including the execution and delivery of such
further instruments and documents) as any other party reasonably may request,
all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting party (unless the
requesting party is entitled to indemnification therefor under _Section 11_
hereof). Sellers acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing
Purchaser will be entitled to possession of and Sellers will provide to
Purchaser all documents, books, records (including Tax records), agreements,
corporate/company minute books and financial data of any sort relating to
Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that Sellers shall have full
access to such records during business hours upon reasonable prior notice, so
long as such records are to be used for a reasonable purpose (other than those
records which are related to matters involving a dispute, suit or claim
between or among parties). 

12.2 _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as any party actively
is contesting or defending against any action, suit, proceeding, hearing,
investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand in connection with (i)any
transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii)any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act, or transaction that existed on or prior to
the Closing Date involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries, each of the
other parties will cooperate with such party and such partys counsel in the
contest or defense, make available their personnel, and provide such testimony
and access to their books and records as shall be reasonably necessary in
connection with the contest or defense, all at the sole cost  



 

68  and expense of the contesting or defending party (unless the contesting or
defending party is entitled to indemnification therefor under  _Section 11_
hereof). This provision shall be inapplicable to any direct claims between the
Sellers or their representatives or Affiliates on the one hand and the
Company, the Purchaser, the Parent or their representatives or Affiliates
on the other hand.

12.3 _Transition_. Neither any Seller nor Company will take any action that
is designed or intended to have the effect of discouraging any lessor,
licensor, customer, supplier, or other business associate of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries from maintaining the same business relationships with Company
or its Subsidiaries after the Closing as it maintained with Company or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. Each Seller will refer all customer
inquiries relating to the business of Company or its Subsidiaries to Company
from and after the Closing.

12.4 _Confidentiality_. _Section 6.8_ includes certain obligations of the
Sellers to protect Confidential Information. If any Seller is requested or
required (by oral question or request for information or documents in any
legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or
similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, such Seller will
notify Purchaser promptly of the request or requirement so that Purchaser may
seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions
of this _Section 12.4_. If, in the absence of a protective order or the
receipt of a waiver hereunder, a Seller is, on the advice of counsel,
compelled to disclose any Confidential Information to any tribunal or else
stand liable for contempt, such Seller may disclose the Confidential
Information to the tribunal; provided, however, that such Seller shall use
its Reasonable Best Efforts to obtain, at the request and expense of
Purchaser, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be
disclosed as Purchaser shall designate. The foregoing provisions shall not
apply to any Confidential Information which is generally available to the
public immediately prior to the time of disclosure. 

12.5 _Books and Records_. Each party agrees that it will reasonably cooperate
with and make available (or cause to be made available) to the other party,
during normal business hours, all books and records, information and employees
(without substantial disruption of employment) retained, remaining in
existence or continuing to be employed after the Closing Date which are
necessary or useful in connection with any Tax inquiry, audit, or dispute, any
litigation or investigation or any other matter requiring any such books and
records, information or employees for any reasonable business purpose (a
"Permitted Use"). The party requesting any such books and records, information
or employees shall bear all of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably
incurred in connection with providing such books and records, information or
employees. All information received pursuant to this _Section 12.5_ shall be
kept confidential pursuant to _Section 12.4_ (which shall continue to apply
to this extent following the Closing Date) by the party receiving it, except
to the extent that disclosure is reasonably necessary in connection with any
Permitted Use. This provision shall be inapplicable to any direct claims
between the Sellers or their representatives or Affiliates on the one hand
and the Company, the Purchaser, the Parent or their representatives or
Affiliates on the other hand.

12.6 _Cooperation and Records Retention_. Company and Sellers on the one hand
and Purchaser and Parent on the other hand each shall (i) provide the other
with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by either of them in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, audit, or other examination
by any taxing authority or judicial or administrative proceedings relating to
liability for any Taxes; (ii) retain and provide the other with any records or
other information that may be relevant to such Tax Return, audit or
examination, proceeding or determination; (iii) provide the other with any
final determination of any such audit or examination, proceeding, or
determination that affects any amount required to be shown on any Tax Return
of the other for any period; and (iv) cooperate with respect to closing the
books of Company and filing a tax return for Company as of the Closing Date.
The party requesting any such assistance or information shall bear all of the
out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
providing such assistance or information.



 

69 12.7 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date_. Sellers shall prepare or
cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for
Company for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date which are filed
after the Closing Date. No later than twenty (20) days prior to filing,
Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser all such Tax Returns and any related work
papers and shall permit Purchaser to review and comment on each such Tax
Return and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably
requested by Purchaser. Sellers shall timely pay to the appropriate Taxing
Authority any Taxes of the Company with respect to such periods to the extent
such Taxes were not included as a liability in the calculation of Actual Net
Assets. The costs, fees and expenses related to the preparation of such Tax
Returns shall be estimated and accrued as a liability of Company for purposes
of calculating Net Assets and the amount estimated and accrued shall be paid
by Company.

(b) _Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date_. To the
extent that any Tax Returns of Company relate to any Tax periods which begin
before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
prepare or cause to be prepared in a manner consistent with the prior Tax
Returns of Company and file or cause to be filed any such Tax Returns.
Purchaser shall permit the Sellers to review and comment on each such Tax
Return described in the preceding sentence at least twenty (20) days prior to
filing such Tax Returns and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as
are reasonably requested by the Sellers. Any Taxes of Company with respect to
the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date, to the extent such
Taxes were not included as a liability in the calculation of Actual Net
Assets, shall be paid in cash by all Sellers. The costs, fees and expenses
related to the preparation of such Tax Returns shall be paid by Purchaser or
Company. For purposes of this Section, in the case of any Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a taxable period that includes
but does not end on the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax which relates
to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in
the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or
receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period, and (ii) in the
case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts be deemed equal
to the amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on
the Closing Date. Any credits relating to a taxable period that begins before
and ends after the Closing Date shall be taken into account as though the
relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date. All determinations
necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a
manner consistent with GAAP and the prior practice of Company. 

(c) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax Sharing Agreements or similar agreements
with respect to or involving Company shall be terminated as of the Closing
Date and, after the Closing Date, Company shall not be bound thereby or have
any liability thereunder.

(d) _Covenant Regarding Code Section 754 Election_. To the extent the Company
has not made an election under Code Section 754, or the Operating Agreement
does not provide for such an election, the Sellers hereby agree to take any
and all actions, as may be requested by Parent or Purchaser, to timely make
the election under Code Section 754\.

12.8 _Market Stand-Off_. Company and Sellers acknowledge that the existence of
this Agreement and the negotiations with respect hereto may be considered
material non-public information. Company and Sellers shall not, and shall
notify in writing those Companys officers, directors and affiliates and those
of the Companys employees who have knowledge or become aware of the
existence  



 

70  of this Agreement and/or the negotiations with respect hereto not to,
purchase, sell, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise transfer, or grant or acquire
any option or other right to purchase, any securities of Parent from the date
hereof through the third Business Day after the public announcement by Parent
of the existence of this Purchase Agreement and its subject matter.

12.9 _Employee Matters_.

(a) [Reserved]

(b) Attached as _Schedule 12.9(b)_ is a list of Company employees who will
receive Retention Agreements that will provide for the grant of non-qualified
stock options to purchase Parent common stock, cash retention packages or
both (the "Parent Retention Packages"). _Schedule 12.9(b)_ sets forth the
number of option shares and/or the cash retention amount applicable to each
such employee. The exercise price of any option grants will be calculated in
accordance with Parents standard practices.

12.10  _Release and Covenant Not to Sue_. Subject to and effective as of the
Closing, each Seller hereby releases and discharges the Company and its
Subsidiaries from and against any and all claims, demands, obligations,
agreements, debts and liabilities whatsoever, whether known or unknown, both
at law and in equity, which any of the Sellers now has, has ever had or may
hereafter have against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising on or
prior to the Closing Date or on account of or arising out of any matter
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, including, but not limited to, any
rights to indemnification or reimbursement from the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether pursuant to its Articles of Organization or Operating
Agreement, Contract or otherwise, and whether or not relating to claims
pending on, or asserted after, the Closing Date. From and after the Closing,
each Seller hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly or
indirectly, asserting any claim or demand, or commencing or causing to be
commenced, any proceeding of any kind against the Company and its
Subsidiaries, based upon any matter purported to be released hereby.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (a) none of the
Sellers releases, discharges or waives any claim that he has, has ever had or
may hereafter have against the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
the Company and its Subsidiaries) and each of the Sellers hereby expressly
reserves any such claims against the Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than
the Company and its Subsidiaries) and (b) Sunrise Therapeutics, LLC does not
release any rights or claims related to or in connection with the LRA
Agreement. 

13\. EXPENSES. Except as otherwise expressly set forth elsewhere in this
Agreement, Purchaser and Parent shall bear their own legal and other fees and
expenses incurred in connection with its negotiating, executing and performing
this Agreement, including any related brokers or finders fees, and Company
and Sellers shall bear their respective legal and other fees and expenses
incurred in connection with their negotiating, executing and performing this
Agreement, including any related brokers or finders fees, for periods on or
before the Closing Date in accordance with  _Section 2.2(c)_. Sellers shall
bear their own legal and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement after the Closing, including any related brokers or finders
fees, subject to the provisions of this Agreement. Sellers shall pay all
applicable Taxes, if any, which are due as a result of the transfer of the
Company Equity in accordance herewith.

14\. AMENDMENT; BENEFIT AND ASSIGNABILITY. This Agreement may be amended only
by the execution and delivery of a written instrument by Sellers, the Company
(prior to Closing), and Purchaser. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, and except as expressly provided otherwise
herein, no other person or entity shall have any right (whether third
party beneficiary or otherwise) hereunder. Sellers and Seller Representative,
Parent and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that Purchaser or Parent or both
may merge with another business entity after Closing, and any successor  



 

71  business entity will have all of the rights and remedies of Purchaser or
Parent hereunder, as applicable. This Agreement (and the parties respective
rights hereunder) may not be assigned by any party without the prior written
consent of the other parties; provided, however, that Purchaser and Parent may
assign all or any portion of this Agreement to any Affiliate of Purchaser or
Parent, provided that Purchaser or Parent shall remain obligated for the
payment of the Purchase Price and the performance of this Agreement and
provided further that WCP may assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to any Affiliate of WCP to which WCP transfers the Company Equity
held by it, so long as such transferee assumes WCPs obligations hereunder.

contrary: (i) the failure of any party at any time to require performance by
the other of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect such partys
right thereafter to enforce the same; (ii) no waiver by any party of any

part of this Agreement) and the Transaction Documents constitute the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
referenced herein, and supersede and terminate any prior agreements

specific provisions of the Agreement.

20\. EXHIBITS AND DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES. The Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules
to this Agreement are a material part of this Agreement.

21\. SEVERABILITY. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this
Agreement should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect,
the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions will
not in any way be affected or impaired. Any illegal or unenforceable term

extent necessary to bring such term within the provisions of applicable Law
and such term, as so modified, and the balance of this Agreement shall then be

22\. CHOICE OF LAW.

(a) _Choice of Law_. This Agreement is to be construed and governed by the
Laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to principles of
conflicts of laws). Parent, Purchaser, Company and each Seller irrevocably
agree that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement may be brought in any Delaware state court or in the United
States District Court, for the District of Delaware (or in any court in
which appeal from such courts may be taken), and each party agrees not to
assert, by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise, in any such action, suit
or proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction
of such court, that the action, suit or proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action, suit or proceeding is
improper or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be
enforced in or by such court, and hereby agrees not to challenge such
jurisdiction or venue by reason of any offsets or counterclaims in any such
action, suit or proceeding. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
if a party cannot obtain jurisdiction or venue in any court mentioned in
the previous sentence, that party shall be permitted to proceed with a legal
action in any court in which such party can obtain jurisdiction or venue over
the applicable named defendants.



 

73 (b) _Dispute Resolution_. Prior to initiating any legal action or other legal
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, a party hereto shall:

(i) meet with the other applicable party to any dispute. If a party to the
dispute is an entity it shall appoint a designated representative, who shall
be a senior level manager or other person with the authority to make decisions
and/or commitments on behalf of the respective party to resolve the dispute.
The parties shall meet as often as they reasonably deem necessary to discuss
the problem in an effort to resolve the dispute without the necessity of any
formal proceeding. Unless delay would impair a partys rights under
applicable statutes of limitations, formal proceedings for the resolution of a
dispute may not be commenced until the earlier of: (A) the designated
representatives concluding in good faith that amicable resolution through
continued negotiation of the matter does not appear likely; or (B) the
expiration of the thirty (30) day period immediately following the initial
request to negotiate the dispute; and

(ii) thereafter, if any such dispute remains unresolved, request mediation of
any dispute arising out of any of the terms, provisions, or conditions of
this Agreement. The mediation shall be non-binding and be held in Fairfax
County, Virginia, before a mediator selected through The McCammon Group. The
mediation shall be commenced by any party making a written demand
for mediation to the administrator of The McCammon Group and serving the
demand on the opposing party(ies). Within fifteen (15) days after such demand
is made, the parties shall mutually select a mediator through The McCammon
Group. If the parties are unable to agree on a mediator, the administrator of
The McCammon Group shall select an independent mediator. If participation in
the mediation could reasonably be expected to adversely affect any right or
legal remedy the parties hereto may otherwise have (e.g., in the case of the
need for immediate equitable relief), no party shall be required to
participate therein.

23\. PUBLIC STATEMENTS. No party shall issue any press release or make any
public announcement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement without
the prior written approval of Purchaser and the Seller Representative
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned);
_provided_ , _however_ , that any Party may make any public disclosure it
believes in good faith is required by applicable law (in which case the
disclosing party will use its reasonable best efforts to advise the other
parties prior to making the disclosure).

24\. WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY. THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY KNOWINGLY,
VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE THE RIGHT ANY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED TO BE EXECUTED
IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING,
STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN CONNECTION
WITH SUCH AGREEMENTS.

25\. SELLER REPRESENTATIVE.

(a) By the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Company and each Seller
hereby irrevocably constitute and appoint Mr. Holzworth as the true and lawful
agent and attorney-in-fact (the " _Seller Representative_ ") of such Seller
with full powers of substitution to act in the name, place and stead of
thereof with respect to the performance on behalf of such Seller under the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, as the same may be from time to time
amended, and to do or refrain from doing all such further acts and things, and
to execute all such documents on behalf of the Sellers, if any, as the Seller
Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate in connection with any of
the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including:

(i) to agree upon or compromise any matter related to the calculation of any
adjustments, under this Agreement;



 

74 (ii) to direct the distribution of the Purchase Price;

(iii) to execute the Escrow Agreement on behalf of the Sellers;

(iv) to act for the Sellers with respect to all indemnification matters
referred to in this Agreement, including the right to compromise on behalf of
the Sellers any indemnification claim made by or against the Sellers, if any;

(v) to act for the Sellers with respect to all post-Closing matters including
pursuant to _Section 12_ and including to consent to the payment of funds in
the Escrow Account to Purchaser and/or to petition the Escrow Agent for
the release of any or all funds due the Sellers under the Escrow Agreement;

(vi) after the Closing, to terminate, amend, or waive any provision of this
Agreement; provided that any such action shall be taken in the same manner
with respect to all the Sellers unless otherwise agreed by each of the Sellers
who is subject to any disparate treatment of a potentially adverse nature;

(vii) to employ and obtain the advice of legal counsel, accountants and
other professional advisors as the Seller Representative reasonably deems
necessary or advisable in the performance of his duties as the Seller
Representative and to rely on their advice and counsel;

(viii) to retain a portion of the Purchase Price as a reserve against the
payment of expenses incurred in his capacity as the Seller Representative;

(ix) to sign any releases or other documents with respect to and dispute
or remedy arising under the Transaction Documents; and

(x) to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of the
Sellers which the Seller Representative reasonably deems necessary or
appropriate relating to the subject matter of this Agreement as fully and
completely as any of the Sellers could do if personally present and acting.

 

Without limiting the foregoing, after the Closing Seller Representative shall
take the actions to be taken by the Sellers under _Section 12_ hereof.

(b) The appointment of the Seller Representative shall be deemed coupled with
an interest and shall be irrevocable, and any other Person may conclusively
and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any actions of the Seller
Representative as the acts of the Sellers hereunder appointing the Seller
Representative in all matters referred to in this Agreement. Each of Company
and Sellers appointing the Seller Representative hereby ratifies and confirms
all that the Seller Representative shall do or cause to be done by virtue of
such Seller Representatives appointment as Seller Representative of the
Sellers. The Seller Representative shall act for the Sellers appointing the
Seller Representative on all of the matters set forth in this Agreement in the
manner the Seller Representative believes to be in the best interest of the
Sellers but the Seller Representative shall not be responsible to the Company
nor any of the Sellers for any loss or damage that the Company or any of the
Sellers may suffer by reason of the performance by the Seller Representative
of such Seller Representatives duties under this Agreement and any other
agreement appointing such Seller Representative, other than loss or damage
arising from fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance
of such Seller Representatives duties under this Agreement.



 

75 (c) Each of the Sellers appointing the Seller Representative hereunder hereby
expressly acknowledges and agrees that any Person shall be entitled to rely on
any and all action taken by the Seller Representative under this Agreement
without liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any of the Sellers. If the
Seller Representative resigns or ceases to function in such capacity for any
reason whatsoever, then the successor Seller Representative shall be the
Person appointed by the Sellers that held a majority of the Company Equity
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that
if for any reason no successor has been appointed within thirty (30) days,
then any Seller, who as of the date and time immediately prior to the
Effective Time, held more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding Company
Equity shall have the right to petition a court of competent jurisdiction for
appointment of a successor Seller Representative. The Sellers appointing the
Seller Representative do hereby severally agree to indemnify and hold the
Seller Representative harmless, ratably in accordance with their Common Pro
Rata Percentages, from and against any and all Loss (including attorneys
fees) reasonably incurred or suffered as a result of the performance of such
Seller Representatives duties under this Agreement, except for any such
liability arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Seller Representative.

_RECITALS_

WHEREAS, the parties hereto entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement dated
June 20, 2007 (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "; capitalized terms used herein
without definition shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Purchase
Agreement); and

WHEREAS, in order to (a) comply with certain closing conditions under
the Purchase Agreement, (b) reflect certain agreements of the Company
involving the payment of earn-outs and (c) set forth certain agreements among
the parties to the Purchase Agreement after the execution of the Purchase
Agreement, the parties desire to enter into this Closing Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective promises
and covenants contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable
consideration, the sufficiency and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties hereto hereby incorporate the Recitals and, intending to
be legally bound, agree as follows:

1\. Disclosure Schedules; No Waiver.

(a) Section 6.12 of the Purchase Agreement provides that "the Company and
Sellers shall be required to update the Disclosure Schedules (and [provide] a
certificate as to the accuracy of such update) within three (3) Business Days
prior to Closing so that the representations set forth in _Section 3_ and
_Section 4_ are true and correct as of the Closing Date or, in the case of
representations and warranties that expressly relate to an earlier date, as of
such earlier date. Except as set forth in _Section 7.1_, no such notification
or updated Disclosure Schedules shall have the effect of (i) amending the
Disclosure Schedules provided in connection with the execution of this
Agreement or (ii) constitute a waiver of any rights of Purchaser or Parent for
any breach of any provision of this Agreement." The Company and Sellers
hereby certify that, subject to the terms of the Disclosure Schedules attached
as _Exhibit A_ hereto (collectively, the " _New Disclosure Schedules_ " and
each, a " _New Schedule_ "), the representations set forth in _Section 3_
and _Section 4_ are true and correct as of the Closing Date or, in the case
of representations and warranties that expressly relate to an earlier date, as
of such earlier date. In addition, the Company and Sellers hereby acknowledge
that such New Disclosure Schedules shall not have the effect of (i) amending
the Disclosure Schedules provided in connection with the execution of the
Purchase Agreement or (ii) constitute a waiver of any rights of Purchaser or
Parent for any breach of any provision of the Purchase Agreement.

(b) The parties agree that no Purchaser Party shall have waived any rights to
seek indemnity or enforce any other remedies pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement for any breaches of representations, warranties, covenants or
obligations by (i) executing this Closing Agreement, (ii) consummating the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement, or (iii) otherwise.

such investigations could reasonably be expected to lead to losses which are
indemnifiable pursuant to Section 11 below, provided that all such costs and
expenses which meet the terms of Section 11.3(f) shall be indemnifable
pursuant to the terms and conditions (and subject to the limitations) set
forth in Section 11.3(f)), charges, complaints, claims, demands, injunctions,

7 (d) Section 11.7 is hereby amended and restated to read in its entirety as
follows:

11.7 _Non-Third Party Claims_. Any claim (including any Special
Indemnity Claim) which does not result from a third party claim shall be
asserted by a written notice to the other party or parties and shall be
identified as an "DIRECT INDEMNITY CLAIM NOTICE." The recipient of such notice
shall have a period of thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice within
which to respond thereto, provided that any response in connection with
Section 11.3(f) shall be limited to a response that the applicable costs and
expenses were outside the scope of Section 11.3(f). If such matter is capable
of cure then during such thirty (30) day period the recipient shall have the
right to cure any applicable breach of this Agreement or any circumstances
giving rise to a Special Indemnity Claim, as applicable. If the recipient
does not respond within such thirty (30) days and does not cure the applicable
breach or such circumstances, the recipient shall be deemed to have accepted
responsibility for the Losses set forth in such notice and shall have no
further right to contest the validity of such notice. If the recipient
responds within such thirty (30) days after the receipt of the notice and
rejects such claim in whole or in part, the party delivering shall be free to
pursue such remedies as may be available to it under contract or applicable
Law subject, in each case, to the limitations set forth in this Agreement,
including this _Section 11_.

(e) Section 11.15 is hereby amended and restated to read in its entirety as
follows:

11.15 _Prohibited Losses and Actions_. Except in connection with Section
11.3(f), in the absence of a third party claim triggering the application of
Section 11.6 of this Agreement, no Purchaser Party shall take any action which
could reasonably be expected to result in such Purchaser Partys incurring any
Losses unless such Purchaser Party reasonably determines, in good faith after
being reasonably informed, that such Losses must be incurred to comply with
applicable Law. Without limiting any other manner in which a Purchaser Party
may, in good faith, be reasonably informed that Losses must be incurred to
comply with applicable Law, the parties agree that a Purchaser Party will be
deemed to have acted in good faith and been reasonably informed that Losses
must be incurred to comply with applicable Law if its legal counsel or
outside accounting advisors have advised a Purchaser Party that it believes
that an action or course of action is reasonably necessary to comply with
applicable Law.

5\. Amendment to the Purchase Agreement Regarding Determination of Actual Net
Assets and Actual Surplus Cash. The term "sixty (60) days" in the first
sentence of Section 2.3 shall be replaced with the term "ninety (90) days".

6\. Agreements Regarding Surplus Cash and Indebtedness. For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties agree that (a) checks payable that have been issued by the
Company but not cashed by the recipients thereof on or prior to the Closing
Date shall not be included in Surplus Cash, (b) payments by wire plus any
check actually received by the Company but not cashed by the Company on or
prior to the Closing Date (i.e., deposits in transit) shall be treated as
additional Surplus Cash and (c) payroll obligations due on the Closing Date
shall be treated as Indebtedness for the purposes of the Purchase Agreement.

7. Certain Seller Expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
Purchase Agreement, the parties agree that the invoice from
PricewaterHouseCoopers LLP dated August 2, 2007 for $448,772 shall be deemed
to be a Seller Expense and shall be subtracted from the Closing Date Purchase
Price as if it were paid at Closing, but such invoice shall not be paid at
Closing. Instead, the Seller Representative shall have 30 days after the
Closing Date to negotiate a reduction in such amount.  



 

8  If PricewaterHouseCoopers LLP agrees in writing to reduce such invoice
within such 30 day period, then Purchaser shall promptly pay both (a)
such reduced amount to PricewaterHouseCoopers LLP and (b) $448,772 less such
reduced amount to the Seller Representative (who shall add such additional
amount to the reserve described in subsection (vii) of the definition of
Seller Expenses). If PricewaterHouseCoopers LLP does not agrees in writing to
reduce such invoice within such 30 day period, then Purchaser shall promptly
pay the full amount of the $448,772 invoice to PricewaterHouseCoopers LLP
thereafter.

8\. UK Entity Corporate Records. Purchaser and Parent agree that in lieu of
the legal opinion of Kilpatrick Stockton LLP relating to Constella Group
Holding Ltd., Constella Group Ltd., and Constella Futures Ltd. that is
attached to the Purchase Agreement as of the date of the signing, Purchaser
and Parent shall accept the legal opinion attached hereto as _Exhibit D_. In
exchange, the Seller Representative, at the sole cost and expense of the
Sellers (whether from the reserve described in subsection (vii) of the
definition of Seller Expenses or otherwise), agrees to take, or to cause to be
taken, within 15 Business Days after the Closing, any and all actions
necessary so that, following the taking of such actions, a reasonable UK
counsel could opine that the capitalization of Constella Group Holding Ltd.,
Constella Group Ltd., and Constella Futures Ltd. is as set forth on the New
Disclosure Schedules, with such opinion based upon the books and records of
such entities. The parties hereto acknowledge that the actions contemplated by
this provision shall be based on the capitalization of Constella Group
Holding Ltd., Constella Group Ltd., and Constella Futures Ltd. set forth on
the New Disclosure Schedules and the public records available from Companies
House.

9\. Escrow Agreement. The parties hereto agree that the Escrow Agreement in
the form attached as _Exhibit B_ to the Purchase Agreement shall be amended
and restated in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_.

10\. Flow of Funds Memorandum. Attached hereto As _Exhibit C_ is the Final
Certificate and Flow of Funds Memorandum required by _Section 2.2(e)_ of the
Purchase Agreement. Each Seller hereby approves the terms thereof and the
calculations therein

11\. Representations and Warranties. Each party hereto represents and warrants
that with respect to itself, such party has full power and authority to enter
into this Agreement and to perform their respective obligations hereunder, and
that this Agreement constitutes a valid agreement enforceable by its terms
against each of them.

12\. Effect on Purchase Agreement. Except as expressly set forth herein, the
Purchase Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
the provisions thereof. The terms of this Closing Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the provisions of the Purchase Agreement
including _Sections 13_ through _25_ thereof (which shall be deemed
applicable to the terms of Closing Agreement). Anything to the contrary in
this Closing Agreement notwithstanding, in the event of a conflict in the
terms and conditions of this Closing Agreement and the terms and conditions of
the Purchase Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Closing Agreement
shall govern.
