Section 2.2  Purchase Price Adjustments..

 

(a) Not more than seven (7) Business Days, but in no event less than two (2)
Business Days, before the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser (i)
an estimated unaudited balance sheet of the Company as of the close of
business on the earlier of November 30, 2008 or the Closing Date, and after
giving effect to the completion of the transactions contemplated by Section
5.10(b) hereof (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet"), (ii) a statement
(the "Estimated Adjustment Statement" and, together with the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet, the "Estimated Financial Statements"), which
Estimated Adjustment Statement shall set forth Seller's good faith estimate
of (x) the Aggregate Net Company Indebtedness (such estimated amount, the
"Estimated Aggregate Net Company Indebtedness"), (y) the Adjusted Net Working
Capital (such estimated amount, the "Estimated Adjusted Net Working
Capital") and (z) the Net PPandE Amount (such estimated amount, the "Estimated
Net PPandE Amount"), in each case as of the close of business on the earlier
of November 30, 2008 or the Closing Date (and after giving effect to
the completion of the transactions contemplated by Section 5.10(b) hereof),
with such amounts being derived from the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, and
(iii) a statement setting forth the name of each Excluded SERP Employee, the
SERP Accrual for each Excluded SERP Employee and the Aggregate SERP
Adjustment Amount. The Estimated Financial Statements shall be prepared
in accordance with GAAP (applied using the same principles and policies used
to prepare the Balance Sheet and the March 31 Calculations). The
parties acknowledge and agree that the calculations of Aggregate Net
Company Indebtedness, Adjusted Net Working Capital and the Net PPandE Amount
attached to Section 2.2(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule are
calculations of such amounts as of March 31, 2008 and have been derived from
the Balance Sheet (such calculations are referred to herein as the "March
31 Calculations")

 

 

(b) The Base Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment on the Closing
Date as follows (it being understood and agreed that, if applicable, the
adjustments contemplated by clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) immediately
below shall be netted against each other for purposes of determining the
adjustment to the Base Purchase Price to be made on the Closing Date):

 

 

(i) If the Estimated Adjusted Net Working Capital is less than the Target
Adjusted Net Working Capital, the Base Purchase Price shall be decreased by
an amount equal to the amount by which the Target Adjusted Net Working
Capital exceeds the Estimated Adjusted Net Working Capital. If the Estimated
Adjusted Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Adjusted Net Working
Capital, the Base Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to the
amount by which the Estimated Adjusted Net Working Capital exceeds the Target
Adjusted Net Working Capital;

 

 

(ii) If the Estimated Aggregate Net Company Indebtedness is less than the
Target Aggregate Net Company Indebtedness, the Base Purchase Price shall be
increased by an amount equal to the amount by which the Target Aggregate Net
Company Indebtedness exceeds the Estimated Aggregate Net
Company Indebtedness. If the Estimated Aggregate Net Company Indebtedness
is greater than the Target Aggregate Net Company Indebtedness, the Base
Purchase Price

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

shall be decreased by an amount equal to the amount by which the Estimated
Aggregate Net Company Indebtedness exceeds the Target Aggregate Net
Company Indebtedness;

 

 

(iii) If the Estimated Net PPandE Amount is less than the Target Net PPandE
Amount, the Base Purchase Price shall be decreased by an amount equal to the
amount by which the Target Net PPandE Amount exceeds the Estimated Net
PPandE Amount. If the Estimated Net PPandE Amount is greater than the Target Net
PPandE Amount, the Base Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to
the amount by which the Estimated Net PPandE Amount exceeds the Target Net PPandE
Amount; and

 

 

(iv) The Base Purchase Price shall be decreased by the positive amount
obtained by subtracting (A) the sum of $1,000,000 plus the income tax
effected aggregate amount (62%) of the SERP Accrual for each Excluded SERP
Employee, from (B) $3,700,000 (the amount obtained by subtracting clause (A)
from clause (B) is referred to herein as the "Aggregate SERP Adjustment
Amount"), it being understood and agreed that Purchaser shall not have the
right to dispute Seller's calculation of the Aggregate SERP Adjustment Amount
except in the case of mathematical error.

 

 

(c) Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare
and deliver to Seller (i) an unaudited balance sheet of the Company as of the
close of business on the earlier of November 30, 2008 or the Closing Date,
and after giving effect to the completion of the transactions contemplated by
Section 5.10(b) hereof (the "Closing Balance Sheet"), and (ii) a statement
(the "Closing Adjustment Statement" and, together with the Closing Balance
Sheet, the "Closing Date Financial Statements"), which Closing Adjustment
Statement shall set forth (x) the Aggregate Net Company Indebtedness, (y) the
Adjusted Net Working Capital and (z) the Net PPandE Amount, in each case as of
the close of business on the earlier of November 30, 2008 or the Closing Date

Balance Sheet. The Closing Date Financial Statements shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP (applied using the same principles and policies used to
prepare the Balance Sheet and the March 31 Calculations). Contemporaneously
with the delivery of the Closing Date Financial Statements, Purchaser shall
also deliver to Seller copies of the calculations that Purchaser used in
preparing the Closing Date Financial Statements and Purchaser shall also
promptly provide to Seller such other calculations, documents and information
as Seller may reasonably request for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
the Closing Date Financial Statements. Without limiting the foregoing,
Purchaser shall allow Seller and its Representatives reasonable access to the
books and records of the Company to the extent reasonably necessary to review
and verify the information contained in the Closing Date Financing
Statements.

 

 

(d) In the event that Seller either has no objections to the Closing Date
Financial Statements as prepared by Purchaser and does not deliver a Dispute
Notice to Purchaser or if Seller otherwise fails to deliver a Dispute Notice
to Purchaser within the time period required by the immediately following
sentence, then, on the date that is thirty-one (31)

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

days following the date on which Purchaser delivers the Closing Date
Financial Statements to Seller, the Closing Date Financial Statements
prepared by Purchaser, including the Aggregate Net Company Indebtedness,
Adjusted Net Working Capital and Net PPandE Amount set forth therein, shall be
deemed to be and shall become final, binding and conclusive on the parties
hereto, including Seller. In the event that Seller disputes the amount of
Aggregate Net Company Indebtedness, the amount of Adjusted Net Working
Capital and/or the Net PPandE Amount as set forth in the Closing Date Financial
Statements, Seller shall, within thirty (30) days following the date on which
Purchaser delivers the Closing Date Financial Statements to Seller, prepare
and deliver to Purchaser a written notice of dispute (the "Dispute Notice"),
which Dispute Notice shall specifically identify, and provide a reasonably
detailed explanation of the basis upon which Seller has delivered such
Dispute Notice.

 

 

(e) In the event Seller timely delivers a Dispute Notice to Purchaser in
accordance with the terms hereof, Purchaser and Seller shall attempt to
reconcile their differences, and any resolution by them as to any such
disputes shall be final, binding and conclusive on each of them. If Purchaser
and Seller are unable to resolve any such dispute within fifteen (15) days of
Purchaser's receipt of the Dispute Notice from Seller, Purchaser and Seller
shall submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to an independent
accounting firm of national reputation that is mutually acceptable to
Purchaser and Seller (the "Independent Accounting Firm"), provided that if
Purchaser and Seller are unable to agree on a mutually acceptable Independent
Accounting Firm, then the parties shall request that the New York City, New
York office of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") select
an accounting firm to as the Independent Accounting Firm hereunder, provided
that any such Independent Accounting Firm selected by the AAA shall be of
national reputation and shall (i) not be an Affiliate of Seller or Purchaser,
(ii) not have had a material business relationship with Seller or Purchaser
in the two (2) year period immediately preceding the proposed engagement of
such Independent Accounting Firm and (iii) have expertise in general
accounting matters. Upon the selection of the Independent Accounting Firm,
and in any event within five (5) Business Days following such selection,
Purchaser and Seller shall submit to such Independent Accounting Firm (and
the other party) all documentary materials and analyses that Purchaser or
Seller, as the case may be, believes to be relevant to a resolution of the
dispute set forth in the Dispute Notice and, without limiting the foregoing,
Purchaser shall allow the Independent Accounting Firm and its Representatives
reasonable access to the books and records of the Company to the extent
reasonably necessary to perform the duties for which it is engaged hereunder.
The Independent Accounting Firm shall, within twenty (20) Business Days after
receipt of all such submissions by Purchaser and Seller, determine and
deliver to Purchaser and Seller a written report (the "Final Report")
containing such Independent Accounting Firm's determination of the disputed
matters that were so submitted to it (and only such matters), and the
determinations of the Independent Accounting Firm that are contained therein
shall be final, binding and conclusive on Purchaser and Seller. The fees and
disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm and, if applicable, the AAA,
shall be allocated to Seller in the same proportion that the aggregate amount
of such remaining disputed items so submitted to the Independent Accounting
Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by Seller (as finally determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such remaining
disputed items so submitted, and the balance shall be paid by Purchaser.

(f) No later than two (2) Business Days following the Determination Date,
Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall make the following payments,
after netting against each other all payments required to be made by Seller
and/or Purchaser, as the case may be, pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
immediately below, with all such payments being made to the applicable Person
via wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts
designated in writing by the Person entitled to receive such payment:

 

 

(i) If the Estimated Adjusted Net Working Capital is less than the Final
Adjusted Net Working Capital, Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount equal
to the amount by which the Final Adjusted Net Working Capital exceeds the
Estimated Adjusted Net Working Capital. If the Estimated Adjusted Net Working
Capital is greater than the Final Adjusted Net Working Capital, Seller shall
pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the amount by which the Estimated
Adjusted Net Working Capital exceeds the Final Adjusted Net Working Capital;

 

 

(ii) If the Estimated Aggregate Net Company Indebtedness is less than the
Final Aggregate Net Company Indebtedness, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an
amount equal to the amount by which the Final Aggregate Net Company
Indebtedness exceeds Estimated Aggregate Net Company Indebtedness. If the
Estimated Aggregate Net Company Indebtedness is greater than the Final
Aggregate Net Company Indebtedness, Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount
equal to the amount by which the Estimated Aggregate Net Company Indebtedness
exceeds the Final Aggregate Net Company Indebtedness; and

 

 

(iii) If the Estimated Net PPandE Amount is less than the Final Net PPandE
Amount, Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the amount by which
the Final Net PPandE Amount exceeds Estimated Net PPandE Amount. If
the Estimated Net PPandE Amount is greater than the Final Net PPandE
Amount, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the amount by which
the Estimated Net PPandE Amount exceeds the Final Net PPandE Amount.

 

 

(g) Any amount paid pursuant to Section 2.3(f) shall bear interest from the
Closing Date through but excluding the date of payment, at a rate of eight
percent (8%) per annum. Such interest shall accrue daily on the basis of a
three hundred sixty (360) day year calculated for the actual number of days
for which payment is due and such payment shall be payable together with the
amount payable pursuant to Section 2.2(f).

Section 5.2 Employment Matters.

 

 

(a) During the one (1) year period following the Closing, Purchaser shall, or
shall cause its Affiliates to, provide to the employees of the Company who
are employed at the Closing ("Company Employees") and who remain employed
with Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser for so long as the Company

respect to each Company Employee, are substantially similar in the aggregate
to the compensation and benefits provided to such Company Employee under the
Company Plans immediately prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall, or shall
cause the Company to, perform all of the obligations under the Company Plans
as in effect on the Closing Date or as may thereafter be amended in
accordance with the terms hereof and thereof. Without limiting the foregoing,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company to, adopt a severance plan
effective at the Closing in a form reasonably satisfactory to Seller and
having the terms set forth on Section 5.2(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule (the "Company Severance Plan"), it being understood and agreed that

5.2(a) to the contrary, Purchaser shall maintain, or cause the Company to
maintain, the Company Severance Plan in accordance with the term thereof as

acknowledge and agree that for purposes of this Section 5.2, Company Plans
shall include the Company SERP and the Company Severance Plan.

 

 

(b) At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall create a new deferred
compensation/salary reduction plan (the "Seller Deferred Compensation Plan")

and key managers of Seller and Seller\'s post-Closing Affiliates, and any and
all liabilities under the Company Deferred Compensation Plan not associated
with (i) a Company Employee or (ii) a former employee of the Company or any
former Subsidiary thereof whose names appear on Section 5.2(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or who retires or otherwise ceases to be employed by the
Company (except in connection with such Person becoming an employee of Seller
or any of its post-Closing Affiliates at the Closing) between the date hereof
and the Closing Date (each, a "Company Retiree"), shall be transferred to,
and become liabilities of, Seller pursuant to the Seller Deferred
Compensation Plan, and the Company shall no longer have any liability or
obligations in respect thereof. Except as expressly set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence, all deferred compensation liabilities and
obligations under the Company Deferred Compensation Plan shall remain
obligations of the Company.

 

 

(c) At or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall create and, subject to
the terms set forth in this Section 5.2, including Section 5.2(a) hereof,
maintain, a supplemental retirement plan, substantially in the form attached
to Section 5.2(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and approved by
Purchaser, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed (the "Company SERP "). At or prior to the Closing Date, any and all
liabilities under the Intermountain Industries, Inc. Supplemental Retirement
Plan (other than liabilities thereunder that are associated with an Excluded
SERP Employee, William C. Glynn, Richard Hokin and Kenneth Smith) shall be
transferred to, and become liabilities of, the Company pursuant to the
Company SERP, and, without limiting the terms set forth in Section 2.2(b)(iv)
hereof, neither Seller nor any of its post-Closing Affiliates shall have any
liability or obligations in respect thereof.

 

 

(d) At or prior to the Closing, the Board of Directors of the Company shall
adopt a resolution terminating the Intermountain Gas Company Employee Savings
and Profit Sharing Plan and the Intermountain Gas Company Employee Pension,
Savings and Profit Sharing Plan (collectively, the "Company Savings Plans"
) effective upon, and subject to the occurrence of, the Closing, and
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for reimbursing participants in the
Company Savings Plans for fees (if any) incurred in connection with
such termination. At and after the Closing, all such participants that
are Company Employees shall be eligible to participate in a defined
contribution plan maintained by Purchaser (the "Purchaser Savings Plan" )
on terms, for at least one (1) year following the Closing, that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to those that applied to such
participants under the Company Savings Plans immediately prior to the
Closing. Upon receipt by the Company of a favorable IRS determination letter
with respect to the termination of the Company Savings Plans, Purchaser shall
allow the Purchaser Savings Plan to accept direct rollovers for participants
from the Company Savings Plans.

 

 

(e) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates, as applicable, to give
Company Employees full credit for such Company Employees\' service with the
Company and its Affiliates for purposes of eligibility, vesting, and
determination of the level of benefits (including for purposes of vacation
and severance), but not for purposes of benefit accruals, under any benefit
plans made generally available to employees or officers or any class or level
of employees or officers maintained by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in
which a Company Employee participates to the same extent recognized by the
Company or an Affiliate thereof

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 


 

immediately prior to the Closing; provided, however, that such service shall
not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service.

 

 

(f) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates, as applicable, to (i)
waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to Company
Employees and their eligible dependents under any plan of Purchaser or any
Subsidiary of Purchaser that provides health benefits in which Company
Employees may be eligible to participate following the Closing, other than
any limitations that were in effect with respect to such Company Employees as
of the Closing under the analogous Company Plan, (ii) honor any deductible,
co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Company Employees and
their eligible dependents under the health plans in which they participated
immediately prior to the Closing during the portion of the calendar year
prior to the Closing in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-
pocket maximums under health plans of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in
which they are eligible to participate after the Closing in the same plan
year in which such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were
incurred and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Company
Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after the Closing, in each
case to the extent such Company Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied
any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Company Plan prior
to the Closing.

 

 

(g) The provisions of this Section 5.2 (other than in respect of the Company
Severance Plan) are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement,
and except with respect to the provisions regarding the Company Severance
Plan, no employee or former employee of the Company or any other individual
associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party
beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an
amendment to any Company Plan for any purpose. The parties acknowledge and
agree that nothing contained in this Agreement, including in this Section
5.2, shall require Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof (including, after the
Closing Date, the Company) to maintain the employment of any employee of the
Company.

 

 

Section 5.3 Publicity. Purchaser and Seller agree that no public release or
announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written consent of
Purchaser and Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), except (a) such release or announcement as may be
required by applicable Law, in which case, to the extent practicable, the
party required to make the release or announcement shall allow the other
party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance
of such issuance, (b) Seller and Purchaser shall be permitted to disclose
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in connection with
making any Governmental Filing or Purchaser Governmental Filing,
as applicable, or in response to the request of any Government Entity
having jurisdiction over Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, and Seller and
Purchaser shall be permitted to take such actions in connection with
obtaining or making any other filings, registrations, notifications,
authorizations, consents or approvals, in each case in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (c) nothing contained herein
shall preclude disclosure of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in the event of litigation between the parties hereto, but then only
to the extent necessary to prosecute or defend any such litigation.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Section 5.4 Confidentiality. Purchaser and its Representatives (as such term
is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement between Citigroup Global Markets
Inc. (on behalf of the Company) and Purchaser, dated April 7, 2008 (as the
same may be amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the
"Confidentiality Agreement")) shall treat all materials and information
obtained in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby as confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with the terms set forth therein.

 

 

Section 5.5 Access to Information. Subject to Section 5.4, Seller shall
cause the Company to afford Purchaser and its Representatives reasonable
access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the
officers, properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and to its
books and records, and shall furnish Purchaser with available financial,
operating and other data and information with respect to the business and
properties of the Company as Purchaser may reasonably request. In exercising
its rights hereunder, Purchaser shall (and shall cause each of its
Representatives to) conduct itself so as not to interfere in the conduct of
the business of the Company prior to Closing. Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that any contact by Purchaser or its Representatives with officers,
employees, customers or agents of the Company shall be arranged and
supervised by representatives of Seller, unless Seller otherwise expressly
consents in writing with respect to any specific unsupervised contact.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including the Company) shall be required to
disclose to Purchaser or any Representative thereof any information (a)
relating to any sale or divestiture process conducted by Seller for the
Company or the Business or Seller\'s (or its Representatives\') evaluation of
the Company or the Business in connection therewith, including projections,
financial information or other information relating thereto or (b) if doing
so could violate any Contract or Law to which Seller or any of its Affiliates
(including the Company) is a party or to which it is subject or which it
believes in good faith could result in a loss of the ability to successfully
assert a claim of privilege (including the attorney-client and work product
privileges). In addition, notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, without the prior written consent of Seller, none
of Purchaser or its Representatives shall have any right to perform or
conduct, or cause to be performed or conducted, any environmental sampling or
testing at, in, on or underneath the Real Property.

 

 

Section 5.6 Filings, Authorizations and Consents.

request in connection with its preparation of any filing, submission or other
act that is necessary or advisable under the HSR Act. Seller and
Purchaser shall keep each other timely apprised of the status of any
material communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional
information from, such Governmental Entity, and shall comply promptly with
any such inquiry or request. Neither party shall agree to participate in any
meeting, whether in person or telephonically, with any Governmental Entity in
respect of filings referred to in this Section 5.6(a) or any investigation or
other inquiries relating thereto, unless the relevant party consults with the
other party in advance, and to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat.

 

 

(b) [Intentionally omitted.]

 

 

(c) Seller and/or Purchaser, as applicable, shall, as promptly as reasonably

reports, notices and other documents, if any, required to be filed by

notifications, applications, reports and other documents referred to in the
immediately preceding clause (i) shall be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to each of Seller and Purchaser, and with Seller
being provided a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
foregoing referred to in the immediately preceding clause (ii). Seller and
Purchaser shall inform the other party promptly of any material communication
made by or on behalf of such party to (including permitting the other party
to review such material communication in advance), or received from, the IPUC
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall
furnish to the other such information and assistance as the other may
reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any notifications,
applications, reports, notices and other documents, if any, contemplated by
this Section 5.6(c). Without limiting the foregoing, Seller and Purchaser
shall keep each other timely apprised of the status of any material actions,

(d) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with one another in determining
whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Entity (excluding the actions and filings described in subsections (a) and
(c) of this Section 5.6) is required or reasonably appropriate, or any
action, consent, approval or waiver from any party to

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 


 

any Company Material Contract is required or reasonably appropriate, in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Confidentiality Agreement, in taking such actions or making any
such filings, the parties shall furnish such information as may be required
in connection therewith and timely seek to obtain any such actions,
consents, approvals or waivers.

 

 

Section 5.7 Director and Officer Liability; Indemnification. If the Closing
occurs, Purchaser and Seller agree that all rights to indemnification and
all limitations on liability existing in favor of any individual who, on or
prior to the Closing Date, was an officer, director or employee of the
Company (collectively, the "Company Indemnitees"), as provided in (a) the
articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company in effect on the date of
this Agreement or (b) any agreement providing for indemnification by the
Company of any Company Indemnitee in effect on the date of this Agreement to
which the Company is a party or by which it is bound as of the date of this
Agreement and which in each case of this clause (b) is listed on Section 5.7

transactions contemplated hereby and continue in full force and effect and be
honored by the Company after the Closing for a period of not less than six
(6) years. Purchaser shall cause the Company to take all actions required by,
and otherwise comply with, the provisions of this Section 5.7. It is
expressly agreed that the Company Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.7
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.7.

 

 

Section 5.8 Reasonable Best Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions herein provided, each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, to do or cause to be
done and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated hereby, including: (a) the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of any of the parties; (b) the obtaining of
applicable consents, waivers or approvals of any Governmental Entities or
third parties; (c) the defending of any Actions challenging this Agreement or
the performance of the obligations hereunder; and (d) the execution and
delivery of such instruments, and the taking of such other actions as the
other party may reasonably require in order to carry out the intent of this
Agreement, it being understood and agreed that in connection with the
obtaining of applicable consents, waivers or approvals of any
Governmental Entities, if it is reasonably likely that the condition to
Closing set forth in Section 6.1(c) and/or Section 6.1(d) hereof (in each
case, without giving effect to the terms thereof regarding the imposition of
terms and/or conditions by the applicable Governmental Entity) will not be
satisfied at or prior to the Initial Outside Date (including any extension
thereof), then Purchaser shall be required to (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) take such actions and/or accept such terms and/or conditions
(and Purchaser shall consent to the Company taking such actions and/or
accepting such terms and/or conditions) as may be requested or imposed by the
applicable Governmental Entity unless the effect thereof would result in the
condition to Closing set forth in Section 6.1(c) and/or Section 6.1(d) not
being satisfied. In addition, but subject to the terms set forth in the
immediately following sentence, Seller agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to assist Purchaser in obtaining a waiver or amendment,
as appropriate, to Section 9.17 of the Debenture Purchase Agreement to
permit Purchaser to include the Company in its consolidated income Tax
returns, and to permit the Company to make tax payments as part of
Purchaser's consolidated group in the same

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

manner as currently provided for in such Section 9.17 with respect
to Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise
expressly contemplated by this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its

any payments or otherwise pay any consideration to any third party (excluding
Governmental Entities) to obtain any applicable consent, waiver or approval.

 

 

Section 5.9 Insurance. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that all insurance
coverage for the Company and the Business under policies of Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Company) shall terminate as of the Closing and,
except as otherwise provided herein, no claims may be brought thereunder by
the Company from and after the Closing for losses that occur after the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon written notice to Seller, the
Company may bring claims under such policies that are occurrence-based
policies for losses that occur prior to the Closing if permitted under such
policies, provided that uninsured costs of such claims shall be at the
Company\'s sole cost and expense (including any applicable retentions or
deductibles in connection with such claims).

 

 

Section 5.10 Indebtedness; Termination of Affiliate Agreements.

 

 

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, including the last sentence of
Section 5.8 hereof, if Purchaser desires to obtain the consent of the lenders
party to the Credit Agreement to waive the change of control provision set
forth therein or to assign the Credit Agreement, Seller agrees to cooperate
with any reasonable request of Purchaser in connection with Purchaser's
seeking and obtaining such consent. However, if such consent has not been
obtained, on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall repay, or shall cause one of
its Affiliates to repay, any and all amounts that are outstanding on the
Closing Date, whether principal, accrued and unpaid interest or otherwise,
under the terms of the Credit Agreement, and Seller and Purchaser shall, at
the Closing, cause the administrative agent or other lenders, as applicable,
under the Credit Agreement to deliver written evidence thereof to the parties
hereto. Seller acknowledges and agrees that all amounts that are outstanding
on the Closing Date, whether principal, accrued and unpaid interest or
otherwise, under the terms of the Credit Agreement, and that are repaid by
Purchaser as contemplated by this Section 5.10(a) shall constitute Debt for
purposes of calculating the amount of Aggregate Net Company
Indebtedness hereunder. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any and all amounts
that are outstanding on the Closing Date, whether principal, accrued and
unpaid interest or otherwise, under the terms of the Debenture Purchase
Agreement shall remain outstanding upon the Closing and shall not be repaid
or otherwise extinguished at the Closing, provided that all such amounts
shall constitute Debt for purposes of calculating the amount of Aggregate Net
Company Indebtedness hereunder.

 

 

(b) Effective at the Closing, except for those Contracts set forth in Section
5.10(b)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, all Contracts between the
Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other
hand (the "Terminating Contracts"), shall be terminated as between them and
shall be without any further force and effect, and there shall be no further
obligations of any of the relevant parties thereunder. Purchaser agrees to
take and to cause the Company to take, and Seller agrees to take and to cause
its Affiliates (other than the Company) to take, any action following the
Closing that would be required to give effect to the termination of the
Terminating Contracts. Without

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 


 

limiting the foregoing, except as set forth in Section 5.10(b)(ii) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, all inter-company accounts, whether payables or
receivables, between any of Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, as of the Closing shall be settled in cash or
otherwise discharged and released as of the Closing.

 

 

Section 5.11 Names. Following the Closing Date, the Company shall be
permitted to continue to use the name "Intermountain Gas Company" and any
other name, trademark or service mark used by the Company in the operation of
the Business as of the Closing Date and that is listed on Section 5.11 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule (such name and such other names, trademarks and
service marks are collectively referred to herein as the "Marks"), provided
that Purchaser shall cause the Company to use the Marks solely in connection
with the operation of the Business, it being understood and agreed that
neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing
Date, the Company) shall be permitted to use any of the Marks in connection
with any other activities. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date, the
Company) not to, (a) hold itself out as having any affiliation or
relationship of any kind with Seller or any post-Closing Affiliate thereof,
provided that Purchaser shall be permitted, and may permit its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing Date, the Company) to refer to the fact that
the Company was purchased from Seller or (b) use the Marks in a manner that
would be reasonably likely to reflect negatively thereon or on Seller or its
post-Closing Affiliates. Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company
to, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its post-Closing Affiliates from
and against any Losses relating to or arising from any use by Purchaser or
the Company of the Marks in a manner not permitted by this Section 5.11 or
otherwise. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, Seller and its post-Closing Affiliates shall be permitted to
use the Marks (other than the name "Intermountain Gas Company" or any other
Mark that is used exclusively in the Business as of the date hereof) in
connection with the operation of any business or activities in which they may
be engaged from time to time, provided that Seller shall not, and shall cause
its post-Closing Affiliates not to, hold itself out as having any affiliation
or relationship of any kind with the Company, provided that Seller shall
be permitted to, and may permit its post-Closing Affiliates to, refer to the
fact that the Company was previously owned by Seller. Without limiting the
foregoing, Seller shall not use the Marks in a manner that would be
reasonably likely to reflect negatively thereon or on the Company or its
post-Closing Affiliates. Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Company and
its post-Closing Affiliates from and against any Losses relating to or
arising from any use by Seller or its post-Closing Affiliates of the Marks in
a manner not permitted by this Section 5.11.

 

 

Section 5.12 Tax Matters.

 

 

(a) Seller shall timely prepare and file, or cause to be timely prepared and
filed, on a basis consistent with past practice to the extent consistent with
applicable Law, all Tax Returns with respect to the Company for any Tax
period of the Company ending on or prior to the Closing Date (the "Pre-
Closing Tax Returns"). With respect to all income Tax Returns (other
than income Tax Returns filed on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis
with Seller or any of Seller's Affiliates) and other material Pre-Closing Tax
Returns that are filed by Seller after the Closing Date, Seller shall permit
Purchaser to review and comment on each such Tax Return prior to its filing
and Seller shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably
requested by Purchaser as long as such revisions are consistent with the
prior

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 


 

practices of the Company that are consistent with applicable Law. In
connection with Purchaser's review, Seller shall provide any and all
financial data that is reasonably necessary to confirm the correctness of any
such Tax Returns. Seller shall deliver a copy of each Pre-Closing Tax
Return (or the portion thereof that specifically related to the Company) to
Purchaser promptly after filing. Seller shall timely pay or cause to be
timely paid all Taxes due with respect to the Pre-Closing Tax Returns to the
extent that such Taxes exceed the amount (if any) of such Taxes that are
included as current liabilities in Adjusted Net Working Capital, as finally
determined pursuant to Section 2.2 of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, no position shall be taken, election made,
or method adopted on any Pre-Closing Tax Return that (i) is inconsistent with
positions taken, elections made or methods used in preparing or filing
similar Tax Returns in the immediately prior period, or (ii) would reasonably
be expected to materially and adversely affect the Tax position or liability
of Purchaser, the Company or any of their Affiliates for any period following
the Closing Date (including, without limitation, positions, elections or
methods that would have the effect of deferring income to Tax periods (or
portions thereof) ending after the Closing Date or accelerating deductions to
Tax periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date), in
case of either clause (i) or this clause (ii), without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Purchaser shall timely prepare and file, or cause to
be timely prepared and filed, on a basis consistent with past practice to the
extent consistent with applicable Law, all Tax Returns for any Straddle
Period of the Company ("Straddle Period Tax Returns"). Purchaser shall permit
Seller to review and comment on each Straddle Period Tax Return prior to its
filing and Purchaser shall make such revisions to such Straddle Period Tax
Returns as are reasonably requested by Seller as long as such revisions are
consistent with the prior practices of the Company that are consistent with
applicable Law. In connection with Seller's review, Purchaser shall provide
any and all financial data that is reasonably necessary to confirm the
correctness of any such Tax Returns. Purchaser shall deliver a copy of each
such Tax Return to Purchaser promptly after filing.

 

 

(b) All tax-sharing or similar agreements with respect to or involving the
Company shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and after the Closing
Date, the Company shall not be ound thereby or have any liability thereunder.
Seller may elect to control, at its own expense, the conduct of any audit or
administrative or judicial proceeding with respect to any Taxes of, or any
Tax Return required to be filed by, the Company with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period for which Seller is liable for indemnification pursuant to
Section 8.1, if Seller acknowledged in writing that Seller has sole
responsibility for any Taxes that arise in such audit or proceeding;
provided, however, that Seller shall not resolve, abandon, compromise or
settle any such audit or proceeding without obtaining Purchaser\'s prior
written consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) if it would reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse
effect on Purchaser, the Company or any Affiliate thereof; provided further,
however, that (i) Seller shall keep Purchaser reasonably apprised of the
status of the audit or proceeding, and (ii) Purchaser shall have the right,
at its own expense, to retain separate counsel and to reasonably participate
(but not control) in the aspects of the prosecution or defense of such Tax
audit or proceeding that are reasonably anticipated to materially adversely
affect the Taxes of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates with respect to any
Tax period ending after the Closing Date.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(c) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes
of the Company. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the other party\'s request) the provision of records and information
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Purchaser and Seller shall retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until expiration of the statute of limitations on
assessment (taking into account any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable periods. Seller shall provide reasonable prior written notice to
Purchaser prior to disposing of books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company, at Purchaser's request, shall provide Purchaser
with copies of all such books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company.

 

 

(d) Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including after the Closing,
the Company) shall, without the prior written consent of Seller (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), (i) make
or change any Tax election affecting a taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date of Seller or any of its Affiliates (including, before the
Closing, the Company), (ii) amend, refile or otherwise modify (or grant an
extension of any applicable statute of limitations on assessment with respect
to) any Tax Return prepared by Seller or any of its Affiliates (including,
before the Closing, the Company) relating to a taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date or (iii) take any action that results in any
increased Tax liability (including a reduction in a refund) or reduction of
any Tax asset of the Company (or Seller or any of its Affiliates) in respect
of a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date.

 

 

(e) If, following the Closing Date, a refund of Taxes (the "Refund") is
received by or credited to the account of the Company in respect of any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or of Pre-Closing Straddle Period Taxes, Purchaser shall
cause the Company to pay the amount of the Refund to Seller to the extent
such Refund exceeds the amount (if any) of such Refund that is included as a
current asset in Adjusted Net Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant
to Section 2.2 of this Agreement.

 

 

Section 5.13 Non-Solicitation of Employees. For a period of one (1) year
from and after the Closing, Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its
post-Closing Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, for its own account
or for the account of any other Person, knowingly encourage, solicit or
induce, or in any manner attempt to knowingly encourage, solicit or induce,
any Person employed by the Company as of the Closing Date to terminate such
Person\'s employment with the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained in the immediately preceding sentence shall preclude Seller or its
post-Closing Affiliates from (i) making a general solicitation for employment
contained in a newspaper or other periodical or on the radio, internet or
similar media or hiring any employee of the Company as a result thereof or
(ii) taking any actions otherwise prohibited pursuant to the terms of the
immediately preceding sentence if the Person subject thereto has initiated
discussions with Seller or any of its post-Closing Affiliates without any
knowing encouragement, solicitation or inducement by Seller or such post-
Closing Affiliates. Seller and Purchaser acknowledge that the
restrictions contained in this Section 5.13 are reasonable in scope and
duration in light of the nature, size and location of

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 


 

the Business. Seller and Purchaser further acknowledge that the restrictions
contained in this Section 5.13 are necessary to protect
Purchaser\'s significant investment in the Business, including its goodwill.
If any court of competent jurisdiction shall at any time deem the duration or
scope of any of the provisions of this Section 5.13 to be unenforceable, the
other provisions of this Section shall nevertheless stand and the duration
and/or scope set forth herein shall be deemed to be the longest period and/or
greatest size permissible by Law under the circumstances, and the parties
hereto agree that such court shall reduce the time period and/or scope to
permissible duration or size.

 

 

Section 5.14 Purchaser\'s Financing Activities.

 

 

(a) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, except as otherwise set forth in
this Agreement, Seller and its Affiliates shall have no responsibility for
any financing that Purchaser may raise or attempt to raise in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby. Any offering memorandum, banker\'s book
or other materials prepared by or on behalf of Purchaser or its Affiliates,
or Purchaser\'s financing sources, in connection with Purchaser\'s
financing activities in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby (collectively, "Offering Materials") which include any information
provided by or on behalf of Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company) shall include a conspicuous disclaimer to the effect that neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates (other than the Company only after the
Closing Date) nor any employees thereof have any responsibility for the
content of such Offering Materials and disclaim all responsibility therefor
and shall further include a disclaimer with respect to Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Company only after the Closing Date) in any oral
disclosure with respect to such financing activities.

 

 

(b) Seller shall provide, and shall cause the Company to provide, and shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the respective officers,
employees, Representatives and advisors (including legal and accounting
advisors) of Seller and its Affiliates (including the Company) to provide, to
Purchaser all reasonable and customary cooperation requested by Purchaser in
connection with any debt or equity financing that Purchaser may determine to
obtain prior to the Closing, in each case upon the reasonable request of
Purchaser with reasonable prior notice. Purchaser shall promptly, upon
request by Seller, reimburse Seller for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by Seller or its Representatives in connection with
such cooperation.

any time prior to the Closing Date as follows:

 

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Purchaser and Seller;

 

 

(b) by the written notice of Seller to Purchaser if the Closing shall not
have occurred on or before December 31, 2008 (the "Initial Outside Date");
provided, however, that if the conditions to Closing set forth in Section
6.1(a), 6.1(c) and/or Section 6.1(d) hereof shall not have been satisfied on
or before December 31, 2008, but all other conditions set forth in Article VI
hereof would be satisfied if the Closing Date were to occur on such date,
then Seller shall be entitled, upon written notice to Purchaser, to extend
the Initial Outside Date until March 30, 2009; provided further, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall
not be available to Seller if the failure of Seller to fulfill any obligation
under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in,
the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to the Initial Outside Date
or any extension thereof contemplated hereby;

 

 

(c) by the written notice of Purchaser to Seller if the Closing shall not
have occurred on or before the Initial Outside Date; provided, however, that
if the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 6.1(a), 6.1(c) and/or
Section 6.1(d) hereof shall not have been satisfied on or before December 31,
2008, but all other conditions set forth in Article VI hereof would be
satisfied if the Closing Date were to occur on such date, then Purchaser
shall be entitled, upon written notice to Seller, to extend the Initial
Outside Date until March 30, 2009; provided further, however, that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(c) shall not
be available to Purchaser if the failure of Purchaser to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have
resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to the Initial
Outside Date or any extension thereof contemplated hereby;

 

 

(d) by Seller or Purchaser, by written notice to the other, if there shall be
a final Law in effect making illegal the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, or there shall be a Governmental Order that is a Final
Order in effect prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or that would cause the condition set forth in Section 6.1 (a), (c) or
(d) not to be satisfied; provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.1(d) shall not be available to such party if
the failure of such party to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement
shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the enactment of
such Law or the issuance of such Governmental Order;

 

 

(e) by Purchaser if there shall have been (i) a breach of any of the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in this Agreement, which
breach would cause the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) not to be
satisfied, or (ii) a breach of any of the covenants or agreements on the part
of Seller set forth in this Agreement, which breach would cause the condition
set forth in Section 6.2(b) not to be satisfied (and, in the case of either
(i) or

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) immediately above, such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days

Seller of such breach or is incapable of being cured by Seller by the Initial
Outside Date or, if it has been extended as herein provided, the Initial
Outside Date as so extended);

 

 

(f) by Seller if there shall have been (i) a breach of any of the
representations and warranties of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement,
which breach would cause the condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) not to be
satisfied, or (ii) a breach of any of the covenants or agreements on the part
of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement (other than the covenants and
agreements set forth in 2.1 and 2.2(b)), which breach would cause the
condition set forth in Section 6.3(b) not to be satisfied (and, in the case
of either (i) or (ii) immediately above, such breach is not cured within
thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice thereof from Seller to
Purchaser informing Seller of such breach or is incapable of being cured by
Purchaser by the Outside Date or, if it has been extended as herein provided,
the Initial Outside Date as so extended); and

 

 

(g) by Seller if Purchaser breaches its obligations under Section 2.1 or
Section 2.3(b) in any respect, provided that at such time all of the
conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI hereof shall have been
satisfied or waived, if permissible (or would be satisfied or waived if the
Closing was scheduled on the date of any termination pursuant to this clause
(g)).

 

 

Section 7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by a party pursuant to Section 7.1, written notice thereof shall

9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, 9.9, 9.10 and 9.13 and this Section 7.2 shall
survive the termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that, if such
termination shall have been caused by, or shall have resulted from,
the intentional and material breach by a party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, including, in the case of Purchaser, Purchaser\'s failure to pay
any portion of the Closing Date Purchase Price upon the satisfaction or
waiver of the applicable conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI,
Seller, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand, as the case may be,
shall be fully liable for any and all Losses of the other party as a result
of such breach or failure. Nothing contained herein shall limit or otherwise
preclude any party hereto from, in lieu of terminating this Agreement
pursuant to this Article VII, seeking specific performance of the terms set
forth herein as contemplated by Section 9.13.

pursuant to Section 2.2 of this Agreement; and (e) all uninsured liability
arising out of the pending litigation brought by plaintiffs Warren G. Taylor,
Melinda Taylor, Stacey Taylor and Christine Taylor identified on Section 3.9
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "Taylor Litigation"). For purposes of
this Article VIII only, "Losses" shall not include any losses, liabilities,
damages or expenses that are in the nature of punitive, incidental,
consequential, special, treble or indirect damages or damages based on any
multiple, including business interruption, loss of future revenue, profits or
income, or loss of business reputation or opportunity, in each case of any
kind or nature, regardless of the form of action through which any of the
foregoing are sought.

 

 

Section 8.2 Indemnification of Seller by Purchaser. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Article VIII, including, without limitation, the terms and
conditions set forth in Sections 8.6, from and after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller, its Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the
"Seller Indemnified Parties"), harmless from and against any and all Losses
that any such Seller Indemnified Party has suffered, sustained, incurred or
become subject to and that arises out of: (a) the breach of any of the
representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in Article IV of this
Agreement; or (b) the breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser under
this Agreement.

 

 

Section 8.3 Survival. The pre-Closing covenants of the parties set forth in
this Agreement and the related rights of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or
the Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, to indemnity with respect
to any breach thereof in accordance with the applicable Sections hereof shall
survive the Closing and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement until the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date unless
a shorter period of performance is specified with respect to such covenant.
The representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement
other than the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Section
3.2 (Authorization), Section 3.5 (Capital Structure; Subsidiaries), Section
3.12 (Taxes) or Section 3.14 (Employee Benefit Plans), the representations
and warranties of Purchaser set forth in Section 4.2 (Authorization), Section
4.8 (Solvency), and Section 4.9 (Foreign Persons), and the related rights of
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as the
case may be, to indemnity with

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 


 

respect to any breach thereof in accordance with the applicable Sections
hereof, shall survive the Closing for a period of eighteen (18) months
following the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 8.3, but subject to the other provisions of this Article VIII, the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in (i) Section 3.2
(Authorization), Section 3.5 (Capital Structure; Subsidiaries) and Section
3.12 (Taxes), and the representations and warranties of Purchaser set forth
in Section 4.2 (Authorization), Section 4.8 (Solvency) and Section 4.9
(Foreign Persons), and the related rights of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, to indemnity
with respect to any breach thereof in accordance with the applicable Sections
hereof, shall survive the Closing until the fourth (4th) anniversary of the
Closing Date, and (ii) Section 3.14 (Employee Benefit Plans), and the related
rights of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to indemnity with respect to any
breach thereof in accordance with the applicable Sections hereof, shall
survive the Closing until the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date.
The parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that any bona fide claim (and
only such bona fide claim, but not the related representations and
warranties) for indemnification made in writing in accordance with the terms
of this Article VIII on or prior to the applicable expiration date with
respect to any such claim as set forth herein shall survive the Closing and
any such applicable expiration date until the final resolution thereof.

 

 

Section 8.4 Limitation on Liability.

 

 

(a) Purchaser (on behalf of itself and the other Purchaser Indemnified
Parties) hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except as otherwise provided in
the immediately following proviso, no claim for indemnification by a
Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to the terms of Section 8.1(a) above (an
indemnification claim by a Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to the terms
of Section 8.1(a) above is referred to herein as a "Purchaser Warranty
Claim") shall be asserted by a Purchaser Indemnified Party unless and until
(i) the aggregate amount of Losses incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties with respect to the event or occurrence giving rise to such Purchaser
Warranty Claim exceeds $100,000 (a "Base Claim") and (ii) the aggregate
amount of all Losses to which all of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled by reason of any and all Purchaser Warranty Claims that
constitute Base Claims exceeds, in the aggregate, one percent (1%) of the
Closing Date Purchase Price (the "Deductible"), provided that once the
Deductible has been exceeded, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to indemnification for only the amount of Losses in respect
of Purchaser Warranty Claims that constitute Base Claims that are in excess
of the Deductible; provided, however, that, with respect to a breach of the
Excluded Warranties or the representations and warranties contained in clause
(ii) of Section 3.8(i) and Section 3.12 (Taxes), the amount of the Base Claim
and the amount of the Deductible shall be zero, it being understood and
agreed that, subject to the terms set forth in Section 8.4(b), in the case of
a breach of the Excluded Warranties, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to be paid an amount equal to all Losses incurred by them in
connection with a breach of such Excluded Warranties as and when such Losses
are incurred (and whether or not the Deductible has been exceeded or the
Purchaser Warranty Claim constitutes a Base Claim). The parties hereto hereby
acknowledge and agree that liability hereunder of any Indemnitor for any
Losses shall be limited to the amount of such Losses net of (i) any insurance
or other recoveries from third parties (other than Seller or Purchaser, as
applicable) payable to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the Seller
Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, in connection with the facts giving
rise to the right of

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 


 

indemnification hereunder and (ii) the present value of the amount of any net
Tax Benefits reasonably expected to be realized by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, as a result of
the Losses that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified
Parties, as the case may be, have suffered, sustained, incurred or become
subject to in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of
indemnification hereunder, with such net Tax Benefits to be calculated in
good faith by such parties. For purposes of this subsection, "Tax Benefits"
means, after utilizing all deductions, credits, and losses otherwise
available or reasonably anticipated to be available, any refund of income
Taxes paid or an actual reduction in the amount of income Taxes that would
otherwise be required or reasonably anticipated to be required to be paid in
the particular Tax period.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, and
except as otherwise provided in the immediately following proviso, in no
event shall the aggregate amount of Losses paid by Seller to the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties arising out of any and all Purchaser Warranty Claims
exceed an aggregate amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Closing Date
Purchase Price; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation on the
aggregate amount of Losses that arise out of Purchaser Warranty Claims shall
not apply to any such Purchaser Warranty Claims arising out of or resulting
from a breach of the representations and warranties (collectively, the
"Excluded Warranties") of Seller set forth in Section 3.2 (Authorization)
or Section 3.5 (Capital Structure; Subsidiaries), it being understood and
agreed that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be paid an
amount equal to all Losses incurred by them in connection with a breach of
such Excluded Warranties, which payments in respect of such Losses, in the
aggregate with all other payments by Seller under this Article VIII, shall
not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the Closing Date Purchase Price.

 

 

Section 8.5 Notice and Opportunity to Defend. If there occurs an event which
any party hereto (or any Purchaser Indemnified Party or any Seller
Indemnified Party) asserts is an indemnifiable event pursuant to this Article
VIII, the Person or Persons seeking indemnification (collectively, the
"Indemnitee") shall notify in writing the party or parties obligated to
provide indemnification pursuant to the terms hereof (collectively, the
"Indemnitor") promptly after obtaining knowledge of the occurrence of such
event. If such event involves any claim or the commencement of any action or
proceeding by a third Person, the Indemnitee shall give the Indemnitor prompt
written notice of such claim or the commencement of such action or
proceeding. The notice shall describe the claim, the amount of the claim if
known and quantifiable, and the basis therefor, or if not then known, a good
faith estimate of the amount thereof and the basis therefor. Any delay or
failure by an Indemnitee to so notify the Indemnitor shall relieve the
Indemnitor of its indemnification obligations hereunder to the extent that
the Indemnitor is prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure. The
Indemnitor shall be entitled to assume and control (with counsel of its
choice) the defense of such matter at the Indemnitor's expense by sending
written notice to the Indemnitee of its election to do so within thirty (30)
days after receiving written notice from the Indemnitee. The Indemnitee
agrees to cooperate fully with the Indemnitor and its counsel in the defense
against any such asserted claim; provided, however, that neither the
Indemnitee nor the Indemnitor shall be required pursuant to this Section
8.5 to disclose any privileged information or any attorney work product
in connection with the defense of any such asserted claim. In any event, the
Indemnitee shall have the right to participate (but not control) in
the defense of such asserted claim with separate counsel, if it desires, at
its own expense. Any settlement or compromise of such asserted claim

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 


 

by the Indemnitor shall require the prior written consent of the Indemnitee,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
provided that no such consent shall be required as long as it is solely a
monetary settlement that provides a full release of the Indemnitee with
respect to such matter and does not contain an admission of liability on the
part of the Indemnitee. If the Indemnitor shall not have assumed the defense
of such claim within the thirty (30) day period set forth above, the
Indemnitee may assume the defense of such claim with counsel of its choice
and the Indemnitor shall be required to pay all reasonable costs and
reasonable expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such
matter; provided, however, in the event the Indemnitee assumes control of the
defense of any such claim as contemplated by this sentence, the Indemnitee
shall not be permitted to settle or compromise any such claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

 

Section 8.6 No Knowledge of Breach; Mitigation; Other
Indemnification Provisions.

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no party shall
make an indemnification claim hereunder with respect to any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement to the extent that the liability underlying such claim were
accounted for in the adjustment to the Base Purchase Price or the Closing
Date Purchase Price, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof.

 

 

(b) Without limiting the computation of Losses as hereunder as set forth in
Section 8.4(a) hereof, to the extent that an Indemnitor makes any payment
pursuant to this Article VIII in respect of Losses for which the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be,
have a right to recover against a third party, the Indemnitor shall, if
applicable, after the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have recouped any amounts
not paid to them by the Indemnitor, including any amount not recouped as a
result of the Deductible, be subrogated to the right of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, to
seek and obtain recovery from such third party at the expense of the
Indemnitor; provided, however, that if the Indemnitor shall be prohibited
from such subrogation, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the Seller
Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, shall seek recovery from such third
party on the Indemnitor's behalf and expense and shall, subject to the
foregoing in respect of non-indemnified Losses, including the Deductible, pay
any such recovery to the Indemnitor, provided that any amount so paid to the
Indemnitor shall not exceed the amount of the indemnification payment made by
it hereunder.

 

 

Section 8.7 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Provisions. The parties
agree that any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall
be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

 

Section 8.8 Exclusivity. After the Closing, except for the rights of the
parties hereunder to specific performance or other equitable relief, except
pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof and except in the case of actual fraud, in
which case the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified
Parties reserve any and all rights and remedies available to them, the
indemnities set forth in this Article VIII shall be the exclusive remedies of
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties for any
breach of any representation or

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 


 

warranty or breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement,
and such parties shall not be entitled to a rescission of this Agreement or
to any further indemnification rights or claims of any nature whatsoever in
respect thereof, all of which Seller (on behalf of the Seller Indemnified
Parties) and Purchaser (on behalf of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties)
hereby waive to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.

Section 9.9 Seller Disclosure Schedule. Any matter disclosed in any Section
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed for all
purposes of the Agreement and all other Sections of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule set forth herein to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent that such disclosure is applicable to such other Sections of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule. The inclusion of any information in any Section
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or

intended only to allocate rights and risks between Purchaser and Seller and
are not intended to be admissions against interests, give rise to any
inference or proof of accuracy, be admissible against any party to this
Agreement by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement, or give rise to
any claim or benefit to any Person who is not a party to this Agreement. In
addition, the disclosure of any matter in the Seller Disclosure Schedule is
not to be deemed an admission that such matter actually constitutes non-
compliance with, or a violation of Law, any Permit or Contract or other topic
to which such disclosure is applicable. In no event shall the disclosure of
matters disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule be deemed or interpreted
to broaden Seller\'s representations and warranties, obligations, covenants,
conditions or agreements contained in this Agreement. The headings contained
in the Seller Disclosure Schedule are for convenience of reference only and
shall not be deemed to modify or influence the interpretation of the
information contained in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or this Agreement.

 

 

Section 9.10 Waiver and Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented only by a written mutual agreement executed and delivered by
Seller and Purchaser. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, any failure of any party to comply with any obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party entitled
to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party
granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligations, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

 

 

Section 9.11 Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when executed, shall be
deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to be one

be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement and shall have the right to
enforce the obligations of Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.7 hereof and (b)
each Company Employee shall be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement
and shall have the right to enforce the obligations of Purchaser relating to
the Company Severance Plan.

 

 

Section 9.13 Specific Performance. The parties agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at Law would exist and damages

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 

 


 

would be difficult to determine, and that the parties shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at
Law or in equity.

 

 

Section 9.14 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held
