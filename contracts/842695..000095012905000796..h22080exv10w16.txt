2.    Assignee's Representations and Acknowledgements. As a material inducement
      to Assignor to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Assignment,
      Assignee represents and acknowledges to Assignor as follows:

      (a) Assignee has made its own independent investigations, inspections and
      analyses of: (i) the Note and other Loan Documents described on Schedule I
      attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference (the "LOAN
      DOCUMENTS"); (ii) the validity and enforceability of the Note and other
      Loan Documents; (iii) the perfection or priority of any lien and security
      interests of the Loan Documents, if any, listed on Schedule I; (iv) the
      value, condition, quality, sufficiency of the description and amount of
      collateral purportedly covered and affected by the Loan Documents; and (v)
      the enforceability of any documentation related to, collateral for,
      nature, terms and tenor of and the rights, remedies of any holder with
      respect to, obligations or indebtedness of Borrower or any Guarantor to
      any creditor other than Assignor ("OTHER INDEBTEDNESS"), including without
      limitation, any Other Indebtedness subordinated to the payment and
      performance of the obligations and indebtedness of Borrower or any
      Guarantor under the Loan Documents. Assignee acknowledges that Assignor
      has attempted to provide accurate information to Assignee but that
      Assignor does not represent, warrant or insure the accuracy or
      completeness of any information or its sources of information provided to
      Assignee or in any of the Loan Documents. Assignee agrees and represents
      that the Note, the other Loan Documents and other information made
      available to Assignee were an adequate and sufficient basis on which to
      determine whether to purchase the Note. Assignee has not relied and will
      not rely on Assignor to furnish or make available to Assignee any
      documents or information regarding the credit, affairs, financial
      condition or business of Borrower or any Guarantor. Assignee has made such
      independent investigations as Assignee deems to be warranted into the
      nature, validity, enforceability, collectability, and value of the Note
      and the other Loan Documents, any Other Indebtedness and all other facts
      Assignee deems material to Assignee's purchase and is entering into this
      transaction solely on the basis of that investigation and Assignee's own
      judgment, and is not acting in reliance on any representation made or
      information furnished by Assignor, Assignor's affiliates or its employees,
      agents, representatives or independent contractors (other than the
      representations and warranties of Assignor contained herein). Assignee
      acknowledges that Assignor has not given Assignee any investment advice,
      credit information or opinion on whether the purchase of the Note is
      prudent.

      (b) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement do not involve, nor
      are they intended in any way to constitute, the sale of a "security" or
      "securities" within the meaning of any applicable securities laws, and
      none off the representations, warranties or agreements of Assignee shall
      create any inference that the transactions involve any "security" or
      "securities". Assignee acknowledges, understands and agrees that the
      acquisition of the Note involves a high degree of risk and is suitable
      only for persons or

                                Page 2 of 8 Pages
<PAGE>

      entities of substantial financial means who have no need for liquidity and
      who can hold the Note indefinitely or bear the partial or entire loss of
      the value of the Note and any collateral securing the Note. Assignee

      the Note; and (e) has such knowledge and experience and has made purchases
      of instruments of a similar nature, so as to be aware of the risks and
      uncertainties inherent in the type of transaction contemplated by this
      Agreement.

      (c) Assignee acknowledges that (i) Assignor currently may have, and later
      may come into possession of, information with respect to the Note and the
      other Loan Documents, Borrower, any Guarantor or any other matter related
      thereto that is not known to Assignee and that may be material to a
      decision to acquire the Note ("EXCLUDED INFORMATION"), (ii) Assignee has
      determined to purchase the Note notwithstanding its
      lack of knowledge of the Excluded Information; and (iii) Assignor shall
      have no liability to Assignee, and Assignee waives and releases any claims
      that it might have against Assignee or any Assignor Party, as defined
      below, whether under applicable law or otherwise, with respect to the
      nondisclosure of the Excluded Information in connection with the
      transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the Excluded
      Information shall not and does not affect the truth or accuracy of
      Assignor's representations or warranties in this Agreement.

      (d) Assignor has not made and does hereby specifically disclaim, in
      addition to and cumulative of the disclaimers contained in the Assignment,

      thereof with governmental codes, rules, regulations, orders and laws.

      (e) This Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement are legal, valid and
      binding obligations of Assignee enforceable in accordance with their
      respective terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency and
      other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally. The execution,
      delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Confidentiality
      Agreement have all been duly authorized by all necessary action; are
      within the power and authority of Assignee.

      (f) Assignee acknowledges that the Note is in default.

      or nondisclosure, mislead any person as to, or conceal from any person,

Attn: Michael B. Phillips

      RE: Confidentiality Agreement Ladies and Gentlemen:

      The undersigned has expressed an interest in purchasing from you an
Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Note dated April 30, 2002 (the same, as
heretofore modified, renewed and extended, is herein collectively referred to as
the "NOTE"), executed by Tidel Engineering, L.P.. ("BORROWER") in the original
principal amount of $4,680,000.00 and payable to your order. You have advised
the undersigned that any such purchase and sale would be with very limited
representations and warranties on your behalf and that the undersigned must rely
upon the results of its own investigations and analyses in electing to purchase
the Note. To assist in that effort, you have agreed to make available to the
undersigned certain information in your files and records in respect to the
Note, but your willingness to do so is conditioned upon the undersigned's
agreement to the terms and provisions hereof which shall be and are binding upon
the undersigned irrespective of whether or not the purchase and sale of the Note
is consummated.

      In consideration of your willingness to make available to the undersigned
information in your files and record in respect to the Note and the collateral
purportedly securing repayment of the same, the undersigned hereby agrees with
you as follows (each of which agreements and covenants shall bind the
undersigned irrespective of whether or not the undersigned consummates the
purchase and sale of the Note):

1.    The undersigned shall not have the right to review any portions of the
      records or information you have in your possession in respect to the Note,
      Borrower, the purported collateral for the Note or your relationship to
      Borrower or any guarantor in respect to the Note or otherwise other than
      the loan documents executed in connection with the Note. Without limiting
      the generality of the foregoing, the undersigned recognizes and agrees
      that you will provide no information in respect to the creditworthiness of
      Borrower or any other party liable for repayment of the Note, including
      personal financial statements, tax returns or credit applications of
      Borrower. The undersigned further recognizes and agrees that such
      information as is not delivered to the undersigned by you is not and will
      not be material to the undersigned in reaching its decision as to whether
      or not to purchase the Note.

2.    The undersigned will safeguard all information which the undersigned
      receives from you against unauthorized use or disclosure to others and
      agree to refrain from copying any such information provided by you. In the
      event that the undersigned does not consummate the purchase of the Note,
      the undersigned will return to you all copies of all information, files
      and records in respect to the Note which you provide to the

                                    Exhibit B
                                   Page 1 of 2
<PAGE>

      undersigned promptly upon your request therefor. The undersigned will
      retain no copies of any such information, files or records. The
      undersigned further agrees that you are not granting any license, right,
      title or interest in and to any materials which you may provide the
      undersigned.

3.    Until such time as the undersigned has purchased the Note, the undersigned
      will keep all information in respect to the Note and any of the documents,
      instruments and agreements executed in connection therewith or as security
      therefor, Borrower and any collateral purportedly securing repayment of
      the Note in the strictest confidence and shall not divulge the same to any
      party for any purpose (other than consultants employed by the undersigned
      but then only after such consultants execute and deliver to you agreements
      satisfactory to you wherein such parties agree to be bound by the terms
      and provisions of this letter agreement) except to the extent required to
      do so by court order or other legal process, provided however, the
      undersigned will be responsible for any disclosures of any such
      information by the undersigned in violation of applicable law and any such
      disclosures shall specifically be covered by and included in Section 4
      hereof. The undersigned recognizes that its agreement to keep confidential
      all such material and information is a material inducement to you in
      providing information from your files and records in respect to the Note
      and but for the undersigned's agreements set forth herein you would not do
      so. Until such time as the undersigned has purchased the Note, the
      undersigned further agrees to use such information solely for the purposes
      of evaluating whether or not it desires to purchase the Note and for no
      other purpose whatsoever.

4.    The undersigned hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold you harmless
      of, from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, causes of
      action, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees)
      hereafter suffered or incurred by you arising out of, directly or
      indirectly, the undersigned's failure to observe (and to cause its agents,
      contractors, employees and consultants to observe) and comply with the
      terms and provisions hereof. The indemnification obligations of the
      undersigned contained herein shall bind the undersigned, its successors
      and assigns, irrespective of whether or not the purchase of the Note is
      consummated.

5.    This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
      with the laws of the State of Texas, Harris County Texas, shall be a
      proper place of venue to enforce the terms and provisions hereof.

                                   Very truly yours,

                                   WALLIS STATE BANK
