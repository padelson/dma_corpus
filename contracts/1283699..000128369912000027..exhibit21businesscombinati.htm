0.5 of a share of MetroPCS Common Stock (the "MetroPCS Exchange Ratio") (the
"MetroPCS Reverse Stock Split"), by filing a Certificate of Amendment with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, providing for the amendment and
restatement of the Certificate of Incorporation of MetroPCS in the form of the
New MetroPCS Certificate. The New MetroPCS Certificate shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of MetroPCS from and after the Effective Time,
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein and/or in accordance
with its provisions and applicable Law (the date and time the New MetroPCS
Certificate becomes effective, the "Effective Time").

(b) Amendment of Bylaws. MetroPCS shall take all actions necessary so that,
effective as of the Effective Time, the amended Bylaws of MetroPCS shall be
amended and restated in the form of the New MetroPCS Bylaws, which shall be
the Bylaws of MetroPCS from and after the Effective Time, until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein, in the New MetroPCS Certificate and/or
in accordance with applicable Law.

(c) Cash Payment. As part of the recapitalization of MetroPCS, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and conditioned upon the
effectiveness of the MetroPCS Reverse Stock Split, effective immediately
following the Effective Time, MetroPCS shall make a payment (the "Cash
Payment") in cash in an amount equal to $1,500,000,000, without interest, in
the aggregate (the "MetroPCS Cash Amount"), to the MetroPCS Stockholders of
record immediately following the Effective Time, by paying to each such
MetroPCS Stockholder an amount per share of MetroPCS Common Stock held of
record by such holder immediately following the Effective Time (with the
number of shares of MetroPCS Common Stock held by 

such holder, for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account the MetroPCS
Reverse Stock Split) equal to the MetroPCS Cash Amount divided by the
aggregate number of shares of MetroPCS Common Stock (with the number of shares
of MetroPCS Common Stock, for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account the
MetroPCS Reverse Stock Split) outstanding immediately following the Effective
Time (the "MetroPCS Per-Share Cash Amount"). The amount to be paid to each
holder of record of MetroPCS Common Stock immediately following the Effective
Time shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

(d) MetroPCS Equity and Equity-Based Awards.

(i) Effective as of the Effective Time, and except as otherwise provided in
Section 2.1(d)(iii), each then outstanding option to purchase shares of
MetroPCS Common Stock (each, a "MetroPCS Stock Option") granted to or held by
any current or former employee, officer or director of, or consultant or other
service provider to, MetroPCS or any of its Affiliates shall be adjusted such
that (A) it shall become an option to purchase a number (rounded down to the
nearest whole number) of shares of MetroPCS Common Stock (an "Adjusted
MetroPCS Stock Option") equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of
MetroPCS Common Stock subject to such MetroPCS Stock Option immediately prior
to the MetroPCS Reverse Stock Split, multiplied by (2) the MetroPCS Exchange
Ratio, and (B) the per share exercise price for MetroPCS Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise of such Adjusted MetroPCS Stock Option shall be adjusted to
be equal to (rounded up to the nearest cent) (x) the quotient of (1) the
exercise price per share of MetroPCS Common Stock for which such MetroPCS
Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the MetroPCS Reverse Stock
Split, divided by (2) the MetroPCS Exchange Ratio, less (y) the MetroPCS Per-
Share Cash Amount (such adjusted per-share exercise price, the "Adjusted Per-
Share Option Exercise Price"). Except as otherwise provided in this Section
2.1(d)(i) and in Section 2.1(d)(ii), each Adjusted MetroPCS Stock Option shall
be subject to the same terms and conditions (including expiration dates and
exercise provisions, taking into account, to the extent applicable, Section
2.1(d)(ii) and Section 2.1(d)(iv)), as were applicable to the corresponding
MetroPCS Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. This Section
2.1(d)(i) is intended to comply with Section 409A (and, to the extent
applicable by reason of Section 409A, Section 424) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations issued thereunder and will be interpreted accordingly.

(ii) Effective as of the consummation of the Stock Purchase, each then
outstanding MetroPCS Stock Option (whether or not converted into an Adjusted
MetroPCS Stock Option) shall automatically and without any action on behalf of
the holder thereof, immediately vest and become exercisable in accordance with
its terms.

(iii) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(d)(i), (x) each MetroPCS Stock Option (other
than any Low Exercise Price MetroPCS Stock Option) with an exercise price per
share immediately prior to the Effective Time (ignoring any adjustment for the
MetroPCS Reverse Stock Split or the Cash Payment, including pursuant to
Section 2.1(d)(i)) that is less than the MetroPCS Closing Price (an "In-the-
Money MetroPCS Stock Option") shall, at the written election, as to all or any
portion of such In-the-Money MetroPCS Stock Option, of the holder of such In-
the-Money MetroPCS Stock Option made no later than five 

Business Days after the consummation of the Stock Purchase, and (y) each
MetroPCS Stock Option granted under the Second Amended and Restated 1995 Stock
Option Plan of MetroPCS that, if it were adjusted pursuant to Section
2.1(d)(i), would have an Adjusted Per-Share Option Exercise Price that is less
than or equal to zero (a "Low Exercise Price MetroPCS Stock Option"), shall,
automatically and without any action on behalf of the holder thereof, in each
case of (x) and (y) in lieu of becoming an Adjusted MetroPCS Stock Option, be
cancelled and converted, effective as of the consummation of the Stock
Purchase, into the right to receive from MetroPCS, as promptly as reasonably
practicable and in any event no later than 10 Business Days after the Closing
Date, in full settlement of such holder\'s right thereunder, an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to (A) the product of (1) the aggregate number
of shares of MetroPCS Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money MetroPCS Stock
Option (or portion thereof) for which the holder has elected to receive cash
pursuant to this Section 2.1(d)(iii) or Low Exercise Price MetroPCS Stock
Option, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time (and in each
case ignoring any adjustment for the MetroPCS Reverse Stock Split and the Cash
Payment, including pursuant to Section 2.1(d)(i)), multiplied by (2) the
amount by which the MetroPCS Closing Price exceeds the exercise price per
share of such In-the-Money MetroPCS Stock Option (or portion thereof) for
which the holder has elected to receive cash pursuant to this Section
2.1(d)(iii) or Low Exercise Price MetroPCS Stock Option, as applicable,
immediately prior to the Effective Time (and in each case ignoring any
adjustment for the MetroPCS Reverse Stock Split and the Cash Payment,
including pursuant to Section 2.1(d)(i)), less (B) any Taxes required to be
withheld from such payment.

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, the MetroPCS Reverse Stock Split and Cash
Payment contemplated by this Section 2.1 shall be deemed for all purposes of
the MetroPCS Benefit Plans (including each of MetroPCS\'s equity-based
compensation plans, as amended, identified on Schedule 3.3(h) of the MetroPCS
Disclosure Letter (the "MetroPCS Stock Plans")) to have occurred contingent
upon the consummation of the Stock Purchase such that, (A) there shall be a
"Change in Control", "Change of Control" and "Corporate Transaction", as
applicable, at the time of the consummation of the Stock Purchase under and
pursuant to the terms of the MetroPCS Benefit Plans (including the MetroPCS
Stock Plans) and (B) all severance, accelerated vesting, lapsing of
restrictions and other rights and benefits that accrue and become effective
under the MetroPCS Benefit Plans (including the MetroPCS Stock Plans) upon a
"Change in Control", "Change of Control" and "Corporation Transaction", as
applicable, as a result of the Transaction shall accrue and become effective
as of the consummation of the Stock Purchase pursuant to such MetroPCS Benefit
Plans (including the MetroPCS Stock Plans) and the provisions hereof. For the
further avoidance of doubt, the MetroPCS Reverse Stock Split and Cash Payment
shall together be deemed to constitute a "recapitalization" under each of the
MetroPCS Stock Plans, and the applicable provisions of each such MetroPCS
Stock Plan shall be construed accordingly. At or prior to the consummation of
the Stock Purchase, the MetroPCS Board (or the appropriate committee thereof)
and the boards of directors or management committees of its Subsidiaries shall
pass such resolutions as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this

Section 2.1(d), including to (x) ensure that all MetroPCS Stock Options that
are not converted into Adjusted MetroPCS Stock Options are cashed out and
cancelled effective as of the consummation of the Stock Purchase pursuant to
Section 2.1(d)(iii) (and the MetroPCS Stock Plans are hereby deemed amended 

to the extent necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.1(d))
and that no holder of any such cashed-out and cancelled MetroPCS Stock Option
shall have any right with respect thereto, except as provided in this Section
2.1(d) and (y) amend the award agreements with respect to any MetroPCS
Restricted Stock to permit the holder of such MetroPCS Restricted Stock to
receive and keep the Cash Payment contemplated by this Section 2.1.

(v) Prior to the Effective Time, MetroPCS shall deliver to each holder of the
MetroPCS Stock Options appropriate notices and, if applicable, election forms,
setting out the terms applicable to such MetroPCS Stock Options with respect
to the Transaction.

(e) Payment Agent; Deposit of MetroPCS Cash Amount. At or prior to the
Effective Time, MetroPCS shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a
commercial bank or trust company designated by MetroPCS and reasonably
satisfactory to DT (the "Payment Agent") for the benefit of the MetroPCS
Stockholders of record immediately following the Effective Time, (i) cash in
lieu of any fractional shares, to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(f)(v), and
(ii) cash in an amount equal to the MetroPCS Cash Amount (such deposited
amount described in clauses (i) and (ii), the "MetroPCS Cash Deposit");
provided, that, if the Closing does not occur, the Payment Agent shall return,
or cause to be returned, the MetroPCS Cash Deposit, and any interest or other
income thereon, to MetroPCS on the next Business Day following the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to its terms. Except as otherwise agreed to by the
parties, the investment of the MetroPCS Cash Deposit shall in all events be
limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully
guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States government, in
commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\'s Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements, other bank instruments or direct deposits
or banker\'s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$10,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank
that are then publicly available); provided, that no investment or loss
thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of MetroPCS Common Stock
pursuant to this Section 2.1. The MetroPCS Cash Deposit shall be used solely
for purposes of making the Cash Payment and paying any cash in lieu of
fractional shares to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(f)(v), and shall not be
used to satisfy any other obligation of MetroPCS, DT, TMUS or any of their
respective Subsidiaries.

(f) Exchange of Shares.

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.1(f) to the contrary, each
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of
MetroPCS Common Stock (each, a "MetroPCS Certificate") shall thereafter (and
without the necessity of presenting the same for exchange) represent that
number of shares of MetroPCS Common Stock into which the shares of MetroPCS
Common Stock represented by such MetroPCS Certificate shall have been combined
pursuant to the MetroPCS Reverse Stock Split, subject to the limitation on
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(f)(v).

(ii) As soon as practicable after the Closing, MetroPCS shall instruct the
Payment Agent to send to each holder of record of a MetroPCS Certificate
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (A) a letter of transmittal (which
shall be in customary form and 

shall specify, among other things, that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to such MetroPCS Certificate shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of such MetroPCS Certificate to the Payment Agent) and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such MetroPCS Certificate
in exchange for a new certificate representing that number of shares of
MetroPCS Common Stock into which the shares of MetroPCS Common Stock
represented by such MetroPCS Certificate shall have been combined pursuant to
the MetroPCS Reverse Stock Split, the portion of the MetroPCS Cash Amount that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the Cash Payment and cash in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(f)(v).

(iii) Upon surrender of a MetroPCS Certificate for cancellation to the Payment
Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, the Payment
Agent (A) shall register in the name of the holder of such MetroPCS
Certificate the number of whole shares of MetroPCS Common Stock (in the form
of book-entry shares, unless the holder of such MetroPCS Certificate expressly
requests in writing that such shares be delivered in certificated form)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of MetroPCS Common
Stock, if any, into which the shares of MetroPCS Common Stock represented by
such MetroPCS Certificate shall have been combined pursuant to the MetroPCS
Reverse Stock Split and (B) shall deliver to the holder of such MetroPCS
Certificate a check or wire transfer in same day funds for the amount equal to
the portion of the MetroPCS Cash Amount that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the Cash Payment and cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.1(f)(v). The MetroPCS Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. Promptly (and in any event no more than two
Business Days) after the Closing, with respect to each holder of book-entry
shares which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of
MetroPCS Common Stock ("MetroPCS Book-Entry Shares"), the Payment Agent (x)
shall register in the name of such holder the number of whole shares of
MetroPCS Common Stock (in the form of book-entry shares) representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of shares of MetroPCS Common Stock, if any, into
which such holder\'s MetroPCS Book-Entry Shares shall have been combined
pursuant to the MetroPCS Reverse Stock Split, and (y) deliver to such holder a
check or wire transfer in same day funds for the amount equal to the portion
of the MetroPCS Cash Amount that such holder has the right to receive pursuant
to the Cash Payment and cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.1(f)(v), without such holder being required to deliver a MetroPCS
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any MetroPCS Payment, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares or any other cash payments payable in respect of any such
securities pursuant to this Agreement.

(iv) If any shares of MetroPCS Common Stock that are combined pursuant to the
MetroPCS Reverse Stock Split are to be registered in the name of, or if any
cash in respect thereof is to be paid to, a Person other than that in whose
name the MetroPCS Certificate(s) surrendered pursuant to this Section 2.1(f)
is or are registered (whether as the result of a transfer of such shares or
otherwise), it shall be a condition to the registration of such shares and the
cash payments that (A) such certificate or certificates so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument or
instruments of transfer as MetroPCS or the Payment Agent may reasonably
request) and 

otherwise in proper form for transfer, (B) the Person requesting such
registration and payment shall pay to the Payment Agent in advance any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment or registration in
any name other than that of the registered holder of the shares represented by
the MetroPCS Certificate surrendered or required for any other reason, or
shall establish to the satisfaction of the Payment Agent that such Tax has
been paid or is not payable, and (C) the Person receiving such payment and in
whose name such shares are being registered (I) represents and warrants to
MetroPCS that such Person is entitled to such payment and shares being
registered and (II) agrees to indemnify MetroPCS from and against any and all
Damages resulting from, arising out of, or incurred in connection with any
claim that any other Person is entitled to such payment and shares being
registered.

(v) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of MetroPCS Common
Stock or book-entry credit of the same will be issued in connection with the
MetroPCS Reverse Stock Split, including upon the surrender for exchange of
shares of MetroPCS Common Stock, but in lieu thereof each MetroPCS Stockholder
who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of MetroPCS Common
Stock in connection with the MetroPCS Reverse Stock Split (after aggregating
all fractional shares of MetroPCS Common Stock to be received by such MetroPCS
Stockholder) shall receive an amount of cash (rounded up to the nearest whole
cent), without interest, equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by
the MetroPCS Closing Price.

(vi) Any portion of the MetroPCS Cash Deposit that remains unclaimed by
MetroPCS Stockholders or former MetroPCS Stockholders as of the first
anniversary of the Closing shall be paid to MetroPCS. Any MetroPCS
Stockholders or former MetroPCS Stockholders shall thereafter look only to
MetroPCS for the issuance of any certificates of MetroPCS Common Stock or
payment of any portion of the MetroPCS Cash Amount or cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of MetroPCS Common Stock such MetroPCS Stockholders or
former MetroPCS Stockholders are entitled to receive pursuant to this
Agreement, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of MetroPCS, the Payment Agent, any of their respective Representatives or any
other Person shall be liable to any MetroPCS Stockholder or former MetroPCS
Stockholder for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(vii) In the event any MetroPCS Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact in a form reasonably
acceptable to MetroPCS by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by MetroPCS, the posting by
such Person of a bond in such amount as MetroPCS may determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such certificate, the Payment Agent shall (A) register in the name
of the holder of such MetroPCS Certificate the number of whole shares of
MetroPCS Common Stock (in the form of book-entry shares, unless the holder of
such MetroPCS Certificate expressly requests in writing that such shares be
delivered in certificated form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole
number of shares of MetroPCS Common Stock, if any, into which the shares of
MetroPCS Common Stock represented by such MetroPCS Certificate shall have been
combined pursuant to the 

MetroPCS Reverse Stock Split and (B) deliver to the holder of such MetroPCS
Certificate a check or wire transfer in same day funds for the amount equal to
the portion of the MetroPCS Cash Amount that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the Cash Payment and cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.1(f)(v).

(g) Withholding Rights. The Payment Agent and MetroPCS shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the MetroPCS Cash Amount and any other amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the Payment Agent
or MetroPCS, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the
making of such payment (which deduction, in the case of the MetroPCS
Restricted Stock, shall be made from the shares into which such MetroPCS
Restricted Stock is combined pursuant to the MetroPCS Reverse Stock Split). To
the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Payment Agent or MetroPCS, as
the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made.

2.2 Stock Purchase. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Closing and effective immediately following the Cash
Payment:

(a) Holding will sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to MetroPCS, free
and clear of all Encumbrances, and MetroPCS will purchase, acquire and accept
from Holding, all of Holding\'s right, title and interest in and to TMUS
Shares, free and clear of all Encumbrances, and shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to MetroPCS certificates representing the TMUS Shares, duly endorsed
in blank or accompanied by stock powers duly endorsed in blank in proper form
for transfer, with appropriate transfer stamps, if any, affixed (the "Stock
Purchase"); provided that notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision
hereof, neither MetroPCS, TMUS nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall
assume or be obligated to pay, perform or otherwise discharge any (and DT
shall retain, pay, perform or otherwise discharge without recourse to
MetroPCS, TMUS or any of their Subsidiaries all, and as applicable shall
reimburse MetroPCS, TMUS and any of their Subsidiaries for their satisfaction
of any) Excluded Liabilities;

(b) MetroPCS shall issue and deliver (the "MetroPCS Share Issuance") to
Holding or its designee, a number of shares of MetroPCS Common Stock equal to
74% of the fully-diluted (as calculated under the treasury method based on the
MetroPCS Closing Price after taking into account the MetroPCS Reverse Stock
Split and the Cash Payment, but not taking into account any cancellation of
MetroPCS Stock Options pursuant to Section 2.1(d)(iii)) shares of MetroPCS
Common Stock outstanding immediately following the Cash Payment (on a grossed-
up basis to take into account the number of shares of MetroPCS Common Stock so
issued to Holding or its designee), which, at DT\'s election, may be
represented by one or more certificates or may be uncertificated (the "TMUS
Stock Consideration"); provided, that in the event of any dividend or
distribution (other than the Cash Payment), stock split, reverse stock split
(other than the MetroPCS Reverse Stock Split), stock dividend, reorganization,
reclassification, merger, combination, recapitalization, or other like change
with respect to or affecting shares of MetroPCS Common Stock (or in respect of
which a record date or effective date, as applicable, has been declared and
passed prior to the Effective Time), and including any stock repurchase or
redemption effected on a substantially pro rata basis or in which a majority
of the MetroPCS 

Stockholders participate, which occurs prior to the Effective Time and which
affects the number of shares of MetroPCS Common Stock that DT should equitably
receive, such number of shares of MetroPCS Common Stock shall be equitably
adjusted to the extent necessary to provide the parties the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such transaction or
declaration; and provided, further, that the MetroPCS Share Issuance shall be
made only in whole shares, and any fractional shares shall be rounded up to
the nearest whole share; and

(c) DT shall pay to TMUS the Estimated Adjustment Amount, if any.

2.3 Mergers. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, on the Business Day immediately following the Closing Date, unless
otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing in good faith:

(a) In accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL, MetroPCS shall cause MetroPCS
HoldCo to merge with and into MetroPCS OpCo (the "MetroPCS Merger"), whereupon
the separate existence of MetroPCS HoldCo shall cease and MetroPCS OpCo shall
continue its existence as the surviving corporation under the laws of the
State of Delaware. MetroPCS shall cause MetroPCS OpCo to file with the
Secretary of State of Delaware a certificate of merger, upon the filing of
which the MetroPCS Merger shall be effective. By virtue of the MetroPCS
Merger, (i) each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of
MetroPCS HoldCo issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness
of the MetroPCS Merger shall automatically be converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of MetroPCS OpCo,
and (ii) each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of MetroPCS
OpCo shall be automatically canceled. Prior to the Closing Date, MetroPCS
shall cause MetroPCS HoldCo and MetroPCS OpCo to enter into an agreement and
plan of merger reflecting the provisions of this Section 2.3(a).

(b) Immediately following the MetroPCS Merger, in accordance with Section 251
of the DGCL, MetroPCS shall cause MetroPCS OpCo to merge with and into TMUS
(the "TMUS Merger"), whereupon the separate existence of MetroPCS OpCo shall
cease and TMUS shall continue its existence as the surviving corporation under
the laws of the State of Delaware. MetroPCS shall cause TMUS to file with the
Secretary of State of Delaware a certificate of merger, upon the filing of
which the TMUS Merger shall be effective. By virtue of the TMUS Merger, (i)
each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of MetroPCS OpCo
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the TMUS
Merger shall automatically be canceled, and (ii) each share of common stock,
par value $0.000001 per share, of TMUS shall remain outstanding. Prior to the
Closing Date, MetroPCS shall cause MetroPCS OpCo to, and DT shall cause TMUS
to, and TMUS shall, enter into an agreement and plan of merger reflecting the
provisions of this Section 2.3(b), and MetroPCS and Holding shall provide such
consents as may be necessary or advisable to authorize the TMUS Merger.

2.4 Adjustment. (a) At least five Business Days prior to the expected Closing
Date (and in any event not more than 10 Business Days prior to the actual
Closing Date), DT shall prepare and deliver to MetroPCS a statement (the
"Estimated TMUS Closing Statement") consisting of a calculation in reasonable
detail (including calculations of the TMUS Working Capital and the Spending
Deficiency Amount) of the estimated Adjustment Amount, if any (the "Estimated
Adjustment Amount"). The Estimated TMUS Closing Statement shall be signed by a 

duly authorized officer of DT and prepared in good faith and in accordance
with the TMUS Applicable Accounting Principles and using the line items set
forth on the Sample TMUS Statement. DT shall provide to MetroPCS and its
Representatives such access to the books and records of TMUS and its
Subsidiaries and to any other information, including such access to TMUS\'s
and its Subsidiaries\' employees and work papers of their accountants (subject
to MetroPCS entering into, and such accountants agreeing to, a customary
agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such accountants), as MetroPCS shall reasonably
request, in connection with MetroPCS\'s review of the Estimated TMUS Closing
Statement and preparation of the TMUS Closing Statement. MetroPCS shall have
the right to object to the amounts contained in the Estimated TMUS Closing
Statement within two Business Days after the delivery of the Estimated TMUS
Closing Statement to MetroPCS. DT shall in good faith consider the objections,
if any, of MetroPCS to the Estimated TMUS Closing Statement and, if MetroPCS
has made any objections, will re-issue an Estimated TMUS Closing Statement
containing the Estimated Adjustment Amount no later than two Business Days
prior to the Closing Date with any such revisions that DT has determined in
good faith are appropriate.

(b) Closing Statement. As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date
(but in any event within 90 days thereafter), MetroPCS shall prepare, or cause
to be prepared, and deliver to DT a statement (the "TMUS Closing Statement")
consisting of a calculation in reasonable detail (including calculations of
the TMUS Working Capital and the Spending Deficiency Amount) of (i) the
Adjustment Amount, if any, and (ii) the amount, if any, payable pursuant to
Section 2.4(g). The TMUS Closing Statement shall be signed by a duly
authorized officer of MetroPCS and prepared in good faith and in accordance
with the TMUS Applicable Accounting Principles and using the line items set
forth on the Sample TMUS Statement.

(c) Access to Information. MetroPCS shall provide to DT and its
Representatives such access to the books and records of TMUS and its
Subsidiaries and to any other information, including such access to TMUS\'s
and its Subsidiaries\' employees and work papers of the accountants who
compiled or reviewed the TMUS Closing Statement or the underlying accounting
data (subject to DT entering into, and such accountants agreeing to, a
customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants), as DT shall reasonably
request, in connection with DT\'s review of the TMUS Closing Statement.

(d) Closing Statement Dispute Notice. The TMUS Closing Statement shall become
final, binding and conclusive upon DT and MetroPCS on the 45th day following
DT\'s receipt of the TMUS Closing Statement unless, if DT in good faith
disputes one or more items contained in the TMUS Closing Statement on the
basis that it was not prepared and calculated in accordance with this
Agreement or that there was a mathematical error (a "Disputed Item"), on or
prior to such 45th day, DT delivers to MetroPCS a written notice (a "TMUS
Closing Statement Dispute Notice") stating that DT disputes one or more
Disputed Items and specifying in reasonable detail each Disputed Item. If DT
timely delivers a TMUS Closing Statement Dispute Notice, all items in the TMUS
Closing Statement that are not Disputed Items shall be final, binding and
conclusive as to MetroPCS and DT for all purposes hereunder except for any
such items that must be changed or adjusted as a direct consequence of a
change or adjustment to a Disputed Item. 

(e) Resolution Period. If DT timely delivers a TMUS Closing Statement Dispute
Notice, then MetroPCS and DT shall seek in good faith to resolve the Disputed
Items during the 30-day period beginning on the date MetroPCS receives the
TMUS Closing Statement Dispute Notice (the "Resolution Period"). If MetroPCS
and DT reach agreement with respect to any Disputed Items, MetroPCS shall
revise the TMUS Closing Statement to reflect such agreement.

(f) Independent Accountant. If MetroPCS and DT are unable to resolve all
Disputed Items during the Resolution Period, then, at the request of either
party, MetroPCS and DT shall jointly engage and submit the unresolved Disputed
Items (the "Unresolved Items") to the Independent Accountant. MetroPCS and DT
shall enter into reasonable and customary arrangements for the services to be
rendered by the Independent Accountant, including a customary non-disclosure
agreement. MetroPCS and DT shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause
the Independent Accountant to issue its written determination regarding the
Unresolved Items within 30 days after such items are submitted to it for
resolution. The Independent Accountant shall make a determination with respect
to the Unresolved Items only and in a manner consistent with this Section 2.4
and the TMUS Applicable Accounting Principles. The Independent Accountant
shall limit its review only to the Unresolved Items. In reviewing any
Unresolved Items, the Independent Accountant may not assign a value to any
Unresolved Item that is greater than the greatest value or less than the
smallest value for such Unresolved Item claimed by either party. Each party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the Independent Accountant
such work papers and other documents and information pertaining to the
Unresolved Items as the Independent Accountant may reasonably request. The
determination of the Independent Accountant shall be final, binding and
conclusive on MetroPCS and DT absent manifest error. The fees, expenses and
costs of the American Arbitration Association, if applicable, and the
Independent Accountant shall be borne by DT and MetroPCS in the same
proportion as the aggregate amount of the Unresolved Items that is
unsuccessfully disputed by each (as determined by the Independent Accountant)
bears to the total amount of the Unresolved Items submitted to the Independent
Accountant.

(g) Final Adjustment. If (i) the Adjustment Amount as set forth on the TMUS
Closing Statement delivered by MetroPCS to DT if DT does not timely deliver a
TMUS Closing Statement Dispute Notice pursuant to Section 2.4(d), or as agreed
by MetroPCS and DT pursuant to Section 2.4(e), or as determined by the
Independent Accountant pursuant to Section 2.4(f), as applicable) (the "Actual
Adjustment Amount") exceeds the Estimated Adjustment Amount, then DT shall pay
to TMUS an amount equal to such excess, or (ii) the Estimated Adjustment
Amount exceeds the Actual Adjustment Amount, then TMUS shall pay to DT an
amount equal to such excess.

(h) Method of Payment, Interest, etc. Any amount paid pursuant to Section
2.4(g) shall be (i) increased by interest on such amount at an annual interest
rate equal to 4%, from the Closing Date to and including the date of payment
based on a 365 day year, and (ii) made within five Business Days after the
TMUS Closing Statement becomes final pursuant to Section 2.4(d), (e) or (f) by

3.2 Representations and Warranties Regarding TMUS and its Subsidiaries. Except
as set forth in the corresponding sections of the disclosure letter delivered
to MetroPCS by TMUS on or prior to entering into this Agreement (the "TMUS

all requisite power and authority to own and operate its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership or
operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
or to have such power and authority would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a TMUS Material Adverse Effect. Prior
to the date hereof, MetroPCS has been provided with complete and correct
copies of each of TMUS\'s and its Subsidiaries\' Organizational Documents, and
each as so delivered is in full force and effect.

(b) Capitalization.

Voting Debt of TMUS or any securities or obligations exercisable or
exchangeable for, or convertible into, any Equity Interests or Voting Debt of
TMUS, and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized,
issued or outstanding.

(iii) The outstanding shares of TMUS Common Stock are not subject to any
voting trust agreement or other contract, agreement or arrangement to which

and its Subsidiaries for the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 and a

involved, except as may be noted therein or in the notes thereto, (B) present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of TMUS

accurately reflect in all material respects the books of account and other
financial records of TMUS and its Subsidiaries.

(ii) Neither TMUS nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Liabilities except for
(A) Liabilities reflected or reserved against on the balance sheet as of
December 31, 2011 included in, or otherwise disclosed in, the TMUS Financial
Statements and not heretofore paid or discharged, (B) Liabilities incurred
since December 31, 2011 in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice or (C) Liabilities that would not, individually or in the

the Liabilities of TMUS and its Subsidiaries arose, directly or indirectly,
out of or in connection with the assets used in, or the operations of, the
business of TMUS and its Subsidiaries (including products, services, assets
and operations ancillary thereto).

(iii) TMUS has designed and maintains a system of internal controls over
financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and provides reasonable
assurance that fraud is detected and prevented.

(iv) Since December 31, 2009, to the Knowledge of TMUS, no attorney
representing TMUS or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by TMUS
or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported to TMUS\'s chief legal officer, chief
executive officer, audit committee or the TMUS Board evidence of a material
violation of securities laws, material breach of fiduciary duty or similar
material violation of law, relating to periods after December 31, 2009.

(f) Litigation. As of the date hereof, there is no civil, criminal or
administrative action, suit, demand, claim, hearing, proceeding or
investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of TMUS, threatened, against TMUS
or any of its Subsidiaries, except those that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a TMUS Material Adverse Effect.
Neither TMUS nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or subject to the
provisions of, any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or award of any
Governmental Entity that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be likely to have a TMUS Material Adverse Effect. No representation or
warranty is made in this Section 3.2(f) with respect to Tax matters, which
shall be governed exclusively by Section 3.2(g) (Employee Benefits) and 3.2(l)
(Taxes), or environmental matters, which shall be governed exclusively by
Section 3.2(k) (Environmental Matters).

(g) Employee Benefits.

(i) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, agreements, policies or
arrangements sponsored or contributed to by TMUS or any of its Subsidiaries,
including those covering any of its past or present employees, officers or
directors (or for which 

TMUS or any of its Subsidiaries could have any liability), including "employee
benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and employment agreements,
collective bargaining agreements, deferred compensation, change of control,
retention, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock appreciation,
phantom share, stock based, incentive, severance and bonus plans (other than
any immaterial benefit plans) (the "TMUS Benefit Plans") in effect as of the
date hereof are listed on Schedule 3.2(g) of the TMUS Disclosure Letter. True
and complete copies of all TMUS Benefit Plans listed on Schedule 3.2(g) of the
TMUS Disclosure Letter, and of all related material funding documents,
actuarial and financial reports, government correspondence, summary plan
descriptions, annual reports, IRS determination letters, and audit reports
have been provided or made available to MetroPCS prior to the date hereof.

(ii) Each TMUS Benefit Plan was established and, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a TMUS Material
Adverse Effect, has been documented, maintained and administered in compliance
in all respects with the terms thereof and the applicable requirements of
ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and any
other applicable Law. Each TMUS Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination or
opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") with respect to
its qualified status under Section 401(a) of the Code or has pending or has
time remaining in which to file an application for such determination from the
IRS (or TMUS and its Subsidiaries are entitled to rely on a favorable opinion
or advisory letter issued by the IRS in accordance with Revenue Procedure
2005-16 with respect to the qualified status of the plan document), and, to
the Knowledge of TMUS, there is no fact or circumstance that exists that
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to adversely
affect or give rise to the revocation of such qualified status. All
contributions required to be made under the terms of any TMUS Benefit Plan or
applicable Law (including all employer contributions and employee salary
reduction contributions) have been timely made or are reflected in the TMUS
Financial Statements as of the dates thereof. All unfunded liabilities, if
any, under the TMUS Benefit Plans are fully reflected in the TMUS Financial
Statements. No event has occurred and no condition exists that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to subject TMUS or any
of its Subsidiaries to any material Tax, fine, lien, penalty or other
liability imposed by ERISA or the Code or other applicable Law in respect of
any TMUS Benefit Plan.

(iii) Neither TMUS nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains or contributes to or has
within the past six complete calendar years maintained or contributed to, or
been required to contribute to, or otherwise has any direct or indirect
liability with respect to, an "employee pension benefit plan" (within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, is a
"multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA) or is a
multiple employer plan (within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA or Section
413(c) of the Code). Except as required by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, or similar state or local law or as is
reflected on the TMUS Financial Statements, neither TMUS nor any ERISA
Affiliate is obligated to provide any retiree health or life insurance
benefits to any employee or former employees of TMUS or any ERISA Affiliate.
Each TMUS Benefit Plan can be 

amended or terminated at any time without liability, other than liability for
benefits accrued as of the date of any such amendment or termination.

(iv) Excluding routine, uncontested claims for benefits under any TMUS Benefit
Plan and except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a TMUS Material Adverse Effect, (A) there is no action, suit,
demand, audit, claim, hearing, proceeding or investigation pending against or
involving or, to the Knowledge of TMUS, threatened, against or involving any
TMUS Benefit Plan before any court or arbitrator or any Governmental Entity,
or federal, state or local official that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to subject TMUS or any of its Subsidiaries to
a liability, except those first arising after the date hereof in the ordinary
course of business, and (B) to the Knowledge of TMUS, there are no facts or
circumstances existing that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to give rise to such actions, suits, demands, audits,
claims, hearings or proceedings.

(v) No agreement, binding commitment or obligation exists to materially
increase benefits under, or adopt any new, TMUS Benefit Plan. There is no
provision of any TMUS Benefit Plan or other related contract or agreement, and
there has been no amendment to or announcement by, TMUS or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any TMUS Benefit Plan that would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the
most recent fiscal year.

(vi) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transaction will (whether alone or in connection with any other related
event(s)): (A) entitle any employee of TMUS or any of its Subsidiaries to
severance pay or any increase in severance pay (or other compensation or
benefits) upon any termination of employment; (B) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor
trust or otherwise) of any compensation or benefits under, or increase the
amount payable pursuant to, or result in the deemed satisfaction of vesting
conditions, goals or any other requirements or conditions under, any of the
TMUS Benefit Plans; (C) limit or restrict the right of TMUS or any of its
Subsidiaries or, after the consummation of the Transaction, MetroPCS or any of
its Subsidiaries, to merge, amend or terminate any of the TMUS Benefit Plans
(other than solely pursuant to applicable Law); or (D) result in the creation,
increase, forgiveness, extension or modification of any loan to any employee,
officer or director of TMUS or any of its Subsidiaries.

(vii) No TMUS Benefit Plan or other TMUS practice provides any Person with any
amount of additional compensation if such individual is provided amounts
subject to excise or additional taxes imposed under Section 409A or 4999 of
the Code.

(viii) Each TMUS Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined under Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) is, except as would
not result in a material liability, in documentary compliance with Section
409A of the Code and the guidance provided thereunder and has been operated
and administered in compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of
the Code and the guidance provided thereunder. 

(h) Compliance with Laws; Licenses.

(i) The business of TMUS and its Subsidiaries has been, and is being,
conducted in compliance with all federal, state, local and foreign laws,
statutes and ordinances, common law and all rules, regulations, guidelines,
standards, judgments, orders, writs, injunctions, decrees, arbitration awards,
agency requirements, licenses and permits of any Governmental Entity
(collectively, "Laws"), except for violations that would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a TMUS Material Adverse Effect.
No investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to TMUS or
any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the Knowledge of TMUS, threatened,
nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same,
except for such investigations or reviews that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a TMUS Material Adverse Effect.
Each of TMUS and its Subsidiaries has obtained and is in compliance with all
permits, licenses, certifications, approvals, registrations, consents,
authorizations, franchises, variances, exemptions and orders issued or granted
by a Governmental Entity ("Licenses") necessary to conduct its business as
presently conducted, except those the absence of which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a TMUS Material Adverse
Effect (the "TMUS Material Licenses").

(ii) Schedule 3.2(h)(ii) of the TMUS Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list, as of the date hereof, of (A) all TMUS Material Licenses and,
to the extent not otherwise constituting TMUS Material Licenses, all Licenses

regulating telecommunications businesses ("TMUS State Licenses"), and all
Licenses issued or granted to TMUS or any of its Subsidiaries by foreign
Governmental Entities regulating telecommunications businesses (collectively
with the TMUS Material Licenses, TMUS FCC Licenses and TMUS State Licenses,
the "TMUS Communications Licenses"); (B) all pending applications for

be likely to have a TMUS Material Adverse Effect.

Licenses are issued in the name of TMUS or one of its Subsidiaries. The TMUS
Communications Licenses are in full force and effect, are granted without

Communications Licenses or conditions generally applicable to all similarly

which might, individually or in the aggregate, limit the full operation of the
TMUS Communications Licenses in any material respect.

except that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely
to have a TMUS Material Adverse Effect. Appropriate notification to the FAA
has been made for each transmission tower owned or leased by TMUS and its
Subsidiaries to the extent required to be made by TMUS or any of its

Act and the rules and regulations of the FCC to hold the TMUS FCC Licenses

Property and Leased Real Property, which are adequately maintained and are in
good operating condition and repair for the requirements of the business of

(iv) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to result in a TMUS Material Adverse Effect, (A) TMUS and its
Subsidiaries have good and marketable title to or, in the case of leased
assets, a valid leasehold interest in, free and clear of all Encumbrances

operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such

(i) MetroPCS has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis all
MetroPCS SEC Reports since December 31, 2009. Each of the MetroPCS SEC

filed or furnished, will comply, in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the
MetroPCS SEC Reports. As of their respective dates (or, if amended prior to

statements of income and comprehensive income, changes in stockholders\'
equity and cash flows of MetroPCS and its consolidated Subsidiaries included
in or incorporated by reference into the MetroPCS SEC Reports (including any

financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting for MetroPCS and its Subsidiaries. MetroPCS
(A) has designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by MetroPCS in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\'s rules and forms and
is accumulated and communicated to MetroPCS\'s management (including
MetroPCS\'s principal executive and principal financial officers, or Persons
performing similar functions) as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and (B) based on its most recent evaluation of
internal control prior to the date hereof, has disclosed to MetroPCS\'s
auditors and the audit committee of the MetroPCS Board (I) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect MetroPCS\'s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (II) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in MetroPCS\'s
internal control over financial reporting, except with respect to clause (A),
those failures to design or maintain that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be material to MetroPCS and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
MetroPCS has made available to DT a summary of any such disclosure made by
management to MetroPCS\'s auditors and to the audit committee since December
31, 2009. Since December 31, 2009, to the Knowledge of MetroPCS, no attorney
representing MetroPCS or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by
MetroPCS or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported to 

MetroPCS\'s chief legal officer, chief executive officer, audit committee or

letters from the staff of the SEC since December 31, 2009 relating to MetroPCS
SEC Reports and all written responses of MetroPCS thereto through the date
hereof. As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments
in comment letters received from the SEC staff with respect to any MetroPCS
SEC Reports. To the Knowledge of MetroPCS, there are no SEC inquiries or
investigations, other governmental inquiries or investigations or internal
investigations pending or threatened involving MetroPCS or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case regarding any accounting practices of MetroPCS or
any of its Subsidiaries.

(g) Litigation. As of the date hereof, there is no civil, criminal or
administrative action, suit, demand, claim, hearing or proceeding or
investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of MetroPCS, threatened, against
MetroPCS or any of its Subsidiaries, except those that would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a MetroPCS Material Adverse
Effect. Neither MetroPCS nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or subject
to the provisions of, any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or award
of any Governmental Entity that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a MetroPCS Material Adverse Effect. No
representation or warranty is made in this Section 3.3(g) with respect to Tax
matters, which shall be governed exclusively by Section 3.3(h) (Employee
Benefits) and 3.3(m) (Taxes), or environmental matters, which shall be
governed exclusively by Section 3.3(l) (Environmental Matters).

(h) Employee Benefits.

(i) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, agreements, policies or
arrangements sponsored or contributed to by MetroPCS or any of its
Subsidiaries, including those covering any of its past or present employees,
officers or directors (or for which MetroPCS or any of its Subsidiaries could
have any liability), including "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of ERISA, and employment agreements, collective bargaining
agreements, deferred compensation, change of control, retention, stock option,
stock purchase, restricted stock, stock appreciation, phantom share, stock
based, incentive, severance and bonus plans (other than any immaterial benefit
plans) (the "MetroPCS Benefit Plans") in effect as of the date hereof are
listed on Schedule 3.3(h) of the MetroPCS Disclosure Letter. True and complete
copies of all MetroPCS Benefit Plans listed on Schedule 3.3(h) of the MetroPCS
Disclosure Letter, and of all related material funding documents, actuarial
and financial reports, government correspondence, summary plan descriptions,
annual reports, IRS determination letters, and audit reports have been
provided or made available to DT prior to the date hereof.

(ii) Each MetroPCS Benefit Plan was established and, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a MetroPCS
Material Adverse Effect, has been documented, maintained and administered in
compliance in all respects with the terms thereof and the applicable
requirements of ERISA, the Code, and 

any other applicable Law. Each MetroPCS Benefit Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination or opinion letter from the IRS with respect to its qualified
status under Section 401(a) of the Code or has pending or has time remaining
in which to file an application for such determination from the IRS (or
MetroPCS and its Subsidiaries are entitled to rely on a favorable opinion or
advisory letter issued by the IRS in accordance with Revenue Procedure 2005-16
with respect to the qualified status of the plan document), and, to the
Knowledge of MetroPCS, there is no fact or circumstance that exists that
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to adversely
affect or give rise to the revocation of such qualified status. All
contributions required to be made under the terms of any MetroPCS Benefit Plan
or applicable Law (including all employer contributions and employee salary
reduction contributions) have been timely made or are reflected in the
MetroPCS Financial Statements as of the dates thereof. All unfunded
liabilities, if any, under the MetroPCS Benefit Plans are fully reflected in
the MetroPCS Financial Statements. No event has occurred and no condition
exists that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to
subject MetroPCS or any of its Subsidiaries to any material Tax, fine, lien,
penalty or other liability imposed by ERISA or the Code or other applicable
Law in respect of any MetroPCS Benefit Plan.

(iii) Neither MetroPCS nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains or contributes to or
has within the past six complete calendar years maintained or contributed to,
or been required to contribute to, or otherwise has any direct or indirect
liability with respect to, an "employee pension benefit plan" (within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, is a
"multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA) or is a
multiple employer plan (within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA or Section
413(c) of the Code). Except as required by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, or similar state or local law, or as
is reflected on the MetroPCS Financial Statements, neither MetroPCS nor any
ERISA Affiliate is obligated to provide any retiree health or life insurance
benefits to any employee or former employees of MetroPCS or any ERISA
Affiliate. Each MetroPCS Benefit Plan can be amended or terminated at any time
without liability, other than liability for benefits accrued as of the date of
any such amendment or termination.

(iv) Excluding routine, uncontested claims for benefits under any MetroPCS
Benefit Plan and except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a MetroPCS Material Adverse Effect, (A) there is
no action, suit, demand, audit, claim, hearing, proceeding or investigation
pending against or involving or, to the Knowledge of MetroPCS, threatened,
against or involving any MetroPCS Benefit Plan before any court or arbitrator
or any Governmental Entity, or federal, state or local official that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to subject MetroPCS or
any of its Subsidiaries to a liability, except those first arising after the
date hereof in the ordinary course of business, and (B) to the Knowledge of
MetroPCS, there are no facts or circumstances existing that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to give rise to such
actions, suits, demands, audits, claims, hearings or proceedings. 

(v) No agreement, binding commitment or obligation exists to materially
increase benefits under, or adopt any new, MetroPCS Benefit Plan. There is no
provision of any MetroPCS Benefit Plan or other related contract or agreement,
and there has been no amendment to or announcement by, MetroPCS or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any MetroPCS Benefit Plan that would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the
most recent fiscal year.

(vi) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transaction will (whether alone or in connection with any other related
event(s)): (A) entitle any employee of MetroPCS or any of its Subsidiaries to
severance pay or any increase in severance pay (or other compensation or
benefits) upon any termination of employment; (B) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor
trust or otherwise) of any compensation or benefits under, or increase the
amount payable pursuant to, or result in the deemed satisfaction of vesting
conditions, goals or any other requirements or conditions under, any of the
MetroPCS Benefit Plans; (C) limit or restrict the right of MetroPCS or any of
its Subsidiaries or, after the consummation of the Transaction, DT or any of
its Subsidiaries (including MetroPCS and any of its Subsidiaries), to merge,
amend or terminate any of the MetroPCS Benefit Plans (other than solely
pursuant to applicable Law); or (D) result in the creation, increase,
forgiveness, extension or modification of any loan to any employee, officer or
director of MetroPCS or any of its Subsidiaries.

(vii) No MetroPCS Benefit Plan or other MetroPCS practice provides any Person
with any amount of additional compensation if such individual is provided
amounts subject to excise or additional taxes imposed under Section 409A or
4999 of the Code.

(viii) Each MetroPCS Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined under Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) is,
except as would not result in a material liability, in documentary compliance
with Section 409A of the Code and the guidance provided thereunder and has
been operated and administered in compliance in all material respects with
Section 409A of the Code and the guidance provided thereunder.

(i) Compliance with Laws; Licenses.

(i) The business of MetroPCS and its Subsidiaries has been, and is being,
conducted in compliance with all Laws, except for violations that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a MetroPCS
Material Adverse Effect. No investigation or review by any Governmental Entity
with respect to MetroPCS or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the
Knowledge of MetroPCS, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated
an intention to conduct the same, except for such investigations or reviews
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have
a MetroPCS Material Adverse Effect. Each of MetroPCS and its Subsidiaries has
obtained and is in compliance with all Licenses necessary to conduct its
business as presently conducted, except those the absence of which would not,
individually or in the ag- 

gregate, reasonably be likely to have a MetroPCS Material Adverse Effect (the
"MetroPCS Material Licenses").

(ii) Schedule 3.3(i)(ii) of the MetroPCS Disclosure Letter sets forth a true
and complete list, as of the date hereof, of (A) all MetroPCS Material
Licenses and, to the extent not otherwise constituting MetroPCS Material

assets, a valid leasehold interest in, free and clear of all Encumbrances

(u) TMUS Stock Consideration.



(i) Assuming the accuracy of DT\'s representations and warranties set forth in
Section 7.13, upon issuance, the TMUS Stock Consideration will be fully paid,
nonassessable, issued in compliance with all applicable Laws concerning the
issuance of securities and not in violation of any preemptive rights, purchase
option, call, right of first refusal or any similar right granted by MetroPCS,
and not be subject to any voting trust

Agreement) with respect to the TMUS Stock Consideration and (ii) no Flip In

occurred as a result of the execution, delivery or performance of this

(w) Required Vote of MetroPCS Stockholders. The only vote of holders of
MetroPCS capital stock necessary to approve the Transaction is the MetroPCS
Stockholder Approval.

(other than (i) the fact of the Stock Purchase, (ii) the fact of the MetroPCS
Finance Transactions and (iii)(x) with respect to the MetroPCS Merger, the
fact of TMUS Merger and (y) with respect to the TMUS Merger, the fact of the
MetroPCS Merger) that would prevent or impede, or would be reasonably likely
to prevent or impede, the MetroPCS Merger or the TMUS Merger from qualifying
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. There
are no material intercompany gains (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-13) with respect to the stock of MetroPCS HoldCo or MetroPCS
OpCo that will be required to be included in taxable income as a result of the
MetroPCS Merger or the TMUS Merger.

implied representation or warranty with respect or relating to DT, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any information provided to MetroPCS or any other Person, or
MetroPCS\'s use of any such information, including any information, documents,
projections, forecasts or other material made available to MetroPCS in certain
"data rooms" or management presentations in 

expectation of the Transaction, and MetroPCS has not relied on such
information or any other representation or warranty not set forth in this

4.3 Proxy Statement.

(a) MetroPCS and DT shall cooperate to, and MetroPCS shall, as promptly as
practicable following the date hereof, and in no event later than 45 calendar
days following the date hereof (unless DT fails to furnish information
relating to TMUS that is required by the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder to be included in the Proxy Statement, or
delays furnishing such information to a time when it is no longer practicable
for MetroPCS to meet such deadline, in which case such deadline shall be
extended to the first practicable date following the furnishing of such
information), prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement. DT shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, promptly furnish to MetroPCS all the
information relating to them required by the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder to be included in the Proxy Statement and
any other information reasonably requested by MetroPCS. MetroPCS shall use its
reasonable best efforts, and DT shall cooperate with MetroPCS, to resolve all
SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable
after receipt thereof. MetroPCS shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Proxy Statement in definitive form to be mailed to the MetroPCS
Stockholders as promptly as practicable following the clearance of the Proxy
Statement by the SEC.

(b) DT hereby covenants and agrees with MetroPCS that the Proxy Statement (at
the time it is first mailed to the MetroPCS Stockholders and at the time of
the MetroPCS Stockholders Meeting) will not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; provided, however, that this Section 4.3(b) shall apply only
to information contained in the Proxy Statement that was supplied by DT or any
of its Subsidiaries expressly for inclusion therein.

(c) MetroPCS hereby covenants and agrees with DT that the Proxy Statement (at
the time it is first mailed to the MetroPCS Stockholders and at the time of
the MetroPCS 

Stockholders Meeting) will not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
provided, however, that this Section 4.3(c) shall not apply to information
contained in the Proxy Statement that was supplied by DT or any of its
Subsidiaries expressly for inclusion therein.

(d) If at any time prior to obtaining the MetroPCS Stockholder Approval, any
information relating to a party hereto, or any of its respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by such party that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, such party shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto in writing thereof and MetroPCS will
use its reasonable best efforts to file an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information with the SEC and, to the extent required under
applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement to the MetroPCS
Stockholders prior to the MetroPCS Stockholders Meeting; provided that the
delivery of such notice and the filing or dissemination of any such amendment
or supplement shall not affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by any party hereunder or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to any party.

4.4 MetroPCS Stockholders Meeting.

(a) Provided that there shall not have been a MetroPCS Adverse Recommendation
Change permitted by Section 4.5(e), MetroPCS shall include in the Proxy
Statement the recommendation of the MetroPCS Board that the MetroPCS
Stockholders approve the New MetroPCS Certificate and the MetroPCS Share
Issuance (the "MetroPCS Recommendation") and use reasonable best efforts to
(i) solicit from the MetroPCS Stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of
the New MetroPCS Certificate and the MetroPCS Share Issuance and (ii) take all
other actions necessary or advisable to secure such approval.

(b) MetroPCS agrees to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
MetroPCS Stockholders Meeting in no event later than 45 Business Days
following clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC; provided that (i) (A)
MetroPCS may postpone or adjourn the MetroPCS Stockholders Meeting to a date
no more than 15 days after its originally noticed date, and (B) MetroPCS shall
postpone or adjourn the MetroPCS Stockholders Meeting to a date no more than
15 days after its originally noticed date at the request of DT, in each case
of clauses (A) and (B) only to the extent reasonably required in order to
solicit additional proxies so as to establish a quorum and obtain the MetroPCS
Stockholder Approval, and (ii) MetroPCS may postpone or adjourn the MetroPCS
Stockholders Meeting to allow time for the filing and dissemination of any
supplemental or amended disclosure document that the MetroPCS Board has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
is necessary or required to be filed and disseminated under applicable Laws.

4.5 No Solicitation - MetroPCS.

(a) Upon execution of this Agreement, MetroPCS and its Subsidiaries shall, and
shall cause their respective directors and officers and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to 

cause their other Representatives to, cease and terminate any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to a
MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal. MetroPCS shall promptly after the date hereof
instruct each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement
relating to a MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal with or for the benefit of
MetroPCS promptly to return to MetroPCS or destroy all information, documents,
and materials relating to the MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal or to MetroPCS or
its businesses, operations or affairs heretofore furnished by MetroPCS or any
of its Representatives to such Person or any of its Representatives in
accordance with the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such Person.

(b) Except as provided in Section 4.5(c), MetroPCS agrees that neither it nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall, that it shall not authorize or permit any of
its and their respective directors and officers to, and that it shall not
authorize, and shall use its reasonable best efforts not to permit, any of its
and their other respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly take or continue any
other action to facilitate the submission of any inquiry, indication of
interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected
to lead to, a MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or that would reasonably be expected to
lead to, any MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal (other than to inform a Person of
the existence of this Section 4.5), (iii) furnish any non-public information
or data regarding MetroPCS or any of its Subsidiaries to, or afford access to
the properties, personnel, books and records of MetroPCS to, any Person (other
than DT and its Subsidiaries) in connection with or in response to or in
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any MetroPCS
Acquisition Proposal, (iv) take any action to make the provisions of any "fair
price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination" or
other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (including any transaction
under, or a third party becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Section
203 of the DGCL), or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover
provision in MetroPCS\'s Organizational Documents or the MetroPCS Rights
Agreement, inapplicable to any Person other than DT and its Subsidiaries or to
any transactions constituting or contemplated by a MetroPCS Acquisition
Proposal, or (v) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.

(c) Notwithstanding Section 4.5(b) or anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, from the date hereof and prior to the receipt of the MetroPCS
Stockholder Approval, if (i) MetroPCS or its Representatives receive a bona
fide, unsolicited written MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal that did not result
from a breach of this Section 4.5 and that the MetroPCS Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a MetroPCS
Superior Proposal, (ii) the MetroPCS Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action with respect to such MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the MetroPCS Board\'s fiduciary obligations to
MetroPCS and/or the MetroPCS Stockholders under applicable Law, and (iii)
MetroPCS timely provides to DT in accordance with Section 4.5(f) the
information required under Section 4.5(f) to be delivered by MetroPCS to DT,
then MetroPCS may take the following actions, provided that MetroPCS first
receives from the third party making such MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal (a
"MetroPCS Qualified Bidder") an executed confidentiality agreement (the terms
of which are no less favorable in any material respect to MetroPCS than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement): (x) furnish, or cause to be
furnished, information to the MetroPCS Qualified Bidder 

and its Representatives; and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with
the MetroPCS Qualified Bidder and its Representatives with respect to the
MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal. Unless such information has previously been
provided to DT, all non-public written information that is provided to the
MetroPCS Qualified Bidder shall be substantially concurrently provided to DT.

(d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.5(e), neither the MetroPCS Board
nor any committee of the MetroPCS Board may (i) withdraw or withhold, amend,
modify or qualify in any manner adverse to DT the MetroPCS Recommendation or
make any public announcement inconsistent with the MetroPCS Recommendation, or
publicly propose to do any of the foregoing, (ii) approve, adopt, endorse,
recommend, or take a neutral position (other than any factually accurate
public statement by MetroPCS that solely describes MetroPCS\'s receipt of a
MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect
thereto or any "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication
of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) on any
MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably
be expected to lead to a MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal, (iii) following the
date any MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal or any material modification thereto is
first made public, sent or given to the stockholders of MetroPCS, fail to
issue a press release that expressly reaffirms the MetroPCS Recommendation
within 10 Business Days following DT\'s written request to do so (which
request may only be made once with respect to any such MetroPCS Acquisition
Proposal and each material modification thereto), (iv) fail to include the
MetroPCS Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in clause
(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), whether taken by MetroPCS, the MetroPCS Board or any
committee thereof, being referred to as a "MetroPCS Adverse Recommendation
Change"), or (v) cause or permit MetroPCS to enter into any MetroPCS Contract,
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, or agreement in principle
regarding or providing for any MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement as contemplated by Section 4.5(c)) or requiring
MetroPCS to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate the Transaction.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, including Section 4.5(d), at
any time prior to the receipt of the MetroPCS Stockholder Approval, the
MetroPCS Board may effect a MetroPCS Adverse Recommendation Change in response
to an Intervening Event or in response to a MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal
(provided that, if the MetroPCS Adverse Recommendation Change relates to a
MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal (a "MetroPCS Superior Proposal Adverse
Recommendation Change"), the MetroPCS Board shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that such MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal constitutes a MetroPCS
Superior Proposal and such MetroPCS Superior Proposal is not withdrawn), if
the MetroPCS Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
MetroPCS\'s outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would reasonably be
likely to be inconsistent with the MetroPCS Board\'s fiduciary obligations to
MetroPCS and/or the MetroPCS Stockholders under applicable Law; provided,
however, that such actions may only be taken (A) if MetroPCS shall have
complied with this Section 4.5 (except for any immaterial violation of this
Section 4.5 that is not reasonably related to such MetroPCS Adverse
Recommendation Change), (B) at a time that is after the fifth Business Day
following DT\'s receipt of written notice from MetroPCS that the MetroPCS
Board is prepared to take such action (the "MetroPCS Subsequent Determination
Notice"), which notice will set forth MetroPCS\'s reason for delivery of the
MetroPCS Subsequent Determination Notice, and (1) in the case of a MetroPCS
Superior Proposal Adverse Recommendation Change, specify the terms of the
MetroPCS Superior Pro- 

posal that is the subject thereof, including the identity of the Person making
such MetroPCS Superior Proposal and (2) in the case of an Intervening Event,
include a description of the Intervening Event (it being agreed that the
delivery of a MetroPCS Subsequent Determination Notice, in each case, shall
not in and of itself be deemed a MetroPCS Adverse Recommendation Change), and
(C) if at the end of such five Business Day period, the MetroPCS Board
determines in good faith, taking into account all amendments or revisions
committed to by DT, (x) after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
MetroPCS Board\'s fiduciary obligations to MetroPCS and/or the MetroPCS
Stockholders under applicable Law and (y) in the case of a MetroPCS Superior
Proposal Adverse Recommendation Change, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, that the MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal
remains a MetroPCS Superior Proposal. During any such five Business Day period
following a MetroPCS Subsequent Determination Notice, DT shall be entitled to
deliver to MetroPCS one or more counterproposals. Any material amendment to
the MetroPCS Superior Proposal that is the subject of such MetroPCS Superior
Proposal Adverse Recommendation Change, including any revision to price, shall
require MetroPCS to deliver to DT a new MetroPCS Subsequent Determination
Notice and again comply with the requirements of this Section 4.5(e) with
respect to such revised MetroPCS Superior Proposal, except that the time
period after DT\'s receipt of a MetroPCS Subsequent Determination Notice when
MetroPCS may effect a MetroPCS Superior Proposal Adverse Recommendation Change
shall be three Business Days.

(f) From and after the execution of this Agreement, MetroPCS shall notify DT
promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) of the receipt of any MetroPCS
Acquisition Proposal, and (i) if it is in writing, deliver to DT a copy of
such MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal and any related draft agreements and other
written material setting forth the terms and conditions of such MetroPCS
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) if oral, provide to DT a detailed summary
thereof. MetroPCS shall keep DT reasonably informed on a prompt and timely
basis of the status and material details of any such MetroPCS Acquisition
Proposal and with respect to any material change to the terms of any such
MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal within 24 hours of any such material change.

(g) Nothing in this Section 4.5 shall be deemed to prohibit MetroPCS or its
Subsidiaries from complying with Rule 14e-2, Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or to prohibit MetroPCS from
making any disclosure if the MetroPCS Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to do so may violate
MetroPCS\'s disclosure requirements under applicable Law, nor shall any such
action be deemed to constitute a breach of MetroPCS\'s obligations under this
Agreement; provided, however, that any disclosure regarding a MetroPCS
Acquisition Proposal (other than any factually accurate public statement by
MetroPCS that solely describes MetroPCS\'s receipt of a MetroPCS Acquisition
Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto or any
"stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a
MetroPCS Adverse Recommendation Change unless the MetroPCS Board expressly
reaffirms the MetroPCS Recommendation in such disclosure; and provided,
further, that nothing in this Section 4.5(g) shall permit MetroPCS to effect a
MetroPCS Adverse Recommendation Change without complying with Section 4.5(e). 

(h) MetroPCS agrees that its obligations pursuant to Sections 4.3 and 4.4(b)
shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure
or communication to MetroPCS or its stockholders of any MetroPCS Acquisition
Proposal, any determination that a MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal is a MetroPCS
Superior Proposal, or by the occurrence of any MetroPCS Adverse Recommendation
Change.

(i) For purposes hereof, "MetroPCS Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide
written MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal (with all references to 20% in the
definition of MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal being treated as references to 50%
for these purposes) made by a third party that the MetroPCS Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, would be more favorable to the MetroPCS Stockholders from a
financial point of view than the Transaction, taking into account (i) any
proposal by DT in writing to amend or modify the terms hereof, (ii) the
identity of the Person making such MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal, and (iii)
the terms, conditions, timing, likelihood of consummation and legal,
financial, and regulatory aspects of such MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal.

(j) For purposes hereof, "MetroPCS Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry,
proposal, offer, plan, arrangement or other expression or indication of
interest with respect to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in
one transaction or a series of transactions, and whether through any merger,
reorganization, consolidation, tender offer, self-tender, exchange offer,
stock acquisition or issuance, asset acquisition, binding share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint
venture or otherwise, of (i) assets or businesses of MetroPCS and its
Subsidiaries that generate or represent 20% or more of the (A) net revenues or
net income of MetroPCS and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately
prior to such transaction, (B) aggregate Licensed MHz POPs of the MetroPCS FCC
Licenses immediately prior to such transaction, or (C) total assets (based on
fair market value) of MetroPCS and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
immediately prior to such transaction, or (ii) 20% or more of any class of
capital stock, Equity Interests, other equity securities, economic interests
or voting power of MetroPCS, any of its Subsidiaries or any resulting parent
company of MetroPCS; provided, however, that the term "MetroPCS Acquisition
Proposal" shall not include the Transaction.

Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations

circumstances that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any TMUS
Acquisition Proposal, (iv) take any action to make the provisions of any "fair
price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination" or

any of the foregoing.

basis of the status and material details of any such TMUS Acquisition Proposal
and with respect to any material change to the terms of any such TMUS
Acquisition Proposal within 24 hours of any such material change.

(d) For purposes hereof, "TMUS Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry,

comparable, in the aggregate, to the compensation (other than equity
compensation), severance pay and benefits, and other employee benefits
provided by MetroPCS as of the date hereof. MetroPCS shall, and DT shall cause
MetroPCS to, use its reasonable best efforts to (x) make a decision regarding
whether to continue the employment of each MetroPCS Employee in a position and
on terms of employment comparable to such MetroPCS Employee\'s position and

severance and paid time off (but not for benefit accrual purposes, for the
purpose of qualifying a subsidized early retirement benefit, or as would
result in a duplication of benefits) for the same purposes under the
replacement employee benefit plans in which such MetroPCS Employee
participates following the Closing. To the extent a MetroPCS Employee
participates in a new welfare plan or arrangement (a "Replacement Welfare
Plan") following the Closing, MetroPCS will, and DT will cause MetroPCS to,
cause all (i) pre-existing condition limitations which otherwise would be
applicable to such MetroPCS Employee and his or her covered dependents to be

MetroPCS Employee participated and that is comparable to such Replacement
Welfare Plan, in each case immediately prior to the Closing or, if later,
immediately prior to such MetroPCS Employee\'s commencement of participation
in such Replacement Welfare Plan, and (ii) participation waiting periods under
each Replacement Welfare Plan that would otherwise be applicable to such
MetroPCS Employee to be waived to the same extent waived or satisfied under
the MetroPCS Benefit Plan in which such MetroPCS Employee participated and
that is comparable to such Replacement Welfare Plan immediately prior to the
Closing or, if later, immediately prior to such MetroPCS Employee\'s
commencement of participation in such Replacement Welfare Plan. In addition,
MetroPCS and its Subsidiaries will, and DT will cause MetroPCS to, honor or
cause to be honored any expenditures incurred by MetroPCS Employees and their
covered dependents in satisfying the deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket
maximums under the MetroPCS Benefit Plans during the portion of the applicable
plan year that includes the Closing in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments
or out-of-pocket maximums under any comparable Replacement Welfare Plans in
which they are eligible to participate after the Closing for the portion of
the applicable plan year that includes the Closing.

material oral communications to the directors, officers or employees of
MetroPCS, TMUS, or any of their respective Subsidiaries pertaining to the

the effect of the Transaction on any employment, compensation or benefit
matters and provide MetroPCS a reasonable opportunity to comment on the same.

relating to the effect of the Transaction on any employment, compensation or
benefit matters and provide DT and TMUS a reasonable opportunity to comment on
the same. Without limiting the foregoing, for purposes of this paragraph,

prior to its use shall be deemed to be a reasonable opportunity to comment.

in good faith to identify prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, in the
event that one or more of the executive officers set forth on Exhibit K are
unwilling or unable to serve in that capacity, DT and MetroPCS will discuss in
good faith a replacement for each such individual. If DT and MetroPCS are
unable to reach agreement on any replacement for an individual specified on
Exhibit K or on any officer not specified on Exhibit K, DT shall designate
such replacement or officer. For the avoidance of doubt, any executive officer
of TMUS or MetroPCS not set forth on Exhibit K, and not otherwise identified

of MetroPCS effective as of the Closing, shall be deemed to not be an
executive officer of MetroPCS following the Closing.

Subsidiaries (other than TMUS and its Subsidiaries) and (y) DT and its
Subsidiaries will not have access to any IT Assets, networks or electronic
data of MetroPCS and its Subsidiaries (including TMUS and its Subsidiaries),
in each case other than as provided in Intercompany Contracts with obligations
remaining on the Closing Date.

or its Subsidiaries any Intellectual Property owned by DT and used by TMUS or
any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date, provided that
(i) MetroPCS does not use such Intellectual Property for any activities,
products and services or for any other purposes other than those for which
TMUS used the respective Intellectual Property immediately prior to the
Closing Date, (ii) this covenant is limited to the territory of the United
States, Puerto Rico and the territories and protectorates of the United
States, and (iii) this covenant shall not be assignable and not extend to
MetroPCS\'s legal successors and assignees. The covenant of the preceding
sentence shall not apply to any Intellectual Property with respect to which
TMUS and DT or, as the case may be, MetroPCS and DT have made a written
agreement, including the Trade-

employees, as the case may be, of MetroPCS, TMUS or their respective
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective Organizational Documents or in
any agreement as in effect on the date hereof and which has prior to the date
hereof been made available to the other parties hereto shall survive the
Closing and shall continue in full force and effect to the extent provided in
the following sentence. DT shall cause MetroPCS and TMUS to maintain in effect
any and all exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
provisions of MetroPCS\'s, TMUS\'s and any of their respective Subsidiaries\'
Organizational Documents or in any indemnification agreements of MetroPCS,
TMUS or their respective Subsidiaries with any of their respective current or
former directors, officers or employees, in each case in effect as of the date
hereof and which has been provided to DT prior to the date hereof, for acts or
omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing. DT, for and on behalf of
itself and on behalf of its Affiliates, hereby acquits, releases and
discharges each of the current or former directors and officers of TMUS from
any and all Liabilities that arise out of or are connected with such
directors\' and officers\' position or services to TMUS and each of its
Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing.

(b) For six years after the Closing, MetroPCS (or a Subsidiary thereof) shall,
and DT shall cause MetroPCS (or a Subsidiary thereof) to, maintain in effect
for the benefit of the current and former directors, officers, fiduciaries,
agents and employees of MetroPCS and its Subsidiaries an insurance and
indemnification policy with an insurer with the same or better credit rating
as the current carrier for MetroPCS that provides coverage for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing (the "DandO Tail Policy")
covering each such Person covered by the officers\' and directors\' liability
insurance policies of MetroPCS (the "Insured Parties") on terms with respect
to coverage and advancement of expenses, and in amounts, no less favorable to
the Insured Parties than those of MetroPCS\'s directors\' and officers\'
insurance policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, however,
that MetroPCS shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Tail
Policy in excess of 250% of the annual premium currently paid by MetroPCS for
such coverage; and provided, further, that if any annual premium for such
insurance coverage exceeds 250% of such annual premium, MetroPCS shall obtain
as much coverage as practicable for a cost not exceeding such amount.
MetroPCS\'s and DT\'s obligations under this Section 4.23(b) may be satisfied
by MetroPCS, with the approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, of DT, by purchasing a "tail" policy from an insurer with sub- 

stantially the same or better credit rating as the current carrier for
MetroPCS\'s existing directors\' and officers\' insurance policy, which (i)
has an effective term of six years from the Closing, (ii) covers each Insured
Party for actions and omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing
(including with respect to acts or omissions by directors or officers of
MetroPCS or its Subsidiaries in their capacities as such arising in connection
with the entry into, performance under, or the transactions contemplated by,
this Agreement), and (iii) contains terms with respect to coverage and
advancement of expenses, and in amounts, that are no less favorable to the
Insured Parties than those of MetroPCS\'s directors\' and officers\' insurance
policy in effect on the date of this Agreement. If such "tail" policy has been
obtained by MetroPCS prior to the Closing, MetroPCS shall cause such policy to
be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by MetroPCS.

(c) In the event MetroPCS or TMUS or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of MetroPCS or TMUS, as applicable, shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 4.23.

(d) Effective as of the Closing, DT, for and on behalf of itself and on behalf
of its Subsidiaries, hereby acquits, releases and discharges each of TMUS and
its Subsidiaries from any and all Liabilities as of the Closing to DT or any
of its Subsidiaries (other than TMUS and its Subsidiaries), except in respect
of obligations under Intercompany Contracts or under this Agreement that are
not terminated as of the Closing Date. DT shall cause its other Affiliates to
use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action and to execute and deliver such documents and other papers,
as may be required to effect the release set forth in this Section 4.23(d).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
current and former directors, officers and employees of MetroPCS, TMUS and
their respective Subsidiaries are intended to be, and shall be, third party
beneficiaries of this Section 4.23.

4.24 MetroPCS Common Stock. During the period from the date hereof to the
Closing, DT shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to, directly
or indirectly, alone or in concert with any other Person acquire, offer to
acquire or agree to acquire Beneficial Ownership of any shares of MetroPCS
Common Stock.

4.25 Sale of Towers. From and after the date hereof until the Closing Date,
and without limiting any other rights of DT or TMUS hereunder, DT shall be
permitted to cause TMUS to sell, lease, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the
Tower Assets, including by selling or transferring an entity holding such
Tower Assets (and no other material assets) (a "Tower Holdco") on terms that
TMUS has made available to MetroPCS prior to the date hereof (or other terms
which, taken as a whole, have an equivalent or more favorable economic cost to
TMUS and its Subsidiaries with respect the use of the Tower Assets by TMUS).
On or prior to the Closing Date, any and all actual proceeds (net of fees and
expenses other than Taxes) from such sale, lease, transfer or disposition (or,
to the extent such proceeds are not received on or prior to the Closing Date,
a note, contingent value right or other obligation or security for the amount
of any 

reasonably expected proceeds), may be distributed to DT or any of its
Subsidiaries. From and after the Closing Date, if any or all of the Tower
Assets have not been so sold, leased, transferred or otherwise disposed of,
MetroPCS shall, and cause its Subsidiaries (including TMUS and Subsidiaries)
to, use their reasonable best efforts to sell, lease, transfer, or otherwise
dispose of such Tower Assets on terms acceptable to DT in its sole discretion,
and shall transfer any proceeds thereof to DT promptly after the receipt of
such proceeds (net of fees and expenses other than Taxes), including pursuant
to any note, contingent value right or other obligation or security
distributed to DT on or prior to the Closing Date.

4.26 Notification of Certain Matters. Each of TMUS and MetroPCS shall promptly
advise the other party of any Circumstance (a) having or reasonably expected
to have a TMUS Material Adverse Effect or MetroPCS Material Adverse Effect,
respectively, or (b) that it believes would or would be reasonably likely to
cause or constitute a breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement such that it would cause a failure of
the applicable condition related to such breach in Article V if the Closing
were otherwise to occur on the date the Circumstance occurs; provided,
however, that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect
thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement; provided, further, that a failure to comply with this Section 4.26
shall not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in Article V to be
satisfied unless the underlying TMUS Material Adverse Effect or MetroPCS
Material Adverse Effect, respectively, or breach would independently result in
the failure of a condition set forth in Article V to be satisfied.

4.27 Litigation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
each of DT and MetroPCS shall notify the other party promptly if and after it
receives notice of any action or proceeding instituted or threatened in
writing against it or any of its stockholders, directors, officers or
Affiliates before any court or other Governmental Entity relating to, or
seeking damages or other relief or discovery in connection with, this
Agreement or the Transaction. Until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms or the Closing, to the extent legally
permissible, each of DT and MetroPCS shall give the other party the
opportunity to reasonably participate in the defense or settlement of any
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Transaction, and shall
not settle any such action or proceeding without the other party\'s written
consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

4.28 Anti-Takeover Statutes. If any other potentially applicable anti-takeover
or similar Law or provision in MetroPCS\'s or TMUS\'s governing documents is
or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Transaction, MetroPCS or DT, as
applicable, shall, and shall cause its and its Subsidiaries\' directors,
officers and Affiliates to, grant such approvals and take such other actions
as may be required so that the Transaction may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms and subject to the satisfaction of conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

4.29 Control of Operations. Without in any way limiting and subject to the
parties\' rights and obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand
and agree that nothing contained in this Agreement shall give any party,
directly or indirectly, the right to exercise de 

facto or de jure control over the operations, licenses, spectrum or other
assets of any other party prior to the Closing.

4.30 Listing of TMUS Stock Consideration. MetroPCS shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the TMUS Stock Consideration to be approved for listing
on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing.

results of operations of MetroPCS and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
(after giving effect to the Transaction), or the ability of either party to
consummate the Transaction, and in each of cases (i), (ii) and (iii), without

(ii) the other representations and warranties of DT, Global, Holding or TMUS,

reasonably be likely to have a TMUS Material Adverse Effect; and (iii)

(Subsidiaries) and 3.3(u) (TMUS Stock Consideration) shall be true and correct
(A) on the date hereof and (B) at the Closing (except to the extent that any
such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of a particular date, in
which case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of
such date, and except where the failure of such representations and warranties
to be true and correct as of the date hereof and at the Closing, or such
particular date, as applicable, is de minimis); and (ii) the other

received a certificate signed by an executive officer of MetroPCS to such
effect.

(c) No MetroPCS Material Adverse Effect. Since the date hereof, there shall

MetroPCS Existing Notes.

(g) Listing of MetroPCS Shares. The TMUS Stock Consideration shall have been
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance.

herein), by written notice to MetroPCS, in the event that (i) assuming all
conditions set forth in Article V (other than Sections 5.3(a) and (b)) were
satisfied and the Closing were otherwise to occur on the date DT delivers such
notice, a breach by MetroPCS of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein would result in a failure of a condition set

(g) by DT, by written notice to MetroPCS prior to receipt of the MetroPCS
Stockholder Approval, if there shall have been a MetroPCS Adverse

(B) those other conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until
the Closing Date but would be capable of satisfaction if the Closing Date were
the date of such termination) have been satisfied or waived on or prior to the
date of such termination, DT shall make a cash payment to MetroPCS in the
amount of $250,000,000 (the "DT Termination Amount") in immediately available
funds, as directed by MetroPCS in writing, within two Business Days after such
termination by MetroPCS or concurrently with or prior to a termination by DT.

(e) Each of MetroPCS and DT acknowledges that, in the event of a termination
of this Agreement as described in Section 6.2(b), 6.2(c), or 6.2(d), (i)
Damages would be extremely difficult to calculate, (ii) the provisions
regarding the MetroPCS Termination Amount or the DT Termination Amount, as
applicable, represent the parties\' best estimate of such Damages and as such
are an integral part of the Transaction, and (iii) the MetroPCS Termination
Amount or the DT Termination Amount, as applicable, is not a penalty, but
rather is liquidated 

damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate and reimburse DT or
MetroPCS, as applicable, in the circumstances in which the MetroPCS
Termination Amount or the DT Termination Amount, as applicable, is required
for the efforts, costs and expenses expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transaction, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Accordingly, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement other than the
immediately preceding sentence, if this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms and such termination gives rise to the obligation of MetroPCS
to pay the MetroPCS Termination Amount or DT to pay the DT Termination Amount,
as applicable, the sole and exclusive remedy of the other party and its
Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and Affiliates against
such paying party and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
directors and Affiliates for any Damages resulting from, arising out of, or
incurred in connection with, this Agreement (including termination thereof) or
any transactions ancillary hereto shall be the MetroPCS Termination Amount or
the DT Termination Amount, as applicable, and no Person shall have, except as
provided herein, any rights or claims against such paying party and its
Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and Affiliates under
this Agreement or otherwise, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and neither the paying party, nor any of its Subsidiaries nor their
respective officers, directors or Affiliates shall have any further liability
or obligation resulting from, arising out of, or incurred in connection with,
this Agreement; provided, that nothing in this Section 6.2(e) shall apply to
any party\'s rights to seek equitable remedies, including injunctive relief or
specific performance, with respect to the surviving provisions of and
obligations under this Agreement, or to limit DT\'s, Global\'s, Holding\'s,
TMUS\'s or MetroPCS\'s rights with respect to any Damages incurred or suffered
by DT, Global, Holding, TMUS or MetroPCS, as applicable, as a result of the
willful breach by DT, Global, Holding, TMUS or MetroPCS, as applicable, of any
provision of this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or any other
agreement delivered in connection herewith prior to the termination of this
Agreement. In no event shall MetroPCS be required to pay the MetroPCS
Termination Amount, or DT be required to pay the DT Termination Amount, on
more than one occasion.

ARTICLE VII

MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL



7.1 Survival. None of the representations and warranties of the parties
contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall survive the Closing. Except for any covenant or agreement that
by its terms contemplates performance after the Closing, none of the covenants
and agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the
Effective Time.

7.2 Amendment; Waivers, Etc. No amendment, modification or discharge of this
Agreement, and no waiver hereunder, and no extension of time for the
performance of any of the obligations hereunder, shall be valid or binding
unless set forth in writing and duly executed by (a) MetroPCS where
enforcement of the amendment, modification, discharge, waiver or extension is
sought against MetroPCS or (b) DT where enforcement of the amendment,
modification, discharge, waiver or extension is sought against DT, Holding or
TMUS. Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the
specific matter described in such writing and shall in no way impair the
rights of the party granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other
time. The waiver by MetroPCS or DT of a breach of, or a default under, any of
the provisions hereof, or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall
not be construed as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar
nature, or as a waiver of any of such provi- 

sions, rights or privileges hereunder. Except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, the rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and none is
exclusive of any other, or of any rights or remedies that any party may
otherwise have at law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, after the MetroPCS Stockholder Approval is obtained, no
amendment, modification, discharge or waiver of this Agreement or any portion
hereof shall be made that by Law requires further approval by the MetroPCS
Stockholders without obtaining such approval.

7.3 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each such counterpart (including any facsimile or electronic
document transmission of such counterpart) being deemed to be an original
instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute the same
agreement.

7.4 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Forum; Waiver of Trial by Jury. THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY CONFLICT-OF-LAWS RULE OR PRINCIPLE
THEREOF. Each party hereto agrees that it shall bring any action or proceeding
in respect of any claim arising out of, or related to, this Agreement or the
Transaction, exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery, New Castle County,
or solely if that court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in
the State of Delaware (the "Chosen Courts"), and solely in connection with
claims arising under this Agreement or the Transaction (a) irrevocably submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (b) waives any objection
to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (c)
waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do
not have jurisdiction over any party hereto, and (d) agrees that service of
process upon such party in any such action or proceeding shall be effective if
notice is given in accordance with Section 7.5. Each party hereto irrevocably
designates C.T. Corporation as its agent and attorney-in-fact for the
acceptance of service of process and making an appearance on its behalf in any
such claim or proceeding and for the taking of all such acts as may be
necessary or appropriate in order to confer jurisdiction over it before the
Chosen Courts and each party hereto stipulates that such consent and
appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest. EACH PARTY HERETO
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTION.

7.6 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including any annexes and exhibits
hereto), the TMUS Disclosure Letter, the MetroPCS Disclosure Letter, the
Confidentiality Agreement and, when executed, the Ancillary Agreements,
constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior and
contemporaneous agreements, understandings, undertakings, arrangements,
representations and warranties, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

7.7 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
the terms hereof and that, subject to Section 6.2(e), the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
in any of the Chosen Courts without any requirement to post bond, in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

7.8 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is not intended to confer
upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, except to the extent contemplated by Section 4.23. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, following the Effective Time, the provisions of Article II
shall be enforceable by each holder of MetroPCS Common Stock or MetroPCS Stock
Options as of the Effective Time solely to the extent necessary for any such
holder to receive the cash and/or MetroPCS Common Stock, as applicable, to
which it is entitled pursuant to Article II.

7.9 Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable
and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the
validity or enforceability or the other provisions hereof. If any provision of
this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance,
is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable
provision; and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such
invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability
affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application
thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

7.10 Interpretation. The table of contents and headings herein are for
convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and
shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.
The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting
of this Agreement and, in the event that an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly drafted by
the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring
or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

7.11 Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the
benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. Neither party may directly or
indirectly assign any of its rights or delegate any of its 

obligations under this Agreement, by operation of Law or otherwise, without
the prior written consent of the other party. Any purported direct or indirect
assignment in violation of this Section 7.11 shall be null and void ab initio.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, DT may assign any of its rights and/or delegate
any of its obligations under this Agreement to one or more of its wholly-owned
Subsidiaries (but no such assignment shall relieve DT of any of its
obligations hereunder).

7.12 Limitation of Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, (a) neither DT, MetroPCS, their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees or attorneys shall be liable to any Person with respect to a claim
under this Agreement for any punitive, indirect or exemplary damages or any
damages that are not the reasonably foreseeable result of a breach hereof
(other than to the extent such damages are paid to a third party), whether
such claim is based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence or
strict liability) or otherwise, and (b) this Agreement shall not create or be
deemed to create any liability or obligation on the part of any
Representative, Affiliate or direct, indirect or beneficial owner or holder of
any securities of any party hereto (unless itself a party hereto).



7.13 Securities Matters. Each of MetroPCS and DT represents and warrants to
the other party as follows:



(a) Experience; Risk. Such party has such knowledge, sophistication and
experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of the receipt of TMUS Shares or the TMUS Stock
Consideration, respectively, and of protecting its interests in connection
herewith. DT has the ability to bear the economic risk of this investment,
including complete loss of the investment.

(b) Investment. Such party is acquiring TMUS Shares or the TMUS Stock
Consideration, respectively, for investment for its own account, not as a
nominee or agent, and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with,
any distribution thereof, and has no present intention of selling, granting
any participation in or otherwise distributing the same. Such party
understands that TMUS Shares or the TMUS Stock Consideration, respectively,
have not been registered under the Securities Act, by reason of a specific
exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act which depends
upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent and
the accuracy of such party\'s representations as expressed in this Section
7.13.

(c) Access to Information. Such party acknowledges that, as of the date
hereof, it has been afforded (i) the opportunity to ask such questions as it
has deemed necessary of, and to receive answers from, Representatives of the
other party concerning the terms and conditions of the Transaction and TMUS
Shares or the TMUS Stock Consideration, respectively, and the merits and risks
of investing in TMUS Shares or the TMUS Stock Consideration, respectively, and
any such questions have been answered to such party\'s reasonable
satisfaction; (ii) access to information about TMUS or MetroPCS, respectively,
and its financial condition, results of operations, business, properties,
management and prospects sufficient to enable it to evaluate its investment;
(iii) the opportunity to obtain such additional information that the other
party possesses or can acquire without unreasonable effort or expense that is
necessary to make an in- 

formed investment decision with respect to the investment and any such
additional information has been provided to such party\'s reasonable
satisfaction; and (iv) the opportunity to ask questions of management of the
other party and any such questions have been answered to such party\'s
reasonable satisfaction. Such party has sought such accounting, legal and tax
advice as it has considered necessary to make an informed decision with
respect to its acquisition of TMUS Shares or the TMUS Stock Consideration,
respectively. Each party hereto acknowledges that no other party hereto nor
any Affiliate or Representative of such other party has made any
representation, express or implied, with respect to the accuracy, completeness
or adequacy of any available information except or to the extent such
information is covered by the representations and warranties contained herein.

(d) Accredited Investor. Such party is an "accredited investor" within the
meaning of Regulation D, Rule 501(a), promulgated by the SEC.



(e) Restricted Securities; Rule 144. Such party understands that TMUS Shares
and the TMUS Stock Consideration, respectively, are characterized as
"restricted securities" under the United States federal securities laws
inasmuch as they are being acquired from the other party in a transaction not
involving a public offering and that under such laws and applicable
regulations the TMUS Stock Consideration may be resold without registration
under the Securities Act only in certain limited circumstances. Such party
acknowledges that TMUS Shares or the TMUS Stock Consideration, respectively,
must be held indefinitely unless a sale of such TMUS Shares or TMUS Stock
Consideration, respectively, is subsequently registered under the Securities
Act or an exemption from such registration is available. Such party is aware
of the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act which
permit limited resale of shares purchased in a private placement or shares
owned by certain Persons associated with TMUS subject to the satisfaction of
certain conditions.



(f) Legends. DT understands and agrees that each certificate, if any,
representing the TMUS Stock Consideration and any securities issued in respect
thereof or in exchange therefor shall bear a legend in the following forms (in
addition to any other legend required under applicable state and foreign
securities laws) (and a comparable notation or other arrangement will be made
with respect to any uncertificated TMUS Stock Consideration):

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR
INVESTMENT AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED. SUCH SHARES MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH
REGISTRATION OR UNLESS THE ISSUER RECEIVES AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY
ACCEPTABLE TO IT STATING THAT SUCH SALE OR TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM THE
REGISTRATION AND PROSPECTUS DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS OF SAID ACT."

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS
OF A STOCKHOLDER\'S AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF [_____], 201[_], TO WHICH THE
ISSUER AND CERTAIN OF ITS STOCKHOLDERS ARE PARTY, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE
INSPECTED AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF THE ISSUER OR OBTAINED FROM THE ISSUER
WITHOUT CHARGE." 

7.14 Transfer Taxes. Any Transfer Taxes imposed with respect to the
Transaction shall be borne by MetroPCS; provided, that any German value added
tax payable with respect to the Stock Purchase shall be borne by DT and its
Subsidiaries (other than TMUS and its Subsidiaries). The party so required by
applicable Law shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all Transfer Taxes, and, if required by the applicable Law,
the other parties shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

7.15 Reliance of Other Parties. This Agreement contains representations and
warranties by each of the parties hereto that are the product of negotiations
between the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 7.2. These representations
and warranties have been qualified by certain disclosures that were made
between the parties in the TMUS Disclosure Letter and the MetroPCS Disclosure
Letter, which disclosures are not reflected in this Agreement itself.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

7.16 Effect of Breaches. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for
all purposes under this Agreement, a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein by DT, Global, Holding or TMUS shall be
deemed to be a breach of such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
by each of DT, Global, Holding and TMUS.

FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION



OF



T-MOBILE US, INC.



Pursuant to Sections 242 and 245

of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL")



The undersigned, [Name], hereby certifies that,



ONE: He is the duly elected and acting [Title] of MetroPCS Communications,
Inc. (the "Corporation").



TWO: The name of the Corporation prior to the Effective Time is MetroPCS
Communications, Inc.



THREE: The original certificate of incorporation of the Corporation was filed
in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on March 10,
2004 pursuant to the DGCL.



FOUR: The directors and the stockholders of the Corporation, in accordance
with Sections 242 and 245 of the DGCL, have duly adopted and approved this
Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.



The certificate of incorporation of the Corporation is hereby amended and
restated to read in its entirety as follows:



ARTICLE I

CORPORATE NAME



The name of the Corporation from and after the Effective Time is T-Mobile US,
Inc.



ARTICLE II

REGISTERED ADDRESS AND AGENT



The address of the registered office of the Corporation in the State of
Delaware is 2711 Centerville Road, City of Wilmington, County of New Castle,
19808. The name of its registered agent at such address is Corporation Service
Company.



ARTICLE III

NATURE OF BUSINESS



The nature of the business or purposes to be conducted or promoted is to
engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized
under the DGCL. 



ARTICLE IV

AUTHORIZED CAPITAL STOCK



(A)General. The Corporation is authorized to issue two (2) classes of capital
stock to be designated, respectively, "Common Stock" and "Preferred Stock."
The total number of shares which the Corporation is authorized to issue is One
Billion One Hundred Million (1,100,000,000) shares. One Billion
(1,000,000,000) shares shall be Common Stock, par value $0.00001 per share,
and One Hundred Million (100,000,000) shares shall be Preferred Stock, par
value $0.00001 per share.



(B)Upon the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per
share, issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time
automatically shall be, without any action on the part of the Corporation or
the holder thereof, reclassified as, and converted into, 0.5 of a validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock, par value
$0.00001 per share (such reclassification and conversion, the "Reverse Stock
Split"), subject to the treatment of fractional share interests as described
below. Any stock certificate that, immediately before the Effective Time,
represented a share or shares of Common Stock shall, from and after the
Effective Time, automatically and without the presentation of such certificate
to the Corporation for exchange thereof, represent such share or shares of
Common Stock that result from the Reverse Stock Split, subject to the
elimination of fractional shares as described below. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Common Stock holder that would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of a share of Common Stock as a result of the Reverse Stock Split
after aggregating all fractions of shares of Common Stock to be received by
such holder shall in lieu thereof be entitled to receive payment in cash
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent, without interest and subject to
applicable withholding taxes) from the Corporation\'s transfer agent in lieu
of such fractional shares in accordance with Section 155 of the DGCL.



(C)Preferred Stock.



1.The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series
and in such amounts as may be determined by the Board of Directors or by order
or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction over the Corporation
administering any applicable statute of the United States relating to plans of
reorganization of corporations, subject to any qualifications, limitations and
restrictions set forth elsewhere in this Article IV or in Article VIII. The
voting powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional
or other special rights, if any, and the qualifications, limitations or
restrictions thereof, if any, of each series of the Preferred Stock shall be
such as are fixed by the Board of Directors or fixed by such court, the
authority to do so being hereby expressly granted, and as are stated and
expressed in a resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors or
in an order or decree of such court providing for the issue of such series of
Preferred Stock (herein called the "Certificate of Designation"). The
Certificate of Designation as to any series shall, subject to any
qualifications, limitations and restrictions set forth elsewhere in this
Article IV or in Article VIII, (a) designate the series, (b) fix the dividend
rate, if any, of such series, the payment dates for dividends on shares of
such series and the date or dates, or the method of determining the date or
dates, if any, from which dividends on shares of such series shall be
cumulative, (c) fix the amount or amounts payable on shares of such series
upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
affairs of the Corporation, and (d) state the price or prices or rate or
rates, and adjustments, if 

any, at which, and the time or times and the terms and conditions upon which,
the shares of such series may be redeemed at the option of the Corporation or
at the option of the holder or holders of shares of such series or upon the
occurrence of a specified event, and state whether such shares may be redeemed
for cash, property or rights, including securities of the Corporation or other
equity securities; and such Certificate of Designation may (i) limit the
number of shares of such series that may be issued, (ii) provide for a sinking
fund for the purchase or redemption of shares of such series and specify the
terms and conditions governing the operations of any such fund, (iii) grant
voting rights to the holders of shares of such series, (iv) impose conditions
or restrictions upon the creation of indebtedness of the Corporation or upon
the issuance of additional Preferred Stock or other capital stock ranking on a
parity therewith, or prior thereto, with respect to dividends or distribution
of assets upon liquidation, (v) impose conditions or restrictions upon the
payment of dividends upon, or the making of other distributions to, or the
acquisition of, shares ranking junior to such series with respect to dividends
or distributions of assets upon liquidation, (vi) state the time or times, the
price or prices or the rate or rates of exchange and other terms, conditions
and adjustments upon which shares of any such series may be made convertible
into, or exchangeable for, at the option of the holder or the Corporation or
upon the occurrence of a specified event, shares of any other class or classes
or of any other series of Preferred Stock or any other class or classes of
stock or other securities of the Corporation, and (vii) grant such other
special rights and impose such qualifications, limitations or restrictions
thereon as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors or such court, to the
extent not inconsistent with this Article IV or Article VIII and to the full
extent now or hereafter permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware.



2.Preferred Stock that is redeemed, purchased or retired by the Corporation
shall assume the status of authorized and unissued Preferred Stock and may
thereafter, subject to the provisions of any Certificate of Designation
providing for the issue of any particular series of Preferred Stock, be
reissued in the same manner as authorized and unissued Preferred Stock.



(D)Common Stock. All shares of Common Stock shall be identical except as
expressly set forth in this Article IV. Each share of Common Stock shall have
attributed to it the number of votes set forth in Section (E) below.



(E)Rights of Holders of Capital Stock.



1.Holders of Preferred Stock. Except as such rights may be specifically
limited herein, the rights of holders of Preferred Stock shall be as set forth
in any Certificate of Designation relating thereto.



2.Holders of Common Stock. The rights of holders of Common Stock shall be as
set forth in this Section (E)(2), except with respect to such rights as are
set forth in Section (F) of this Article IV.



(a)Dividend Rights. Subject to the prior rights of holders of all classes of
stock at the time outstanding having prior rights as to dividends, the holders
of the Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the
Board of Directors, out of any assets of the Corporation legally available
therefor, such dividends, distributed ratably among the holders of the Common
Stock in proportion to the number of shares of such Common 

Stock owned by each such holder, as may be declared from time to time by the
Board of Directors.



(b)Liquidation Preference. Subject to the prior rights of holders of all
classes of stock at the time outstanding having prior rights as to
distributions in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, and after any and all distributions are made in accordance
therewith, in such event, either voluntary or involuntary, the remaining
assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall
be distributed ratably among the holders of the Common Stock in proportion to
the number of shares of such Common Stock owned by each such holder.



3.Redemption.



(a)Subject to Section (E)(3)(e) of this Article IV, if, at any time, a holder
of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock acquires additional shares of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock, or is otherwise attributed with ownership of
such shares, that would cause the Corporation to violate (in each case, an
"FCC Violation") (A) any requirement of the Federal Communications Commission
("FCC") regarding foreign ownership (collectively, "Foreign Ownership
Requirements") or (B) any other rule or regulation of the FCC applicable to
the Corporation, then the Corporation may, at the option of the Board of
Directors, redeem from the holder or holders causing such FCC Violation a
sufficient number of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock to eliminate
the FCC Violation by paying in cash therefor a sum equal to the Redemption
Price. The "Redemption Price" (herein so called) shall equal such price as is
mutually determined by such stockholders and the Corporation, or, if no
mutually acceptable agreement can be reached, shall equal either (i) seventy-
five percent (75%) of the fair market value of the Common Stock (the "Common
Stock Fair Market Value") or the Fair Market Value of the Preferred Stock, as
applicable, where such holder caused the FCC Violation, or (ii) one hundred
percent (100%) of the Common Stock Fair Market Value or the Fair Market Value
of the Preferred Stock, as applicable, where the FCC Violation was caused by
no fault of the holder; provided, however, that the determination of whether
such party caused the FCC Violation shall be made, in good faith, by the
disinterested members of the Board of Directors. As used in this Section
(E)(3), the Common Stock Fair Market Value shall be determined as follows:



(i)if the Common Stock is publicly traded at the time of determination, the
average of the closing prices for the Common Stock on all domestic securities
exchanges on which the Common Stock may at the time be listed, or, if there
have been no sales of the Common Stock on any such exchange on such day, the
average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices for the Common Stock on all
such exchanges at the end of such day, or, if on any day the Common Stock is
not so listed, the average of the representative bid and asked prices for the
Common Stock quoted on the NASDAQ system as of the close of trading on such
day, or if on any day such security is not quoted in the NASDAQ system, the
average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices for the Common Stock on
such day in the domestic over-the-counter market as reported by the Pink
Sheets, LLC, or any similar successor organization, in each such case averaged
over the 30-day period ending three days prior to the Redemption Date (as
defined in Section (E)(3)(b) of this Article IV); and 

(ii)if the Common Stock is not publicly traded at the time of determination
then, the fair value of the Common Stock as determined in good faith by the
disinterested members of the Board of Directors.



As used in this Section (E)(3), the Preferred Stock Fair Market Value shall
mean the value determined by multiplying the Common Stock Fair Market Value by
the number of shares of Common Stock into which the share of Preferred Stock
is then convertible.



(b)At least five (5) but no more than thirty (30) days prior to any date on
which Common Stock or Preferred Stock is to be redeemed (a "Redemption Date"),
written notice shall be sent by mail, first class postage prepaid, overnight
mail, facsimile, or electronic mail to each holder of record (at the close of
business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given)
of the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock to be redeemed, at the
address last shown on the records of the Corporation for such holder,
notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected, specifying the number
of shares to be redeemed from such holder, the Redemption Date, the Redemption
Price, the place at which payment may be obtained and calling upon such holder
to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated,
his, her or its certificate or certificates representing the shares to be
redeemed (the "Redemption Notice"). Except as provided in Section (E)(3)(c) of
this Article IV, on or after the Redemption Date, each holder of shares of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall surrender to the
Corporation the certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the
manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the
Redemption Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person
whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof
and each surrendered certificate shall be canceled. In the event less than all
the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate
shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares.



(c)From and after the Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a default
in payment of the Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of shares of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock designated for redemption in the Redemption
Notice as holders of such shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock (except
the right to receive the Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of
their certificate or certificates) shall cease with respect to such shares,
and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the
Corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the
funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of shares of Common
Stock or Preferred Stock on any Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the
total number of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock to be redeemed on
such date, those funds which are legally available will be used to redeem the
maximum possible number of such shares ratably among the holders of such
shares to be redeemed based upon their holdings of Common Stock or Preferred
Stock to be redeemed. The shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock not
redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and
preferences provided herein. At any time thereafter when additional funds of
the Corporation are legally available for the redemption of shares of Common
Stock or Preferred Stock, such funds will immediately be used to redeem the
balance of the shares which the Corporation has become obligated to redeem on
any Redemption Date but which it has not redeemed. 

(d)Prior to effecting any such redemption, the Corporation shall provide any
holder of Common Stock or Preferred Stock to be redeemed with reasonable prior
written notice of the reason giving rise to the Corporation\'s redemption
right and, if requested to do so by such holder, the Corporation shall
reasonably cooperate with such affected holder in arranging another method to
minimize or eliminate the reason giving rise to the Corporation\'s redemption
right, including, but not limited to and not in any particular order of
priority, preparing and filing waiver requests with the FCC, developing
alternative ownership structures, assisting with a sale of such holders\'
interest in the Corporation, amending the Corporation\'s Certificate of
Incorporation and obtaining FCC approvals for such transaction.



(e)The provisions of Sections (E)(3)(a) through (E)(3)(d) of this Article IV
shall not apply to Deutsche Telekom AG (the "Stockholder") or any of its
subsidiaries, any acquisition of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock by
the Stockholder or any of its subsidiaries, or any ownership of such shares
otherwise attributed to the Stockholder or any of its subsidiaries, and the
Corporation shall not have the authority under Sections (E)(3)(a) through
(E)(3)(d) of this Article IV to redeem any shares of Common Stock or Preferred
Stock beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by the Stockholder or any of
its subsidiaries, in each case notwithstanding anything to the contrary
therein. In the event that any waivers or approvals are required from the FCC
in order for the Stockholder or any of its subsidiaries to acquire or hold
Common Stock or Preferred Stock, the Stockholder and its subsidiaries shall
cooperate to secure such waivers or approvals and abide by any conditions
related to such waivers or approvals.



(F)Voting Rights.



1.Common Stock. The holders of Common Stock shall have the right to vote on
every matter submitted to a vote of the holders of capital stock of the
Corporation other than any matter on which only the holders of one or more
other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation are entitled to
vote separately as a class.



2.Preferred Stock. Except as specifically limited herein, the holders of
Preferred Stock shall have such voting rights as shall be set forth in any
Certificate of Designation relating thereto.



ARTICLE V

POWER TO AMEND BYLAWS



(A)Board of Directors. Except as otherwise provided in this Fourth Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as it may be amended from time to time,
this "Certificate of Incorporation") and subject to any additional
requirements expressly set forth in the Bylaws of the Corporation, the Board
of Directors is expressly authorized, upon the affirmative vote of a majority
of the directors then serving, to make, adopt, alter, amend, and repeal from
time to time the Bylaws of the Corporation and make from time to time new
Bylaws of the Corporation (subject to the right of the stockholders entitled
to vote thereon to adopt, alter, amend, and repeal Bylaws made by the Board of
Directors or to make new Bylaws). 

(B)Stockholders. The stockholders of the Corporation may adopt, alter, amend,
or repeal Bylaws made by the Board of Directors or make new Bylaws upon the
affirmative vote of the holders of shares having a majority of the aggregate
voting power of all of the outstanding shares of the Corporation\'s capital
stock then entitled to vote thereon, subject to any additional requirements in
the Bylaws of the Corporation.



ARTICLE VI

BOARD OF DIRECTORS



(A)Number, Election and Term of Directors.



1.The number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors shall be
fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the Bylaws of the Corporation, or as
provided in accordance with any Certificate of Designation. All of the
directors of the Corporation shall be of one class and shall be elected
annually. Each director shall hold office until the next annual meeting of
stockholders and, the foregoing notwithstanding, shall serve until his
successor shall have been duly elected and qualified or until his earlier
death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal.



2.At all times when the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of (i) the number of
votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors ("Votes") by
the Common Stock and any class of capital stock or other securities of the
Corporation other than the Common Stock that are entitled to vote generally in
the election of directors (the "Voting Securities") Beneficially Owned by the
Stockholder to (ii) the aggregate Votes entitled to be cast by all then-
outstanding Voting Securities (such ratio, the "Stockholder Voting
Percentage") is ten percent (10%) or more, the Stockholder shall have the
right to designate a number of individuals to be nominees for election to the
Board of Directors ("Stockholder Designees") equal to the Stockholder Voting
Percentage multiplied by the total number of directors of the Board of
Directors that the Corporation would have if there were no vacancies, rounded
to the nearest whole number; provided, that the number of directors on the
Board of Directors who are also officers, employees, directors or affiliates
of the Stockholder shall not in any event exceed a number equal to the
Stockholder Voting Percentage multiplied by the total number of Directors that
the Corporation would have if there were no vacancies, rounded to the nearest
whole number greater than zero. In addition, the Corporation shall cause any
committee of the Board of Directors to include in its membership a number of
Stockholder Designees then serving as directors on the Board of Directors
equal to the Stockholder Voting Percentage multiplied by the total number of
members that such committee would have if there were no vacancies on such
committee, rounded up to the nearest whole number, except to the extent that
such membership would violate applicable securities laws or stock exchange or
stock market rules; provided, however, that no committee may consist solely of
directors who are also officers, employees, directors or affiliates of the
Stockholder. If at any time the Stockholder Voting Percentage is less than ten
percent (10%), the Stockholder shall promptly cause all of the Stockholder
Designees then serving as Directors to resign from the Board, and all of the
rights of the Stockholder set forth in this Section (A)(2) of Article VI shall
forever terminate.



3.If at any time the number of Stockholder Designees then serving as directors
or as members of any committee of the Board of Directors exceeds the number of 

Stockholder Designees the Stockholder is entitled to designate to the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof pursuant to this Section (A) of Article VI,
the Stockholder shall cause the number of Stockholder Designees then serving
as directors or as members of such committee of the Board of Directors
representing such excess to resign immediately as directors or committee
members, as applicable.



4.In the event of any change in the authorized number of directors, each
director then continuing to serve as such shall nevertheless continue as a
director until the expiration of his current term, or his prior death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal. In the event of any
increase in the authorized number of directors as a result of which the
Stockholder shall be entitled to designate one or more additional Stockholder
Designees based upon the increased size of the Board of Directors and the then
Stockholder Voting Percentage, (i) the Stockholder shall be entitled promptly
to designate such Stockholder Designees, and (ii) the Corporation shall cause
the prompt appointment or election of such Stockholder Designee(s) as
director(s) . If at any time the Stockholder Voting Percentage is less than
ten percent (10%), all of the rights of the Stockholder set forth in this
Section (A)(4) of Article VI shall forever terminate.



5.The Company and the Stockholder shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause at least three of the directors to be considered "independent" under the
rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York Stock Exchange
and any other or additional exchange on which the securities of the
Corporation are listed, including for purposes of Rule 10A‑3 promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (or any successor rule
thereto).



(B)Vacancies. Any vacancies of the Board of Directors resulting from death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other reason
may be filled as provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation; provided that upon
any such vacancy resulting in any Stockholder Designee ceasing to serve as a
director at a time when the Stockholder has the right under Section (A)(2) of
Article VI to designate a replacement Stockholder Designee, (i) the
Stockholder shall be entitled promptly to designate a replacement Stockholder
Designee to fill such vacancy, and (ii) the Corporation shall cause the prompt
appointment or election of such replacement Stockholder Designee as a
director.



(C)Written Ballots not Required. Elections of directors need not be by written
ballot unless the Bylaws of the Corporation shall so provide.



(D)Removal of Directors. Subject to the rights of the holders of any class or
series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, any director may be removed from
office at any time, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the outstanding
shares of the Corporation\'s capital stock entitled to elect such director,
voting separately as a class, at a duly organized meeting of stockholders or
by written consent; provided that no Stockholder Designee may be removed under
this Section (D) of Article VI without the prior written consent of the
Stockholder. 

(E)Corporate Opportunity Matters.



1.Except as set forth in Section (E)(2) of this Article VI, to the extent
permitted by the DGCL, if any non-employee director (or any of his or her
affiliates) acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may
be a corporate opportunity in the same or similar activity or line of business
as the Corporation, the Corporation shall have no interest or expectancy in
being offered by such non-employee director any opportunity to participate in
such corporate opportunity, any such interest or expectancy being hereby
renounced, so that, as a result of such renunciation and without limiting the
scope of such renunciation, such person (a) shall have no duty to communicate
or present such corporate opportunity to the Corporation and (b) shall have
the right to hold any such corporate opportunity for its (and its officers\',
directors\', agents\', stockholders\' or affiliates\') own account or to
recommend, sell, assign or transfer such corporate opportunity to any
individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, governmental entity or other entity of any kind or
nature (each, a "Person") other than the Corporation; provided, however, that
the foregoing shall not preclude or prevent the Corporation from pursuing any
corporate opportunity that may be presented to it by any means.



2.Notwithstanding the provisions of Section (E)(1) of this Article VI, the
Corporation does not renounce any interest or expectancy it may have in any
corporate opportunity that is offered to any non-employee director, if such
opportunity is expressly offered to such non-employee director (or his or her
affiliates) solely in, and as a direct result of, his or her capacity as a
director of the Corporation.



ARTICLE VII

MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS; ACTION WITHOUT A MEETING



(A)Meetings of Stockholders. Meetings of stockholders may be held within or
without the State of Delaware, as the Bylaws of the Corporation may provide.
Special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation (i) may be called, for
any purpose or purposes, by the chairman of the Board of Directors or the
chief executive officer and (ii) shall be called by the secretary of the
Corporation at the request of (a) a majority of the Board of Directors or (b)
for so long as the Stockholder Voting Percentage is twenty-five percent (25%)
or greater, the holders of not less than thirty-three and one third percent
(33-1/3%) of the voting power of all of the outstanding voting stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote generally for the election of directors, which
such request must be in writing, shall state the purpose or purposes of the
proposed meeting (which shall be included in the notice of such meeting) and
shall include all information required to be delivered pursuant to the notice
requirements set forth in the Bylaws of the Corporation in order for
nominations or business, as applicable, to be properly brought before a
meeting by a stockholder. If at any time the Stockholder Voting Percentage is
less than twenty-five percent (25%), the stockholders\' ability to request a
special meeting of stockholders pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence
shall forever terminate. Each special meeting shall be held within a
reasonable time after being called in accordance with the preceding sentence.
Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the election of directors and of
business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of the stockholders
of the Corporation shall be given in the manner provided in the Bylaws of the
Corporation. The books of the Corporation may be kept (subject to any
provision contained in the statutes) outside the State of 

Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by the
Board of Directors or in the Bylaws of the Corporation.



(B)Stockholder Action by Written Consent. For so long as the Stockholder
Voting Percentage is twenty-five percent (25%) or greater, any action required
or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may
be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a
consent or consents in writing setting forth the action so taken shall be
signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
If at any time the Stockholder Voting Percentage is less than twenty-five
percent (25%), the stockholders\' ability to act by written consent pursuant
to the immediately preceding sentence shall forever terminate, and,
thereafter, (i) no action shall be taken by the stockholders of the
Corporation except at an annual or special meeting of such stockholders and
(ii) the stockholders may not take action by written consent.



ARTICLE VIII

CONSENTS



(A)In addition to any other vote, consent or approval required by this
Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws of the Corporation, or applicable
law, for so long as the Stockholder Voting Percentage is thirty percent (30%)

to, take or agree to take any of the following actions, in each case without
the prior written consent of the Stockholder, which consent the Stockholder

Agreement)) that would result in the Corporation and its subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, having or being liable for Indebtedness (as defined in the
Stockholder\'s Agreement) in an aggregate principal amount that would result
in the Debt to Cash Flow Ratio (as defined in the Stockholder\'s Agreement)
for the Corporation\'s most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which
financial statements are available to be greater than 5.25 to 1.0 on a pro
forma basis as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred at the
beginning of such four-quarter period;



2.take any action or enter into any transaction that would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach of or default under any credit agreement,
indenture, note, or similar instrument or security to which the Stockholder or
any of its affiliates is a party or is bound;



3.acquire (including by way of merger, recapitalization, reorganization,
liquidation or dissolution) any business, debt or equity interests, operations
or assets of any Person, or make any investment in or loan to any Person, in
any single transaction or series of related transactions (excluding the
acquisition of products and equipment in the ordinary course of business), for
consideration in excess of $1,000,000,000; 

4.sell, lease, transfer, Encumber (as defined in the Stockholder\'s Agreement)

awards to officers or employees of the Corporation or its subsidiaries that
are approved by the Board or the applicable committee thereof or issuances of
securities to the Corporation or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries) or (ii)
for the purpose of redeeming or purchasing any indebtedness of the Corporation
held by the Stockholder or its affiliates;



7.subject to Section (E)(3)(e) of Article IV, (i) repurchase or redeem any

basis with respect to all stockholders of the Corporation, or a dividend to
the Corporation or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries; or



8.hire, or terminate without cause, its Chief Executive Officer, or agree to

(B)In addition to any other vote, consent or approval required by this
Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws of the Corporation, or applicable
law, for so long as the Stockholder Voting Percentage is five percent (5%) or
greater, the Corporation shall not amend or seek to amend this Certificate of
Incorporation, the Bylaws of the Corporation or the Stockholder\'s Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the creation of any shareholder rights
plan or other amendment intended to limit the Stockholder\'s ownership or
acquisition of securities of the Corporation) in any manner that could limit,
restrict or adversely affect the Stockholder or its rights thereunder without
the prior written consent of the Stockholder, which consent may be withheld in
its sole discretion.



(C)Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if at any time
the Stockholder Voting Percentage is less than thirty percent (30%), all of
the obligation of the Corporation and rights of the Stockholder set forth in
Section (A) of this Article VIII shall forever terminate.





ARTICLE IX

INDEMNIFICATION



(A)The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL in
effect on the date of the effectiveness of this Certificate of Incorporation,
and to such greater extent as the 

DGCL may thereafter permit, indemnify any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative by
reason of the fact that he is or was a director, manager, member, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, manager, member, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys\' fees),
judgments, liabilities, losses, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually
and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding.



(B)To the extent that a director, manager, member, officer, employee or agent
of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense
of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section (A) of this Article
IX, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be
indemnified against expenses (including attorneys\' fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.



(C)Any indemnification under Section (A) of this Article IX (unless ordered by
a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific
case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer,
employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL. Such determination shall
be made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum
consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or
proceeding, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if
obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent
legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders of the
Corporation.



(D)Expenses (including attorneys\' fees) incurred by an officer, director, a
manager of a Corporation limited liability company, or a member of a
management committee of a Corporation limited liability company, in defending
any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or
proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of such director, officer, manager or member to repay such
amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article IX. Such expenses
(including attorneys\' fees) incurred by other employees and agents may be so
paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems
appropriate.



(E)The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, the other sections of this Article IX shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law, Bylaw, agreement, vote
of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in
an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office.



(F)The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person
who is or was a director, officer, manager, employee or agent of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, manager, member, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in
any such capacity, or 

arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have
the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of
Section 145 of the DGCL.



(G)For purposes of this Article IX, references to "the Corporation" shall
include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or joint venturer or
other enterprise (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a
consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would
have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, managers,
members, employees or agents so that any person who is or was a director,
officer, manager, member, employee or agent of such constituent corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, or joint venturer or other enterprise,
or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, or joint venturer or other enterprise
as a director, officer, manager, member, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of
this Article IX with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, or joint venturer or other enterprise
as he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate
existence had continued.



(H)For purposes of this Article IX, (i) references to "other enterprises"
shall include employee benefit plans, including without limitation, any plan
of the Corporation which is governed by the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended from time to time (collectively, "Employee
Benefit Plans"), (ii) references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes
assessed on a person with respect to an Employee Benefit Plan, (iii)
references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any
service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which
imposes duties on, or involves service by, such director, officer, employee or
agent with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan, its participants or
beneficiaries, and (iv) a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and
beneficiaries of an Employee Benefit Plan shall be deemed to have acted in a
manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to
in this Article IX.



(I)The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Article IX shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized
or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,
manager, member, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.



(J)The provisions of this Article IX shall be deemed to be a contract between
the Corporation and each director, officer, employee or agent who serves in
such capacity at any time while this Article IX is in effect. Any repeal or
modification of this Article IX shall be prospective only, and shall not
adversely affect any rights or obligations then existing with respect to any
state of facts then or theretofore existing or any action, suit or proceeding
theretofore or thereafter brought based in whole or in part upon any such
state of facts, whether such state of facts was then known or later known.





ARTICLE X

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY



A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director\'s
duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, as the same
exists or hereafter may be amended or replaced, or (iv) for any transaction
from which the director derived any improper personal benefit. If the DGCL is
amended after the date of filing this Certificate of Incorporation to
authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal
liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation,
in addition to the limitation on personal liability provided herein, shall be
limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as so amended. Any repeal
or modification of this Article X shall be prospective only, and shall not
adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the
Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.





ARTICLE XI

AMENDMENTS TO CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION



The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now or
hereafter prescribed by law and subject to Section C of Article VIII, and all
rights and powers conferred herein on stockholders, directors and officers are
subject to this reserved power; provided that, notwithstanding the fact that a
lesser percentage may be specified by the DGCL, the affirmative vote of the
holders of record of outstanding shares representing at least seventy-five
percent (75%) of the voting power of all of the shares of capital stock of the
Corporation then entitled to vote generally in the election of the Board of
Directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend,
alter, change, repeal, or adopt any provision or provisions inconsistent with,
Article IX and this Article XI of this Certificate of Incorporation unless
such amendment, alteration, change, repeal or adoption of any inconsistent
provision or provisions is adopted or authorized by the Board of Directors by
the affirmative vote of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of all of the
members of the Board of Directors.



ARTICLE XII

GOVERNING LAW; FORUM FOR ADJUDICATION OF DISPUTES



This Certificate of Incorporation and the internal affairs of the Corporation
shall be governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of Delaware,
excluding its conflict of laws principles. Unless the Corporation consents in
writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative
action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action
asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer
or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation\'s
stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any
provision of the Delaware Corporation Law, this Certificate of Incorporation
or the Bylaws of the Corporation, or (iv) any other action asserting a claim

PREAMBLE

In accordance with power conferred to the board of directors (the "Board of
Directors") of T-Mobile US, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"),
in the Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation ("Certificate
of Incorporation") of the Corporation, the Board of Directors approved and
adopted these Fifth Amended and Restated Bylaws (these "Bylaws"), effective as

Law of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Corporation Law") and the
Certificate of Incorporation. In the event of a direct conflict between the

ARTICLE II

MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

1. All meetings of the stockholders for the election of directors shall be held at such time and place either within or without the State of Delaware as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting. Meetings of stockholders for any other purpose may be held at such time and place, within or without the State of Delaware, as shall be stated in the notice of the meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof.

2. The annual meeting of the stockholders for the election of directors and the transaction of such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting shall be held at such date, time and place as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting. 



3. Written notice of the annual meeting stating the place, date and hour of the meeting shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not fewer than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting.

4. The officer of the Corporation who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting of stockholders (provided, however, if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten days before the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date), arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares of each class of capital stock registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. Except as provided by applicable law, the stock ledger of the Corporation shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger and the list of stockholders entitled to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

5. Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called as set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation.

6. Written notice of a special meeting stating the date, time and place of the meeting and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given not fewer than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting, to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting.

7. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice.

8. At each meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders holding issued and outstanding capital stock of the Corporation having not less than a majority of the votes of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. A quorum, once established, shall not be broken by the subsequent withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or, if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. 



9. When a quorum is present at any meeting, unless otherwise required by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, the election of directors and any advisory vote on the frequency of stockholder votes related to the compensation of executives required by Section 14A(a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), shall be decided by a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting in person or by proxy by the holders of stock entitled to vote therein. When a quorum is present at any meeting, unless otherwise required by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, any matter, other than the election of directors and an advisory vote on the frequency of stockholder votes related to the compensation of executives required by Section 14A(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, brought before any meeting of stockholders shall be decided by the vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy in favor of such action by the holders of stock entitled to vote therein. For the avoidance of doubt, abstentions and, except as may be permitted pursuant to the rules of any exchange where the securities of the Corporation may be listed, broker non-votes, will not be counted as votes cast for such purposes.

10. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, in the Certificate of Incorporation, or in these Bylaws, each stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder, but no proxy shall be voted on after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Such proxy shall be filed with the Secretary before or at the time of the meeting. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to the secretary of the Corporation a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot.

11. The Board of Directors of the Corporation may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of the stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. At every meeting of stockholders, the chief executive officer, or in his or her absence or inability to act, the secretary, or, in his or her absence or inability to act, the person whom the chief executive officer shall appoint, shall act as chairman of, and preside at, the meeting. The secretary or, in his or her absence or inability act, the person whom the chairman of the meeting shall appoint as secretary of the meeting, shall act as secretary of the meeting and keep the minutes thereof. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of the stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (a) order of business for the meeting; (b) the determination of when the polls shall open and close for any given matter to be voted on at the meeting; (c) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (d) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine; (e) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; (f) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants; and (g) policies and procedures with respect to the adjournment of such meeting. 



12. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, the provisions of this Section 12 shall apply to the nominations of directors to the Board of Directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made in advance of any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected as provided in the notice of meeting delivered in accordance with Sections 3 or 6 of this Article II, respectively. Nominations for election to the Board of Directors must be made by the Board of Directors or by any Eligible Stockholder (as defined below). Nominations, other than those made by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, must be preceded by notification in writing for each nominee received by the secretary of the Corporation at the executive offices of the Corporation (i) in the case of an annual meeting, not later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) calendar day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) calendar day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year\'s annual meeting, regardless of whether the party or parties seeking to make the nominations are seeking to include the nominees in management\'s proxy materials or in their own or other proxy materials; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) calendar days before or more than sixty (60) calendar days after such anniversary date, notification must be received by the secretary of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) calendar day prior to such annual meeting but not later than the close of business on the latter of the ninetieth (90th) calendar day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) calendar day following the calendar day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation, and (ii) in the case of a special meeting, not later than the close of business on the sixtieth (60th) calendar day nor earlier than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) calendar day prior to the date of such special meeting, or if the first public announcement of the date of such special meeting is less than seventy (70) days prior to the date of such special meeting, the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and, if applicable, of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. Such notification shall contain the following:

(a) the written consent of each proposed nominee to serve as a director if so
elected;

(b) the following information as to each proposed nominee:

(1) the name, age, citizenship, residence address, and business address of
each proposed nominee;

(2) the principal occupation or employment, and the name, type of business and
address of the Corporation or other organization in which such employment is
carried on, of such proposed nominee and of each such person nominating such
proposed nominee;

(3) the qualifications of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the
Corporation;

(4) the amount of stock of the Corporation owned of record and beneficially,
either directly or indirectly, by each proposed nominee; 



(5) a description of any arrangement or understanding of each proposed nominee
and of each person proposing such nomination with each other or any other
person regarding future employment or any future transaction to which the
Corporation will or may be a party; and

(6) all information required by the Corporation\'s director questionnaire then
in use by the Corporation for its directors and officers, a copy of which
shall be available at the offices of the Corporation; and

(c) the following information with respect to the stockholder giving the
notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is
made, and as to each person, acting alone or in conjunction with one or more
other persons as a partnership, limited partnership, syndicate or other group,
who participates or is expected to participate in making such nomination or in
organizing, directing or financing such nomination or solicitation of proxies
to vote for the nominee:

(1) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the
Corporation\'s books, and such beneficial owner;

(2) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are owned of
record and beneficially by such stockholder and such beneficial owner;

(3) the voting rights of such stockholder; and

(4) the hedging and derivative positions of such stockholder, if any, in the
Corporation\'s capital stock.

The term "Eligible Stockholder" means a stockholder of the Corporation (i) who
is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice by such
stockholder provided for in this Section 12 or Section 13 (as the case may be)
and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote
at the applicable annual or special meeting of the stockholders, (ii) who is
entitled to vote on the business proposed in such notice to be conducted at an
annual meeting of the stockholders (in the case of Section 13) or for the
election of directors to be elected at an annual or special meeting of
stockholders (in the case of this Section 12) and (iii) who complies with the
applicable procedures set forth in this Section 12 or Section 13 (as the case
may be).

Public announcement of a stockholder meeting shall be deemed to occur upon
disclosure of the date of such meeting in a press release reported by the Dow
Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in
a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange
Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

13. At any meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been brought before the meeting (a) pursuant to the Corporation\'s notice of meeting, (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (c) by any Eligible Stockholder who complies with the notice procedures set forth in these Bylaws. The procedures referred to in clause (c) of the immediately preceding sentence and described in the remainder of this Section 13 shall be 

the exclusive means for a stockholder to submit business (other than
stockholder proposals properly submitted in accordance with Rule 14a-8 under
the Exchange Act and included in the Corporation\'s notice of meeting) to be
considered or acted upon at an annual meeting of stockholders. To be properly
brought before a special meeting of the stockholders, business must be
specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), and
stockholders shall not be entitled to submit business to be considered or
acted upon at any special meeting except in accordance with any applicable
procedures for calling a special meeting as set forth in the Certificate of
Incorporation. For the avoidance of doubt, the nomination of directors and the
election of directors are deemed separate and distinct items of business, and
candidates eligible for election to the Board of Directors at any meeting will
be limited to those candidates who have been nominated in accordance with the
provisions of Section 12.

For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder
pursuant to clause (c) of this Section 13, the stockholder must have given
timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the Corporation and such
business must otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action. To be
timely, a stockholder\'s notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at
the principal executive offices of the Corporation (i) in the case of an
annual meeting, not later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th)
calendar day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred
twentieth (120th) calendar day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding
year\'s annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of
the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) calendar days before or more than
sixty (60) calendar days after such anniversary date, notice to the
Corporation to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of
business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) calendar day prior to such
annual meeting but not later than the close of business on the latter of the
ninetieth (90th) calendar day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th)
calendar day following the calendar day on which public announcement of the
date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation, and (ii) in the case of
a special meeting, not later than the close of business on the ninetieth
(90th) calendar day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred
twentieth (120th) calendar day prior to the date of such special meeting, or
if the first public announcement of the date of such special meeting is less
than one hundred (100) days prior to the date of such special meeting, the
tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made
of the date of the special meeting. A stockholder\'s notice to the secretary
shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the
meeting (i) a precise description of the business desired to be brought before
the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, (ii)
the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation\'s books, of the
stockholder proposing such business, and the name and address of the
beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, (iii) the
class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned
of record and beneficially and of record by such stockholder of record and by
the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf of the proposal is made, (iv)
any material interest of such stockholder of record and the beneficial owner,
if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made in such business, (v) the voting
rights of such stockholder; and (vi) the hedging and derivative positions of
such stockholder, if any, in the Corporation\'s stock. The preceding
requirements must be met independently for each item of business that any
stockholder proposes to bring before a meeting, regardless of whether the
stockholder seeks to include the proposal in management\'s proxy materials or
in their own or other proxy materials. 



Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be
conducted at a meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this Section 13. The presiding officer of the meeting shall, if the facts
warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly
brought before the meeting and in accordance with the procedures prescribed by
this Section 13, and if such person should so determine, such person shall so
declare to the meeting any such business not properly brought before the
meeting shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 13, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with
respect to the matters set forth in this Section 13.

14. Failure to receive notice of any meeting shall not invalidate the meeting.

15. The Board of Directors, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, may, and shall if required by law, appoint one or more inspectors, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and make a written report thereof. The Board of Directors may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall (a) ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, (b) determine the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum and the validity of proxies and ballots, (c) count all votes and ballots, (d) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors and (e) certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of all votes and ballots. The inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist the inspectors in the performance of their duties. Unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors, the date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be determined by the person presiding at the meeting and shall be announced at the meeting. No ballot, proxies, votes or any revocation thereof or change thereto, shall be accepted by the inspectors after the closing of the polls unless the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware upon application by a stockholder shall determine otherwise. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. No person who is a candidate for office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election.

ARTICLE III

DIRECTORS

1. Except as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, the number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be determined by resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that no decrease in the number of directors shall have the effect of shortening the term of an incumbent director.

qualified, unless he shall resign, die, become disqualified or disabled, or

8. At all meetings of the Board of Directors a majority of all directors then serving in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of 

Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by applicable law,
the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws. A quorum, once established,
shall not be broken by the subsequent withdrawal or departure of directors to
leave less than a quorum. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of
the Board of Directors, the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting
from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting,
until a quorum shall be present. Any business may be transacted at an
adjourned meeting that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally
called.

9. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board of Directors or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee.

10. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee, by means of conference call, video conference, webcast or other means by which all persons participating in the meeting can hear or communicate with each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.

The secretary shall act as secretary at each meeting of the Board of Directors. If the secretary is absent from any meeting of the Board of Directors, an assistant secretary shall perform the duties of secretary at such meeting; and in the absence from any such meeting of the secretary and all assistant secretaries, the person presiding at the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

12. The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of all of the directors, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Corporation, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation.

Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of
Directors, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the
Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the
Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to
all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or

all meetings of such committee, a majority of the then authorized members of
the committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and
the vote of a majority of the members of the committee present at any meeting
at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the committee. A quorum, once
established, shall not be broken by the subsequent withdrawal or departure of
directors to leave less than a quorum. Each committee shall keep regular
minutes of its meetings. Unless the Board of Directors or the committee
charter provides otherwise and subject to the provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation, each committee designated by the Board of Directors may make,
alter and repeal rules and procedures for the conduct of its business. In the
absence of such rules and procedures each committee shall conduct its business
in the same manner as the Board of Directors conducts its business pursuant to

Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors, or members of a committee need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.

Upon written request, every holder of capital stock in the Corporation shall be entitled to have a certificate, signed by, or in the name of the Corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman of the Board of Directors, or the president or a vice-president, and by the treasurer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of the Corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by him in the Corporation; provided that the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any class or series of capital stock shall be uncertificated shares that may be evidenced by a book-entry system maintained by the registrar of such stock. If shares are represented by certificates such certificates shall be in a form approved by the Board of Directors.

If the Corporation shall be authorized to issue more than one class of stock
or more than one series of any class, the powers, designations, and
preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of
each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or
restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or
summarized on the face or back of the certificate which the Corporation shall
issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided that, except as
otherwise provided in section 202 of the Delaware Corporation Law, in lieu of
the foregoing requirements, there may be set forth on the face or back of the
certificate which the Corporation shall issue to represent such class or
series of stock, a statement that the Corporation will furnish without charge
to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, and preferences
and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of
stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of
such preferences and/or rights.

2. Any of or all the signatures on the certificate may be facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

LOST CERTIFICATES

3. The Board of Directors may direct a new certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates or uncertificated shares, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his legal representative, to advertise the same in such manner as it shall require and/or to give the Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as 

indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation with
respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

4. The Board of Directors may appoint, or authorize any officer or officers to appoint, one or more transfer agents and one or more registrars.

TRANSFER OF STOCK

5. Stock of the Corporation shall be transferable in the manner prescribed by applicable law and in these Bylaws. Transfers of stock shall be made on the books of the Corporation only by the person named as the holder thereof on the stock records of the Corporation, by such person\'s attorney lawfully constituted in writing, and in the case of shares represented by a certificate upon the surrender of the certificate thereof, which shall be canceled before a new certificate or uncertificated shares shall be issued. No transfer of stock shall be valid as against the Corporation for any purpose until it shall have been entered in the stock records of the Corporation by an entry showing from and to whom transferred. Subject to Section 155 of the Delaware Corporation Law, to the extent designated by the president or any vice president or the treasurer of the Corporation, the Corporation may recognize the transfer of fractional uncertificated shares, but shall not otherwise be required to recognize the transfer of fractional shares. Upon surrender to the Corporation or the transfer agent of the Corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignation or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the Corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.

FIXING RECORD DATE

6. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

7. Subject to Section 213 of the Delaware Corporation Law, the record date for a determination of the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a 

meeting shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting
forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation
by delivery to its registered office in Delaware (by hand or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested), its principal place of business or
to any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which
proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.

REGISTERED STOCKHOLDERS

8. The Corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its books as the owner of shares and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of the State of Delaware.

ARTICLE III

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Section 3.1 Board Representation. At all times when the Stockholder\'s Voting
Percentage is 10% or more:

(a) The Company and the Stockholder shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause at least three of the Directors to be considered "independent" under the
rules of the SEC, the NYSE and any other or additional exchange on which the
securities of the Company are listed, including for purposes of Rule 10A‑3
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any successor rule thereto).

(b) The Stockholder shall have the right to designate a number of individuals
to be nominees for election to the Board ("Stockholder Designees") equal to
the Stockholder\'s Voting Percentage multiplied by the total number of
Directors that the Company would have if there were no vacancies, rounded to
the nearest whole number (and in any event not less than one), and the Company
and the Stockholder shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such
Stockholder Designees to be elected to the Board; provided that the number of
Directors who are Affiliated Directors shall not in any event exceed a number
equal to the Stockholder\'s Voting Percentage multiplied by the total number
of Directors that the Company would have if there were no vacancies, rounded
to the nearest whole number greater than zero. If at any time the
Stockholder\'s Voting Percentage is less than 10%, the Stockholder shall
promptly cause all of the Stockholder Designees then serving as Directors to
resign from the Board, and the contractual rights of the Stockholder to
designate one or more Stockholder Designees pursuant to this Article III shall
forever terminate. 

(c) The Company shall cause any committee of the Board to include in its
membership a number of Stockholder Designees then serving as Directors equal
to the Stockholder\'s Voting Percentage multiplied by the total number of
members that such committee would have if there were no vacancies on such
committee, rounded to the nearest whole number, except to the extent that such
membership would violate the rules of the SEC, the NYSE and any other or
additional exchange on which the securities of the Company are listed, or any
other applicable securities Laws; provided, however, that no committee may
consist solely of Affiliated Directors. If at any time the number of
Stockholder Designees then serving as Directors or as members of any committee
of the Board exceeds the number of Stockholder Designees the Stockholder is
entitled to designate to the Board or any committee thereof pursuant to this
Article III, the Stockholder shall cause the number of Stockholder Designees
then serving as Directors or as members of such committee of the Board
representing such excess to resign immediately as Directors or committee
members, as applicable.

(d) Each Stockholder Designee shall not be prohibited or disqualified from
serving as a Director pursuant to any rule or regulation of the SEC, the NYSE
or any other or additional exchange on which securities of the Company are
listed or by applicable Law. The Stockholder shall, and shall cause the
Stockholder Designees to, timely provide the Company with accurate and
complete information relating to the Stockholder and the Stockholder Designees
that may be required to be disclosed by the Company under the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act, including such information required to be furnished by
the Company with respect to the Stockholder Designees in a proxy statement
pursuant to Rule 14a‑101 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and the
nationality of such Stockholder Designee. In addition, at the Company\'s
request, the Stockholder shall cause the Stockholder Designees to complete and
execute the Company\'s director and officer questionnaire prior to being
elected to the Board or standing for reelection at an annual meeting of
stockholders or at such other time as may be reasonably requested by the
Company.

(e) With respect to each meeting of stockholders of the Company at which
Directors are to be elected, the Company shall provide the Stockholder with
notice of such meeting not less than 120 days prior to the date thereof, and
the Stockholder shall provide the Company with written notice of the names
(together with all other information requested by the Company pursuant to
Section 3.1(d)) of the Stockholder Designees to be nominated for election at
such meeting not more than 30 days following the delivery of such notice. If
the Stockholder shall fail to timely provide the Company with the names of
that number of Stockholder Designees equal to the number of Stockholder
Designees the Stockholder is entitled to designate pursuant to this Article
III, the Nominating Committee of the Board may select alternative nominees for
such positions. If any Stockholder Designee is not qualified, available or
eligible to stand for election, then the Stockholder may name an acceptable
and available replacement Stockholder Designee and any such Stockholder
Designee will be included as a nominee for election at such meeting if written
notice of the name of such Stockholder Designee is provided to the Company
within a reasonable period of time prior to the mailing of the proxy statement
for such meeting. The Company shall cause the Stockholder Designees to be
included in the slate of Directors approved and recommended by the Board for
election at such meeting and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the election of each such Stockholder Designee, including soliciting proxies
in favor of the election of such Stockholder Designees at such meeting. 

(f) In the event the size of the Board is increased at any time and as a
result of such increase, the Stockholder shall be entitled to designate one or
more additional Stockholder Designees based upon the increased size of the
Board and its then Voting Percentage pursuant to this Section 3.1, (i) the
Stockholder shall be entitled promptly to designate such Stockholder
Designees, and (ii) the Company shall cause the prompt appointment or election
of such Stockholder Designee(s) as Director(s).

(g) Upon the resignation, retirement, death or other removal (with or without
cause) from office of any Stockholder Designee serving as a Director at a time
when the Stockholder has the right under this Section 3.1 to designate a
replacement Stockholder Designee, (i) the Stockholder shall be entitled
promptly to designate a replacement Stockholder Designee and (ii) the Company
shall cause the prompt appointment or election of such replacement Stockholder
Designee as a Director.

Section 3.2 Specified Actions. In addition to any other vote, consent or
approval required by the Company\'s Organizational Documents, this Agreement
or applicable Law, for so long as the Stockholder\'s Voting Percentage is 30%
or greater, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
take or agree to take any of the following actions, in each case without the
prior written consent of the Stockholder, which consent the Stockholder may
withhold in its sole discretion:

(a) create, incur, issue, assume or otherwise become liable for (including
through a merger, acquisition or otherwise) or refinance or guarantee any
Indebtedness (excluding any Permitted Debt) that would result in the Company
and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, having or being liable for
Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount that would result in the Debt to
Cash Flow Ratio for the Company\'s most recently ended four full fiscal
quarters for which financial statements are available to be greater than 5.25
to 1.0 on a pro forma basis as if the additional Indebtedness had been
incurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period;

(b) take any action or enter into any transaction that would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach of or default under any credit agreement,
indenture, note, or similar instrument or security to which the Stockholder or
any of its Affiliates is a party or is bound;

(c) acquire (including by way of merger, recapitalization, reorganization,
liquidation or dissolution) any business, debt or equity interests, operations
or assets of any Person, or make any investment in or loan to any Person, in
any single transaction or series of related transactions (excluding the
acquisition of products and equipment in the ordinary course of business), for
consideration in excess of $1,000,000,000;

(d) sell, lease, transfer, Encumber (other than Permitted Liens) or otherwise
dispose of (including by way of merger, recapitalization, reorganization,
liquidation or dissolution) any division, business, or operations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any equity interests of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, in any single transaction or series of related
transactions, for consideration in excess of $1,000,000,000;

(e) change the size of the Board; 

(f) issue any equity or equity-linked securities or other Voting Securities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in any single transaction or series of
related transactions, (i) constituting 10% or more of the then outstanding
shares of Common Stock (other than grants of incentive awards to officers or
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries that are approved by the Board or
the applicable committee thereof or issuances of securities to the Company or
any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries) or (ii) for the purpose of redeeming or
purchasing any indebtedness of the Company held by the Stockholder or its
Affiliates;

(g) (i) except as required in the Organizational Documents, repurchase or
redeem any equity (or equity-based) securities of the Company or any of its
non-wholly owned Subsidiaries, or (ii) make any extraordinary or in-kind
dividend with respect to any of the equity (or equity-based) securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than a dividend on a pro rata basis
with respect to all stockholders of the Company, or a dividend to the Company
or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries; or

(h) hire, or terminate without cause, its Chief Executive Officer, or agree to
do so.

Section 3.3 Organizational Documents Actions. In addition to any other vote,
consent or approval required by the Company\'s Organizational Documents, this
Agreement or applicable Law, for so long as the Stockholder\'s Voting
Percentage is 5% or greater, the Company shall not amend or seek to amend its
Organizational Documents (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the creation
of any shareholder rights plan or other amendment intended to limit the
Stockholder\'s ownership or acquisition of securities of the Company) in any
manner that could limit, restrict or adversely affect the Stockholder or its
rights thereunder without the prior written consent of the Stockholder, which
consent may be withheld in its sole discretion.

Section 3.4 Debt Defaults. The Company shall notify the Stockholder any time
it is reasonably likely that the Company will default on any Indebtedness (as
defined in the Business Combination Agreement) with a principal amount greater
than $75 million (a "Potential Default"). Thereupon, the Stockholder shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to provide new debt financing to the
Company up to the amount of the Indebtedness that is the subject of the
Potential Default plus any applicable prepayment or other penalties, on the
same terms and conditions as such Indebtedness (together with any waiver of
the Potential Default). If Stockholder elects to provide the Company with new
debt financing, the Company shall take any actions reasonably requested by the
Stockholder (i) to prepare documentation reflecting the terms and conditions
of the new debt financing; (ii) to repay the Indebtedness that is the subject
of the Potential Default; and (iii) to take any other action necessary or
desirable to avert the Potential Default.

Section 3.5 Information.

(a) For so long as the Stockholder\'s Voting Percentage is 10% or greater, the
Stockholder shall be entitled to the information and consultation rights set
forth in this Section 3.5 with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, in
addition to any other vote, consent or approval rights set forth herein, in
the Company\'s Organizational Documents or otherwise: (i) the Stockholder
shall be entitled to consult with the officers of the Company with respect to 

the Company\'s business and financial matters, including management\'s
proposed annual operating plans, and, upon request, members of management will
meet with representatives of the Stockholder at mutually agreeable times and
places for such consultation, including to review progress in achieving said
plans; provided that such consultation shall not unreasonably disrupt the
normal operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries and the Stockholder shall
be responsible for any out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the
Company in connection with such consultation; (ii) the Company shall furnish
the Stockholder with such available financial and operating data and other
information with respect to the business and properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as the Stockholder may reasonably request; provided that such
request must be made through the Company\'s chief financial officer or one or
more individuals designated by such person, and in any event, if a Stockholder
Designee is then serving as a Director, with all information provided to
members of the Board; and (iii) the Stockholder shall be entitled to inspect
all books and records and facilities and properties of the Company at
reasonable times and intervals.

(b) Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, regulations and rules
(including the regulations and rules of the NYSE and any other or additional
exchange on which the securities of the Company are listed), the Stockholder
shall, and shall cause its officers, directors, employees, accountants,
counsel and consultants ("Representatives") and the Stockholder Designees to,
keep confidential all information and documents of the Company and its
Affiliates obtained by the Stockholder and the Stockholder Designees (the
"Company Information") unless the Company Information (i) is or becomes
publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 3.5 by
the Stockholder, including by way of actions taken by its Representatives or
the Stockholder Designees; (ii) was within the possession of the Stockholder
or the Stockholder Designees prior to being furnished such information by or
on behalf of the Company on a non-confidential basis; provided that the source
of such information was not known by the Stockholder, its Representatives or
the Stockholder Designees to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or
other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the Company Information;
(iii) was available to the Stockholder or the Stockholder Designees on a non-
confidential basis from a source other than the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives; provided that such source
was not known to the Stockholder or the Stockholder Designees to be bound by a
confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary
obligation of confidentiality to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to such Company Information; or (iv) was independently developed by or
on behalf of the Stockholder without violating any of the obligations under
this Section 3.5. The Stockholder shall, and shall cause its controlled
Affiliates, Representatives, and the Affiliated Directors to, comply with
applicable law regarding insider trading in the Company\'s securities to the
extent any of them is in possession of Company Information.

(c) The Stockholder hereby acknowledges that it is aware and will advise its
Representatives who are informed as to the matters which are the subject of
this Agreement, that the United States securities Laws prohibit any Person who
is in possession of material, non-public information concerning the matters
that are the subject of this Agreement from purchasing or selling securities
of the Company or from communicating such information to any other Person
under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such Person is
likely to purchase or sell securities. 

(d) From the date hereof until the next subsequent filing of the Company\'s
annual report on Form 10-K, the Stockholder agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to assist the Company with the integration of TMUS and its

and shall cause the Stockholder Designees then serving as Directors not to,
support, enter into or vote in favor of any transaction between, or involving
both (A) the Company and (B) the Stockholder or an Affiliate of the
Stockholder unless such transaction is approved by a majority of the
Directors, which majority includes a majority of the Non-Affiliated Directors
(it being understood that such approval or similar approvals in this Agreement
shall not require any separate vote or consent of the Non-Affiliated
Directors).

(b) From and after the Closing, the Stockholder agrees that the Non-Affiliated
Directors shall direct and make any determinations with respect to the
Company\'s post-Closing actions under Section 2.4 of the Business Combination
Agreement.

ARTICLE IV

TRANSFERS OF COMMON STOCK

Section 4.1 Certain Acquisitions. (a) The Stockholder shall not, and shall
cause each of its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, alone or in
concert with any other Person, acquire, offer to acquire or agree to acquire
(including from the Company) Beneficial Ownership of any Common Stock that
would cause the Stockholder\'s and its Affiliates\' Voting Percentage to
exceed 80.1%, except in accordance with the following provisions of this
Section 4.1.

(b) If the Stockholder or its Affiliates proposes to acquire Common Stock that
would cause the Stockholder\'s Voting Percentage to exceed 80.1% (the
"Proposed Acquisition"), the Stockholder or its Affiliates shall offer to
acquire all of the then-outstanding Common Stock at the same price and on the
same terms and conditions as the Proposed Acquisition (the "Stockholder
Purchase Offer"). For the avoidance of doubt, the Stockholder Purchase Offer
may contemplate a merger or other consolidation, a tender offer, or any other
transaction that could permit the acquisition of all of the then-outstanding
Common Stock. The Stockholder shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not
to, consummate, in whole or in part, any Proposed Acquisition or Stockholder
Purchase Offer unless such Stockholder Purchase Offer is either (i) accepted
and approved by a majority of the Directors, which majority includes a
majority of the Non-Affiliated Directors, or (ii) accepted or approved by
holders of a majority of the Common Stock held by stockholders of the Company
other than the Stockholder and its Affiliates (either of clause (i) or (ii),
the "Required Approval"). The Stockholder may, in its sole discretion,
withdraw any Stockholder Purchase Offer and terminate any Proposed Acquisition
at any time. 

Section 4.2 Certain Dispositions. (a) The Stockholder shall not Transfer any
Registrable Shares during the 183-day period commencing at the Closing (the
"Lock-Up Period") other than Transfers approved by a majority of the
Directors, which majority includes a majority of the Non-Affiliated Directors.

(b) Following the Lock-Up Period, the Stockholder and its Affiliates may
freely Transfer their Common Stock subject to applicable Law, provided that if
the Stockholder intends to Transfer any Common Stock to a third party (the
"Proposed Acquiror"), as a result of which Transfer (to the knowledge of
Stockholder following reasonable inquiry) the Proposed Acquiror\'s Voting
Percentage would be greater than 30% (the "Proposed Sale"), then the
Stockholder shall not effect such Proposed Sale other than in accordance with
Section 4.2(c).

(c) No Proposed Sale shall be consummated unless the Proposed Acquiror shall
contemporaneously make a binding offer to acquire all of the then-outstanding
Common Stock of the Company, at the same price and on the same terms and
conditions as the Proposed Sale (the "Acquiror Purchase Offer"). For the
avoidance of doubt, the Acquiror Purchase Offer may contemplate a merger or
other consolidation, a tender offer, or any other transaction that permits the
acquisition of all of the then-outstanding Common Stock.

ARTICLE V

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

Section 5.1 Shelf Registration. As soon as reasonably practicable following
the Closing, and in any event within 30 days thereof, the Company shall file,
and shall thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to make and keep
effective (including by renewing or refiling upon expiration), a shelf
registration statement permitting the resale from time to time on a delayed or
continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act by the Stockholder
of the Registrable Securities, which registration statement shall be filed on
(i) Form S‑3, if the Company is then eligible to file a registration statement
on Form S‑3 (pursuant to the General Instructions to Form S‑3) ("S‑3
Eligible"), or (ii) any other appropriate form under the Securities Act for
the type of offering contemplated by the Stockholder, if the Company is not
then S‑3 Eligible. Thereafter, the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the written request of the Stockholder for a resale of
Registrable Securities (a "Takedown Request"), file a prospectus supplement (a
"Takedown Prospectus Supplement") to such shelf registration statement filed
under Rule 424 promulgated under the Securities Act with respect to resales of
the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Stockholder\'s intended method of
distribution thereof, and to the extent such Takedown Prospectus Supplement is
not automatically effective upon filing, shall, subject to the terms of this
Article V, use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such prospectus
supplement to be declared effective under the Securities Act promptly after
the filing thereof. Each Takedown Request shall specify the Registrable
Securities to be registered, their aggregate amount, and the intended method
or methods of distribution thereof. The Stockholder agrees to provide the
Company with such information in connection with a Takedown Request as may be
reasonably requested by the Company to ensure that the Takedown Prospectus
Supplement complies with the requirements of the Securities Act. 

Section 5.2 Demand Registration. At any time after the end of the Lock-Up
Period and at which time the shelf registration statement required pursuant to
Section 5.1 shall not be available for the resale of the Registrable
Securities, including if for any reason the Company shall be ineligible to
maintain or use a shelf registration statement, the Company shall, as promptly
as reasonably practicable following the written request of the Stockholder for
registration under the Securities Act of all or part of the Registrable
Securities (a "Demand Request"), file a registration statement with the SEC (a
"Demand Registration Statement") with respect to resales of the Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Stockholder\'s intended method of distribution
thereof, and shall, subject to the terms of this Article V, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Demand Registration Statement to
be declared effective under the Securities Act promptly after the filing
thereof; provided that such Demand Registration Statement shall be filed on
(i) Form S‑3, if the Company is then S‑3 Eligible, or (ii) any other
appropriate form under the Securities Act for the type of offering
contemplated by the Stockholder, if the Company is not then S‑3 Eligible. Each
Demand Request shall specify the Registrable Securities to be registered,
their aggregate amount, and the intended method or methods of distribution
thereof. The Stockholder agrees to provide the Company with such information
in connection with a Demand Request as may be reasonably requested by the
Company to ensure that the Demand Registration Statement complies with the
requirements of the Securities Act.

Section 5.3 Registration Obligations.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 5.1 or
Section 5.2, the Company shall not be obligated to prepare, file or cause a
Demand Registration Statement or Takedown Prospectus Supplement to become
effective:

(i) unless the expected proceeds from the sale of the Registrable Securities
to be included in such Demand Registration Statement or Takedown Prospectus
Supplement is $100,000,000 or greater; and

(ii) in the case of Registrable Shares, within 90 days after the effective
date of a Takedown Prospectus Supplement, a Demand Registration Statement or a
registration statement in which the Stockholder participated pursuant to its
piggy-back rights pursuant to Section 5.4 (provided that the number of
Registrable Shares included in such Piggy-Back Registration was not less than
60% of the number of Registrable Shares requested to be registered by the
Stockholder pursuant to the Piggy-Back Request related to such Piggy-Back
Registration), in each case with respect to Registrable Shares.

(b) Any Takedown Request or Demand Request may be revoked by notice from the
Stockholder to the Company at any time prior to the effective date of the
corresponding Takedown Prospectus Supplement or Demand Registration Statement;
provided that (i) the Stockholder reimburses the Company for all reasonable,
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company in connection with such
Takedown Request or Demand Request, and (ii) the Stockholder shall not make
another Takedown Request or Demand Request with respect to Registrable Shares
during the 45 days following the date of a revocation with respect to
Registrable Shares. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
shall be entitled to postpone and delay, for reasonable periods of time not in
excess of 60 days, but in no event more than twice in any 12-month period (a
"Blackout Period"), the filing or effectiveness of any Takedown Prospectus
Supplement or Demand Registration Statement or the offer or sale of any
Registrable Securities thereunder if one or more executive officers of the
Company shall determine in good faith that any such filing or the offering or
sale of any Registrable Securities thereunder would (i) impede, delay or
otherwise interfere with any pending or contemplated material acquisition,
disposition, corporate reorganization or other similar material transaction
involving the Company, (ii) based upon advice from the Company\'s investment
banker or financial advisor, materially and adversely impede, delay or
otherwise interfere with any pending or contemplated financing, offering or
sale of any class of securities by the Company, (iii) require disclosure of
material non-public information which, if disclosed at such time, would not be
in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, or (iv) have a
material adverse effect on the Company; provided, that in the event that the
Company proposes to register Common Stock, whether or not for sale for its own
account, during a Blackout Period, the Stockholder shall have the right to
exercise its rights under Section 5.4 with respect to such registration,
subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement on the exercise of such
rights. Upon notice by the Company to the Stockholder of any such
determination, the Stockholder shall, except as required by applicable Law,
including any disclosure obligations under Section 13 of the Exchange Act,
keep the fact of any such notice strictly confidential, and during any
Blackout Period, promptly halt any offer, sale, trading or Transfer by it of
any Common Stock for the duration of the Blackout Period set forth in such
notice (or until such Blackout Period shall be earlier terminated in writing
by the Company) and promptly halt any use, publication, dissemination or
distribution of any prospectus or prospectus supplement covering such
Registrable Securities for the duration of the Blackout Period set forth in
such notice (or until such Blackout Period shall be earlier terminated in
writing by the Company) and, if so directed by the Company, shall deliver to
the Company any copies then in its possession of any such prospectus or
prospectus supplement.

(d) The Stockholder agrees that any rights granted pursuant to this Article V
shall be subject to any rights pursuant to the Existing Registration Rights
Agreement to the extent such rights remain in effect after the Closing.

(e) In connection with any offering pursuant to a Takedown Prospectus
Supplement or a Demand Registration Statement, the managing underwriter for
such offering shall be selected by the Stockholder; provided, however, that
the managing underwriter must be a nationally recognized investment banking
firm.

Section 5.4 Piggy-Back Registration. If the Company at any time proposes or is
required to register any Common Stock or Company debt securities under the
Securities Act on its behalf or on behalf of any of its stockholders, on a
form and in a manner that would permit registration of the Registrable
Securities (other than in connection with dividend reinvestment plans, rights
offerings or a registration statement on Form S‑4 or S‑8 or any similar
successor form), the Company shall give the Stockholder prompt written notice
of its intent to do so not less than 15 Business Days prior to the
contemplated filing date for such registration statement. Upon the written
request of the Stockholder (a "Piggy-Back Request"), given within five
Business Days following the time that the Stockholder was given any such
written notice (which 

request shall specify the number of Registrable Securities requested to be
registered on behalf of the Stockholder) (the "Piggy-Back Securities"), the
Company shall include in such registration statement (a "Piggy-Back
Registration"), subject to the provisions of this Section 5.4 and, in the case
of a registration on behalf of any of the Company\'s stockholders, subject to
the rights of such stockholders, the number of Registrable Securities set
forth in such Piggy-Back Request.

Section 5.5 Cutbacks. In the event that (x) the Company proposes or is
required (other than pursuant to a Takedown Request or Demand Request) to
register Common Stock or Company debt securities in connection with an
underwritten offering, (y) the Stockholder has made a Piggy-Back Request with
respect to such offering, and (z) a nationally recognized investment banking
firm selected by the Company to act as managing underwriter thereof reasonably
and in good faith shall have advised the Company, the Stockholder or any other
holder of Common Stock or Company debt securities intending to offer Common
Stock or Company debt securities in the offering, as applicable (each, an
"Other Holder") in writing that, in its opinion, the inclusion in the
registration statement of some or all of the Common Stock or Company debt
securities sought to be registered by the Company, the Stockholder or the
Other Holder(s) would adversely affect the price or success of the offering,
the Company shall include in such registration statement such number of shares
of Common Stock or principal amount of Company debt securities as the Company
is advised can be sold in such offering without such an effect (the "Maximum
Number") as follows and in the following order of priority:

(a) if such registration is by the Company for its own account, (i) first,
such number of shares of Common Stock or principal amount of Company debt
securities as the Company proposes to register for its own account, (ii)
second, to the extent the number of shares of Common Stock or Company debt
securities to be included in the registration pursuant to clause (i) is less
than the Maximum Number, such number of Piggy-Back Securities as the
Stockholder proposes to be included pursuant to a Piggy-Back Request, and
(iii) third, to the extent the number of shares of Common Stock or Company
debt securities to be included in the registration pursuant to clauses (i) and
(ii) is less than the Maximum Number, such number of shares of Common Stock or
principal amount of Company debt securities as all Other Holders request to be
included for their own account, on a pro rata basis; or

(b) if such registration is pursuant to the demand registration rights of one
or more Other Holders, (i) first, such number of shares of Common Stock or
principal amount of Company debt securities as such Other Holder(s) and the
Stockholder propose to be included on a pro rata basis, and (ii) second, to
the extent the number of shares of Common Stock or Company debt securities to
be included in the registration pursuant to clause (i) is less than the
Maximum Number, such number of shares of the Company Common Stock or principal
amount of Company debt securities as the Company requests to be included, on a
pro rata basis.

Section 5.6 Termination of Registration Obligation. The obligation of the
Company to register Registrable Securities pursuant to this Article V and
maintain the effectiveness of any shelf registration statement filed pursuant
to Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 shall terminate (a) solely with respect to
Registrable Shares, on the first date on which the Stockholder Voting
Percentage is less than 5% and (b) solely with respect to Registrable Debt, on
the first date on which the Stockholder no longer beneficially owns any
Registrable Debt. 

Section 5.7 Registration Procedures. (a) In connection with each registration
statement prepared pursuant to this Article V pursuant to which Registrable
Securities will be offered and sold, and in accordance with the intended
method or methods of distribution of the Registrable Securities as described
in such registration statement, the Company shall:

(i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on an
appropriate registration form of the SEC and cause such registration statement
to become effective under the Securities Act promptly after the filing
thereof, which registration statement shall comply as to form in all materials
respects with the requirements of the applicable form and include all
financial statements required by such form to be filed therewith; provided
that before filing a registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or
supplements thereto, the Company shall furnish to one counsel selected by the
Stockholder draft copies of all such documents proposed to be filed at least
five Business Days prior to such filing, which documents will be subject to
the reasonable review and comment of the Stockholder and its agents and
Representatives and the underwriters, if any, and the Company shall not file
any amendment or supplement to a Takedown Prospectus Supplement or Demand
Registration Statement to which the Stockholder or the underwriters, if any,
shall reasonably object;

(ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, furnish without charge to the Stockholder, and the underwriters,
if any, at least one conformed copy of the registration statement and each
post-effective amendment or supplement thereto (including all schedules and
exhibits but excluding all documents incorporated or deemed incorporated
therein by reference, unless requested in writing by the Stockholder or an
underwriter, except to the extent such exhibits and schedules are currently
available via the SEC\'s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval
System ("EDGAR")) and such number of copies of the registration statement and
each amendment or supplement thereto (excluding exhibits and schedules) and
the summary, preliminary, final, amended or supplemented prospectuses included
in such registration statement as the Stockholder or such underwriter may
reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition
of the Registrable Securities being sold by the Stockholder (the Company
hereby consents to the use in accordance with the U.S. securities Laws of such
registration statement (or post-effective amendment thereto) and each such
prospectus (or preliminary prospectus or supplement thereto) by the
Stockholder and the underwriters, if any, in connection with the offering and
sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement or
prospectus);

(iii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep such registration
statement effective until the date that is 45 days after the date such
registration statement is initially declared effective (or such shorter period
as shall terminate when all of the securities covered by the registration
statement have been disposed or withdrawn, or if such registration statement
relates to a firm commitment underwritten offering, such longer period as, in
the opinion of counsel for the underwriters for such offering, a prospectus is
required under the Securities Act to be delivered in connection with sales of
Registrable Securities by an underwriter or dealer (but not in excess of 90
days) (the "Effective Period"), prepare and file with the SEC such amendments,
post-effective amendments 

and supplements to the registration statement and the prospectus as may be
necessary to maintain the effectiveness of the registration for the Effective
Period) and cause the prospectus (and any amendments or supplements thereto)
to be filed with the SEC;

(iv) use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, register or qualify the Registrable Securities covered by such
registration statement under such other securities or "blue sky" laws of such
jurisdictions in the United States as are reasonably necessary, keep such
registrations or qualifications in effect for so long as the registration
statement remains in effect, and do any and all other acts and things which
may be reasonably necessary to enable the Stockholder or any underwriter to
consummate the disposition of the Registrable Securities in such
jurisdictions; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company be
required to (A) qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in any
jurisdiction where it would not, but for the requirements of this subparagraph
(iv), be required to be so qualified, (B) execute or file any general consent
to service of process under the Laws of any jurisdiction, (C) take any action
that would subject it to service of process in suits other than those arising
out of the offer and sale of the securities covered by the registration
statement, or (D) subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction where it
would not otherwise be obligated to do so, but for this subparagraph (iv);

(v) use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, cause all Registrable Shares covered by such registration
statement, if any, to be listed (after notice of issuance) on the NYSE or on
the principal securities exchange or interdealer quotation system on which the
Common Stock is then listed or quoted;

(vi) use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify the
Stockholder and the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, after
becoming aware thereof, (A) when the registration statement or any related
prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto has been filed, and, with
respect to the registration statement or any post-effective amendment, when
the same has become effective, (B) of any request by the SEC or any U.S. state
securities authority for amendments or supplements to the registration
statement or the related prospectus or for additional information, (C) of the
issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
registration statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose,
(D) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the
suspension of the qualification of the Registrable Securities for sale in any
jurisdiction or the initiation of any proceeding for such purpose, or (E)
within the Effective Period of the happening of any event or the existence of
any fact which makes any statement in the registration statement or any post-
effective amendment thereto, prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto, or any document incorporated therein by reference untrue in any
material respect or which requires the making of any changes in the
registration statement or post-effective amendment thereto or any prospectus
or amendment or supplement thereto so that they will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; 

(vii) during the Effective Period, use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, as promptly as practicable, the withdrawal of any order enjoining or
suspending the use or effectiveness of the registration statement or any post-
effective amendment thereto or the lifting of any suspension of the
qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any
jurisdiction at the earliest date reasonably practicable;

(viii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver promptly to the
Stockholder and the managing underwriters, if any, copies of all
correspondence between the SEC and the Company, its counsel or auditors and
all memoranda relating to discussions with the SEC or its staff with respect
to the registration statement (except to the extent such correspondence is
currently available via EDGAR) and permit the Stockholder to do such
investigation with respect to information contained in or omitted from the
registration statement as it deems reasonably necessary for the purpose of
conducting due diligence with respect to the Company; provided that any such
investigation shall not interfere unreasonably with the Company\'s business;

(ix) use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and registrar
for all Registrable Shares covered by such registration statement not later
than the effective date of such registration statement;

(x) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Stockholder
and the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, to facilitate the timely
preparation and delivery of certificates representing the Registrable
Securities to be sold under the registration statement in a form eligible for
deposit with the Depository Trust Corporation not bearing any restrictive
legends (other than as required by the Depository Trust Corporation) and not
subject to any stop transfer order with any transfer agent, and cause such
Registrable Securities to be issued in such denominations and registered in
such names as the managing underwriters, if any, may request in writing or, if
not an underwritten offering, in accordance with the instructions of the
Stockholder, in each case at least two Business Days prior to any sale of
Registrable Securities;

(xi) in the case of a firm commitment underwritten offering, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as reasonably practicable,
enter into an underwriting agreement customary in form and substance (taking
into account the Company\'s prior underwriting agreements) for firm commitment
underwritten secondary offerings of the nature contemplated by the applicable
registration statement;

(xii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, obtain an opinion from the Company\'s counsel and a "cold
comfort" letter from the Company\'s independent public accountants (and, if
necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any
Subsidiary of the Company or of any business acquired by the Company for which
financial statements and financial data is, or is required to be, included in
the registration statement) in customary form and covering such matters as are
customarily covered by such opinions and "cold comfort" letters in connection
with an offering of the nature contemplated by the applicable registration
statement; 

(xiii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, provide to counsel to the Stockholder and to the managing
underwriters, if any, and no later than the time of filing of any document
which is to be incorporated by reference into the registration statement or
prospectus (after the initial filing of such registration statement), copies
of any such document;

(xiv) cause its officers to fully cooperate with the marketing of the
Registered Securities covered by the registration statement, including, at the
recommendation or request of the underwriters, making themselves available to
participate in "road-show," "one-on-one," and other customary marketing
activities in such locations (domestic and foreign) as recommended by the
underwriter(s);

(xv) otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and any applicable national
securities exchange; and

(xvi) use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the requirements
of Rule 144(c)(1) with respect to public information about the Company.

(b) In the event that the Company would be required, pursuant to Section
5.7(a)(vi)(E), to notify the Stockholder or the managing underwriter or
underwriters, if any, of the happening of any event specified therein, the
Company shall, subject to Section 5.3(c), as promptly as practicable, prepare
and furnish to the Stockholder and to each such underwriter a reasonable
number of copies of a prospectus supplemented or amended so that, as
thereafter delivered to purchasers of Registrable Securities that have been
registered pursuant to this Agreement, such prospectus shall not contain an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
Stockholder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company pursuant
to Section 5.7(a)(vi)(E), it shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to, cause any sales or placement agent or agents for the Registrable
Securities and the underwriters, if any, to forthwith discontinue disposition
of the Registrable Securities until such Person shall have received copies of
such amended or supplemented prospectus and, if so directed by the Company, to
destroy all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in its possession
of the prospectus (prior to such amendment or supplement) covering such
Registrable Securities as soon as practicable after the Stockholder\'s receipt
of such notice.

(c) (i) If requested by the managing underwriter for an underwritten offering
(primary or secondary) of any equity securities of the Company, the
Stockholder agrees not to effect any Transfer of any Registrable Shares,
including any sale pursuant to Rule 144, and not to effect any Transfer of any
other equity security of the Company (in each case, other than as part of such
underwritten public offering) during the ten days prior to, and during the
90-day period (or such longer period as the Stockholder agrees with the
underwriter of such offering) beginning on, the consummation of any
underwritten public offering covered by a registration statement referred to
in Section 5.4 if the Stockholder is permitted to include Registrable Shares
thereunder. 

(ii) The Company hereby agrees that if it shall previously have received a
request pursuant to Section 5.1 or Section 5.2 for registration of Registrable
Securities in an underwritten offering, and if such previous registration
shall not have been withdrawn or abandoned, the Company, if requested by the
managing underwriter for such underwritten offering, shall not Transfer to a
third party or third parties any Common Stock, any other equity security of
the Company or any security convertible into or exchangeable for any equity
security of the Company until the earlier of (A) 90 days after the effective
date of such registration statement and (B) such time as all of the
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement have been
distributed; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company may Transfer Common Stock or such other securities (1) as part of such
underwritten offering, (2) pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-8 or
Form S-4 under the Securities Act or any successor or similar form, (3) as
part of a transaction under Rule 145 of the Securities Act, (4) in one or more
private transactions that would not interfere with the method of distribution
contemplated by such registration statement, or (5) if such Transfer was
publicly announced or agreed to in writing by the Company prior to the date of
the receipt of such request pursuant to Section 5.1.

(d) The Stockholder shall furnish to the Company in writing such information
regarding the Stockholder and its intended method of distribution of the
Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request
in writing in order for the Company to comply with its obligations under all
applicable securities and other Laws and to ensure that the prospectus
relating to such Registrable Securities conforms to the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
The Stockholder shall promptly notify the Company of any inaccuracy or change
in information previously furnished by the Stockholder to the Company or of
the occurrence of any event, in either case as a result of which any
prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities contains or would contain an
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and
promptly furnish to the Company any additional information required to correct
and update any previously furnished information or required so that such
prospectus shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

(e) In the case of any underwritten offering of shares of Common Stock
registered under a Takedown Prospectus Supplement or a Demand Registration
Statement, or in the case of a registration under Section 5.4 if the Company
has entered into an underwriting agreement in connection therewith, all shares
of Common Stock to be included in such offering or registration, as the case
may be, shall be subject to the applicable underwriting agreement and no
Person may participate in such offering or registration unless such Person
agrees to sell such Person\'s securities on the basis provided therein and
completes and executes all questionnaires, indemnities, underwriting
agreements and other documents (other than powers of attorney) which must be
executed in connection therewith, and provides such other information to the
Company or the underwriter as may be reasonably requested to offer or register
such Person\'s Common Stock. 

Section 5.8 Registration Expenses. The Stockholder shall bear all agent fees
and commissions, underwriting discounts and commissions and fees and
disbursements of its counsel and accountants in connection with any
registration and sale of any Registrable Securities, including pursuant to
Section 5.1 or Section 5.4. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
the Company shall bear all other fees and expenses in connection with any
registration statement for the registration of any Registrable Securities,
including all registration and filing fees, all printing costs and all fees
and expenses of counsel and accountants for the Company.

Section 5.9 Indemnification; Contribution. (a) The Company shall, and it
hereby agrees to, indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholder and its
controlling Persons, if any, and each underwriter and its controlling Persons,
if any, in any offering or sale of the Registrable Securities, including
pursuant to Section 5.1, Section 5.2 or Section 5.4, against any losses,
claims, damages or liabilities, actions or proceedings (whether commenced or
threatened) in respect thereof and expenses (including actual out-of-pocket
fees of counsel reasonably incurred) (collectively, "Claims") to which each
such indemnified party may become subject, insofar as such Claims (including
any amounts paid in settlement effected with the consent of the Company as
provided herein), or actions or proceedings in respect thereof, arise out of,
relate to, are in connection with, or are based upon an untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration
statement, or any preliminary or final prospectus contained therein, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated by reference
therein, or arise out of, relate to, are in connection with, or are based upon
any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, and the Company shall,
and it hereby agrees to, reimburse periodically the Stockholder or any such
underwriter for any actual out-of-pocket legal or other actual out-of-pocket
expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or
defending any such Claims; provided, however, that the Company shall not be
liable to any such Person in any such case to the extent that any such Claims
arise out of, relate to, are in connection with, or are based upon an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in
such registration statement, or preliminary or final prospectus, or amendment
or supplement thereto, in reliance upon information furnished to the Company
by the Stockholder, any underwriter or any Representative of the Stockholder,
expressly for use therein, or by the Stockholder\'s failure to furnish the
Company, upon request, with the information with respect to the Stockholder,
or any underwriter or Representative of the Stockholder, or the Stockholder\'s
intended method of distribution, that is the subject of the untrue statement
or omission.

(b) The Stockholder shall, and hereby agrees to, (i) indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its directors, officers, employees and controlling
Persons, if any, and each underwriter, its partners, officers, directors,
employees and controlling Persons, if any, in any offering or sale of
Registrable Securities against any Claims to which each such indemnified party
may become subject, insofar as such Claims (including any amounts paid in
settlement as provided herein), or actions or proceedings in respect thereof,
arise out of, relate to, are in connection with, or are based upon an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
registration statement, or any preliminary or final prospectus contained
therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated
by reference therein, or arise out of, relate to, are in connection with, or
are based upon any omission or 

alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each
case only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity
with written information furnished to the Company by the Stockholder expressly
for use therein, and (ii) reimburse the Company for any actual out-of-pocket
legal or other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in
connection with investigating or defending any such Claim.

(c) The Stockholder and the Company agree that if, for any reason, the
indemnification provisions contemplated by Section 5.9(a) or Section 5.9(b)
are unavailable to or are insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party
in respect of any Claims referred to therein, then each indemnifying party
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a
result of such Claims in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified
party, on the other hand, with respect to the applicable offering of
securities. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified
party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the
untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such
indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties\' relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such statement or omission. If, however, the allocation in the first sentence
of this Section 5.9(c) is not permitted by applicable Law, then each
indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only
such relative faults, but also the relative benefits of the indemnifying party
and the indemnified party, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 5.9(c) were to be
determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which
does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the
preceding sentences of this Section 5.9(c). The amount paid or payable by an
indemnified party as a result of the Claims referred to above shall be deemed
to include (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5.10) any actual
out-of-pocket legal or other out-of-pocket fees or expenses reasonably
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or
defending any such action, proceeding or claim. No Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

Section 5.10 Indemnification Procedures. (a) If an indemnified party shall
desire to assert any claim for indemnification provided for under Section 5.9
in respect of, arising out of or involving a Claim against the indemnified
party, such indemnified party shall notify the Company or the Stockholder, as
the case may be (the "Indemnifying Party"), in writing of such Claim, the
amount or the estimated amount of Damages sought thereunder to the extent then
ascertainable (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of
such Claim), any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints
relating thereto and, to the extent practicable, any other material details
pertaining thereto (a "Claim Notice") promptly after receipt by such
indemnified party of written notice of the Claim; provided, however, that
failure to provide a Claim Notice shall not affect the indemnification
obligations provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. The
indemnified party shall deliver to the Indemnifying 

Party, promptly after the indemnified party\'s receipt thereof, copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the indemnified
party relating to the Claim; provided, however, that failure to provide any
such copies shall not affect the indemnification obligations provided
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(b) If a Claim is made against an indemnified party, the Indemnifying Party
will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses,
to assume the defense thereof with separate counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.
Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the indemnified party for legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the
defense thereof, unless the Claim involves potential conflicts of interest or
substantially different defenses for the indemnified party and the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the
indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense (except as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence), separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the actual out-
of-pocket fees and expenses of counsel reasonably incurred by the indemnified
party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the
defense thereof and as otherwise contemplated by the two immediately preceding
sentences. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Claim, the other
party shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Party\'s request) the
provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such Claim, and use of reasonable efforts to make
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not
the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Claim, the
indemnified party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge, such Claim without the Indemnifying Party\'s prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). The Indemnifying Party may pay, settle or compromise a Claim
without the written consent of the indemnified party, so long as such
settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from
all liability in respect of such Claim, (ii) does not subject the indemnified
party to any injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, and (iii) does not
include a statement or admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or
on behalf of any indemnified party.

Section 5.11 Transferee Registration Rights. Any transferee who acquires at
least 5% of either the Registrable Shares or of the Registrable Debt pursuant
to a transaction that is not registered under the Securities Act (each, a
"Registrable Securities Transferee") shall be entitled to enjoy the same
registration and other rights pursuant to this Article V as does the
Stockholder so long as the Registrable Shares or the Registrable Debt held by
any such Registrable Securities Transferee may not be sold or disposed of
pursuant to Rule 144 without volume limitations at the time when a Registrable
Securities Transferee seeks to exercise its rights pursuant to this Agreement.
Any Registrable Securities Transferee shall enjoy such right pursuant to this
Section 5.11 if and to the extent the Company shall have received (x) written
notice from the Stockholder stating the name and address of such Registrable
Securities Transferee and identifying the amount of Registrable Shares or
Registrable Debt with respect to which such rights under this Article V apply
and (y) a written agreement from the Registrable Securities 

Transferee to be bound by all of the relevant terms of this Article V. In
relation to any such Registrable Securities Transferee, the term "Stockholder"
as used in this Article V shall, where appropriate, be deemed to refer to such
Registrable Securities Transferee. After such Transfer, the Stockholder shall
retain its rights under this Agreement with respect to all other Registrable
Securities owned by the Stockholder. Upon the request of the Stockholder, the
Company shall execute a registration rights agreement with such Registrable
Securities Transferee or a proposed Registrable Securities Transferee
substantially similar to the applicable sections of this Article V.

ARTICLE VI

Section 6.1 Non-Competition. The Stockholder agrees that (a) for the period
commencing at the Closing and expiring on the date that is two years after the
first date on which the Stockholder\'s Voting Percentage is less than 10%,
neither the Stockholder nor any of its controlled Affiliates shall, either
directly or indirectly, alone or with others, engage in (i) providing wireless

than by the Company and its Affiliates in accordance with the terms of the
Trademark License (each of (a) and (b), a "Competing Business"). The
Stockholder further agrees that, during the applicable period set forth in
clause (a) or (b), it will not own an interest in (whether as a stockholder,
member or partner, but in each case excluding any such interest not exceeding
10% of any class of security), or manage, operate, or control, or act as or
have the right to appoint a director of, any Person engaged in a Competing
Business (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) (it being understood
that no ownership permitted by this sentence shall be considered to be a
breach of any other part of this Section 6.1). For the avoidance of doubt,
neither (x) the offering or provision of products or services (including
software, apps, and "over-the-top" services) on, or the conducting of
transactions through, mobile or wireless devices or platforms, nor (y) the
resale of wireless telecommunications services ancillary to providing
information technology outsourcing services shall in any event be deemed to be
engaging a Competing Business. If the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction declares any term or provision of this Section 6.1 invalid or
unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to and
shall reform this Section 6.1 to reduce the time, geographic area and/or scope
of activity, to delete specific words or phrases, and/or to replace any
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is
valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified.

Section 6.2 Reasonable Scope. The Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that the
agreements and covenants set forth in Section 6.1 are (i) necessary to protect
the legitimate business interests of the Company, (ii) reasonable as to time,
geographic area and scope of 

activity and do not impose a greater restraint on the activities of the
Stockholder than is reasonably necessary to protect such legitimate interests
of the Company, and (iii) reasonable in light of the consideration and other
value provided, directly or indirectly, to the Stockholder by the Company
pursuant to this Agreement and the Business Combination Agreement. The
Stockholder hereby waives any and all rights to contest the validity of the
agreements and covenants set forth in Section 6.1 on the ground of the
reasonableness of the length of their term or the breadth of their geographic
area or scope of activity.

ARTICLE VII

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 7.1 Injunctive Relief. Each party hereto acknowledges that it would be
impossible to determine the amount of damages that would result from any
breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement and that the remedy at law
for any breach, or threatened breach, of any of such provisions would likely
be inadequate and, accordingly, agrees that the other party shall, in addition
to any other rights or remedies which it may have, be entitled to such
equitable and injunctive relief as may be available from any court of
competent jurisdiction to compel specific performance of, or restrain any
party from violating, any of such provisions. In connection with any action or
proceeding for injunctive relief, each party hereto hereby waives the claim or
defense that a remedy at law alone is adequate and agrees, to the maximum
extent permitted by Law, to have each provision of this Agreement specifically
enforced against it, without the necessity of posting bond or other security
against it, and consents to the entry of injunctive relief against it
enjoining or restraining any breach or threatened breach of such provisions of
this Agreement.

Section 7.2 Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. Neither party may directly or
indirectly assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under
this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written
consent of the other party other than (a) in connection with a change in
control of the Stockholder or to any successor of the Company; (b) by the
Stockholder in whole or in part, to one or more of its Subsidiaries so long as
the Stockholder remains liable for its obligations as contained herein, or (c)
in accordance with Section 5.11. Any purported direct or indirect assignment
in violation of this Section 7.2 shall be null and void ab initio.

Section 7.3 Amendments; Waiver. No amendment, modification or discharge of
this Agreement, and no waiver hereunder, and no extension of time for the
performance of any of the obligations hereunder, shall be valid or binding
unless set forth in writing and duly executed by (a) the Company where
enforcement of the amendment, modification, discharge, waiver or extension is
sought against the Company or (b) the Stockholder where enforcement of the
amendment, modification, discharge, waiver or extension is sought against the
Stockholder. Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to
the specific matter described in such writing and shall in no way impair the
rights of the party granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other
time. The waiver by the Company or the Stockholder of a breach of, or a
default under, any of the provisions hereof, or to exercise any right or
privilege hereunder, shall not be construed as a waiver of any other breach or
default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of 

any of such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. Except as expressly
provided in this Agreement, the rights and remedies herein provided are
cumulative and none is exclusive of any other, or of any rights or remedies
that any party may otherwise have at law or in equity.

Section 7.4 Termination. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement
(including Section 5.6(b)), this Agreement shall terminate at any time after
which the Stockholder\'s Voting Percentage is less than 5%; provided, however,
that (a) the obligations under Section 3.2 shall terminate at any time after
which the Stockholder\'s Voting Percentage is less than 30%, (b) the indemnity
and contribution provisions contained in Section 5.9 and Section 5.10 shall
remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any termination of
this Agreement; and (c) the provisions of Article VI and this Article VII
shall survive any termination of this Agreement or any provision thereof.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to release any party from any
liability for any willful and material breach of this Agreement occurring
prior to any termination hereof or to impair the right of a party to compel
specific performance by the other party of its obligations under this
Agreement.

Section 7.5 Notices. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be
given hereunder by any party to the others shall be in writing and delivered
personally or sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY CONFLICT-OF-LAWS RULE OR
PRINCIPLE THEREOF. Each party hereto agrees that it shall bring any action or
proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of, or related to, this
Agreement or the Transaction, exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery,
New Castle County, or solely if that court does not have jurisdiction, a
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware (the "Chosen Courts"), and
solely in connection with claims arising under this Agreement or the
Transaction (a) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Chosen Courts, (b) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or
proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (c) waives any objection that the Chosen
Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party
hereto, and (d) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such
action or proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with
Section 7.5. Each party hereto irrevocably designates C.T. Corporation as its
agent and attorney-in-fact for the acceptance of service of process and making
an appearance on its behalf in any such claim or proceeding and for the taking
of all such acts as may be necessary or appropriate in order to confer
jurisdiction over it before the Chosen Courts and each party hereto stipulates
that such consent and appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest.

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO, THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 7.7 Interpretation. The table of contents and headings herein are for
convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and
shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.
The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting
of this Agreement and, in the event that an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly drafted by 

the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring
or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

Section 7.8 Entire Agreement; No Other Representations. This Agreement and the
Business Combination Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede
all other prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, undertakings,
arrangements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

Section 7.9 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as explicitly provided for in
Section 5.9, Section 5.10 and Section 5.11, this Agreement is not intended to
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder.

Section 7.10 Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision; and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

counterparts, each such counterpart (including any facsimile or electronic
document transmission of such counterpart) being deemed to be an original

Exhibit G

Form of Description of Notes

You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description of
notes under the subheading "Certain definitions" below. In this description of
notes, "Issuer" refers only to T-Mobile USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and
not to any of its Subsidiaries and "Parent" refers only to MetroPCS
Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and not to any of its
Subsidiaries.

Issuer will issue the notes as a series of debt securities under a new
indenture among itself, Parent, the Subsidiary Guarantors and [Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A.], as trustee. The terms of the notes include those stated in the
indenture and those made part of the indenture by reference to the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.1

The obligations and covenants of Issuer described hereunder are only of Issuer
and not of Parent, its direct parent company. Although Parent will be a
guarantor of the notes, it and its Subsidiaries, except Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, are generally not subject to any of the obligations
and covenants described hereunder.

[The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the
indenture. It does not restate the indenture in its entirety. We urge you to
read the indenture in its entirety because it, and not this description of
notes, defines your rights as a holder of the notes. We have filed a copy of
the indenture as an exhibit to [_____], which has been incorporated by
reference in this prospectus supplement. For more information on how you can
obtain a copy of the indenture, see "Incorporation of documents by reference."
Certain defined terms used in this description of notes but not defined below
under

"--Certain definitions" have the meanings assigned to them in the indenture.]

will be general unsecured obligations of Issuer; 

| 
---|--- 



will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured
senior Indebtedness and other liabilities of Issuer, including Issuer\'s
existing senior notes; 

 



__________________________

1 The Form of the Indenture to be customary for offerings of this type, and to
include customary provisions for debt securities offered under and exception
from the securities laws that are subject to registration rights.

will be unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the
Guarantors. 

However, the notes will be effectively subordinated to all borrowings under
existing and future secured Indebtedness of Issuer or any Guarantor to the
extent of the assets securing such Indebtedness and to all liabilities of any
of Issuer\'s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes to the extent of the
assets of those Subsidiaries. [See "Risk Factors--Risks related to the notes--
The notes and the guarantees will be unsecured and effectively subordinated to
our and the guarantors\' existing and future secured indebtedness and
structurally subordinated to any future indebtedness and other liabilities of
our non-guarantor subsidiaries."]

The note guarantees

The notes will be guaranteed by Parent, all of Issuer\'s Domestic Restricted
Subsidiaries that are Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries (other than Immaterial
Subsidiaries), Issuer\'s Restricted Subsidiaries that guarantee any Specified
Issuer Indebtedness, and any future Subsidiary of Parent that directly or
indirectly owns equity interests of Issuer.

Each guarantee of the notes by a Guarantor:

will be a general unsecured obligation of that Guarantor; 

| 
---|---

will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured
senior Indebtedness and other liabilities of that Guarantor, including its
guarantee of Issuer\'s existing senior notes; and

will be senior in right of payment to any future subordinated Indebtedness of
that Guarantor to the extent that such future Indebtedness provides by its
terms that it is subordinated to its guarantee of the notes. 

However, the guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all existing and
future secured Indebtedness of the Guarantors to the extent of the assets
securing such Indebtedness. [See "Risk Factors--Risks related to the notes--
The notes and the guarantees will be unsecured and effectively subordinated to
our and the guarantors\' existing and future secured indebtedness and
structurally subordinated to any future indebtedness and other liabilities of
our non-guarantor subsidiaries."]

Initially, all of Issuer\'s existing Domestic Restricted Subsidiaries will
guarantee the notes. Under the circumstances described below under the
subheading "--Certain covenants--Additional note guarantees," one or more of
Issuer\'s Subsidiaries together with certain newly created or acquired
Subsidiaries in the future may not guarantee the notes. In the event of a
bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor
Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay their trade creditors 

and holders of their debt and other obligations before they will be able to
distribute any of their assets to Issuer.

Initially, all of Issuer\'s Subsidiaries will be "Restricted Subsidiaries."
However, under the circumstances described below under the caption "--Certain
covenants-Designation of restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries," Issuer
will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as "Unrestricted
Subsidiaries." Issuer\'s Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to many
of the restrictive covenants in the indenture. Issuer\'s Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not guarantee the notes.

Principal, maturity and interest



Issuer will issue $[__]3 in aggregate principal amount of notes in this
offering. Issuer may issue additional notes from time to time after this
offering, and such additional notes may be issued either under the indenture
or one or more supplemental indentures. Any issuance of additional notes is
subject to all of the covenants in the indenture, including the covenant
described below under the caption "--Certain covenants--Incurrence of
indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock." The notes and any additional
notes subsequently issued under the indenture will be treated as a single
series for all purposes under the indenture, including waivers, amendments,
redemptions and offers to purchase. Issuer will issue notes in minimum
denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000. The notes will
mature on [_____].4

Interest on the notes will accrue (i) at the rate of [___]%5 per annum to and
including the date that is [__]6 months after the Closing Date and (ii)
thereafter at the rate per annum equal to [___]%,7 and will be payable
semiannually in arrears on [____] and [_____], commencing on [______].8 Issuer
will make each interest payment to the holders of record on the immediately
preceding [_____] and [_____].

Interest on the notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if
interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid.
Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360day year comprised of twelve
30-day months. If an interest payment date or the maturity date falls on a day
that is not a business day, the related payment of principal or interest will
be made on the next succeeding business day as if made on the date the payment
was due, and no interest shall accrue for the intervening period.

months after the Closing Date. 



Payments of principal of and interest on the notes issued in book-entry form
or definitive form, if any, will be made as described below under the caption
"--Same day settlement and payment."

The notes will initially be evidenced by one or more global notes deposited
with a custodian for, and registered in the name of, Cede and Co., as nominee of
The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"). Except as described below, beneficial
interests in the global notes will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be
effected only through, records maintained by DTC and its direct and indirect
participants.9 We do not intend to apply for the notes to be listed on any
securities exchange or to arrange for the notes to be quoted on any quotation
system.

Methods of receiving payments on the notes

If a holder of a definitive note has given wire transfer instructions to
Issuer and Issuer is the paying agent, Issuer will pay all principal, interest
and premium, if any, on that holder\'s notes in accordance with those
instructions until given written notice to the contrary. All other payments on
the notes will be made at the office or agency of the paying agent and
registrar within the City and State of New York unless Issuer elects to make
interest payments by check mailed to the noteholders at their address set
forth in the books and records of the registrar.

Paying agent and registrar for the notes

The trustee will initially act as paying agent and registrar. Issuer may
change the paying agent or registrar without prior notice to the holders of
the notes, and Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as paying agent or
registrar.

Transfer and exchange

Except as set forth below, the global notes may be transferred, in whole and
not in part, only to another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its
nominee, as described below under the caption "--Book-entry, delivery and
form."

A holder of a definitive note may transfer or exchange notes in accordance
with the provisions of the indenture. The registrar and the trustee may
require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and
transfer documents in connection with a transfer of notes. Holders will be
required to pay all taxes relating to, arising out of, or in connection with
such transfer. Issuer will not be required to transfer or exchange any note
selected for redemption. Also, Issuer will not be required to transfer or
exchange any note for a period of 15 days before a selection of notes to be
redeemed.









_________________________

9 DT and TMUS will cooperate to take all actions reasonably required to submit
the notes promptly to DTC to the extent that DTC registration is available. 

Note guarantees

The notes will be guaranteed by Parent, all of Issuer\'s Domestic Restricted
Subsidiaries that are Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries (other than Immaterial
Subsidiaries), all of Issuer\'s Restricted Subsidiaries that guarantee any
Specified Issuer Indebtedness, and any future Subsidiary of Parent that
directly or indirectly owns equity interests of Issuer. These Note Guarantees
will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The obligations of
each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to
prevent that Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under
applicable law. [See "Risk factors--Risks related to the notes--The guarantees
may not be enforceable because of fraudulent conveyance laws."]

A Guarantor (other than Parent) may not sell or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of its assets to, or consolidate with or merge with or into
(whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving Person) another Person, other
than Issuer or another Guarantor, unless:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Default or Event of
Default exists; and 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

either: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

if it is not already a Guarantor, the Person acquiring the property in any
such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation or merger assumes all the obligations of that Guarantor under
the indenture and its Note Guarantee pursuant to a supplemental indenture
satisfactory to the trustee; or 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

such sale or other disposition complies with the "Asset Sale" provisions of
the indenture (it being understood that only such portion of the Net Proceeds
as is or is required to be applied on or before the date of such release in
accordance with the terms of the indenture needs to be so applied). 

The Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will be released:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all
of the assets of that Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation)
to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such
transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of Issuer, if the sale or
other disposition is not prohibited by the "Asset Sale" provisions of the
indenture; 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

in connection with any issuance, sale or other disposition of Capital Stock of
that Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect
to such transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of Issuer, if the
issuance, sale or other disposition does not violate the "Asset Sale" or
"Restricted Investment" provisions of the indenture, and the Guarantor ceases
to be a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of Issuer as a result of such sale or other
disposition and does not guarantee any Specified Issuer Indebtedness; 
| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

if such Guarantor ceases to guarantee any Specified Issuer Indebtedness and is
not a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary; 

| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

if Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
indenture; 

| 
---|--- 

(5)

|

upon legal defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the indenture as
provided below under the captions "--Legal defeasance and covenant defeasance"
and "--Satisfaction and discharge"; 

| 
---|--- 

(6)

|

upon the liquidation or dissolution of such Guarantor provided no Default or
Event of Default has occurred that is continuing; or 

| 
---|--- 

(7)

|

solely in the case of a Note Guarantee created pursuant to clause (b) of the
covenant described below under the caption "--Additional note guarantees,"
upon the release or discharge of the Guarantee that resulted in the creation
of such Note Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described below under the
caption "--Additional note guarantees," except a discharge or release by or as
a result of payment under such Guarantee. 

See "--Repurchase at the option of holders--Asset sales."

Optional redemption

At any time prior to [_____]10, Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem
up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of notes issued under the
indenture at a redemption price of [ ]11% of the principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, with
the net cash proceeds of one or more sales of Equity Interests (other than
Disqualified Stock) of Issuer or contributions to Issuer\'s common equity
capital made with the net cash proceeds of one or more sales of Equity
Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of Parent; provided that:



(1) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of notes issued under the
indenture

(excluding notes held by Issuer and its Subsidiaries) remains outstanding
immediately

after the occurrence of such redemption; and



(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of such
sale of Equity

Interests by Issuer or the date of contribution to Issuer\'s common equity
capital made

with net cash proceeds of one or more sales of Equity Interests of Parent.

On or after [______]12, Issuer may redeem all or a part of the notes upon not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days\' notice, at the redemption prices
(expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below plus accrued
and unpaid interest on the notes redeemed,

applicable redemption date.

At any time prior to [______],14 Issuer may also redeem all or a part of the
notes, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days\' prior notice sent
electronically or mailed by first-class mail to each holder\'s registered
address, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of notes
redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest
to, but not including, the date of redemption, subject to the rights of
holders of notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date for periods prior to such date of redemption.

Mandatory redemption

Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments
with respect to the notes.

Repurchase at the option of holders

Change of control triggering event

If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, each holder of notes will have
the right to require Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or
an integral multiple of $1,000) of that holder\'s notes pursuant to a Change
of Control Offer on the terms set forth in the indenture. In the Change of
Control Offer, Issuer will offer a Change of Control Payment in cash equal to
101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and
unpaid interest on the notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of
purchase, subject to the rights of holders of notes on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date for periods
prior to such repurchase date (the "Change of Control Payment"). Within 30
days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, Issuer will send a
notice (the "Change of Control Offer") to each holder and the trustee
describing the transaction or transactions and identify the ratings decline
that together constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering
to repurchase

14 NTD: Redemption dates to be as set forth in the DT Note Pricing Schedule 

notes on the Change of Control Payment Date specified in the notice, which
date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date
such notice is sent (the "Change of Control Payment Date"), pursuant to the
procedures required by the indenture and described in such notice. Issuer will
comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any
other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and
regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the notes as a
result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of
Control Triggering Event provisions of the indenture, or compliance with the
Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the indenture would
constitute a violation of any such laws or regulations, Issuer will comply
with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to
have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Triggering Event
provisions of the indenture by virtue of such compliance. In connection with
the tender of any notes with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event,
the tendering holder shall provide good title to the notes, free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances, and shall represent and warrant that such holder
is presenting good title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, and
such other representations and warranties as are customary.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

accept for payment all notes or portions of notes properly tendered pursuant
to the Change of Control Offer; 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment
in respect of all notes or portions of notes properly tendered; and 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

deliver or cause to be delivered to the trustee the notes properly accepted
together with an officers\' certificate stating the aggregate principal amount
of notes or portions of notes being purchased by Issuer. 

The paying agent will promptly make payment to each holder of notes properly
tendered the Change of Control Payment for such notes, and the trustee will
promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to
each holder, a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion
of the notes surrendered, if any; provided that each new note will be in a
principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess
thereof. Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control
Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.

The provisions described above that require Issuer to make a Change of Control
Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event will be applicable
whether or not any other provisions of the indenture are applicable. Except as
described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the
indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the notes to
require, or otherwise provide, that Issuer repurchase or redeem the notes in
the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Issuer will not be required to make a Change of
Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if (1) a third party
makes the Change of 

Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the indenture applicable to a Change of Control
Offer made by Issuer and purchases all notes properly tendered and not
withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) notice of redemption has
been given pursuant to the indenture as described above under the caption "--
Optional redemption," unless and until there is a default in payment of the
applicable redemption price.

A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control
Triggering Event, and conditioned upon such Change of Control Triggering
Event, if a definitive agreement has been executed for a transaction that
would constitute a Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of
Control Offer.

In the event that holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding notes accept a Change of Control Offer and Issuer
purchases all of the notes held by such holders, Issuer will have the right,
upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days\' prior notice, given not more
than 30 days following the purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer
described above, to redeem all of the notes that remain outstanding following
such purchase at a redemption price equal to the Change of Control Payment
plus, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and
unpaid interest on the notes that remain outstanding, to, but not including,
the date of redemption (subject to the right of holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that
is on or prior to the redemption date).

[The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct
or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of "all or
substantially all" of the properties or assets of Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase "substantially all," there is no precise established
definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a
holder of notes to require Issuer to repurchase its notes as a result of a
sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the
assets of Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another
Person or group may be uncertain.]

Asset sales

Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
consummate an Asset Sale unless:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

Issuer (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives
consideration at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market
Value of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed
of; 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

at least 75% of the consideration received by Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary in the Asset Sale and all other Asset Sales since the date of the
indenture is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents or Replacement Assets or a
combination thereof. For purposes of this provision, each of the following
will be deemed to be cash: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

any liabilities, as shown on Issuer\'s most recent consolidated balance sheet
(or as would be shown on Issuer\'s consolidated balance sheet as of the date 

of such Asset Sale), of Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than
contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to
the notes or any Note Guarantee) that are assumed by the transferee of any
such assets pursuant to a novation agreement that releases Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary from further liability; and

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

any securities, notes or other obligations received by Issuer, or any such
Restricted Subsidiary, from such transferee that are converted by Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary into cash, Cash Equivalents or Replacement Assets
within 90 days after such Asset Sale, to the extent of the cash, Cash
Equivalents or Replacement Assets received in that conversion. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 75% limitation referred to above shall be
deemed satisfied with respect to any Asset Sale in which the cash, Cash
Equivalents or Replacement Assets portion of the consideration received
therefrom, determined in accordance with the foregoing provision on an after-
tax basis, is equal to or greater than what the after-tax proceeds would have
been had such Asset Sale complied with the aforementioned 75% limitation.

Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale,
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may apply an amount equal to such Net
Proceeds:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

to purchase Replacement Assets; or 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

to prepay, repay, defease, redeem, purchase or otherwise retire Indebtedness
and other Obligations under a Credit Facility or Indebtedness secured by
property that is subject to such Asset Sale and, if the Indebtedness repaid is
revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with
respect thereto. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if within 365 days after the receipt of any Net
Proceeds from an Asset Sale, Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into a
binding written agreement committing Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary,
subject to customary conditions, to an application of funds of the kind
described in clause (1) above, Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary shall be
deemed not to be in violation of the preceding paragraph so long as such
application of funds is consummated within 545 days of the receipt of such Net
Proceeds.

Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds of an Asset Sale, Issuer may
temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise use the Net
Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the indenture.

An amount equal to any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or
invested as provided in the third paragraph of this covenant will constitute
"Excess Proceeds." When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $100.0
million, within 20 days thereof, Issuer shall apply the entire aggregate
amount of unutilized Excess Proceeds (not only the amount in excess of $100.0
million) to make an offer (an "Asset Sale Offer") to all holders of notes and
all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the notes containing
provisions requiring the Issuer to make an offer to purchase or redeem with
the proceeds of 

sales of assets to purchase the maximum principal amount of notes and purchase
or redeem such other pari passu Indebtedness that may be purchased or redeemed
out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will be
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes and such other pari passu
Indebtedness that may be purchased or redeemed with Excess Proceeds, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of consummation of
the purchase, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after
consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the
indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of notes and other pari passu
Indebtedness tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess
Proceeds, the trustee will select the notes and Issuer will select such other
pari passu Indebtedness to be purchased or redeemed on a pro rata basis. Upon
completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be
reset at zero.

Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act
and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those
laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of
notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of
any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of
the indenture, or compliance with the Asset Sale provisions of the indenture
would constitute a violation of any such laws or regulations, Issuer will
comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be
deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of the
indenture by virtue of such compliance.

[The agreements governing Issuer\'s other Indebtedness contain, and future
agreements may contain, prohibitions of certain events, including events that
would constitute a Change of Control or an Asset Sale and may prohibit
repurchases of or other prepayments in respect of the notes. The exercise by
the holders of the notes of their right to require Issuer to repurchase the
notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event or an Asset Sale could cause a
default under these other agreements, even if the Change of Control Triggering
Event or Asset Sale itself does not, due to the financial effect of such
repurchases or other prepayments on Issuer. In the event a Change of Control
Triggering Event or Asset Sale occurs at a time when Issuer is prohibited from
purchasing notes, Issuer could seek the consent of the holders of such
Indebtedness to the purchase of notes or could attempt to refinance the
borrowings that contain such prohibition. If Issuer does not obtain a consent
or repay those borrowings, Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing
notes. In that case, Issuer\'s failure to purchase tendered notes would
constitute an Event of Default under the indenture that could, in turn,
constitute a default under the other Indebtedness. Finally, Issuer\'s ability
to pay cash to the holders of notes upon a repurchase may be limited by
Issuer\'s then existing financial resources. See "Risk Factors-Risks related
to the notes-Our senior secured credit facility, the indenture governing the
notes and the indentures governing our existing senior notes include
restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility."] 

Selection and notice

If less than all of the notes are to be redeemed at any time, the trustee will
select notes for redemption on a pro rata basis unless otherwise required by
law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements.

No notes of $2,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will
be sent electronically or mailed by first class mail at least 10 but not more
than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of notes to be redeemed
at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be sent more
than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection
with a defeasance of the notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the
indenture. Except as otherwise set forth in the provisions described under the
captions "--Repurchase at the option of holders-Change of control triggering
event," notices of redemption may not be conditional.

If any note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that
relates to that note will state the portion of the principal amount of that
note that is to be redeemed. If in definitive form a new note in principal
amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original note will be issued in
the name of the holder of notes upon cancellation of the original note. Except
to the extent that a notice of redemption is conditional as permitted in the
provisions described under the captions "--Repurchase at the option of holders
--Change of control triggering event," notes called for redemption become due
on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest
ceases to accrue on notes or portions of notes called for redemption.

Certain covenants

Changes in covenants when notes rated investment grade

If on any date following the Closing Date:

|

no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (other
than with respect to the covenants specifically listed under the following
captions), 

then, beginning on that day, the covenants specifically listed under the
following captions in this prospectus supplement will cease to apply and will
not be later reinstated even if the ratings of the notes should subsequently

of the covenant described below under the caption "--Merger, consolidation or
sale of assets." 

[There can be no assurance that the notes will ever achieve an Investment
Grade rating.]

Restricted payments

Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

declare or pay (without duplication) any dividend, or make any other payment
or distribution, on account of Issuer\'s or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries\' Equity Interests (including any payment in connection with any
merger or consolidation involving Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries) or to the direct or indirect holders of Issuer\'s or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries\' Equity Interests in their capacity as such (other
than dividends or distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than
Disqualified Stock) of Issuer and other than dividends or distributions
payable to Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of Issuer); 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including in
connection with any merger or consolidation involving Issuer) any Equity
Interests of Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of Issuer; 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

make any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or
otherwise acquire or retire for value any Subordinated Indebtedness (excluding
any intercompany Indebtedness between or among Issuer and any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries), except a payment of interest or principal at the
Stated Maturity thereof; or 

| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

make any Restricted Investment 

(all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (1) through (4)
above being collectively referred to as "Restricted Payments"),

unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur
as a consequence of such Restricted Payment; 

|

Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock

Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise
become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect
to (collectively, "incur") any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and
Issuer will not issue any Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of Preferred Stock; provided,
however, that Issuer may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue
Disqualified Stock and the Subsidiary Guarantors may incur Indebtedness
(including Acquired Debt) or issue Preferred Stock, if the Debt to Cash Flow
Ratio for Issuer\'s most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which
internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on
which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or
such Preferred Stock is issued, as the case may be, would have been no greater
than 6.0 to 1, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma
application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness
had been incurred or the Disqualified Stock or the Preferred Stock had been
issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four-quarter period.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence of any
of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively, "Permitted Debt"), nor
will it prohibit Issuer\'s Restricted Subsidiaries from issuing the following
types of Preferred Stock:

|

Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries thereunder) of all Indebtedness under
Credit Facilities then 

outstanding under this paragraph (1), together with any Indebtedness incurred
pursuant to the following clause (b), does not to exceed the greater of (x)
$9.0 billion and (y) 150% of the Consolidated Cash Flow of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which
financial statements are available, calculated on a pro forma basis in the
manner described in the definition of "Debt to Cash Flow Ratio" and (b)
without duplication, all Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance,
replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to the
foregoing clause (a); provided, however, that the maximum amount permitted
under this clause (1) shall not be deemed to limit additional Indebtedness

additional Indebtedness is permitted pursuant to any of the other provisions
of this covenant;

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

the incurrence by Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries of any Existing

represented by Capital Lease Obligations, mortgage financings or purchase

price or cost of design, construction, installation or improvement of
property, plant or equipment or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such
assets used in the business of Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
in an aggregate principal amount, including all Permitted Refinancing
Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or
discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (4), not to exceed
the greater of (x) $2.5 billion and (y) 5.0% of Issuer\'s Total Assets, at the
time of any such incurrence pursuant to this clause (4); 

| 
---|--- 

(5)

|

the incurrence by Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are

indenture to be incurred under the first paragraph of this covenant or clauses
(2), (3), (4), (5), (13), (14), (15), (25) or (26) of this paragraph; 

| 
---|--- 

(6)

|

the incurrence by Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of intercompany
Indebtedness between or among Parent, Issuer and any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries and any Guarantors; provided, however, that: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

if Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness and
the payee is not Issuer or a Guarantor, such Indebtedness must be expressly
subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations then due
with respect to the notes, in the case of Issuer, or the Note Guarantee, in
the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor; and 
| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

(i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in
any such Indebtedness being held by a Person other than Parent, Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary of Issuer, or a Guarantor and (ii) any sale or other
transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not either Parent,
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of Issuer, or a Guarantor, 

will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness
by Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not
permitted by this clause (6);

| 
---|--- 

(7)

|

the issuance by any of Issuer\'s Restricted Subsidiaries to Issuer or to any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries of shares of Preferred Stock; provided,
however, that:

shall be subordinated or pari passu, as applicable, to the same extent as the
Indebtedness guaranteed; 

| 
---|--- 

(10)

|

the incurrence by Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness
in respect of workers\' compensation claims, self-insurance obligations,

pursuant to clause (5) of the third paragraph under the covenant described

|

the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors of

accreted value, as applicable) of all Indebtedness incurred under this clause
(26), when aggregated with the principal amount (or accreted value) of all
other Indebtedness then outstanding and incurred pursuant to this clause (26),
including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund,
refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to
this clause (26), does not exceed $250 million as of the time of incurrence. 

Issuer will not incur, and will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to incur,
any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt, but excluding Indebtedness
permitted by clause (6) above) that is contractually subordinated in right of
payment to any other Indebtedness of Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor
unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of
payment to the notes and the applicable Note Guarantee on substantially
identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be
contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of
Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor solely by virtue of such Indebtedness being
unsecured or by virtue of such Indebtedness being secured on a first or junior
Lien basis.

For purposes of (x) determining compliance with this "Incurrence of
indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock" covenant, in the event that an
item of proposed Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the
categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (25) above, or
is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant,
Issuer will be permitted to classify all or a portion of such item of
Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence, or later reclassify all or a
portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this
covenant and (y) determining the amount of Indebtedness that may be incurred
pursuant to clause (1)(a)(y) of Permitted Debt the Issuer may elect, pursuant
to an officers\' certificate delivered to the Trustee, to treat all or any
portion of the commitment under any Indebtedness (and any refinancing with
respect thereto) as being incurred at such time, in which case any subsequent
incurrence of Indebtedness under such commitment or refinancing, as the case
may be, shall not be deemed, for purposes of this calculation, to be an
incurrence at such subsequent time. The accrual of interest, the accretion or
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any
Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, the
reclassification of Preferred Stock as Indebtedness due to a change in
accounting principles or the application thereof, and the payment of dividends
on Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of
Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or
an issuance of Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of
Indebtedness that Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to
this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of
fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values, and in no event shall the
reclassification of any lease or other liability as indebtedness due to a
change in accounting principles after the Closing Date be deemed to be an
incurrence of Indebtedness. In determining the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding under one of the clauses above, the outstanding principal amount
of any particular Indebtedness of any Person shall be counted only once and
any obligation of such Person or any other Person arising under any guarantee,
Lien, letter of credit or similar instrument supporting such Indebtedness
shall be disregarded so long as it is permitted to be incurred by the Person
or Persons incurring such obligation.

The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued
with original issue discount; 
| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

in the case of Hedging Obligations, the termination value of the agreement or
arrangement giving rise to such obligations that would be payable by such
Person at such time; 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other
Indebtedness; and 

| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets
of the specified Person, the lesser of: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person. 

Liens

Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien
securing Indebtedness upon any asset now owned or hereafter acquired, except
Permitted Liens, unless the notes are equally and ratably secured (except that
Liens securing Indebtedness that is contractually subordinated to the notes
shall be expressly subordinate to any Lien securing the notes to at least the
same extent that such Indebtedness is subordinate to the notes).

Dividend and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries

Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist or become effective any
consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, or pay any Indebtedness owed to Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

make loans or advances to Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to Issuer or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries. 

However, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or
restrictions existing under or by reason of:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

agreements or instruments governing Existing Indebtedness, Equity Interests
and Credit Facilities as in effect on the Closing Date and any amendments,
restatements, modifications, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings of those agreements or instruments; provided that
the amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, increases, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings are (in the good faith judgment of
Board of Directors of Issuer or a senior financial officer of Issuer) not
materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend

Merger, consolidation or sale of assets

Issuer will not: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether

sell, assign, lease, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of the properties or assets of Issuer 

and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related
transactions, to another Person, unless:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

which such sale, assignment, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition
has been made is a corporation, limited liability company or partnership
organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state of the
United States or the District of Columbia; provided that if such Person is not
a corporation, such Person immediately causes a Subsidiary that is a
corporation organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any
state of the United States or the District of Columbia to be added as a co-
issuer of the notes under the indenture; 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other
than Issuer) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, lease, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition has been made expressly assumes, by a
supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the trustee, in form
reasonably satisfactory to the trustee, the payment of the principal of and
any premium and interest on the notes and the performance or observance of
every covenant of the indenture on the part of Issuer to be performed or
observed; 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and 

| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

Issuer or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger
(if other than Issuer), or to which such sale, assignment, lease, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition has been made would, on the date of such
transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing
transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable
four-quarter period, either (a) be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Debt to Cash Flow Ratio test set forth
in the first paragraph of the covenant described above under the caption "--
Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock" or (b) have a Debt
to Cash Flow Ratio no greater than the Debt to Cash Flow Ratio of Issuer
immediately prior to such transaction. 

Upon any merger or consolidation, or any sale, transfer, assignment, lease,
conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties
or assets of Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in
accordance with the first paragraph of this covenant, the successor Person
formed by the consolidation or into which Issuer is merged or to which the
sale, transfer, assignment, lease, conveyance or other disposition is made,
will succeed to and be substituted for Issuer, and may exercise every right
and power of Issuer under the indenture with the same effect as if the
successor had been named as Issuer therein. When the successor assumes all of
Issuer\'s obligations under the indenture, Issuer will be discharged from
those obligations.

This "Merger, consolidation or sale of assets" covenant will not apply to: 
| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

a merger of Issuer with a direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent solely for
the purpose of reincorporating Issuer in another jurisdiction in the United
States so long as the amount of Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries is not increased thereby; 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

any consolidation or merger, or any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance,
lease or other disposition of assets between or among Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries; or 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

the Merger. 

Transactions with affiliates

Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of
its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter
into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding,
loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of
Issuer (each, an "Affiliate Transaction"), in any one or series of related
transactions involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of $50.0
million, unless:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that, taken as a whole, are no less
favorable to Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that
would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Issuer delivers to the trustee: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate
Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of $100.0 million, an
officers\' certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies
with this covenant; and 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate
Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of $250.0 million, a
resolution of the Board of Directors of Issuer set forth in an officers\'
certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with this
covenant and that such Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a majority
of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of Issuer. 

The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and,
therefore, will not be subject to the provisions of the prior paragraph:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

any employment agreement, employee benefit plan, agreement or plan relating to
employee, officer or director compensation or severance, officer or director
indemnification agreement or any similar arrangement entered into by Issuer,
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or Parent existing on the Closing Date, or
entered into thereafter in the ordinary course of business, and any

that is an Affiliate of Issuer solely because Issuer owns, directly or through
a Restricted Subsidiary, an Equity Interest in, or controls, such Person; 

| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

[reserved]; 

|

|

any agreement listed (x) on Schedule 3.2(r) - Related-Party Agreements - to
the "TMUS Disclosure Letter" to the Business Combination Agreement and (y)
under the section entitled "Transactions with Related Persons and Approval" in
the proxy statement of Parent filed with the SEC under cover of Schedule 14A
on April 16, 2012; 

| 
---|--- 

(9)

|

transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, or purchasers or sellers of
goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business and
otherwise in compliance with the terms of the indenture, provided that in the
good faith determination of Issuer\'s Board of Directors or a senior financial
officer of Issuer, such transactions are on terms, taken as a whole, not
materially less favorable to Issuer or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary
than those that could reasonably be expected to be obtained in a comparable
transaction at such time on an arm\'s length basis from a Person that is not
an Affiliate of Issuer; 

| 
---|--- 

(10)

|

issuances, purchases or repurchases of notes or other Indebtedness of Issuer
or its Restricted Subsidiaries or solicitations of amendments, waivers or
consents in respect of notes or such other Indebtedness, if such issuance,
purchase, repurchase or solicitation is approved by a majority of the
disinterested members of the Board of Directors of Issuer; 

| 
---|--- 

(11)

|

reasonable payments made for any financial advisory, financing, underwriting,

a senior financial officer of Issuer in good faith; 

| 
---|--- 

(12)

|

amendments, extensions, replacements and other modifications of transactions
with Affiliates otherwise permitted by the indenture, provided that such
amendments, extensions, replacements or other modifications, taken as a whole, 

are no less favorable in any material respect to Issuer or the applicable
Restricted Subsidiary than the transaction or transactions being amended,
extended, replaced or modified;

| 
---|--- 

(13)

|

any Ancillary Agreements, as defined in the Business Combination Agreement;
and 

| 
---|--- 

(14)

|

so long as 100% of the notes are held by Permitted Holders, any transactions
between the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, on the one hand, and DT or
any Subsidiary thereof (other than Parent, Issuer or any Subsidiary thereof),
on the other hand, and thereafter any agreements evidencing such transactions. 

Business activities

Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
engage in any business other than Permitted Businesses, except to such extent
as would not be material to Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.

Additional note guarantees

If (a) Issuer or any of Issuer\'s Domestic Restricted Subsidiaries acquires or
creates another Domestic Restricted Subsidiary that is a Wholly-Owned
Subsidiary (other than an Immaterial Subsidiary) after the Closing Date or (b)
any Subsidiary of Issuer guarantees any Specified Issuer Indebtedness of
Issuer after the Closing Date or (c) Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent
acquires or creates a Subsidiary that directly or indirectly owns equity
interests of Issuer, then such Person will become a Guarantor and execute a
supplemental indenture and deliver an opinion of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the trustee within 10 business days after the date on which it
was acquired or created or guarantees such Specified Issuer Indebtedness, as
applicable, or reasonably promptly thereafter.

Designation of restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries

The Board of Directors of Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be
an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a
Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, (i) the
aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the
designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under
the covenant described above under the caption "--Restricted payments" or
under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as
determined by Issuer in its discretion, and (ii) any Guarantee by Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary thereof of any Indebtedness of the Restricted
Subsidiary being so designated will be deemed to be an incurrence of
Indebtedness by Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary (or both, if applicable)
at the time of such designation. That designation will only be permitted if
the Investment and/or incurrence of Indebtedness would be permitted at that
time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Board of Directors of Issuer may redesignate any
Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation
would not cause a Default. 

Any designation of a Subsidiary of Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will
be evidenced to the trustee by filing with the trustee a certified copy of a
resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation and an
officers\' certificate certifying that such designation complied with the
preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under
the caption "--Restricted payments." The Board of Directors of Issuer may at
any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary
of Issuer; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence
of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of Issuer of any outstanding
Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only
be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant
described under the caption "--Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of
preferred stock," calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had
occurred at the beginning of the four-quarter reference period; and (2) no
Default would be in existence following, and as a result of, such designation.

Payments for consent

Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for
the benefit of any holder of notes for or as an inducement to any consent,
waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the indenture or the
notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all
holders of the notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame
set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or
amendment.

Reports



Whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the SEC, so long as
any notes are outstanding, Parent will file a copy of each of the reports
referred to in clauses (1) and (2) below with the SEC for public availability
within the time periods (including all applicable extension periods) specified
in the SEC rules and regulations applicable to such reports (unless the SEC
will not accept such a filing):



| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

all quarterly and annual financial reports that would be required to be
contained in a filing with the SEC on Forms 10-Q and 10-K if Parent were
required to file such reports, including a "Management\'s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and, with respect
to the annual information only, a report on the annual financial statements by
its certified independent accountants; and 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

all current reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Form
8-K if Parent or Issuer were required to file such reports; 

provided that the availability of the foregoing reports on the SEC\'s EDGAR
service (or successor thereto)shall be deemed to satisfy Issuer\'s delivery
obligations to the trustee and any holder of notes.

All such reports will be prepared in all material respects in accordance with
all of the rules and regulations applicable to such reports; provided that, if
neither Parent nor Issuer is required under the rules and regulations of the
SEC to file such reports with the SEC for 

public availability, such reports need not be prepared in accordance with all
of the rules and regulations applicable to such reports and shall only be
required to include the information or disclosure that would be required by
such form to the extent that, and in the same general style of presentation
as, the same or substantially similar information or disclosure is also
included in this prospectus supplement. Each annual report on Form 10-K will
include a report on Parent\'s consolidated financial statements by Parent\'s
certified independent accountants. The Issuer will at all times comply with
TIA §314(a).

If the SEC will not accept Parent\'s or Issuer\'s filings for any reason,
Parent or Issuer will post the reports referred to in the preceding paragraphs
on its website, on intralinks.com or another website (which may be password
protected, provided that Issuer makes reasonable efforts to notify the holders
of the notes of the password and other information required to access such
reports on its website) within the time periods that would apply if Parent
were required to file those reports with the SEC (including all applicable
extension periods). If (i) Issuer has designated any of its Subsidiaries as
Unrestricted Subsidiaries or (ii) the combined operations of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, excluding the operations of Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries and excluding cash and Cash Equivalents, would, if held by a
single Unrestricted Subsidiary of Issuer, constitute a Significant Subsidiary
of Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the
preceding paragraphs will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either
on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, and in
Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations, of (A) in the case of (i) above, the financial condition and
results of operations of Parent, Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of Issuer and (B) in the case of (ii) above, the
financial condition and results of operations of Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations
of Parent and its other Subsidiaries; provided however, that the requirements
of this paragraph shall not apply if Parent or Issuer files with the SEC the
reports referred to in clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this
covenant, and any such report contains the information required in this
paragraph.

In addition, Issuer and the Guarantors agree that, for so long as any notes
remain outstanding, if at any time they are not required to file with the SEC
the reports required by the preceding paragraphs, they will furnish to the
holders of notes and prospective investors, upon their request, the
information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(c)(2) under the
Securities Act.

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

default in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise) of

| 
---|--- 

(3)

| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

failure by Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for 30 days after
notice to Issuer by the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate
principal amount of the notes then outstanding voting as a single class to
comply with the provisions described under the captions "--Repurchase at the
option of holders--Change of control triggering event" or "--Repurchase at the
option of holders--Asset sales" (in each case other than a failure to purchase
notes that will constitute an Event of Default under clause (2) above), or "--
Certain covenants--Merger, consolidation or sale of assets"; 

| 
---|--- 

(5)

|

failure by Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for 90 days after
notice to Issuer by the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate
principal amount of the notes then outstanding voting as a single class to
comply with any of the other agreements in the indenture; 

| 
---|--- 

(6)

|

default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be
issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for
money borrowed by Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a
Significant Subsidiary (or any Restricted Subsidiaries that together would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary) (or the payment of which is guaranteed by
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary), whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or
is created after the Closing Date, if that default: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

is caused by a failure to pay principal of, or interest or premium, if any,
on, such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in
such Indebtedness on the date of such default (a "Payment Default"); or 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express
maturity; 

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together
with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has
been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated,
aggregates $100.0 million or more, in each case for so long as such failure or
acceleration is continuing;

| 
---|--- 

(7)

|

failure by Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant
Subsidiary (or any Restricted Subsidiaries that together would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary) to pay or discharge final judgments entered by a court
or courts of competent jurisdiction aggregating in excess of $100.0 million
(to the extent not covered by insurance), which judgments are not paid,
discharged or stayed for a period of 60 consecutive days following entry of
such final judgment or decree 

during which a stay of enforcement of such final judgment or decree, by reason
of pending appeal or otherwise, is not in effect;

| 
---|--- 

(8)

|

except as permitted by the indenture, any Note Guarantee is held in any
judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to
be in full force and effect, or any Guarantor, or any Person acting on behalf
of any such Guarantor, denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note
Guarantee; and 

| 
---|--- 

(9)

|

certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the indenture with
respect to Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant
Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary. 

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy
or insolvency, with respect to Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary of Issuer
that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries of
Issuer that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, all
outstanding notes will become due and payable immediately without further
action or notice. However, the effect of such provision may be limited by
applicable laws. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the
trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding notes may declare all the notes to be due and payable
immediately.

Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding notes may direct the trustee in its exercise of
any trust or power. The trustee may withhold from holders of the notes notice
of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that
withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default
relating to the payment of principal, interest or premium, if any.

Subject to the provisions of the indenture relating to the duties of the
trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the trustee
will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the
indenture at the request or direction of any holders of notes unless such
holders have offered to the trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to it
against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive
payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest when due, no holder of a
note may pursue any remedy with respect to the indenture or the notes unless:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

such holder has previously given the trustee notice that an Event of Default
is continuing; 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
notes have requested the trustee to pursue the remedy; 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

such holders have offered the trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it
against any loss, liability or expense; 

| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

the trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the
receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and 
| 
---|--- 

(5)

|

holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
notes have not given the trustee a direction inconsistent with such request
within such 60-day period. 

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding notes by written notice to the trustee may, on behalf of the
holders of all of the notes, rescind an acceleration or waive any existing
Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the indenture except a
continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or premium,
if any, on, or the principal of, the notes.

In the case of any Event of Default occurring by reason of any willful action
(or inaction) taken (or not taken) by or on behalf of Issuer with the
intention of avoiding payment of the premium that Issuer would have had to pay
if Issuer then had elected to redeem the notes pursuant to the optional
redemption provisions of the indenture, an equivalent premium will also become
and be immediately due and payable to the extent permitted by law upon the
acceleration of the notes.

Issuer is required to deliver to the trustee annually a statement regarding
compliance with the indenture. Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of
Default, Issuer is required to deliver to the trustee a statement specifying
such Default or Event of Default.

No personal liability of directors, officers, employees and stockholders

No director, officer, member, manager, partner, employee, incorporator or
stockholder of Issuer or any Guarantor, as such, will have any liability for
any obligations of Issuer or the Guarantors under the notes, the indenture,
the Note Guarantees, or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of notes by accepting a
note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part
of the consideration for issuance of the notes. The waiver may not be
effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws.



Legal defeasance and covenant defeasance



Issuer may at any time, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a
resolution set forth in an officers\' certificate, elect to have all of its
obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding notes and all
obligations of the Guarantors discharged with respect to their Note Guarantees
("Legal Defeasance") except for:



| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

the rights of holders of outstanding notes to receive payments in respect of
the principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, such notes when such
payments are due from the trust referred to below; 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Issuer\'s obligations with respect to the notes concerning issuing temporary
notes, registration of notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen notes and
the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security
payments held in trust; 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the trustee, and
Issuer\'s and the Guarantors\' obligations in connection therewith; and 
| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the indenture. 

In addition, Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the
obligations of Issuer and the Guarantors released with respect to the
provisions of the indenture described above under

"--Repurchase at the option of holders" and under the caption "--Certain
covenants (other than the covenant described under the caption "--Certain
covenants--Merger, consolidation or sale of assets," except to the extent
described below) and the limitation imposed by clause (4) under the caption "
--Certain covenants--Merger, consolidation or sale of assets" (such release
and termination being referred to as "Covenant Defeasance"), and thereafter
any omission to comply with such obligations or provisions will not constitute
a Default or Event of Default. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs in
accordance with the indenture, the Events of Default described under clauses
(3) through (7) under the caption "--Events of default and remedies" and the
Event of Default described under clause (9) under the caption "--Events of
default and remedies" (but only with respect to Subsidiaries of Issuer), in
each case, will no longer constitute an Event of Default.



In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:



| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the trustee, in trust, for the benefit of
the holders of the notes, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable Government
Securities, or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and non-callable
Government Securities, in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a
nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent
public accountants, to pay the principal of, or interest and premium, if any,
on, the outstanding notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on the
applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and Issuer must specify
whether the notes are being defeased to such stated date for payment or to a
particular redemption date; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

in the case of Legal Defeasance, Issuer must deliver to the trustee an opinion
of counsel reasonably acceptable to the trustee (which opinion of counsel may
be subject to customary assumptions, qualifications and exclusions) confirming
that (a) Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the
Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the Closing Date, there has
been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to
the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that,
the holders of the outstanding notes will not recognize income, gain or loss
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and
will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal
Defeasance had not occurred; 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

in the case of Covenant Defeasance, Issuer must deliver to the trustee an
opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the trustee confirming that the
holders of the outstanding notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and
will be subject to U.S. 

federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same
times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not
occurred;

| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of
such deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the
borrowing of funds, or the imposition of Liens in connection therewith, to be
applied to such deposit, or a Default or Event of Default that will be cured
by such Covenant Defeasance or Legal Defeasance) and the deposit will not
result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any
material instrument to which Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which
Issuer or any Guarantor is bound; 

| 
---|--- 

(5)

|

such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or
violation of, or constitute a default under, any material agreement or
instrument (other than the indenture) to which Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound; 

| 
---|--- 

(6)

|

Issuer must deliver to the trustee an officers\' certificate stating that the
deposit was not made by Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders of
notes over the other creditors of Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of Issuer or others; 

| 
---|--- 

(7)

|

Issuer must deliver to the trustee an officers\' certificate, stating that all
conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant
Defeasance have been complied with; and 

| 
---|--- 

(8)

|

Issuer must deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel (which opinion of
counsel may be subject to customary assumptions, qualifications and
exclusions), stating that all conditions precedent set forth in clauses (2),
(3) and (5) of this paragraph, as applicable, have been complied with;
provided that the opinion of counsel with respect to clause (5) of this
paragraph may be to the knowledge of such counsel. 

Amendment, supplement and waiver

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the indenture or the
notes or the Note Guarantees may be amended or supplemented with the consent
of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, notes), and any existing
Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of the indenture
or the notes or the Note Guarantees may be waived with the consent of the
holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
notes (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, notes). Without the consent of each holder of
notes affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver may not (with respect to
any notes held by a non-consenting holder):

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

reduce the principal amount of notes whose holders must consent to an
amendment, supplement or waiver; 
| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any note or alter the
provisions with respect to the redemption of the notes (other than provisions
relating to the covenants described above under the caption "--Repurchase at
the option of holders"); 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any note; 

| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or
interest or premium, if any, on, the notes (except a rescission of
acceleration of the notes by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration); 

| 
---|--- 

(5)

|

make any note payable in money other than that stated in the notes; 

| 
---|--- 

(6)

|

make any change in the provisions of the indenture relating to waivers of past
Defaults or the rights of holders of notes to receive payments of principal
of, or interest or premium, if any, on, the notes; 

| 
---|--- 

(7)

|

waive a redemption payment with respect to any note (other than a payment
required by one of the covenants described above under the caption "--
Repurchase at the option of holders"); 

| 
---|--- 

(8)

|

release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee or
the indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the indenture; or 

| 
---|--- 

(9)

|

make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions. 

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of notes,
Issuer, the Guarantors and the trustee may amend or supplement the indenture,
the notes or the Note Guarantees:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency; 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

to provide for uncertificated notes in addition to or in place of certificated
notes; 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

to provide for the assumption of Issuer\'s or a Guarantor\'s obligations to
holders of notes and Note Guarantees in the case of a merger or consolidation
or sale of all or substantially all of Issuer\'s or such Guarantor\'s assets,
as applicable; 

| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

to effect the release of a Guarantor from its Note Guarantee and the
termination of such Note Guarantee, all in accordance with the provisions of
the indenture governing such release and termination; 

| 
---|--- 

(5)

|

to add any Guarantor or Note Guarantee or to secure the notes or any Note
Guarantee; 
| 
---|--- 

(6)

|

to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the
holders of notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the
indenture of any such holder [in any material respect]16; 

| 
---|--- 

(7)

|

to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the
qualification of the indenture under the Trust Indenture Act; 

| 
---|--- 

(8)

|

to conform the text of the indenture, the Note Guarantees, or the notes to any
provision of this description of notes to the extent that such provision in
this description of notes was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a
provision of the indenture, the Note Guarantees, or the notes, in each case,
as [conclusively]17 evidenced by an officers\' certificate; 

| 
---|--- 

(9)

|

to provide for the issuance of additional notes in accordance with the
limitations set forth in the indenture as of the Closing Date; or 

| 
---|--- 

(10)

|

to allow any Guarantor to execute a supplemental indenture and/or a Note
Guarantee with respect to the notes. 

The consent of the holders of the notes is not necessary under the indenture
to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver. It is
sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment or
waiver.

Satisfaction and discharge

The indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to
all notes issued thereunder, when:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

either: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

all notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed notes
that have been replaced or paid and notes for whose payment money has been
deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to Issuer, have been delivered to the
trustee for cancellation; or 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

all notes that have not been delivered to the trustee for cancellation have
become due and payable by reason of the sending of a notice of redemption or
otherwise or will become due and payable within one year and Issuer or any
Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the trustee
as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders, cash in U.S.
dollars, non-callable Government Securities, or a combination of cash in U.S.
dollars and non-callable Government Securities, in amounts as will be
sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and
discharge the entire Indebtedness on the notes not delivered to the

trustee for cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest
to the date of maturity or redemption;

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of
such deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the
borrowing of funds, or the imposition of any Liens in connection therewith, to
be applied to such deposit, or a Default or Event of Default that will be
cured by such discharge); 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a
default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than the indenture)
to which Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which Issuer or any
Guarantor is bound; 

| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

Issuer or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it
under the indenture; and 

| 
---|--- 

(5)

|

Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the trustee under the
indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the notes at
maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be. 

In addition, Issuer must deliver to the trustee (a) an officers\' certificate,
stating that all conditions precedent set forth in clauses (1) through (5)
above have been satisfied, and (b) an opinion of counsel (which opinion of
counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and qualifications), stating
that all conditions precedent set forth in clauses (3) and (5) above have been
satisfied; provided that the opinion of counsel with respect to clause (3)
above may be to the knowledge of such counsel.

Governing law

The indenture, the notes and the Note Guarantees will be governed by the laws
of the State of New York.

Concerning the trustee

[We maintain ordinary banking relationships with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and
its affiliates. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. serves as syndication agent and Wells
Fargo Securities, LLC, an affiliate of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., serves as joint
lead arranger and joint book-running manager under our senior secured credit
facility.]

If the trustee becomes a creditor of Issuer or any Guarantor, the indenture
limits the right of the trustee to obtain payment of claims in certain cases,
or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as
security or otherwise. The trustee will be permitted to engage in other
transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest when a Default
is continuing it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days of the date such
conflict arises, apply to the SEC for permission to continue as trustee (if
the indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act) or resign.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for 

exercising any remedy available to the trustee, subject to certain exceptions.
The indenture provides that in case an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, the trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use
the degree of care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own affairs.



Subject to such provisions, the trustee will be under no obligation to
exercise any of its rights or powers under the indenture at the request of any
holder of notes, unless such holder has offered to the trustee security and
indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.



Book-entry, delivery and form



Except as set forth below, the notes will be issued in registered, global form
("Global Notes"). The Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with the
trustee as custodian for DTC and registered in the name of DTC or its nominee,
in each case, for credit to an account of a direct or indirect participant in
DTC as described below.



Except as set forth below, the Global Notes may be transferred, in whole and
not in part, only to another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its
nominee. Beneficial interests in the Global Notes may not be exchanged for
definitive notes in registered certificated form ("Certificated Notes") except
in the limited circumstances described below. See "--Exchange of global notes
for certificated notes." Except in the limited circumstances described below,
owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to
receive physical delivery of such notes in certificated form.

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the
applicable rules and procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants
(including, if applicable, those of Euroclear System ("Euroclear") and
Clearstream Banking, S.A. ("Clearstream")), which may change from time to
time.

[Depository procedures

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear
and Clearstream are provided solely as a matter of convenience. These
operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective
settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. Issuer takes no
responsibility for these operations and procedures and urges investors to
contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised Issuer that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to
hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the
"Participants") and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions
in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry
changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities
brokers and dealers (including the underwriters), banks, trust companies,
clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC\'s system
is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust
companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a
Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the "Indirect
Participants"). Persons who are not 

Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only
through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests
in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on
behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect
Participants.

DTC has also advised Issuer that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of the
Participants designated by the underwriters with portions of the principal
amount of the Global Notes; and 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the
transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through,
records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the
Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of
beneficial interest in the Global Notes). 

Investors in the Global Notes who are Participants may hold their interests
therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Global Notes who are not
Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations
(including Euroclear and Clearstream) which are Participants. Euroclear and
Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their
participants through customers\' securities accounts in their respective names
on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank
S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A., as operator of
Clearstream. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through
Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of
DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject
to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states
require that certain Persons take physical delivery in definitive form of
securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial
interests in a Global Note to such Persons will be limited to that extent.
Because DTC can act only on behalf of the Participants, which in turn act on
behalf of the Indirect Participants, the ability of a Person having beneficial
interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to Persons that do not
participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such
interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing
such interests.]

Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not
have notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of
notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or
"holders" thereof under the indenture for any purpose.

Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on
a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to
DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the indenture. Under the
terms of the indenture, Issuer and the trustee will treat the Persons in whose
names the notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of
the notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. 

Consequently, neither Issuer, the trustee nor any agent of Issuer or the
trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

any aspect of DTC\'s records or any Participant\'s or Indirect Participant\'s
records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership
interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any
of DTC\'s records or any Participant\'s or Indirect Participant\'s records
relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its
Participants or Indirect Participants. 

[DTC has advised Issuer that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment
in respect of securities such as the notes (including principal and interest),
is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the
payment date unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment
on such payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount
proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal
amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by
the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of
notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and
will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants
and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the trustee or Issuer. Neither
Issuer nor the trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of the
Participants or the Indirect Participants in identifying the beneficial owners
of the notes, and Issuer and the trustee may conclusively rely on and will be
protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.

Transfers between the Participants will be effected in accordance with DTC\'s
procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between
participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with
their respective rules and operating procedures.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes
described herein, cross-market transfers between the Participants, on the one
hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be
effected through DTC in accordance with DTC\'s rules on behalf of Euroclear or
Clearstream, as the case may be, by their respective depositaries; however,
such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to
Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such
system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established
deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the
case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements,
deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect
final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the
relevant Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance
with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC.
Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver
instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. 

DTC has advised Issuer that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose
account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect
of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which
such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if
there is an Event of Default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to
exchange the Global Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes
to its Participants.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing
procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes and the
Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, they are
under no obligation to perform or to continue to perform such procedures, and
may discontinue such procedures at any time. None of Issuer, the trustee and
any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the
performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants
or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and
procedures governing their operations.]

Exchange of global notes for certificated notes

A Global Note is exchangeable for Certificated Notes if:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

DTC (a) notifies Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as
depositary for the Global Notes or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency
registered under the Exchange Act and, in either case, Issuer fails to appoint
a successor depositary within 120 days after the date of such notice; or 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Issuer, at its option, notifies the trustee in writing that it elects to cause
the issuance of the Certificated Notes; or 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

there has occurred and is continuing a Default or Event of Default with
respect to the notes and DTC has notified Issuer and the trustee of its desire
to exchange the Global Notes for Certificated Notes. 

In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for
Certificated Notes upon 30 days prior written notice given to the trustee by
or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the indenture. In all cases,
Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial
interests in Global Notes will be registered in the names, and issued in any
approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in
accordance with its customary procedures).

Exchange of certificated notes for global notes

Certificated Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in any Global
Note unless the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate
(in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that such transfer will
comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. 

Same day settlement and payment

Issuer will make payments in respect of the notes represented by the Global
Notes (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts specified by DTC or its nominee.
Issuer will make all payments of principal, interest and premium, if any, with
respect to Certificated Notes by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the accounts specified by the holders of the Certificated Notes or, if no
such account is specified, by mailing a check to each such holder\'s
registered address. [The notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to
be eligible to trade in DTC\'s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any
permitted secondary market trading activity in such notes will, therefore, be
required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. Issuer expects
that secondary trading in any Certificated Notes will also be settled in
immediately available funds.]

[Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or
Clearstream participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a
Participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the
relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities
settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear and
Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has advised
Issuer that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of
interests in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream
participant to a Participant will be received with value on the settlement
date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream
cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream
following DTC\'s settlement date.]

Certain definitions

Set forth below are certain defined terms used in the indenture. Reference is
made to the indenture for a full disclosure of all defined terms used therein,

Terms used but not otherwise defined have the meaning set forth in the

DT Redemption Event

If a DT Redemption Event occurs, any DT Entity which holds any DT Notes will
have the right to require Issuer to repurchase all or any part of such DT
Notes for cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of DT Notes
repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest on the DT Notes repurchased to,
but not including, the date of purchase (the "DT Redemption Event Payment").

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the indenture, in case of any
Change of Control Triggering Event based upon a Change of Control that is a
Specified Change of Control, no DT Entity will tender any DT Notes into the
related Change of Control Offer.

If a DT Entity transfers any DT Notes to any third party after the earlier of
announcement or consummation of a transaction that constitutes a Specified
Change of Control, and before the Change of Control Offer that the Issuer is
required to make in connection therewith expires, the transferee of such DT
Notes shall agree that it will not tender any such DT Notes to the Issuer in
any such Change of Control offer.

Merger, consolidation or sale of assets

The Issuer will cause any person with which it consolidates or merges, or
directly or indirectly transfers all or substantially all of its assets to
expressly assume the obligations under the Noteholder Agreement.

Amendments

For so long as DT holds, directly or indirectly, a majority in principal
amount of any series of the DT Notes, the Issuer shall not agree to any waiver
or amendment of any provision or term of such series of DT Notes or the
indenture or other instrument governing such series of DT Notes without the
prior written consent of DT, which may be withheld in the DT\'s sole
discretion.

After such time as DT no longer holds, directly or indirectly, a majority in
principal amount of any series of the DT Notes, the Issuer shall not agree to
any waiver or amendment of any provision or term of such series of the DT
Notes or the indenture or other instrument governing such series of DT Notes
without the consent of holders of at least 50.1% of the aggregate principal
amount of such series of DT Notes.

Restrictions on optional redemption of DT Notes

For so long as any DT Entity holds, directly or indirectly, any DT Notes,
Issuer shall not (a) issue any equity interests of Issuer for the purpose of
redeeming or otherwise purchasing any DT Notes, or (b) use the proceeds of any
sale of equity interests of Issuer or contributions to Issuer\'s common equity
capital made with the proceeds of one or more sales of equity interests of 

MetroPCS or any other person to directly or indirectly redeem or otherwise
repurchase any DT Notes.

Mutual cooperation regarding DTC

For so long as any DT Entity holds, directly or indirectly, any DT Notes,
Issuer, MetroPCS, and DT shall take all actions reasonable required to submit
the DT Notes for electronic book-entry delivery and settlement through DTC on
the earliest possible date, including, if necessary, through the use of one or
more DTC Participants, provided that the out of pocket costs of such actions
shall be paid by TMUS.
