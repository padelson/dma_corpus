AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of November 17, 2016 (this "
_Agreement_ "), by and between Cascade Bancorp, an Oregon corporation (the "
_Company_ "), and First Interstate BancSystem, Inc., a Montana corporation ("
_Parent_ ").

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their
shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction
provided for herein, pursuant to which the Company will, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Parent (the " _Merger_
"), so that Parent is the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes
referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") in the
Merger;

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have adopted
and approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, and the Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company
have resolved to recommend that the shareholders of each of Parent and the
Company, respectively, approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger;

WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this
Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for
purposes of Sections 354, 356 and 361 of the Code;

WHEREAS, this Agreement constitutes a "plan of merger" within the meaning of
the MBCA and OBCA;

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement for each party to enter into this
Agreement, certain shareholders of the Company and Parent have simultaneously
herewith entered into voting agreements substantially in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_ (each, a " _Voting Agreement_ ," and collectively, the
" _Voting Agreements_ ") in connection with the Merger; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements specified in this Agreement in connection with the Merger and also
to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Montana Business Corporation Act (the " _MBCA_ ") and the

 



-1-  Oregon Business Corporation Act (the " _OBCA_ "), at the Effective Time, the
Company shall merge with and into Parent. Parent shall be the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under
the laws of the State of Montana. Upon consummation of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of the Company shall terminate.

 

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place by mail or electronic
delivery, or by mutual agreement of the parties, at the offices of Luse
Gorman, PC, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on a date which shall be no later
than three (3) business days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to
applicable law) of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof (other than
those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), unless another date, time
or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which
the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date."

 

1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
at the Closing, the parties shall execute, and Parent shall cause to be filed
articles of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Montana (the "
_Montana Secretary_ ") and the Secretary of State of the State of Oregon (the
" _Oregon Secretary_ ") and, as applicable, plans of merger, to the extent
required by the relevant provisions of the MBCA and of the OBCA, respectively
(collectively, the " _Articles of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become
effective at such time as designated in the Articles of Merger, or as
otherwise agreed by the parties. The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the
date and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Articles
of Merger.

 

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the MBCA and the
OBCA.

1.5 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the
holder of any of the following securities:

(a) Subject to Section 2.2(e) and as noted below, each share of the common
stock, no par value, of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), except for the
Cancelled Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive, without
interest, (i) 0.14864 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ," and such shares, the "
_Stock Consideration_ ") of the Class A common stock, no par value per share,
of Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") and (ii) $1.91 in cash (the " _Cash
Consideration_ ," together with the Stock Consideration, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "); it being understood that upon the Effective Time, pursuant
to Section 1.6, the Parent Common Stock, including the shares issued to
former holders of Company Common Stock, shall be the common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist
as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an " _Old Certificate_
," it being understood that any reference herein to an " _Old Certificate_ "
shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating
to the

 



-2-  ownership of shares of Company Common Stock) previously representing any
such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, including without duplication, cash
in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to
receive pursuant to this Section 1.5 and Section 2.2(e), and (ii) any
dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.2(b), in each case, upon the surrender of such Old
Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2 and without any interest thereon.
If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock
or Company Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or
exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result
of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split or other similar change in capitalization, or there
shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and
proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio and the Merger
Consideration to give holders of Company Common Stock and Parent the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ , that nothing contained herein shall be construed to permit
Parent or the Company to take any action with respect to its securities or
otherwise that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are
directly owned by the Company or Parent (in each case, other than shares of
Company Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, by Parent or the Company in
respect of debt previously contracted or held in a fiduciary capacity) shall
be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no Merger Consideration or
other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor (such cancelled
shares, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ").

(d) In accordance with Section 60.554 of the OBCA, no dissenters rights
shall be available to the holders of Company Common Stock in connection with
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

1.6 _Parent Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 

1.7 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each option to purchase
Company Common Stock granted by the Company (a " _Company Option_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and,
subject to Parents receipt of an option surrender agreement in the form set
forth in Section 1.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, the holder shall
be entitled to receive, on the Closing Date, a cash payment, without interest
and less applicable withholding taxes, with respect thereto equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the
Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration Value over the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of
the Effective Time. " _Merger Consideration Value_ " means the sum of (A) the
Cash Consideration and (B) the product of (1) the Exchange Ratio times (2) the
Parent Share Closing Price. If the per share exercise price of a Company
Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration Value, such Company Option
shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration.

 



-3- (b) _Company Restricted Stock Awards_. At the Effective Time, each award of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to vesting or repurchase granted by
the Company that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each,
a " _Company Restricted Stock Award_ ") shall be cancelled and converted
automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect
of each share of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Restricted Stock
Award, without interest.

 

(c) _Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards_. At the Effective Time, each
restricted stock unit award in respect of shares of Company Common Stock
granted by the Company (a " _Company RSU Award_ ") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and, subject to
Parents receipt of an RSU surrender agreement in the form set forth
in Section 1.7(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, the holder shall be
entitled to receive on the Closing Date, a cash payment, without interest and
less applicable withholding taxes, with respect thereto equal to the product
of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company
RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger
Consideration Value. "Merger Consideration Value" has the same meaning as
provided in Section 1.7(a).

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of
the Company and its Compensation Committee, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 1.7.

 

1.8 _Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective
Time, the Articles of Incorporation of Parent (the " _Parent Articles_ "), as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, subject to the
approval by the shareholders of Parent by the Requisite Amendment Vote, be
amended and restated as set forth in the form attached as  _Exhibit B_ hereto
(the " _Articles Amendment_ "), and as so amended and restated shall be the
Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter duly
amended in accordance with the terms thereof and applicable law.

1.9 _Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws
of Parent (the " _Parent Bylaws_ "), as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until
thereafter duly amended in accordance with the terms thereof and applicable
law.

 

1.10 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization"
for the purposes of Sections 354, 356 and 361 of the Code.

 

1.11 _Bank Merger_. Immediately following the Merger, Bank of the Cascades ("
_Company Bank_ "), an Oregon stock bank and a wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company, will merge (the "Bank Merger") with and into First Interstate Bank ("
_Parent Bank_ "), a

 



-4-  Montana state-chartered commercial bank and a wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent. Parent Bank shall be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger (the "
_Surviving Bank_ ") and, following the Bank Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Company Bank shall cease. The parties agree that the Bank Merger
shall become effective immediately after the Effective Time. Promptly after
the date of this Agreement, Parent Bank and Company Bank will enter into an
agreement and plan of merger in form and substance agreed to by Parent and the
Company, which shall be customary for mergers similar to the Bank Merger (the
" _Bank Merger Agreement_ "). The Company shall cause Company Bank, and
Parent shall cause Parent Bank, to execute such articles of merger and such
other documents and certificates as are necessary to make the Bank Merger
effective (" _Bank Merger Articles_ ") immediately following the Effective
Time.

ARTICLE II

 

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

2.1  _Parent to Make Merger Consideration Available_. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an
exchange agent designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Old
Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, (a)
certificates or, at Parents option, evidence of shares in book-entry form,
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock (collectively, referred to
herein as " _New Certificates_ "), to be delivered to the holders of Company
Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5, and (b) cash in an amount equal to the
aggregate Cash Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
required to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Article II (such New Certificates and cash, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ ").

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than ten (10) days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing shares
of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Article I, (i) a letter of transmittal,
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old
Certificates to the Exchange Agent (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates in
exchange for New Certificates representing the number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares, and the Cash
Consideration which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old
Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to
this Agreement, as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.2(b). Upon proper surrender of an Old
Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate
representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the
provisions of

 



-5-  Article I and (ii) a check representing the amount of (A) the Cash
Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Old
Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II, (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder
has the right to receive in respect of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates
surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II and (C) any
dividends or distributions which the holder presenting such Old Certificate or
Old Certificates has the right to receive pursuant to this Section 2.2, and
the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration,
dividends or distributions or cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to
holders of Old Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.2, each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect
of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate
until such holder shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with this
Article II. After the surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with this
Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent
Common Stock that the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive.

(c) If any New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to
be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an
appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent
in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock in
any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or
Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than to
settle transfers of such Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Old Certificates representing
such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Article II.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New
Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable
on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Parent shall pay in accordance with

 



-6-  Section 2.2(a) to each former holder of Company Common Stock who otherwise
would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded
to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing
price per share of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ as reported by _The Wall
Street Journal_ for the consecutive period of twenty (20) full trading days
ending on the fifth day immediately preceding the Closing Date (or, if not
reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually agreed upon by
Parent and the Company) (the " _Parent Share Closing Price_ ") by (ii) the
fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Company Common
Stock held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time and rounded
to the nearest one-thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 1.5. The parties acknowledge that payment of such cash consideration
in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not separately bargained-for
consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for
purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience that would otherwise be
caused by the issuance of fractional shares.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Company Common Stock for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any former holders of Company Common
Stock who have not theretofore exchanged their Old Certificates in compliance
with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares
and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock
deliverable in respect of each former share of Company Common Stock such
shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any
other person shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for
any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(g) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or any other amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock or Company
Equity Awards such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the
appropriate governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company
Common Stock in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

(h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, deliverable
in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement, and any dividends or
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b).

 



-7- (i) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Parent, in the exercise of its
reasonable discretion, shall have the right to make all determinations, not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing (i) the validity of
any Letter of Transmittal and compliance by any holder of Company Common Stock
with the procedures and instructions set forth herein and therein, (ii) the
issuance and delivery of the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock
into which shares of Company Common Stock are converted in the Merger and
(iii) the method of payment of the Cash Consideration and the cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedules delivered by the Company to
Parent concurrently herewith (the " _Company Disclosure Schedules_ ");
_provided_ that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedules as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by the Company
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or
circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material
Adverse Effect and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of
Article III shall be deemed to qualify (a) any other section of Article III
specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (b) other sections of Article
III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the
absence of a specific reference or cross-reference) from a reading of the
disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections the Company
hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the
laws of the State of Oregon, and is a bank holding company duly registered
under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (" _BHC Act_ "). The
Company has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted. The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As
used in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with
respect to Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, any effect, change, event, circumstance, condition, occurrence or
development that, either individually or in the aggregate, has had a material
adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results
of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of such party and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect
to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not

 



-8-  be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable
regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in
laws, rules or regulations of general applicability to companies in the
industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or
interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, including changes
in Federal or state tax laws, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global,
national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or
acts of terrorism) or in economic or market conditions affecting the
financial services industry generally and not specifically relating to such
party or its Subsidiaries, (D) changes, after the date hereof, in prevailing
interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit or United States
capital markets conditions, or other financial, economic or monetary
conditions in the United States or elsewhere, in each case affecting the
financial services industry generally and not specifically relating to such
party or its Subsidiaries, (E) changes proximately caused by the public
disclosure or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (provided
that this exception shall not apply for purposes of the representations and
warranties in Section 3.3(b) or Section 4.3(b)) or actions or omissions
expressly required by this Agreement or that are taken or omitted to be taken
with the express prior written consent of the other party in contemplation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, or (F) any failure by a party to meet
internal or published projections, forecasts, performance measures, operating
statistics or revenue or earnings predictions for any period (it being
understood that the underlying facts and circumstances giving rise to such
failure may be deemed to constitute, and may be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or would reasonably be expected to be, a
Material Adverse Effect if such facts and circumstances are not otherwise
excluded pursuant to clauses (A)-(E) of this definition); except, with
respect to subclauses (A), (B), (C) or (D), to the extent that the effects of
such change are disproportionately adverse to such party and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, as compared to other companies similarly situated in the
industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the ability
of such party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in
this Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any
person, means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, bank or
other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, or person of which
(i) such first person directly or indirectly owns or controls at least a
majority of the securities or other interests having by their terms ordinary
voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or others
performing similar functions or (ii) such first person is or directly or
indirectly has the power to appoint a general partner, manager or managing
member or others performing similar functions. True and complete copies of the
Articles of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Articles_ ") and the
Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available
by the Company to Parent.

 

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company (a " _Company Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or
lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.
There are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of the Company to
pay dividends or 

 



-9-  distributions except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated
entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to
all such regulated entities. The deposit accounts of each Subsidiary of the
Company that is an insured depository institution are insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance
Fund (as defined in Section 3(y) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of
1950) to the fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums and assessments
required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid when due, and no
proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending or threatened.
Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedules sets forth a true and
complete list of all Subsidiaries of the Company. There is no person whose
results of operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders equity or
financial position are consolidated in the financial statements of the
Company other than the Company Subsidiaries.

3.2 _Capitalization_. 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par
value, of which no shares of preferred stock are issued or outstanding. As of
the date of this Agreement, there are (i) 76,263,275 shares of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding, which number includes 1,154,164 shares of
Company Common Stock granted in respect of outstanding Company Restricted
Stock Awards, (ii) 44,199 shares of Company Common Stock held in treasury, and
(iii) 57,292 shares of Company Common Stock subject to outstanding Company
RSU Awards. As of the date of this Agreement, there are 3,386,751 shares of
Company Common Stock subject to and reserved for issuance upon the exercise of
outstanding Company Options, that are not included in the number of issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock indicated above. No other shares
of capital stock or other voting securities or equity interests of the Company
are issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. There
are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have the right to
vote on any matters on which shareholders of the Company may vote, and no
trust preferred or subordinated debt securities of the Company are issued or
outstanding. Other than the Company Options, Company RSU Awards and
Company Restricted Stock Awards (collectively, the " _Company Equity Awards_
") issued prior to the date of this Agreement and set forth in this Section
3.2(a), and the stock-settled dollar-denominated performance-based awards
described in Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules (the " _LTI
Awards_ "), there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts,
calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or
agreements obligating the Company to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire, any shares of capital stock or other voting securities
or equity interests. Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules sets
forth a true, correct and complete list of all Company Equity Awards and LTI
Awards outstanding as of the date hereof specifying, on a holder-by-holder
basis, as applicable, (A) the name of each holder, (B) the number of shares
subject to each such Company Equity Award (or, in the case of an LTI Award,
the dollar value of the award that would be earned at threshold, target and
maximum levels of performance), (C) the grant date of each such Company Equity
Award or LTI Award, (D) the vesting schedule for each Equity Award, (E) the
Company Benefit Plan under which such Company Equity Award or LTI Award was
granted, (F) the exercise price for each such Company Equity Award that is a
Company Option, and (G) the 

 



-10-  expiration date for each such Company Equity Award that is a Company Option.
Other than the Company Equity Awards and the LTI Awards, no equity-based
awards (including any cash awards where the amount of payment is determined
in whole or in part based on the price of any capital stock of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries) are outstanding. No Subsidiary of the Company owns
any capital stock of the Company.

 

(b) Other than the Voting Agreements and as set forth on Section 3.2(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedules, there are no voting trusts, shareholder
agreements, proxies or similar agreements to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party in effect with respect to the voting or transfer of
the Company Common Stock or other voting securities or equity interests of
the Company or granting any shareholder or other person any registration
rights. The Company does not have in effect a "poison pill" or similar
shareholder rights plan.

 

(c) The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests
of each of the Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges,
charges, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all
of such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid, nonassessable (except, with respect to bank
Subsidiaries, as provided under 12 U.S.C. §55 or any comparable provision of
applicable state law) and free of preemptive rights, with no personal
liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Company Subsidiary has or is
bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights,
commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or
issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other voting security or
equity interest of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other voting
security or equity interest of such Subsidiary.

 

3.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

 

(a) The Company has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.
The Board of Directors of the Company has determined that the Merger, on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, is in the best interests of
the Company and its shareholders and has directed that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby be submitted to the shareholders of the
Company for consideration and approval at a meeting of such shareholders and
has adopted a resolution to the foregoing effect and recommending that the
shareholders of the Company approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Except for the adoption and approval of this Agreement
by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock (the " _Requisite Company Vote_ ") and the adoption
and approval of the Bank Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby (including the Bank Merger) by the Board of Directors of Company Bank
and the Company as its sole shareholder, no other corporate proceedings on the
part of the Company are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent) constitutes a valid and binding obligation
of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms
(except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited

 



-11-  by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, reorganization
or similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting insured
depository institutions or the rights of creditors generally and the
availability of equitable remedies (the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ ").
Immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Board of Directors
of the Company has amended and restated the Company Bylaws in the form
attached as _Exhibit C_ hereto.

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by the Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i)
violate any provision of the Company Articles or the Company Bylaws or (ii)
assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to in Section 3.4
are duly obtained and/or made, as applicable, (x) violate any law, statute,
code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets or (y) violate, conflict with, result in a
breach of any provision of or the loss of any benefit under, constitute a
default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a right of
termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of
trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of
clause (y) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults that,
either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

3.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Except for (a) the filing of applications,
filings and notices, as applicable, with the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (the " _Federal Reserve Board_ ") under the BHC Act and

or obtained under the securities or "Blue Sky" laws of various states in
connection with the 

 



-12-  issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and (g)
the approval of the listing of such Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ, no
consents or approvals of or filings or registrations with any court,
administrative agency or commission or other governmental authority or
instrumentality or SRO (each, a " _Governmental Entity_ ") are necessary in
connection with (A) the execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement or (B) the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Bank Merger), the failure of
which to make or obtain would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company
or the Surviving Corporation. As of the date hereof, the Company is not aware
of any reason why the necessary regulatory approvals and consents will not be
received to permit consummation of the Merger, the Bank Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement on a timely basis.

3.5 _Reports_. Except as set forth on Section 3.5 of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed all
reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments required
to be made with respect thereto, that they were required to file (or
furnish, as applicable) since January 1, 2013 with (i) any state regulatory
authority, including the MDOB and the Oregon Division, (ii) the SEC, (iii) the
Federal Reserve Board, (iv) the FDIC, (v) any foreign regulatory authority
and (vi) any self-regulatory organization (an " _SRO_ ") ((i) through (vi),
collectively, " _Regulatory Agencies_ "), including, without limitation, any
report, registration or statement required to be filed pursuant to the laws,
rules or regulations of the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or
any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable
in connection therewith, except where the failure to file such
report, registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except for normal examinations
conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and except as, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company, no Regulatory Agency has pending any proceeding or, to the
knowledge of the Company, investigation into the business or operations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries since December 31, 2013, and there (i) is
no unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency
with respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations or
inspections of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) has been no
formal or informal inquiries by, or disagreements or disputes with,
any Regulatory Agency with respect to the business, operations, policies or
procedures of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries since December 31, 2013.

(a) The financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Company Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations,
cash flows, changes in shareholders equity and consolidated financial
position of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods
or as of the respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of
unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments normal and not material in
nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of filing
with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements
and with the 

 



-13-  published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and (iv)
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the
periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in
the notes thereto. The books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries
have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance
with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and
reflect only actual transactions. Since December 31, 2013, no independent
public accounting firm of the Company has resigned (or informed the Company
that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent
public accountants of the Company as a result of or in connection with any
disagreements with the Company on a matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

 

(b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any
nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and
whether due or to become due), except for liabilities (i) that are reflected
or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company included
in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30,
2016 (including any notes thereto), (ii) incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2016, or (iii) incurred
in connection with or expressly contemplated by this Agreement, in each case,
which would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and
non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
The Company (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) to ensure that material information
relating to the Company, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the
chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of the Company by
others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "
_Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to the Companys outside auditors and
the audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys
internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in
writing by management to the Companys auditors and audit committee. There is
no reason to believe that the Companys outside auditors and its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 



-14- (d) Since January 1, 2013, (i) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any director, officer,
auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise has had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-
offs and accruals) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective internal accounting controls, including any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and
(ii) no attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
or not employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported
evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty
or similar violation by the Company or any of its officers, directors,
employees or agents to the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof or, to the Knowledge of the Company, to any director or officer of the
Company.

 

3.7 _Broker s Fees_. Except as disclosed on Section 3.7 of the Company
Disclosure Schedules, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor any
of their respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or
financial advisor or incurred any liability for any brokers fees, commissions
or finders fees in connection with the Merger or related transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

their respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice.

3.9 _Legal Proceedings_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
there is no suit, action, investigation or proceeding pending or, to its
Knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (1) that involves a Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency, or
(2) that, individually or in the aggregate, if determined adversely to
the Company, could (A) have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, or (B)
be reasonably likely to prevent or delay it from performing its obligations
under, or consummating the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement.

 

(b) Except as could not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, there is no
injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory restriction imposed upon
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the Merger, would apply to
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates).

 



-15- 3.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed
(including all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in
all jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and
all such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return (other than
extensions to file Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary course). All material
Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax
Returns) that are due have been fully and timely paid. Each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have
been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, creditor, shareholder, independent contractor or other third party.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any extension or
waiver of the limitation period applicable to any material Tax, which waiver
or extension remains in effect. The federal income Tax Returns of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for all years to and including 2012 have been examined
by the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") or are Tax Returns with
respect to which the applicable period for assessment under applicable law,
after giving effect to extensions or waivers, has expired. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of assessment
or proposed assessment in connection with any material amount of Taxes, and
there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
disputes, claims, audits, examinations or other proceedings regarding any
material Tax of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. The Company has made available to Parent true, correct
and complete copies of any private letter ruling requests, closing agreements
or gain recognition agreements with respect to Taxes requested or executed in
the last six (6) years. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification
agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement
exclusively between or among the Company and its Subsidiaries or an agreement
entered into in the ordinary course of business, the principal purpose of
which is not related to Tax). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
(A) has been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal
income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent of which was the
Company) or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any person (other than the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6
(or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or
successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been, within the past two (2) years as part of a "plan (or
series of related transactions)" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the
Code of which the Merger is also a part, a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the
Code) in a distribution of stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment
under Section 355 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has participated in a "listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation section 1.6011-4(b)(2). At no time during the past five (5) years
has the Company been a United States real property holding corporation within
the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code.

 

(b) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Tax_ " or " _Taxes_ " means all
federal, state, local, and foreign income, excise, gross receipts, ad
valorem, profits, gains, property, capital, sales, transfer, use, license,
payroll, employment, social security, severance, unemployment, withholding,
duties, excise, windfall profits, intangibles, franchise, backup withholding,
value added, alternative or add-on minimum, estimated and other taxes,
charges, fees, levies or like assessments together with all penalties and
additions to tax and interest thereon.

 



-16- (c) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Tax Return_ " means any
return, declaration, report, claim for refund, estimate or information return
or statement relating to Taxes, including any schedule or attachment thereto,
and including any amendment thereof, supplied or required to be filed with a
Governmental Entity. 

3.11 _Employees_.

 

(a) Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules sets forth a true and
correct list of each material Company Benefit Plan. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Company Benefit Plan_ " means each employee benefit plan (as
defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")), whether or not subject to ERISA, and each
bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, equity or equity-based,
incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, welfare
benefit plans (including vacation and time off policies and other material
benefit policies and practices), supplemental retirement, severance or other
benefit plan, program or arrangement, and each retention, bonus, employment,
change in control, termination, severance plan, program or arrangement or
other contract or agreement (i) to or with respect to which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or any trade or business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not incorporated, all of which together with the
Company would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section
4001 of ERISA (a " _Company ERISA Affiliate_ "), is a party or has or, would
reasonably be expected to have, any current or future obligation or (ii) that
is maintained, contributed to or sponsored, or is required to be contributed
to, by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Company ERISA Affiliate
for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer, director or
independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Company ERISA Affiliate.

(b) The Company has heretofore made available to Parent a true and complete
copy of each Company Benefit Plan and, with respect to each such Company
Benefit Plan, the following related documents: (i) all summary plan
descriptions, amendments, modifications or material supplements, (ii) the
annual reports (Form 5500), if any, filed with the IRS for the last two plan
years, (iii) the most recently received IRS advisory opinion or determination
letter, if any, relating to such Company Benefit Plan, (iv) the most recently
prepared actuarial report (if applicable), (v) benefit schedules, (vi) trust
instruments and insurance contracts and (vii) any Form 5300, Form 5310 or Form
5330 filed with the IRS within the last two years as of the date hereof.

 

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan has been established, operated and administered
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of
all applicable laws, including ERISA and the Code, the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (" _HIPAA_ ") and the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act (" _ACA_ ") and all material filings, disclosures and
notices required by applicable laws, including ERISA, the Code, HIPAA and ACA,
have been timely made or any interest, fines, penalties or other impositions
for late filings have been paid in full, if due. Neither the Company nor any

 



-17-  Company Subsidiary has engaged in a transaction, or omitted to take action,
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to
subject the Company to a material unpaid Tax or penalty imposed by either
Chapter 43 of the Code or Sections 409 or 502 of ERISA. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action to take corrective action or
make a filing under any voluntary correction program of the IRS, Department
of Labor or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Knowledge of
any plan defect that would qualify for correction under any such program. 

(d) Section 3.11(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedules identifies each
Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code (each, a " _Company Qualified Plan_ "). The IRS has issued a
favorable determination letter or advisory opinion with respect to each
Company Qualified Plan and the related trust, which letter has not
been revoked (nor has revocation been threatened) or such Company Qualified
Plan is a volume submitter or prototype plan covered by an IRS advisory or
opinion letter affording reliance equivalent to a determination letter, and,
to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no existing circumstances and no
events have occurred or are reasonably expected to occur that could adversely
affect the qualified status of any Company Qualified Plan or the related trust
or the reliance by the Company on any such IRS advisory or opinion letter or
increase the costs relating thereto. Section 3.11(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedules identifies each trust funding any Company Benefit Plan and whether
that purports to be a voluntary employee benefit association (each, a "
_VEBA_ ""). Each such VEBA has received an exemption letter from the IRS that
the form of such VEBA satisfies the requirements of Code Section 501(c)(9),
which letter has not been revoked (nor has revocation been threatened), and,
to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no existing circumstances and no
events have occurred or are reasonably expected to occur that could adversely
affect the continued exemption of such VEBA or increase the costs relating
thereto.

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) and any award
thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, has (i)
since January 1, 2005, been maintained and operated, in all material respects,
in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and IRS Notice 2005-1
and (ii) since January 1, 2009, been, in all material respects, in documentary
and operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code. All Company Options
have been granted with a per share exercise price or reference price at least
equal to the fair market value (as defined pursuant to Section 409A of the
Code) of the underlying Company Common Stock on the date of grant.

 

(f) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor any Company ERISA
Affiliate has sponsored, maintained or contributed to or been obligated to
contribute to (i) any plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA
or Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code, (ii) any plan that is a
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "
_Multiemployer Plan_ ") or (iii) any plan that has two (2) or more
contributing sponsors at least two (2) of whom are not under common control,
within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer Plan_ "),
and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor any Company ERISA
Affiliate has incurred any liability to a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple
Employer Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal (as those terms
are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) from a Multiemployer
Plan or Multiple Employer Plan.

 



-18- (g) Except as provided in Company Disclosure Schedule 3.11(g), neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, has sponsored or has any
obligation with respect to, any employee benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement that provides for any post-employment or post-retirement health,
medical, disability or life insurance benefits for retired, former or current
employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except as required by
Section 4980B of the Code. There has been no communication to employees by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to
promise or guarantee such employees retiree health, life or disability
insurance, or any retiree death benefits.

(h) All contributions required to be made to any Company Benefit Plan by
applicable law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and
all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any
Company Benefit Plan, for any period through the date hereof, have been
timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid
on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the books and
records of the Company, including the Companys financial statements, as
applicable, to the extent required by GAAP.

(i) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, and, to the Companys
Knowledge, no set of circumstances exists that may reasonably give rise to a
claim or lawsuit, against the Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof
with respect to their duties to the Company Benefit Plans or the assets of any
of the trusts under any of the Company Benefit Plans that could reasonably be
expected to result in any material liability of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the " _PBGC_ "), the
IRS, the Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple Employer
Plan, any participant in a Company Benefit Plan, or any other party.

(j) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor any Company ERISA
Affiliate nor any other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any
"prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section
406 of ERISA), which could subject any of the Company Benefit Plans or their
related trusts, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any Company ERISA
Affiliate or any person that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has an
obligation to indemnify, to any material Tax or penalty imposed under Section
4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

(k) Except as disclosed in Company Disclosure Schedule 3.11(k), neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with any
other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery of, or
increase the amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit to any
employee, officer, director or other service provider of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the right of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of
assets from any Company Benefit Plan or related trust, except as provided in
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount
paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits)
by 

 



-19-  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such
transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains or contributes to a rabbi trust
or similar funding vehicle, and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not cause or require the Company or any of its Affiliates to
establish or make any contribution to a rabbi trust or similar funding
vehicle.

 

(l) No Company Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of
Taxes under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code, or otherwise. Company
Disclosure Schedule 3.11(l) sets forth true, correct and complete copies of
Section 280G calculations (whether or not final) with respect to any
disqualified individual in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, and has also made available a schedule of all termination benefits
that would be payable to the individuals identified thereon, under all
employment, change in control agreements, severance arrangements or policies,
supplemental executive retirement plans, deferred bonus plans, deferred
compensation plans, salary contribution plans or any other material non-
qualified compensation arrangement maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for the benefit of officers, employee or directors of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, assuming their employment or service
is involuntarily terminated without cause on July 1, 2017, and the Closing
Date occurs on such date and based on other assumptions specified in the
schedule.

 

(m) There are no pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened material
labor grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or charges against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other material labor
disputes against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries are party to or bound by any
collective bargaining or similar agreement with any labor organization, or
work rules or practices agreed to with any labor organization or employee
association applicable to employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no organizing efforts by any
union or other group seeking to represent any employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries have complied, in all
material respects, with all laws regarding employment and employment
practices (including anti-discrimination) and terms and conditions of
employment and wages and hours (including classification of employees and
equitable pay practices), and no claims relating to non-compliance with
the foregoing are pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened.

(n) The Company (or its Subsidiaries, as applicable) has obtained a written
consent for each employee on whose behalf bank-owned life insurance (" _BOLI_
") has been purchased to the extent required by Section 101(j) of the Code.

 

3.12 _SEC Reports_. The Company has previously made available to Parent an
accurate and complete copy of each (a) registration statement, prospectus,
report, schedule and proxy statement filed with or furnished to the SEC since

amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), or the Exchange Act (the " _Company
Reports_ ") and (b) communication mailed by the Company to its shareholders
since December 31, 2013, and prior to the date hereof, and no such Company
Report or communication, as of the date thereof (and, in the case of
registration statements and

 



-20-  proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the
relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed or
furnished as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be
deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. Since December 31, 2013,
as of their respective dates, all Company Reports filed under the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act complied in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. No executive
officer of the Company has failed in any respect to make the certifications
required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As
of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from or
unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Company
Reports.

 

3.13 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries hold, and have at all times since January 1, 2013, held, all
licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses and ownership of their respective
properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all
fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where
neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such
license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees
or assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and to the
Knowledge of the Company, no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary
license, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. The Company and
each of its Subsidiaries have complied with and are not in default or
violation under any applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy
and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, all laws related to data

the origination, sale and servicing of mortgage and consumer loans, except for
noncompliance, defaults or violations that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. Company Bank has a Community Reinvestment Act rating of
"satisfactory" or better. Without limitation, none of the Company, or any of
its Subsidiaries, or to the Knowledge of the Company, any director, officer,
employee, agent or other person acting on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has, directly or indirectly, (i) used any funds of the Company or

transactions contemplated hereby (including the Bank Merger), the failure of
which to make or obtain would have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or the
Surviving Corporation. As of the date hereof, Parent is not aware of any
reason why the necessary regulatory approvals and consents will not be
received to permit consummation of the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on a timely basis.

any state, any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all

(a) The financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included (or

notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations,
cash flows, changes in shareholders equity and consolidated financial

SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv)
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the

the notes thereto. The books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have
been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with
GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect
only actual transactions. Since December 31, 2013, no independent public
accounting firm of Parent has resigned (or informed Parent that it intends to
resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of Parent as a
result of or in connection with any disagreements with Parent on a matter
of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or
auditing scope or procedure.

 



-34- (b) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether
due or to become due), except for liabilities (i) that are reflected or
reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Parent included in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016
(including any notes thereto), (ii) incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2016, or (iii) incurred
in connection with or expressly contemplated by this Agreement, in each case,
which would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent (x) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by others within
those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Parents outside
auditors and the audit committee of Parents Board of Directors (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information,
and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in Parents internal controls over
financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to
Parents auditors and audit committee. There is no reason to believe that
Parents outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial
officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

(d) Since January 1, 2013, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,

assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with
respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting
or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach
of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Parent or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Parent or any
committee thereof or to the Knowledge of Parent, to any director or officer of
Parent.

timely filed (including all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns

Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return (other than
extensions to file Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary course). All material
Taxes of Parent and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any
Tax Returns) that are due have been fully and timely paid. Each of Parent and
its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have
been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, creditor, shareholder, independent contractor or other third party.

assessment in connection with any material amount of Taxes, and there are no

letter ruling requests, closing agreements or gain recognition agreements with
respect to Taxes requested or executed in the last six (6) years.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any
Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement (other
than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among Parent and
its Subsidiaries). Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a
member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return
(other than a group the common parent of which was Parent) or (B) has any
liability for the Taxes of any person (other than Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract or otherwise. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has been,
within the past two (2) years or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of
related transactions)" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of

accurate and complete copy of each (a) registration statement, prospectus,

be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that

respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto. No executive officer of Parent has failed in any respect to make the
certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect
to any of the Parent Reports.

4.12 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
hold, and have at all times since January 1, 2013, held, all licenses,
franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses and ownership of their respective properties,
rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have

 



-37-  paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith),
except where neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and
holding such license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to

individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, and to
the Knowledge of Parent, no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary
license, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. Parent and each of

4.15 _Employees_.

 

(a) Section 4.15(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedules sets forth a true and
correct list of each material Parent Benefit Plan. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Parent Benefit Plan_ " means each employee benefit plan (as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), whether or not subject to ERISA, and each
bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, equity or equity-
based, incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance,
welfare benefit plans (including vacation and paid time off policies and other
material benefit policies and procedures), supplemental retirement, severance
or other benefit plan, program or arrangement, and each retention, bonus,
employment, change in control, termination, severance plan, program

 



-39-  or arrangement (i) to or with respect to which Parent or any Subsidiary or
any trade or business of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
incorporated, all of which together with Parent would be deemed a "single
employer" within the meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA (a " _Parent ERISA
Affiliate_ " ), is a party or has or, would reasonably be expected to have,
any current or future obligation or (ii) that is maintained, contributed to
or sponsored, or is required to be contributed to, by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Parent ERISA Affiliate for the benefit of any current or
former employee, officer, director or independent contractor of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or any Parent ERISA Affiliate.

(b) Parent has heretofore made available to the Company a true and complete
copy of each material Parent Benefit Plan and, with respect to each such
Parent Benefit Plan, the following related documents: (i) all summary plan
descriptions, amendments, modifications or material supplements, (ii)
the most recent annual report (Form 5500), if any, filed with the IRS, (iii)
the most recently received IRS determination letter, if any, and (iv) the most

in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of
all applicable laws, including ERISA, the Code, HIPAA and ACA and all material
filings, disclosures and notices required by applicable laws, including ERISA,
the Code, HIPAA and ACA, have been timely made or any interest,
fines, penalties or other impositions for late filings have been paid in
full, if due. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has engaged in a
transaction, or omitted to take action, with respect to any Parent Benefit
Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject the Company to a material
unpaid tax or penalty imposed by either Chapter 43 of the Code or Sections 409

determination letter with respect to each Parent Qualified Plan and the
related trust, which letter has not been revoked (nor has revocation been
threatened) or such Parent Qualified Plan is a volume submitter or prototype
plan covered by an IRS advisory or opinion letter affording reliance
equivalent to a determination letter, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, there
are no existing circumstances and no events have occurred or are reasonably
expected to occur that could adversely affect the qualified status of any
Parent Qualified Plan or the related trust or increase the costs relating
thereto. Section 4.15(d) of the Parent Disclosure Schedules identifies each
trust funding any Parent Benefit Plan and whether that purports to be a VEBA.
Each such VEBA has received an exemption letter from the IRS that the form
of such VEBA satisfies the requirements of Code Section 501(c)(9), which

Subsidiaries are party to or bound by any collective bargaining or similar
agreement with any labor organization, or work rules or practices agreed to
with any labor organization or employee association applicable to employees of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge of Parent, there are
no organizing efforts by any union or other group seeking to represent any

private environmental investigations or remediation activities or governmental
investigations of any nature pending or threatened against Parent seeking to
impose, or that could reasonably be expected to result in the imposition, on
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any liability or obligation arising under
any Environmental Law, which liability or obligation would reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent. To the Knowledge of Parent, there is no reasonable basis for
any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation that would
impose any liability or obligation that would reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
Parent is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter
agreement or memorandum of agreement by or with any court,
Governmental Entity, regulatory agency or third party imposing any liability

Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall
act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that
they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and each party will keep the other apprised of
the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
herein. The parties hereto agree to furnish to the other a final copy of each
filing made with a Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, subject to applicable laws governing the
confidentiality of such information. Each party shall consult with the other
in advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other party and/or its
counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences.

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of,
or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
would restrain, prevent or materially delay the Closing, and (ii) avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment so as to enable the Closing to occur as
soon as possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture or disposition of businesses or assets of Parent, the
Company and their respective Subsidiaries.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, under no circumstances shall Parent be required, and the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be permitted (without Parents written
consent), to (i) take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to
any condition, restriction, prohibition, limitation or requirement in
connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of Governmental Entities that would prohibit or materially
limit the ownership or operation of the business or assets of the Company,
materially limit the business conducted by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or
compel any of them to dispose of or hold separate any material portion of
the business or assets of the Company or would reasonably be expected to have
a material and adverse effect on Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their
respective

 



-51-  Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (measured on a scale relative to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), or the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, in each case after giving effect to the Merger (a "
_Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ") or (ii) agree to any Loss
Share Agreement Condition; _provided_ that _,_ if requested by Parent, then
the Company and its Subsidiaries will take or commit to take any such action,
or agree to any such condition or restriction, prohibition, limitation or
requirement, so long as such action, commitment, agreement, condition or
restriction is binding on the Company and its Subsidiaries only in the event
the Closing occurs.

(e) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, promptly furnish each other
with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4
or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the Bank Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(f) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained, or will be obtained
subject to a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition, or that the receipt
of any such approval will be materially delayed.

6.2 _Access to Information_.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of Parent and
the Company, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties
of the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated
by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
advisors and other representatives of the other party, access, during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel, information technology
systems, and records, and each shall cooperate with the other party in
preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of
systems and business operations generally, and, during such period, each of
Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to,
make available to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or
state banking laws (other than reports or documents which Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, is not permitted to disclose under applicable
law), and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as such party may reasonably request. Neither Parent nor the Company
nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access
to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate
or prejudice the rights of Parents or the Companys, as the case may be,
customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in
possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to
the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement
between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply.

 



-52- (b) Each of Parent and the Company shall hold all information furnished by or
on behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated March 18, 2016, between Parent and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

(d) The Company and Parent shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and plan
for the conversion of the Companys data processing and related electronic
informational systems to those used by Parent, which planning shall include,
but not be limited to, discussion of the possible termination by the Company
of third-party service provider arrangements effective at the Effective Time
or at a date thereafter, non-renewal of personal property leases and software
licenses used by the Company in connection with its systems operations,
retention of outside consultants and additional employees to assist with the
conversion, and outsourcing, as appropriate, of proprietary or self-provided
system services, it being understood that the Company shall not be obligated
to take any such action prior to the Effective Time, that any such action
taken will be at no cost to the Company, that any such actions taken by
employees of the Company shall not unreasonably interfere with the job
performance of such employees and, unless the Company otherwise agrees, no
conversion shall take place prior to the Effective Time.

6.3 _Shareholder Approvals_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall call a meeting of its shareholders
(the " _Parent Meeting_ " and the " _Company Meeting_ ," respectively) to be
held as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective,
for the purpose of obtaining, in the case of the Company, the Requisite
Company Vote and, in the case of the Parent, the Requisite Parent Vote and
Requisite Amendment Vote, and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other
matters of the type customarily brought before a meeting of shareholders to
approve a merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, and
each shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meetings to occur on
the same date. Each of Parent and the Company and its respective Board of
Directors shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the
shareholders of Parent and the Company, as the case may be, the Requisite
Parent Vote and Requisite Amendment Vote, in the case of Parent, and the
Requisite Company Vote, in the case of the Company, including (except as
provided in Section 6.3(b)) by communicating to its respective shareholders
its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement) that they consider and approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (in the case of the Company, the 

 



-53-  " _Company Board Recommendation_ " and in the case of Parent, the " _Parent
Board Recommendation_ "), and, except as provided in Section 6.3(b), shall
not (i) withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to the other party or
make any public statement inconsistent with the Company Board Recommendation,
in the case of the Company, or the Parent Board Recommendation, in the case of
Parent, (ii) fail to make the Company Board Recommendation, in the case of
the Company, or the Parent Board Recommendation, in the case of Parent, in the
Joint Proxy Statement, (iii) fail to publicly, definitively and without
qualification reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation, in the case of the
Company, or the Parent Board Recommendation, in the case of Parent, within
three (3) business days after the other partys written request (or such fewer
number of days as remains prior to the Company Meeting or the Parent Meeting,
as applicable) or (iv) with respect to the Company and the Company Board of
Directors, adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an Acquisition Proposal or
fail to publicly, definitively and without qualification issue a press
release recommending against an Acquisition Proposal, within ten (10) business
days after an Acquisition Proposal is made public (or such fewer number of
days as remains prior to the Company Meeting), or publicly propose to do any
of the foregoing (each of the actions in clauses (i)(iii), with respect to
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, and clause (iv), with respect to
the Company, a " _Recommendation Change_ ").

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to and in compliance with Section
6.12, prior to receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, in the case of the
Company, or the Requisite Parent Vote, in the case of Parent, the Board of
Directors of the Company or Parent, after consultation with its outside
counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor,
determines in good faith that it would more likely than not result in a
violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to make the
Company Board Recommendation or the Parent Board Recommendation, as the case
may be, to its shareholders (and, in the event such determination is made by
the Board of Directors of the Company in response to an Acquisition Proposal,
the Board of Directors of the Company has taken into account the expected
timing of and regulatory conditions related to such Acquisition Proposal),
the Company or Parent and its respective Board of Directors, as the case may
be, may submit this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to its
respective shareholders without recommendation or otherwise effect
a Recommendation Change (although the resolutions adopting this Agreement as
of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the
Company or Parent and its respective Board of Directors, as the case may be,
may communicate the basis for its Recommendation Change to its shareholders
in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto
to the extent required by law; _provided_ , that neither party nor its Board
of Directors may take any actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives the
other party at least five (5) business days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or
circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action
(including, in the event such action is taken by the Company or its Board of
Directors in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms
and conditions and the identity of the third party in any such
Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, including
unredacted copies of any such Acquisition Proposal or other materials received
in connection with or correspondence relating to, such Acquisition Proposal,
or any amendment or modification thereof, (ii) during such notice period the
Company or Parent and its Board of Directors, as the case may be, and its
Representatives negotiate in good faith

 



-54-  with the other party and its Representatives any amendment or modification
to this Agreement proposed by such other party and (iii) at the end of such
notice period, the Board of Directors takes into account any amendment or
modification to this Agreement proposed in writing by the other party prior to
the expiration of such notice period, and after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless continue to be
more likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law to continue to make the Company Board Recommendation or
Parent Board Recommendation, as the case may be. Any change to the financial
or other material terms of any Acquisition Proposal, or any material change to
the event or circumstances giving rise to the applicable Board of Directors
determination to effect a Recommendation Change during a notice period, will
be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal or a new such event or
circumstance, as applicable, for purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require
a new notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3, except that the
notice period shall be three (3) business days.

(c) Parent or the Company shall adjourn or postpone the Parent Meeting or the
Company Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time for which such meeting
is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock
and Parent Class B Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as the case may be,
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting the
Company or Parent, as applicable, has not received proxies representing
a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Company Vote,
in the case of the Company, or the Requisite Parent Vote or Requisite
Amendment Vote, in the case of Parent; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall
prevent Parent or the Company from adjourning or postponing the Parent
Meeting or the Company Meeting, as the case may be, to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure which the Board of Directors of Parent or the Company has
determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is necessary
under applicable law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by such shareholders prior to the Parent Meeting
or the Company Meeting, as the case may be.

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1
and Section 6.3, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all
legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to
obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by,
any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is advisable or
required to be obtained by the Company or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall file with the NASDAQ a notification
form for the listing of all shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered as
Merger Consideration prior to the Effective Time.

 



-55- 6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary thereof (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or
cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
continues to be employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries)
immediately following the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Continuing
Employees_ "), while employed by Parent and its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time, with compensation and employee benefits that
are substantially comparable to the compensation and employee benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any cash incentive compensation payable or
earned in the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs shall be pro-
rated to reflect the short year. Each Continuing Employee whose employment is
involuntarily terminated by Parent or its Subsidiary during the Continuation
Period for the reasons listed in the Companys Severance Policy set forth in
Section 6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules) and who is not subject to
an employment, change in control or other agreement that provides for the
payment of severance, shall be entitled to receive severance payments and
benefits determined in accordance with the Companys Severance Policy as in
effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
Continuing Employee enters into a written release of claims against Parent in
a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent. Nothing contained in this Section
6.6 shall be construed to limit or terminate the rights of employees, officers
or directors of the Company under individual agreements with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries in which the
Continuing Employees are eligible to participate following the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Parent Plans_ ") to recognize the service of each
Continuing Employee with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor
thereto) prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
level of benefits (for purposes of vacation, paid time off and sick leave
policies) under such Parent Plans; _provided_ that such recognition of service
shall not (i) apply for purposes of any Parent Plan that is a defined benefit
retirement plan or any Parent Plan that provides retiree welfare benefits,
(ii) operate to duplicate any benefits of a Continuing Employee with respect
to the same period of service, (iii) apply for purposes of any plan, program
or arrangement (x) under which similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or (y) that is
grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or
participation or (iv) entitle a Continuing Employee to be credited with more
than one hundred twenty (120) hours of vacation, paid time off and sick leave
(collectively, " _PTO_ ") on the Closing Date and to rollover more than eighty
(80) hours of PTO from one calendar year to a subsequent calendar year. With
respect to any Parent Plan that provides medical, dental or vision insurance
benefits, for the plan year in which such Continuing Employee is first
eligible to participate, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
(A) cause any preexisting condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods
under such plan to be waived with respect to such Continuing Employee to the
extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the
Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (B) credit each Continuing Employee
for any co-payments or deductibles incurred by such Continuing Employee in
such plan year for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-
pocket expense requirements under any such Parent Plan, and (C) cause such
credited expenses to also count toward any annual or lifetime limits,
treatment or visit limits or similar limitations that apply under the terms
of the applicable plan.

 



-56- (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving
Corporation, the Company, or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving
Corporation, Company, Parent or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof to
discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or
consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates at any time
for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except as provided in
written agreements with such employees, directors, or consultants. Nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company
Benefit Plan, Parent Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan, Parent Plan or any other
benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the
Effective Time except as provided in Section 6.6(a) and (b) above. Without
limiting the generality of the final sentence of Section 9.11, nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
person other than the parties hereto, including without limitation any current
or former employee, officer, director or consultant of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

(d) Effective as of the day preceding the Effective Time, and subject to the
occurrence of the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt such resolutions
and/or amendments to cause the Company 401(k) Plan to be terminated (the "
_Plan Termination Date_ ") and the accounts of all participants and
beneficiaries in the Company 401(k) Plan as of the Plan Termination Date to
become fully vested as of the Plan Termination Date. The Company shall provide
Parent with a copy of the resolutions and/or plan amendments evidencing that
the Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated in accordance with its terms. The
form and substance of such resolutions and any necessary amendments shall be
subject to the review and approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The Company shall deliver to Parent an executed copy of such
resolutions and any necessary amendments as soon as practicable following
their adoption by the Board of Directors of the Company and shall fully comply
with such resolutions and any necessary amendments. The Surviving Corporation
shall take all other actions necessary to complete the termination of the
Company 401(k) Plan, including filing a Final Form 5500 that arise after the
Effective Time. Parent agrees, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to
permit 401(k) Plan participants who become Continuing Employees to roll over
their account balances in the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.6(d) to the contrary, employees of
the Company who continue employment with the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time shall be eligible as of the Effective Time to
participate in the Parent 401(k) Plan; it being agreed that there shall be no
gap in participation in a 401(k) Plan.

(e) The Company shall obtain from each of the individuals named in Section
6.6(e) of the Parent Disclosure Schedules an agreement, as of the date and in
the form set forth in Section 6.6(e) of the Parent Disclosure Schedules,
stipulating the estimated amount that each such individual is to receive as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any employment
agreement or change in control agreement, as applicable, (the aggregate
amounts of such payments to be specified in Parent Disclosure Schedule
6.6(e)). 

 



-57- (f) For a period of six (6) months following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries whose employment
was terminated other than for cause, disability or retirement at or following
the Effective Time, and who so desires, job counseling and outplacement
assistance services, in which it shall assist such employees in locating new
employment and shall notify all such employees who want to be so notified of
opportunities for positions with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for which
Parent reasonably believes such persons are qualified and shall consider any
application for such positions submitted by such persons, provided, however,
that any decision to offer employment to any such person shall be made in the
sole discretion of Parent, provided, further that the total costs expended
for such job counseling and outplacement assistance services shall not exceed
$150,000 in the aggregate.

(g) Parent shall establish a retention bonus pool in an amount as provided in
Parent Disclosure Schedule 6.6(g) for employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries jointly designated in writing by Parent and the Company (other
than employees of the Company who are subject to employment contracts or
other contracts providing for severance) to help retain key employees. The
amount and payment date of the retention bonus for each such employee shall be
jointly determined in writing by Parent and the Company, but in the aggregate
shall equal the amount provided in Parent Disclosure Schedule 6.6(g) assuming
all such key employees remain with the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or
an Affiliate to such date or are involuntarily terminated without cause prior
to that date.

(h) The Company shall take all such actions as Parent may reasonably request
to fully and timely comply with any and all requirements of both federal
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (" _WARN Act_ "")
and any state-specific WARN Act statutes, including providing notices to the
Company and Company Banks employees. 

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless,
to the extent such persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Company Articles, the
Company Bylaws or comparable governing documents or any indemnification
agreement in effect as of the date hereof (and shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the extent provided under the Company Articles, Company Bylaws or
comparable governing documents any such indemnification agreements as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement), each present and former director
and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, in such
capacity) (collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, amounts paid in settlement, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising out of the fact
that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries

 



-58-  and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the enforcement of the Surviving Corporations obligations under this Section
6.7; _provided_ , that the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification under applicable law.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company (
_provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or
events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_
, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be obligated to expend, in
the aggregate, an amount in excess of 250% of the current annual premium paid
as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_
"), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the
Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained
policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporations good faith
determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium not
exceeding the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company, in
consultation with, but only upon the consent of Parent (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), may (and at the request of
Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or
prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under the Companys
existing directors and officers liability insurance policy providing
equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence, if and to the
extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate,
does not exceed the Premium Cap.

(c) In the event that, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or
any of its respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and other assets to any person, then, and in each case, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause proper provision to be made so that such
successors and assigns shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.7.

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs
and representatives, each of whom is expressly made a third-party beneficiary
of this Section 6.7, and are in addition to, and are not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may
have from Parent, Parent Bank, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any other person by contract or otherwise. The
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.7 shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights
of any Company Indemnified Party unless (x) such termination or modification
is required by applicable law (in which case such termination or modification
shall only be permitted to the extent required by such law) or (y) the
affected Company Indemnified Party has consented in writing to such
termination or modification.

 



-59- 6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including, any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one
hand, and a Subsidiary of the Company, on the other) or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals,
immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper
officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective
Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably
requested by Parent. Effective as of and subject to the occurrence of the
Effective Time, Parent hereby expressly assumes the due and punctual
performance and observance of each and every covenant and condition in the
contracts set forth on Section 6.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedules to be
performed and observed by the Company.

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Parent and the Company shall each promptly advise
the other party of any fact, effect, change, event, circumstance, condition,
occurrence or development that (i) has had or is reasonably likely, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or
(ii) would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material
breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein
or that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the
aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article VII; provided, that any
failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any
breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.9 or
the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied,
or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to
give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach
would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied; and provided, further, that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.9 shall not cure any breach of, or
noncompliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or limit the
remedies available to the party receiving such notice.

6.10 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of
any shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or
officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall
give Parent an opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
such litigation. The Company shall give Parent the right to consult on the
defense and settlement with respect to such litigation, and the Company will
in good faith take any comments of Parent into account, and no such
settlement that provides for a monetary payment to the shareholders and not

6.12 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.12, the Company agrees
that it will not, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers, directors and employees, and will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their respective agents, advisors, financing sources,
investment bankers, attorneys and other representatives (collectively
with officers, directors and employees, " _Representatives_ "), not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals regarding, or the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any person concerning any Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
disclose or provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or
otherwise cooperate in any way with, any person in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal (including by affording access to the personnel,
properties, books, records or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries) or
(iv) unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms,
enter into any term sheet, letter of intent, commitment, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, or other agreement (whether written or oral, binding or
nonbinding) (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to and entered
into in accordance with this Section 6.12(a)) relating to any Acquisition
Proposal ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing shall not prevent the
Company or its Representatives from contacting any person who has made an
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry or proposal relating thereto solely for the
purpose of seeking clarification of the terms and conditions thereof).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company
Vote, in the event the Company receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries Representatives to, (x) furnish or cause to be furnished
confidential or nonpublic information or data to, (y) participate in
negotiations or discussions with and (z) afford access to its and
their personnel, properties, books, records and assets to the person making
the Acquisition Proposal (and such persons Representatives) if and only if
its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after consultation with its
outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors) that failure to take such actions would be more likely than not to
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_
, _further_ , that prior to providing any confidential or nonpublic
information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso
affording such access or participating in such negotiations or discussions,
the Company shall have given Parent at least twenty-four (24) hours prior
written notice and shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with
such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality
Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with
any exclusive right to negotiate with the Company. The Company will, and will
cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of
this Agreement with any person other than Parent with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and will request pursuant to any applicable

 



-61-  confidentiality agreements the return or destruction of any information
provided to any such person in connection therewith. The Company will promptly
(and within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent following receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the terms and
conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or
Acquisition Proposal) and will provide Parent an unredacted copy of such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and any draft agreements, proposals or other
materials received in connection with such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal,
and will keep Parent apprised of any related material developments,
discussions and negotiations on a reasonably current basis, including any
amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition
Proposal (including providing an unredacted copy of such amended or revised
Acquisition Proposal and any further or revised draft agreements, proposals or
other materials received in connection with such inquiry or Acquisition
Proposal). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any
existing confidentiality agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party in accordance with the terms hereof. As used in this Agreement, "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third
party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or
indirect, of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or fifteen percent (15%) or more of any class of
equity or voting securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute fifteen percent (15%) or more of
the consolidated assets of the Company, (ii) any tender offer (including a
self-tender offer), exchange offer or other acquisition of equity or voting
securities that, if consummated, would result in such third
party beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or more of any class of
equity or voting securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute fifteen percent (15%) or more of
the consolidated assets of the Company or (iii) a merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company or
its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company.

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its
Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or making any other
disclosure to the Companys shareholders that the Company or its Board of
Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would be more likely than
not to result in a violation of applicable law; _provided_ , that such rules
or other Law will in no way eliminate or modify the effect or consequences
that any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this
Agreement, and any public disclosure or statement by the Company or its Board
of Directors in connection with an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
a Recommendation Change unless the Company and its Board of Directors
definitively and without qualification reaffirm the Company
Board Recommendation and recommend against such Acquisition Proposal in such
disclosure or statement.

6.13 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto agree that the initial press
release with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be
a release mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, each of
the parties agrees that no public release or announcement or statement
concerning this Agreement or the transactions

 



-62-  contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written
consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as required by applicable law or the rules or
regulations of any applicable Governmental Entity or stock exchange to which
the relevant party is subject, in which case the party required to make the
release or announcement shall consult with the other party about, and allow
the other party reasonable time to comment on, such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance.

 

6.14 _Change of Method_. Parent shall be empowered, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, to change the method or structure of effecting the
combination of the Company and Parent, if and to the extent reasonably
requested by Parent, and the Company agrees to enter into such amendments to
this Agreement as Parent may reasonably request to give effect to such
restructuring;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change or amendment
shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration or
payment to or treatment of any Company Equity Awards provided for in this
Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect
to the shareholders of the Company or of Parent pursuant to this Agreement,
(iii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to the
Company or Parent pursuant to this Agreement or (iv) impede or materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals, the Requisite Company Vote,
the Requisite Parent Vote or the Requisite Amendment Vote.

6.15 _Takeover Statutes_. None of the Company, Parent or their respective
Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover
Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary steps to
exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or
hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be,
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and
their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or
applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

 

6.16 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. The Company and Parent
agree that, to most effectively compensate and retain those officers and
directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _Company Insiders_ "), both prior to and
after the Effective Time, it is desirable that the Company Insiders not be
subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion
of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards in the Merger,
and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of
this Section 6.16. The Company shall deliver to Parent in a reasonably timely
fashion prior to the Effective Time accurate information regarding the
Company Insiders, and the Board of Directors of Parent and of the Company, or
a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly
thereafter, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps
as may be required to cause (in the case of Company) any dispositions

 



-63-  of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards by the Company Insiders,
and (in the case of Parent) any acquisitions of Parent Common Stock by any
Company Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or
directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case, pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law.

 

6.17 _Termination of Securities Purchase Agreements_. The Company shall
negotiate with the parties to the Securities Purchase Agreements disclosed in
Company Disclosure Schedule 6.17 to terminate such Securities Purchase
Agreements at the Effective Time.

6.18  _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation
against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

8.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger abandoned
at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of
the Company Requisite Vote or Parent Requisite Vote:

 

(a) by mutual consent of Parent and the Company in a written instrument;

 

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if any Governmental Entity that must
grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or
the Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable order, injunction, decree, or other legal restraint or
prohibition permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal
the consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger, or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless the failure to obtain a
Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and
agreements of such party set forth herein;

 

(c) by either Parent or the Company, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the one-year anniversary of the date of
this Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "), unless the failure of the
Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking
to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements
of such party set forth herein; _provided_ , that, if all other conditions to
close have been satisfied or waived except as set forth in Section 7.1(c),
either Parent or the Company shall have the option, each in its sole
discretion, to extend the Termination Date for an additional six-month
period;

(d) by either Parent or the Company ( _provided_ , that the terminating party
is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of
the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or
any such representation or warranty shall cease to be

 



-67-  true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of
a termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by the
Company, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the
aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such
representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or
continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth
in Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Section 7.3, in
the case of a termination by the Company, and which is not cured within thirty
(30) days following written notice to the Company, in the case of a
termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by the
Company, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period (or
such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination Date);

 

(e) by the Company, if Parent or the Board of Directors of Parent shall have
(i) made a Recommendation Change, or (ii) breached its obligations under
Section 6.3 in any material respect;

(f) by Parent, if the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company
shall have (i) made a Recommendation Change, or (ii) breached its obligations
under Sections 6.3 or 6.12 in any material respect; or

 

(g) by either Parent or the Company if (i) the Requisite Parent Vote and the
Requisite Amendment Vote are not obtained at the Parent Meeting or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof or (ii) the Requisite Company Vote is not
obtained at the Company Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof.

 

(h) by the Company at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote
to enter into an agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, but only
if (i) the Companys Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters,
its financial advisors) that failure to take such action would be more likely
than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable
law, and (ii) the Company has not materially breached its obligations under
Section 6.12.

 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the
Company as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, and none of Parent, the Company, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them
shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Sections 6.2(b)
(Access to Information (Confidentiality)), Section 8.1 (Termination), this
Section 8.2 (Effect of Termination) and Article IX (General Provisions) shall
survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Company
shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of
its willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

(b) In the event that, after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, (i) a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal shall
have been communicated to or otherwise made known to the Board of Directors or
senior management of

 



-68-  the Company or has been made directly to the shareholders of the Company, or
any person shall have publicly announced an Acquisition Proposal with respect
to the Company, (ii) thereafter this Agreement is terminated (A) by either
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c) (but only if (x) such
Acquisition Proposal was made directly to the shareholders of the Company or
otherwise publicly announced prior to the Company Meeting and (y) the Company
shall have failed to obtain the Requisite Company Vote at the duly convened
Company Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof at which a vote on
the approval of this Agreement was taken), (B) by Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(d) or (C) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(g)(ii), and
(iii) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a
transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same
Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then the Company shall, on
the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement or the date
of consummation of such transaction, as applicable, pay Parent, by wire
transfer of same-day funds, a fee equal to 3.75% of aggregate merger
consideration, or $22,097,579 (the " _Termination Fee_ ");  _provided_ , that
for purposes of this Section 8.2(b), all references in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal to "fifteen percent (15%)" shall instead refer to "fifty
percent (50%)."

 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(f) or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(h), then the Company
shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee on
the date of termination.

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(e), then Parent shall pay the Company, by wire transfer of same
day funds, the Termination Fee on the date of termination.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages arising out of the other
partys willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement, in the
event that this Agreement is terminated as provided in Section 8.1, the
maximum aggregate amount of monetary fees, liabilities or damages payable by
a single party under this Agreement shall be equal to the Termination Fee, and
neither the Company nor Parent shall be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion.

 

(f) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent and the Company,
respectively, would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if either
party fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and,
in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which
results in a judgment against the non-paying party for the Termination Fee or
any portion thereof, such non-paying party shall pay the costs and
expenses of the other party (including attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit. In addition, if the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then
such party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts at a rate per annum
equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any
successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was required to
be made for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was
originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount
is actually paid in full.

contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the receipt of the

may not be, without further approval of the shareholders of the Company or

portion thereof that requires further approval under applicable law. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such

with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or
other entity of any kind or nature, (iii) an "Affiliate" of a specified person
is any person that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is

least one business day prior to the date hereof, (b) included in the virtual

filed by a party with the SEC and publicly available on EDGAR at least one
business day prior to the date hereof. The Company Disclosure Schedules and
the Parent Disclosure Schedules, as well as all other schedules and all
exhibits hereto, shall be deemed part of this Agreement and included in any
reference to this Agreement.

 

9.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart.

 

9.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the
instruments referred to herein) together with the Confidentiality Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement among the parties and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and
enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including all
matters of construction, validity and performance (but excluding all other
choice of law and conflicts of law rules), but excluding matters relating to
the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company which shall
be subject to the laws of the State of Oregon.

9.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AT THE
TIME OF INSTITUTION OF THE

 



-72-  APPLICABLE LITIGATION, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER,
(II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.10.

9.11 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other party. Any purported assignment in contravention
hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except as
otherwise specifically provided in Section 6.7, this Agreement (including the
documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon
any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder,
including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth
herein. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product
of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or
liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may
not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

9.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and, accordingly, that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof (including the parties obligation to consummate the
Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b)
any requirement under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

9.13 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such
that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 



-73- 9.14 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.
