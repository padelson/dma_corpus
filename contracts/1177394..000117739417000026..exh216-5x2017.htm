be responsible to pay, perform or discharge any liability, obligation or
commitments of any nature related to any assets owned by the Seller Entities

of: (i) at Closing, $130 million in cash (the "Closing Cash Payment"), (ii) at

share, representing 10.25% of Purchaser's common stock as of the date hereof,
after giving effect to such issuance and validly issued and outstanding, fully
paid, nonassessable, free and clear of all Encumbrances other than the
transfer and other restrictions set forth in the Investor Rights' Agreement
and pursuant to any State or federal securities Laws (the "Purchaser Common
Stock"), and (iii) if earned, the Earnout Amount calculated and payable in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.03 (the purchase price consisting
of the items listed in (i), (i), and (iii) above shall be hereinafter referred
to as the "Purchase Price", and the items listed in (i) and (ii) above shall
be hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Payment"). The Purchase Price shall
be allocated between the Shares as set forth in Section 2.02 of the Disclosure
Letter.

(b) Cash Election. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
Section 2.02(a)(ii), in the event that on the date that the last of the
conditions set forth in Section 6.01(a), Section 6.01(b), Section 6.02(k) and
Section 6.03(t) has been fulfilled or waived in writing (the "Closing Price
Notice Date"), the Average Purchaser Closing Price is greater than the Average
Purchaser Trading Price by 3.75% or more, the Purchaser may elect, by
providing irrevocable written notice thereof to the Seller Entities (the "Cash
Election"), to pay the entire Closing Payment in an amount of $630,000,000 in
cash, rather than paying a portion of it with the Purchaser Common Stock. The
Cash Election shall be delivered to the Seller Entities pursuant to the notice
provisions contained in Section 8.02 not later than the earlier of (x) three
(3) Business Days following the Closing Price Notice Date or (y) the Business
Day prior to the date that the Closing would otherwise be required to occur
pursuant to Section 2.04.

SECTION 2.03 Earnout Amount

(a) Earnout Amount. An earnout amount (the "Earnout Amount") shall be due and
payable after the Closing to the UK Parent Subsidiary as follows:

(i) If the aggregate Gross Profit, during the twelve-month period ending
February 28, 2018 (the "Earnout Period") is less than or equal to $202
million, the Earnout Amount shall be $0.

(ii) If the aggregate Gross Profit, during the Earnout Period exceeds $202
million, then the Earnout Amount shall equal the sum of (x) $5 multiplied by
the amount of Gross Profit of the US Parent Subsidiary and those Target
Subsidiaries in North America in excess of $122 million (the "North America
Earnout Amount") and (y) $5 multiplied by the amount of Gross Profit of the
Target Subsidiaries in Latin America in excess of $80 million (the "Latin
America Earnout Amount"); provided, however, that the

 aggregate Earnout Amount shall not exceed $200 million, and provided, further,
that the North America Earnout Amount shall not exceed $120 million and the
Latin America Earnout Amount shall not exceed $80 million.

(b) Determination of the Earnout Amount. The Earnout Amount shall be
calculated as follows:

(i) Not more than thirty (30) calendar days following the Closing Date, the
Seller Entities shall provide to the Purchaser, pro forma financial
information for the period starting on March 1, 2017 and ending on the Closing
Date (or if the Closing Date does not occur on the last day of a calendar
month, then ending on the last day of the previous calendar month), assuming
the Internal Reorganization had been complete on February 28, 2017. The Seller
Entities shall, upon request, make available to Purchaser all books and
records in their possession relating to the calculation of the Earnout Amount
for the portion of the Earnout Period occurring prior to the Closing Date.

(ii) No later than thirty (30) calendar days after the end of the each
calendar quarter following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall deliver to
the Seller Entities a written statement setting forth its determination of the
Gross Profit of the Target Subsidiaries for the previous quarter, setting
forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the Gross Profit, including an
itemization of all constituent elements of Gross Profit (each, a "Calculation
Statement").

(iii) No later than April 30, 2018, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller
Entities a written statement setting forth its determination of the Gross
Profit of the US Parent Subsidiary and the Target Subsidiaries for the Earnout
Period and the calculation of the Earnout Amount for the Earnout Period,
setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the Gross Profit,
including an itemization of all constituent elements of Gross Profit (the
"Combined Calculation Statement").

(iv) The Seller Entities may confirm, by written notice to the Purchaser, that
they agree with the calculation of the Gross Profit and Earnout Amount for the
Earnout Period contained in the Combined Calculation Statement (the "Approval
Notice").

(c) Audit; Dispute Resolution.

(i) For a period of thirty (30) calendar days after the receipt of the
Combined Calculation Statement, unless an Approval Notice has been delivered,
the Purchaser shall, upon request, make available during normal business hours
all books and records related to the Calculation Statement and executive
officers of the Purchaser and its Affiliates (or other personnel at the
discretion of the Purchaser), for review by the Seller Entities and their
accountants, subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(ii) In the event that the Seller Entities dispute the Purchaser's calculation
of the Gross Profit set forth in the Combined Calculation Statement, the
Seller Entities shall notify the Purchaser in writing (an "Earnout Dispute
Notice") within thirty (30) calendar days following the Seller Entities'
receipt of the Combined Calculation Statement of the amount, nature and basis
of such dispute. The Seller Entities and the Purchaser shall first endeavor to
resolve such dispute among themselves. If the Seller Entities and the

 Purchaser are unable to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) calendar days
following the receipt of an Earnout Dispute Notice, such dispute shall be
submitted to an independent certified public accountant (the "Independent
Accountants") with international offices mutually appointed by the Seller
Entities and the Purchaser, other than the Seller Entities' or their
Affiliates' accountants or the Purchaser's or its Affiliates' accountants.

(d) Fees of the Independent Accountants. The Seller Entities, on the one hand
and the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall split equally the fees of the
Independent Accountants; provided, however, that (i) in the event the
Independent Accountant's final determination of the Earnout Amount exceeds the
Earnout Amount alleged by Purchaser in Purchaser's Combined Calculation
Statement by more than 20% of the Earnout Amount set forth in such Combined
Calculation Statement, Purchaser shall pay 100% of the fees of the Independent
Accountants, and (ii) in the event the Independent Accountant's final
determination of the Earnout Amount is less than the amount of the Earnout
Amount alleged by the Seller Entities in Seller Entities' Earnout Dispute
Notice by more than 20% of the Earnout Amount set forth in such Earnout
Dispute Notice, the Seller Entities shall pay 100% of the fees of the
Independent Accountants, and (iii) in the event that neither or both (i) and
(ii) hereof are true, the Seller Entities, on the one hand, and the Purchaser,
on the other hand, shall split the fees equally.

(e) Determination by Independent Accountants. The Independent Accountants
shall make a determination as soon as practicable within thirty (30) calendar
days (or such other time as the Seller Entities, on the one hand, and the
Purchaser, on the other hand, shall agree in writing) after their engagement,
and their resolution of the applicable Earnout Dispute Notice shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Seller Entities and the Purchaser with respect
to any Calculation Statement or the Combined Calculation Statement, as
applicable. The Independent Accountants will investigate only those items
which are in dispute and will not assign a value to any item that is (i)
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Purchaser or
the Seller Entities, or (ii) lower than the lowest value for such item claimed
by either Purchaser or the Seller Entities. The Independent Accountants'
determination will be based only upon written submissions by Purchaser and the
Seller Entities, and not upon an independent review by the Independent
Accountants. Unless otherwise agreed, any meetings or proceedings deemed
necessary by the Independent Accountants in order to resolve the matters
referred to the Independent Accountants for determination will be conducted in
New York, New York.

(f) Payment of Earnout Payment. The Earnout Amount shall (i) be paid (x)
within five (5) Business Days of the Approval Notice, if applicable, or (y) if
there is an Earnout Dispute Notice, then within five (5) Business Days of the
final determination of the Combined Calculation Statement by the Independent
Accountants pursuant to clause (e) above; and (ii) be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to UK Parent Subsidiary. Any payments required
under this Section 2.03 not paid within five (5) Business Days of the Approval
Notice or final determination of the Independent Accountants shall bear
interest beginning on the day that is six (6) Business Days following the
Approval Notice or final determination of the Independent Accountants, at a
rate per annum equal to the prime lending rate in effect at such time as
published by Bank of America.

(g) Conduct during the Earnout Period. During that portion of the Earnout
Period that begins at Closing, Purchaser shall have complete control and sole
and absolute discretion with respect to decisions regarding the US Parent
Subsidiary and the Target Subsidiaries;

 provided, however, that Purchaser agrees (i) to act in good faith and (ii) not
to undertake, or fail to undertake, any action with the intent to impede the
ability of UK Parent Subsidiary to earn the Earnout Amount or the intent to
artificially decrease the Gross Profit to adversely affect the Earnout Amount
payable to UK Parent Subsidiary. During that portion of the Earnout Period
beginning on March 1, 2017 and ending on the Closing Date, the Seller Entities
shall not, and cause their Subsidiaries not to, take any action outside the
Ordinary Course or inconsistent with past practice with the intent to
artificially increase Gross Profit.

(h) Liquidated Damages. The parties hereby agree that in the event that
Purchaser breaches its obligations set forth in Section 2.03(g) hereof,
Purchaser shall pay $25,000,000 to UK Parent Subsidiary, as liquidated damages
and not as a penalty. Such liquidated damages shall not, however, serve as a
cap on damages for breach of Section 2.03(g), and UK Parent Subsidiary may
seek and collect any damages that are proven to exceed the amount of any such
liquidated damages received but in any event, not to exceed $200,000,000.

SECTION 2.04 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the sale and purchase of the Shares contemplated by this Agreement shall take
place at a closing (the "Closing") to be held at the offices of Pillsbury
Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, 2550 Hanover St., Palo Alto, California 94304 at
10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on the day that is two (2) Business Days following the
date on which the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto set
forth in Article VI are satisfied or waived (other than conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, and subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or at such other place or at such
other time or on such other date as the Seller Entities and the Purchaser may
mutually agree upon in writing (the day on which the Closing takes place being
the "Closing Date").

SECTION 2.05 Treatment of Outstanding Equity Award.

For purposes of this Section 2.05, the following definition shall apply:

"US Parent Subsidiary Equity Award Value" means, as to each Stock Appreciation
Right ("SAR") under the Westcon Group, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan as in effect
as of the date hereof (the "SAR Plan"), the Fair Market Value (as defined and
determined pursuant to the SAR Plan), taking into account, if applicable, the
Earnout Amount as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.03.

Vested SAR Awards; Long Term Incentive Plan Awards.

(a) On the Closing Date, 50% of each unvested SAR outstanding immediately
prior to the Closing shall vest (the "Acceleration"). The holder of each
vested SAR on the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Acceleration (each,
a "Vested SAR") shall be entitled to receive from its employer at such time
therefor an amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest whole cent), if any,
equal to the product of (i) (A) the Vested SARs exercisable immediately prior
to the Closing ("Outstanding SARs") multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of
the US Parent Subsidiary Equity Award Value over the Redemption Price thereof
(as defined in the applicable award agreement) of such Vested SAR immediately
prior to the Closing (the "Closing SARs Payout"). Any unvested SAR immediately
prior to the Closing which is not subject to Acceleration pursuant to the
terms of this Section 2.05(a) shall be terminated in its entirety.

 (b) On the Closing Date, the LTIP shall terminate and the Seller Entities
shall cause any performance criteria applicable to participants thereunder to
be waived (any payment due thereunder, a "Closing Incentive Payout", and
collectively with the Closing SARs Payout, the "Employees Closing Payout", and
a participant in the LTIP, a "Participant"); provided, that, the Purchaser
shall be responsible for the Employees Closing Payout (whether or not payable
to employees of US Parent Subsidiary or of the Target Subsidiaries) in an
aggregate amount not to exceed by more than $3,000,000 the accrual thereof
reflected in the US Financial Statements, which in no event shall be deducted
from the Purchase Price. An illustration of the Purchaser's payment
obligations at Closing, based on the assumptions described therein, is
attached hereto as Schedule 2.05.

(c) To the extent the holder of a Vested SAR remains in continuous employment
with (x) either the Purchaser, the US Parent Subsidiary or the Target
Subsidiaries or (y) the Seller Entities or any of their Subsidiaries, in each
case, through the applicable date of payment or has been terminated without
cause (as defined in the SAR Plan) by its employer after the Closing but prior
to such applicable date of payment, if and when the Earnout Amount is payable
in accordance with Section 2.03, such holder shall be paid an amount (the "SAR
Earnout Payment") equal to (1) the product of (A) such holder's Outstanding
SARs multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the US Parent Subsidiary Equity
Award Value including the value of the Earnout Amount over the Redemption
Price (as defined in the applicable award agreement) of such Vested SAR less
the Closing SARs Payout. Purchaser shall be responsible for payment of the SAR
Earnout Payment only in respect of Employees entitled to payment in respect of
Vested SARS, and the Seller Entities shall be responsible for payment of the
SAR Earnout Payment only in respect of employees entitled to payment in
respect of Vested SARS who are not Employees.

(d) As and when amounts become payable pursuant to this Section 2.05,
Purchaser shall cause such amounts to be delivered to (i) the US Parent
Subsidiary or any of the Target Subsidiaries or their payroll processing
providers with respect to any holder of Vested SARs or Participant who is an
Employee and (ii) to the Seller Entities or the applicable employer with
respect to any holder of Vested SARs or Participants who are employed by an
employer other than the US Parent Company or the Target Subsidiaries, to the
extent such holder or Participant remains in continuous employment through the

Plan; and (iii) no Action is pending or threatened in writing with respect to
any Plan (other than claims for benefits in the Ordinary Course) and no fact

Action. Neither the US Parent Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to
any material liability or penalty under Title I or IV of ERISA, which could
result in material liability to the Company, its Subsidiaries or the
Purchaser.

(d) Each U.S. Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code (i) either has a favorable IRS determination letter or has been
established pursuant to a preapproved prototype plan for which a favorable IRS
opinion letter has been obtained, and (ii) nothing has occurred since the

employee or former employee, officer, director, independent contractor or

become payable in connection with or as a result of the Transaction,
including, without limitation, with respect to the Vested SARs and any such
payments that result from actions taken by the Purchaser after the Closing

severance, termination or notice pay obligations under local applicable Law)
have been made available to the Purchaser as set forth in Section 3.14(e) of
the Disclosure Letter. Other than the Change in Control Payments and any
statutory severance, termination or notice pay obligations under local
applicable Law, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

under any Plan, (ii) entitle any individual to, or increase the amount of
compensation or benefits due to any individual under any Plan; (iii)
accelerate the vesting of any options, RSUs or other equity interests; or (iv)
limit or restrict the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to

 the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will result in
"excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code.

(f) Except to the extent limited by applicable Law, each Plan may be amended,
terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Closing Date in accordance with
its terms, without material liability to Parent, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries other than ordinary administration expenses and payment of
accrued benefits. However, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any commitment to make material amendments to or to terminate any Plan (other
than as is required by applicable law) or adopt any new plan that, if adopted,

or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
could incur liability under Section 4062, 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. None of the
Plans (i) provides for medical, dental, disability, hospitalization, life or
similar benefits (whether insured or self-insured) to any current or former
employee, director, or consultant following termination of employment or
service with the Company or its Subsidiaries, and neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has promised to provide such benefits to any current or
former employee, director or consultant (in each case, other than coverage
mandated by COBRA or other applicable Law) or (ii) is subject to Title IV of
ERISA.

(j) Each International Plan (i) is being operated in compliance with its terms
and applicable Law, (ii) if intended to qualify for special tax treatment,

standing would not adversely affect the ability of the Purchaser to carry out
its obligations under, and to consummate the transactions contemplated by,
this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party.
The execution and delivery by the Purchaser of this Agreement and each of the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, the performance of its

Purchaser. The execution and delivery by the Purchaser of this Agreement and
each Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party, the performance of its

with or notification to, any Governmental Authority, other than (a) the
premerger notification, waiting period, and clearance requirements under
applicable Antitrust Laws; (b) as set forth in Section 3.05 of the Disclosure
Letter; or (c) where failure to obtain such consent, approval, authorization
or action, or to make such filing or notification, would not prevent or
materially delay the consummation by the Purchaser of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements to which it
is a party.

SECTION 4.04 Purchaser Common Stock. (a) Except as otherwise set forth in the
Purchaser SEC Reports, there are no options, warrants, convertible securities

basis.

its own account for investment purposes and not with a view to, or for offer

Seller Entities' reasonable discretion, jeopardize any attorney-client
privilege with respect to that particular information and, if so, Seller
Entities shall identify to the Purchaser the Contract or information being

any portion of the US Parent Subsidiary and the Target Subsidiaries' business,
taken as a whole, whether by purchase of assets, exclusive license, purchase
of stock, merger or other business combination, or otherwise (but excluding
sales of assets and licenses made in the ordinary course of business) (any of
the foregoing being a "Competing Transaction Proposal"), (ii) disclose (except
disclosures which the Seller Entities are obliged to make under applicable
stock exchange rules or the laws of any competent jurisdiction) to any Person,

termination of this Agreement pursuant

 to the provisions of Article VII, any Competing Transaction Proposal that the
Seller Entities, believes constitutes, or could reasonably lead to, a Superior
Proposal, it will immediately, and in any event, within 24 hours of such
determination, inform Purchaser and provide Purchaser with notice thereof.
Such notice shall include the aggregate purchase price, the form of
consideration and the material terms included in the Competing Transaction
Proposal. The Seller Entities shall not, however, be required to provide other
details of the terms of such Competing Transaction Proposal, including the
identity of the entity or entities providing such Competing Transaction
Proposal or the actual written Competing Transaction Proposal or other
communication. The Seller Entities hereby covenant that the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates will not enter into any agreement with any Third
Party subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company or
its Subsidiaries and Affiliates from providing any information to Parent in
accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this Section 5.04.

Specified Date, the Seller Entities, the Company, its Subsidiaries or their
Representatives may then take any of the actions described in Section
5.04(a)(iv) or Section 5.04(a)(v) (subject to the applicable provisions of
Section 7.01(f) or (h) and Section 8.01(b)(i) of this Agreement).

(d) Tender Offer Rules. Subject to the applicable provisions of Section
7.01(f) or (h) and Section 8.01(b)(i) of this Agreement, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prohibit Parent or the Parent Board from taking and
disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by section 9.21(d) of
the Listings Requirements.

(e) Standstill. Until the earlier of the Closing Date and the date of
termination of this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of Article VII, and
thereafter so long as the Seller Entities or the Purchaser are in receipt of
material non-public information about the other, the Seller Entities and the
Purchaser shall not, and each shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries and
Representatives who are in possession of such material non-public information,
to not, directly or indirectly, acquire (or propose or agree to acquire), of
record or beneficially, by purchase or otherwise, any publicly traded debt
securities or equity securities of Purchaser or the Seller Entities.

 SECTION 5.05 Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents.

(a) Each of the Purchaser and the Seller Entities shall, and shall cause each
of its Affiliates to use commercially reasonable efforts to, (i) as promptly
as practicable, obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of
all Governmental Authorities that may be or become necessary for its execution
and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to, this
Agreement, and (ii) provide such other information to any Governmental
Authority as such Governmental Authority may request in connection herewith.
Each party hereto agrees to cooperate fully with the other party in seeking to
obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders and approvals, and shall
cause its respective Affiliates to, make its respective filing as promptly as
practicable, if necessary, pursuant to the applicable Antitrust Laws and any
other applicable trade regulation Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to use commercially reasonable efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries or requests received from
the appropriate Governmental Authorities for additional information or
documentation pursuant to the Applicable Antitrust Laws or other applicable
trade regulation Law.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the Purchaser's or Seller's undertaking
pursuant to Section 5.05(a), the Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause
each of their Affiliates to:

(i) make appropriate filing of any required Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable and in any event within fifteen (15) days after the
date hereof;

(ii) make all necessary filings, notifications and other submissions with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby under other
applicable Antitrust Laws or trade regulation Laws where such filings,
notifications or other submissions are required, as promptly as practicable;
and

(iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment under any applicable Antitrust Laws or other applicable
trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority or any
other third party so as to enable the parties hereto to close the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the
Termination Date, but in no event shall the Purchaser's obligation under this
Section 5.05 require proposing, negotiating, committing to or effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
license, lease, or disposition of its assets, properties or businesses or of
the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by it pursuant hereto, or

arrangements, required to avoid the entry of, or the commencement of
litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding.

(c) The Purchaser and the Seller Entities shall each make a determination,
within five (5) Business Days after the date hereof, whether each desires that
a filing with CFIUS be made with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. If any of the Purchaser or the Seller Entities wishes to make
a filing with CFIUS with respect to the transactions contemplated

 by this Agreement, then the Purchaser and the Seller Entities shall jointly
assemble all information necessary to complete, and shall submit or cause to
be submitted: (i) promptly but in no event more than fifteen (15) Business
Days after the date hereof, a draft joint voluntary notice of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to CFIUS in accordance with Exon-Florio (the
"Draft Voluntary Notice") and (ii) promptly, but in no event more than five
(5) Business Days after receipt of comments (either written or oral) from the
CFIUS staff on the Draft Voluntary Notice (or as soon as possible after CFIUS
staff confirms it has no comments to the Draft Voluntary Notice), a joint
voluntary notice of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to CFIUS
in accordance with Exon-Florio (the "Joint Voluntary Notice"). The Seller
Entities' counsel shall take the lead in the drafting of the Draft Voluntary
Notice and Joint Voluntary Notice; provided that neither the Draft Voluntary
Notice nor the Joint Voluntary Notice shall be submitted to CFIUS without the
mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Seller Entities via their
respective CFIUS legal counsel. Following submission of the Joint Voluntary
Notice, each of the Purchaser and the Seller Entities shall cooperate (to the
extent permitted by Law) and provide CFIUS with any additional or supplemental
information requested by CFIUS regarding such party during the CFIUS review
process as promptly as practicable, and in all cases within the amount of time
allowed by CFIUS pursuant to Exon-Florio. Notwithstanding any other provision
in this Agreement, the Seller Entities shall have no obligation to share with
the Purchaser any personal identifier information ("PII"), as such term is
defined under the Exon-Florio regulations, and shall separately submit such
PII to CFIUS as set forth in the Exon-Florio regulations. No party shall
communicate with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings,
investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party sufficient prior
notice of such communication and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, the opportunity to review and comment on any proposed written
communication (subject to the terms of this Section 5.05) and, with respect to
any oral communication, to attend and/or participate in such conversation or
meeting. The parties, in cooperation with each other, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the CFIUS Clearance, and without limiting the
foregoing, the parties shall take all such reasonable actions and agree to
such reasonable requirements or conditions to mitigate any national security
concerns as may be requested or required by CFIUS in connection with, or as a
condition of, the CFIUS Clearance; provided, however, that neither the Seller
Entities nor the Purchaser shall be obligated to take any mitigation steps
that would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
the Seller Entities' investment in the Purchaser Common Stock.

(d) Except to the extent prohibited by applicable Laws, each party to this
Agreement shall promptly notify the other party of any communication it or any
of its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives receives from any

nothing in this Section 5.12 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the
right of Purchaser after the Closing to amend or terminate any such Purchaser
Benefit Plan at any time to the extent permitted by applicable Laws. To the
extent Purchaser will make employment offers to employees of the Company and

all requirements of applicable Laws. Further, Purchaser agrees that Purchaser

associated with the termination of, dismissal of, or resignation by any

employment offer or any other action or conduct of Purchaser.

(b) With respect to the Purchaser Benefit Plans, to the extent made available

purposes of eligibility, accrual of benefits and vesting under the Purchaser
Benefit Plans, or any employee benefit plan or program or arrangement that may

the Company shall terminate any Plan maintained by the Target Subsidiaries
that Purchaser had requested to be terminated by providing a written notice to
the Company at least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date. No later than
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company shall provide
Purchaser with evidence that such Plans have been terminated.

(d) Nothing in this Section 5.12 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
constitute an amendment to, or be construed as amending, modifying or
terminating any benefit plan, program, arrangement or agreement, or be
construed to create a right in any employee of the Company or the Target
Subsidiaries to employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates subject to the
requirements of applicable Law and, subject to any other binding written
agreement between an employee and Purchaser, the employment of each Continuing
Employee shall be "at will" employment to the maximum extent permitted by Law.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Continuing
Employee or other employee of the Company or any of the Target Subsidiaries,
or any beneficiary or dependent thereof, will be deemed to be a third-party
beneficiary of this Section 5.12 or any other provision of this Agreement.

months after the date hereof, UK Parent Subsidiary shall not receive any

SECTION 8.03 Public Announcements. None of the parties to this Agreement shall
make, or cause to be made, any press release or public announcement in respect
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise communicate with any news media regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the
other party unless such press release or public announcement is otherwise
required by Law or applicable stock exchange regulation, in which case, the
parties to this Agreement shall to the extent practicable, consult with each
other as to the timing and contents of any such press release, public
announcement or communication.

SECTION 8.04 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

SECTION 8.05 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Disclosure Letter and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all
prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

SECTION 8.06 Survival of Representations and Warranties; Pre-Closing
Covenants. The representations and warranties of the Seller Entities contained
herein and in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto and
the covenants required to be fulfilled by the Seller Entities and Purchaser on
or prior to the Closing shall not survive the Closing. The Purchaser
acknowledges that, following the Closing, it will have no claims against the
Seller Entities or any of their respective Affiliates based on the breach of
such representations or covenants. In making its decision to enter into this
Agreement and

 to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, each party hereto has
relied solely upon its own investigation and the express representations and
warranties of the other parties hereto set forth in this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that no Person
(including the other parties hereto): (a) has made any representation or
warranty as to the other parties hereto, the Company or the Target
Subsidiaries, or this Agreement, except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement or in the Ancillary Agreements, (b) has made any representation or
warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding the other parties hereto, the Company, the Target
Subsidiaries, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that is not
expressly set forth in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, and (c)
will have or be subject to any liability to such party or any other Person
resulting from the distribution to such party, or its use of, any information
relating to the other parties hereto, the Company, or the Target Subsidiaries,
including any information, confidential memoranda, documents, projections,
forecasts, business plans or management presentations, except for the
representations and warranties and covenants expressly set forth in this
Agreement and in the Ancillary Agreements.

SECTION 8.07 Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by operation of
Law or otherwise without the express written consent of the Seller Entities
and the Purchaser (which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole
discretion of the Seller Entities or the Purchaser), as the case may be, and
any attempted assignment without such consent shall be null and void; provided
that in the event the Purchaser intends to assign this Agreement to any
Affiliate, the Seller Entities' consent shall not be unreasonably withheld to
the extent the Purchaser remains obligated to perform its obligations under
this Agreement.

SECTION 8.08 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except
(a) by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, the Seller
Entities and the Purchaser that expressly references the Section of this
Agreement to be amended; or (b) by a waiver in accordance with Section 8.09.

SECTION 8.09 Waiver. Any party to this Agreement may (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party;
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained herein or in any document delivered by the other party
pursuant to this Agreement; or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements
of the other party or conditions to such obligations contained herein. Any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise of any other right
hereunder. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights
hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such rights.

SECTION 8.10 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, only the
parties hereto and

 their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any rights of employment
for any specified period, under or by reason of this Agreement.

SECTION 8.11 Specific Performance. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the parties hereto would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions
of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
are otherwise breached and that any non-performance or breach of this
Agreement by any party hereto could not be adequately compensated by monetary
damages alone and that the parties hereto would not have any adequate remedy
at law. Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which any
party hereto may be entitled, at law or in equity (including monetary
damages), such party shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this
Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to temporary, preliminary
and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of
any of the provisions of this Agreement without posting any bond or other
undertaking. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties
hereto agree that the Seller Entities shall be entitled to enforce
specifically the Purchaser's obligation to (i) consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the obligation to consummate the
Closing and to pay the Purchase Price), if, subject to Article VII, the
conditions set forth in Article VI have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) or waived.
The parties hereto agree that they will not contest the appropriateness of
specific performance as a remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the foregoing, the Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that the only
remedy available to it in the event the Transaction is not consummated due to
termination of this Agreement by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.01(f) or
7.01(g) or by the Seller Entities pursuant to Section 7.01(h) shall be the
payments to the Purchaser set forth in Section 8.01(b)(i) and (ii), as
applicable.

SECTION 8.12 Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to conflict of laws principles. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware located in New Castle County, Delaware (or solely if such courts
decline jurisdiction in any federal court located in the State of Delaware)
any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and hereby
irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such Action may be heard and
determined in such court. Each party to this Agreement hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert by way of motion, defense, counterclaim, or
otherwise, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such
Action. The parties to this Agreement further agree, (i) to the extent
permitted by Law, that final and nonappealable judgment against any of them in
any Action contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any
other jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on the
judgment, a certified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact
and amount of such judgment and (ii) that service of process upon such party
in any such action or proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in
accordance with Section 8.02.

SECTION 8.13 Arbitration. If mutually agreed upon by the parties, any dispute
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the breach thereof,
including, but not

 limited to, any question regarding the existence, validity, performance, non-
performance, interpretation or termination of the Agreement may be determined
by arbitration in Delaware before a panel of three (3) arbitrators (the
"Arbitration"). The Arbitration shall be submitted to the American Arbitration
Association or its successor (collectively, the "AAA") and administered by AAA
pursuant to its Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures then in
effect. The panel of three (3) arbitrators shall be selected as follows: (i)
Purchaser and Parent shall each nominate an arbitrator and (ii) within ten
(10) days thereof, the two (2) selected arbitrators shall confer in good faith
and select a third arbitrator, with the third arbitrator serving as the chief
arbitrator of the arbitration panel. Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Seller Entities, on the other hand, shall each advance one half of the
arbitrators' fees and administrative costs of the Arbitration. Judgment upon
the award rendered by the arbitrators may be enforced by any court of
competent jurisdiction.

SECTION 8.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or other means of electronic transmission, such as by
electronic mail in "pdf" form) in one or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.
