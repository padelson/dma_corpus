If the Parties are unable to resolve such differences within ten (10) Business Days of the delivery of the notice of dispute, then Ernst and Young (the " _Tax Dispute Accountant_ ") shall be engaged to resolve such dispute; provided, that such dispute shall be resolved in favor of TRM unless the Tax Dispute Accountant determines that there is no reasonable basis for TRMs position. The allocation determined by the Tax Dispute Accountant shall become the Allocation Schedule and will be final and binding on the Parties. The fees and expenses of the Tax Dispute Accountant shall be borne equally by TRM and CPRE. CPRE, TRM and the Purchasing Insurers shall prepare and file all returns and reports with respect to Taxes, including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 (and any replacement or successor form), in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule; provided that TRMs and the Purchasing Insurers cost may differ from the Allocable Amount to 

   ##### 

  

 

reflect capitalizable costs incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any
final allocation pursuant to this Section 2.7(d) shall to the extent
permitted by applicable law be determined consistently with the
final allocation determined under Section 11.6(b) of the Stock Purchase
Agreement. 

   

 2.8 _Consent of Third Parties_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign or transfer any approval, instrument, contract, lease, permit or other property, asset, or right included in the Transferred Assets or any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an assignment or transfer or an attempt to make such an assignment or transfer without the approval, authorization, consent or permit of a third party would constitute a breach or violation thereof or affect adversely the rights of any Tower Entity, any member of the HIG Group, or any CPRE Entity thereunder; and any transfer or assignment to any Tower Entity by any member of the HIG Group of any interest under any such approval, instrument, contract, lease, permit or other property, asset or right that requires the approval, authorization, consent or permit of a third party shall be made subject to the same being obtained. In the event any such approval, authorization, consent or permit is not obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, CPRE shall, and shall cause the members of the HIG Group to, continue to use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such approval, authorization, consent or permit after the Closing Date until such time as such approval, authorization, consent or permit has been obtained, and CPRE will cooperate, and will cause the members of the HIG Group to cooperate, with the Tower Entities in any lawful arrangement to provide that the applicable Tower Entity shall receive the interest of the members of the HIG Group in the benefits under any such approval, instrument, contract, lease or permit or other property, asset or right, including performance by CPRE and/or the member of the HIG Group as agents, _provided_ that the applicable Tower Entity shall undertake to pay or satisfy the corresponding Liabilities for the enjoyment of such benefit to the extent such Tower Entity, would have been responsible therefor hereunder if such approval, authorization, consent or permit had been obtained. Nothing in this Section 2.8 shall be deemed a waiver by TRM or any other Tower Entity of their respective rights to have received on or before the Closing an effective assignment of all of the Transferred Assets nor shall this Section 2.8 be deemed to constitute an agreement to exclude from the Transferred Assets any properties, assets or rights described in Section 2.2(a). 

  

 2.9 _Renewal Rights_. 

  

 (a) At any time following the Closing Date, at the option of TRM, without any additional consideration and as directed by TRM by delivery pursuant to the Brokerage Management Agreement of a written Non-Renewal Notice, CPRE shall cause each Selling Insurer, as applicable, to send to each Policyholder whose Insurance Contract is indicated in the relevant Non-Renewal Notice, within 30 days following receipt of the Non-Renewal Notice, written notice in the form directed by TRM and reasonably acceptable to the applicable Selling Insurer advising such Policyholder that (i) such Selling Insurer will not renew or will cancel the Insurance Contract, and (ii) one or more of the Purchasing Insurers, their Insurer Affiliates or other duly licensed, eligible or otherwise authorized insurance companies selected by the Purchasing Insurers may issue to the Policyholder a Purchasing Insurer Policy (defined below). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Following delivery of a Non-Renewal Notice, one or more of the Purchasing Insurers, in its own name and on its own behalf, or in the name and on behalf of any of its Insurer Affiliates or other duly licensed, eligible or otherwise authorized insurance companies selected by the Purchasing Insurers, shall be entitled to and may, in connection with the first expiration, renewal, or anniversary date of each specified Insurance Contract on or after the date of the Non-Renewal Notice, solicit, quote, bind, write and/or issue, or cause to be solicited, quoted, bound, written and/or issued to any Policyholder prior to or upon the expiration, cancellation or non-renewal of such Policyholders Insurance Contract(s), policies or other evidences of insurance coverage on the policy forms of the applicable Purchasing Insurer, Insurer Affiliates or other duly licensed, eligible or otherwise authorized insurance companies selected by the Purchasing Insurers (each such new policy, a " _Purchasing Insurer Policy_ "), subject in each case to Applicable Law, and the rights of Producers and Policyholders. 

  

 (c) Upon receipt of a Notice of Non-Renewal, the applicable Selling Insurer shall, subject to the provisions of Applicable Law, cease renewing the specified Insurance Contracts and shall promptly make all required filings with Government Authorities relating to such non-renewal. 

  

 2.10 _HIG Extension Adjustment_. 

  

 (a) If the HIG Extension shall be limited to a period of six months, pursuant to the first proviso in the definition of HIG Extension, CPRE or TRM shall be obliged to pay the HIG Adjustment Amount to the other pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.10. Within 60 days following the first anniversary of the first day of the HIG Extension (the " _HIG Extension Anniversary Date_ "), TRM shall prepare and deliver to CPRE a statement (the " _HIG Adjustment Amount Statement_ ") setting forth the calculation in reasonable detail of the difference (the " _HIG Adjustment Amount_ ", which amount may be a negative or positive number) between (i) the amount actually paid by CPRE Entities to Tower Entities under the Brokerage Management Agreement, the Master Agreement and the Intercompany Agreements with respect to the period beginning on the first day following the expiration of the HIG Extension and ending on the HIG Extension Anniversary Date less (ii) the amount that would have been paid by CPRE Entities to Tower Entities under the Brokerage Management Agreement, the Master Agreement and the Intercompany Agreements with respect to the period beginning on the first day following the expiration of the HIG Extension and ending on the HIG Extension Anniversary Date, if the HIG Extension had been for a period of one year. 

  

 (b) The HIG Adjustment Amount Statement shall become final, binding and conclusive upon the Parties on the 30th day following CPREs receipt of the HIG Adjustment Amount Statement, unless prior to such 30th day CPRE delivers to TRM a written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") stating that CPRE believes the HIG Adjustment Amount Statement contains errors and specifying in reasonable detail each item that CPRE disputes (a " _Disputed Item_ "), the amount in dispute for each such Disputed Item and the reasons supporting CPREs positions. 

  

 (c) If CPRE delivers a Dispute Notice, then CPRE and TRM shall seek in good faith to resolve the Disputed Items during the 15-day period beginning on the date TRM receives the Dispute Notice (the " _Resolution Period_ "). If CPRE and TRM reach 

   ##### 

  

 

agreement with respect to any Disputed Items, TRM shall revise the HIG
Adjustment Amount Statement to reflect such agreement. 

   

 (d) If TRM and CPRE are unable to resolve all of the Disputed Items during the Resolution Period, then TRM and CPRE shall independently engage and submit the unresolved Disputed Items (the " _Unresolved Items_ ") to KPMG LLP or such other nationally recognized public accounting firm upon whom TRM and CPRE mutually agree (the " _Independent Accountant_ "). TRM and CPRE shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accountant to issue its written determination regarding the Unresolved Items within 30 days after such items are submitted for review. The Independent Accountant shall make a determination with respect to the Unresolved Items only and in a manner consistent with this Section 2.10, and in no event shall the Independent Accountants determination of the Unresolved Items be for an amount that is outside the range of TRMs and CPREs disagreement with respect to each individual item. Each Party shall and shall cause its respective Affiliates to use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to the Independent Accountant such work papers and other documents and information pertaining to the Unresolved Items as the Independent Accountant may request. The determination of the Independent Accountant shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties absent manifest error, and TRM shall revise the HIG Adjustment Amount Statement to reflect such determination upon receipt thereof. The fees, expenses and costs of the Independent Accountant shall be borne equally by TMR and CPRE. 

  

 (e) Within five Business Days after the HIG Adjustment Amount Statement is finalized pursuant to this Section 2.10, each of the CPRE Entities and the Tower Entities, as applicable, will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such approvals, authorizations, consents and permits from Governmental Authorities necessary in connection with payment of the HIG Payment Amount (collectively, the "HIG Payment Amount Approvals"). Within five Business Days following receipt of the HIG Payment Amount Approvals, (i) if the HIG Adjustment Amount is a negative number, CPRE shall pay to TRM the HIG Adjustment Amount (expressed as a positive number) and (ii) if the HIG Adjustment Amount is a positive number, TRM shall pay to CPRE the HIG Adjustment Amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the immediately preceding sentence, failure to obtain the HIG Adjustment Amount Approvals shall not limit the obligations of CPH or Tower Parent to pay the HIG Adjustment Amount under the CastlePoint Guaranty or Tower Guaranty, as the case may be, within five Business Days after the HIG Adjustment Amount Statement is finalized pursuant to this Section 2.10.

With respect to any Transferred Employee who is a party to an employment agreement with the HIG Group (each agreement and " _Employment Agreement_ "), each Purchasing Insurer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, on or prior to the Transfer Date, the consent of such Transferred Employee to the termination of such Employment Agreement.

 7.3 _Employee Benefits_.

 11.1 _Survival_. All covenants, undertakings and agreements contained in this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any document, certificate, schedule or instrument delivered or executed in connection herewith or therewith to be performed or complied with after the Closing Date shall survive for the period of eighteen months following the Closing; provided that the applicable Parties obligation to provide indemnification under Sections 11.2(a)(ii), 11.2(a)(iii), 11.2(a)(iv), and, with respect to the foregoing, 11.2(a)(v), and Sections 11.3(a)(ii), 11.3(a)(iii), 11.3(a)(iv) and, with respect to the foregoing, 11.3(a)(v), shall survive indefinitely. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if prior to the close of business on the last day of the aforementioned eighteen month period, an Indemnified Party shall have been properly notified of a claim for indemnity hereunder and such claim shall not have been finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance with the terms hereof. 

  

 11.2 _Indemnification by CPRE_. __  

  

 (a) _Indemnification_. From and after the Closing, subject to the remainder of this Article 11, CPRE shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Tower Entity, including TRM and the Purchasing Insurers, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, Representatives, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all damages, losses, charges, deficiencies, liabilities, obligations, claims, judgments, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and reasonable expenses of investigation in connection with any action, suit or 

   ##### 

  

    

proceeding) (collectively, " _Loss_ " or " _Losses_ ") to which any of them
become subject, arising or resulting from: 

  

 (i) any material breach by CPRE of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement; 

  

 (ii) any material breach by CPRE, any CPRE Entity or any member of the HIG Group of any covenant made by it in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement to which such Person is a party; 

  

 (iii) any of the Excluded Assets or their use;

 (b) _Limitation_. 

  

 (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, CPRE shall not be liable under this Section 11.2 unless the total aggregate amount of Losses with respect to all such claims or matters exceeds $50,000 and then only to the extent of such excess. The maximum amount of CPREs collective and aggregate liability under Section 11.2(a) shall in no event exceed the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 11.2(b), CPREs obligation to provide indemnification under Sections 11.2(a)(iii) and 11.2(a)(iv), and, with respect to the foregoing, 11.2(a)(v), shall not be subject to any basket, deductible, cap or other similar limitation. 

  

 (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 11.2, none of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 11.2 to the extent that (i) Losses result from acts, omissions or conduct of any Purchaser Indemnified Party, unless such acts, omissions or conduct were committed at the written direction of CPRE, or (ii) such Loss is also a Loss for which the CPRE Indemnified Parties are indemnified pursuant to Section 11.3 of this Agreement. Each of TRM and the Purchaser Insurers acknowledges that none of CPRE, the Selling Insurers, or any of their Affiliates shall be deemed to have guaranteed the profitability of the Business, Transferred Assets, or any transaction contemplated under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, or any volume of sales, and no indemnification shall arise based on an assertion of such a guarantee of profitability or volume of sales. 

  

 11.3 _Indemnification by the Purchasing Insurers_. 

  

 (a) _Indemnification_. From and after the Closing, subject to the remainder of this Article 11, each of TRM and the Purchasing Insurers, jointly and severally, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless CPRE, the CPRE Entities, the members of the HIG Group, including the Selling Insurers, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, Representatives, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the " _CPRE Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Losses to which any of them become subject, arising or resulting from: 

   ##### 

  

  

 (i) any material breach by any of TRM and the Purchasing Insurers of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement; 

  

 (ii) any material breach by any Tower Entity, including TRM and the Purchasing Insurers, of any covenant made by any of them in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement to which such Person is a party; 

  

 (iii) any of the Transferred Assets or their use; 

  

 (iv) any of the Assumed Liabilities; and 

  

 (v) the enforcement of their rights under this Section 11.3. 

  

 (b) _Limitation_. 

  

 (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, TRM and the Purchasing Insurers shall not be liable under this Section 11.3 unless the total aggregate amount of Losses with respect to all such claims or matters exceeds $50,000 and then only to the extent of such excess. The maximum amount of TRMs and the Purchasing Insurers collective and aggregate liability under Section 11.3(a) shall in no event exceed the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 11.3(b), TRMs and the Purchasing Insurers obligation to provide indemnification under Sections 11.3(a)(iii), 11.3(a)(iv) and, with respect to the foregoing, 11.3(a)(v), shall not be subject to any basket, deductible, cap or other similar limitation. 

  

 (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 11.3, none of the CPRE Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 11.3 to the extent that (a) Losses result from acts, omissions or conduct of any CPRE Indemnified Party, unless such acts, omissions or conduct were committed at the written direction of TRM or any of the Purchasing Insurers, or (b) such Loss is also a Loss for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are indemnified pursuant to Section 11.2 of this Agreement. CPRE acknowledges that none of TRM, the Purchasing Insurers, or any of their Affiliates shall be deemed to have guaranteed the profitability of the Excluded Assets or any volume of sales, and no indemnification shall arise based on an assertion of such a guarantee of profitability or volume of sales. 

  

 11.4 _Inter-Party Claims_. Any Party seeking indemnification pursuant to this Article 11 (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall notify the other Party or Parties from whom such indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the Indemnified Partys assertion of such claim for indemnification, specifying in reasonable detail the basis of such claim and including documents that evidence or support such claim or the act, omission or occurrence giving rise to such claim. 

  

 11.5 _Third Party Claims_. 

  

 (a) Each Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of the assertion by any third party of any claim with respect to which the indemnification 

   ##### 

  

    

set forth in this Article 11 relates (which shall also constitute the notice
required by Section 11.4). Failure to timely notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve such Person from its obligations under this Article 11,
except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been prejudiced by
such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon notice to
the Indemnified Party within ten business days after the receipt of any such
notice, to undertake the defense of such claim with counsel of the
Indemnifying Partys choice and with the cooperation of the Indemnified
Parties. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the Indemnified Partys
prior written consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld), settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or
threatened claim in respect of which indemnification under this Article 11 is
being sought, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes
an unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all Liability arising
or resulting from such claim. The failure of the Indemnifying Party to give
such notice and to undertake the defense of or to settle or compromise such a
claim shall constitute a waiver of the Indemnifying Partys rights to assume
the defense of such claim under this Section 11.5(a). No Indemnified Party
shall, without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld), settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgments in any pending or threatened claim in respect of which
indemnification under this Article 11 is being sought. 

  

 (b) The election by the Indemnifying Party, pursuant to Section 11.5(a), to undertake the defense of a third party claim shall not preclude the Party against which such claim has been made also from participating or continuing to participate in such defense, so long as such Party bears its own legal fees and expenses for so doing. 

  

 11.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. The Parties hereto expressly acknowledge that (i) except as otherwise expressly provided in Sections 10.2 and 12.14, the provisions of this Article 11 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for Losses caused as a result of any breach of any representation or warranty or any breach, nonfulfillment or default in the performance of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement, other than claims based on fraud, and (ii) no Indemnifying Party shall be liable for consequential, indirect, punitive or treble Losses in connection with any action, suit or proceeding brought by any Party, or for any Losses based on either the reduced current or future profitability or earnings of any transaction contemplated herein or in any Ancillary Agreement, including the Business, Transferred Assets, and Excluded Assets based on a multiple of such profitability, earnings or other factor, or reduction therein (it being understood that all Losses will for purposes of this Article 11 be determined and calculated on a direct, dollar-for-dollar basis), other than any such Losses paid to a third party in a third party claim. Any liability for indemnification hereunder will be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. 

  

 11.7 _Calculation of Losses_. The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this _Article 11_ shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Parties under insurance policies or other collateral sources (such as contractual indemnities of any Person that are outside of this Agreement, e.g., the Stock Purchase Agreement) or otherwise with respect to such Losses (net of any Tax or expenses incurred in connection with such recovery). Each Party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance 

   ##### 

  

    

policies or other collateral sources (including the Stock Purchase Agreement)
for any Losses prior to seeking indemnification under this Agreement.

 12.14 _Arbitration_. 

  

 (a) If any dispute arises between the Parties with reference to the formation, interpretation, performance, or breach of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, such dispute, if not resolved by the Parties, must be submitted to non-binding mediation. If such dispute is not resolved by non-binding mediation within sixty (60) days it shall be finally settled by arbitration by a panel of three arbitrators in accordance with this Section 12.14. Notice requesting arbitration will be in accordance with Section 12.11. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association in effect at the time of the arbitration, except as they may be modified herein or by mutual agreement of the Parties. 

  

 (b) One arbitrator shall be chosen by each Party and the two arbitrators shall, before commencing the arbitration hearing, choose an impartial third arbitrator who shall preside at the hearing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this section 12.14(b), in the event that more than one of TRM and/or the Purchasing Insurers is involved in an arbitration, TRM and/or the Purchasing Insurers involved shall collectively be entitled to chose only one arbitrator. If either Party fails for any reason to appoint its arbitrator within thirty (30) days after being requested to do so by the other Party, the latter, after ten (10) days notice of its intention to do so, may appoint the second arbitrator. If the two arbitrators are unable to agree upon the third arbitrator within thirty (30) days of their appointment, the third arbitrator shall be selected from a list of six individuals (three named by each arbitrator) by a judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, or if that court declines to act, the state court in such area having general jurisdiction. 

  

 (c) All arbitrators shall be active or retired disinterested officials of insurance or reinsurance companies not under the control or management of either Party to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements and will not have personal or financial interests in the result of the arbitration. 

  

 (d) Within thirty (30) days after notice of appointment of all arbitrators, the panel shall meet and determine timely periods for briefs, discovery procedures, and schedules for hearings. 

  

 (e) Arbitration shall take place in New York, New York. Insofar as the arbitration panel looks to substantive law, it shall consider the law of the State of New York without giving effect to the choice of law or conflict of law provisions of that or any other jurisdiction. The decision of any two arbitrators shall be rendered in writing and shall be final and binding. The panel is empowered to grant interim relief as it may deem appropriate. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. 

  

 (g) Punitive damages will not be awarded. The arbitrators may, however, at their discretion award such other costs and expenses as they deem appropriate, including attorneys fees, the cost of arbitration, and arbitrators fees, to the extent permitted by law. 

  

 (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including the remainder of this Section 12.14, it is understood and agreed that any breach of the terms of this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy and accordingly the Parties agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach, a Party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for, and shall be entitled to, injunctive relief from such court, without the requirement of posting a bond or proof of the inadequacy of monetary damages, designed to cure existing breaches and to prevent a future occurrence or threatened future occurrence of like breaches of this Agreement on the part of any other Party. It is further understood and agreed that the remedies and recourses herein provided shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedy or recourse which is available to a Party either at law or in equity in the absence of this paragraph, including the right to damages. 

  

 12.15 _Confidentiality_. Except upon receipt of the prior written consent of the other Parties, each Party will hold, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates, and their respective Representatives to hold, in strict confidence from any Person (other than any such Affiliates or Representatives) all documents and information concerning any other Party or any of its Affiliates furnished to the other Parties or Representatives in connection with this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein or therein, except to the extent that such documents or information can be shown to have been (a) previously known by the Party receiving such documents or information, (b) in the public domain (either prior to or after the furnishing of such documents or information hereunder) through no fault of such receiving Party, (c) later acquired by the receiving Party from another source if the receiving Party is not aware that such source is under an obligation or duty to the disclosing Party to keep such documents and information confidential, (d) compelled or required to be disclosed by judicial or administrative process (including in connection with obtaining the Required Approvals) or by other requirements of Applicable Law or the rules of any securities market or exchange, or (e) disclosed in an action or proceeding brought by a Party in pursuit of its rights or in the exercise of its remedies hereunder, provided that, following the Closing, the foregoing restrictions will not apply to the use by any Tower Entity of documents and information to the extent relating to the Assumed Liabilities, the Employee Group or the Transferred Assets.

 _FORM OF CASTLEPOINT GUARANTEE_   

  

 _GUARANTEE_  

   

 Guarantee, dated as of [ _ _], 2008 (this " _Guarantee_ "), by CastlePoint Holdings, Ltd., a Bermuda corporation (the " _Guarantor_ "), in favor of Tower Insurance Company of New York, a New York corporation (" _TICNY_ "), Tower National Insurance Company, a Massachusetts corporation (" _TNIC_ "), Preserver Insurance Company, a New Jersey corporation (" _PIC_ "), Mountain Valley Insurance Company, a New Hampshire corporation (" _MVIC_ "), Northeast Insurance Company, a Maine corporation (" _NIC_ "), and Tower Risk Management Corp., a New York corporation (" _TRM_ ," and, together with TICNY, TNIC, PIC, MVIC and NIC, the " _Companies_ "). 

  

 1. _Guarantee_. To induce the Companies to enter into that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of August ___, 2008 (the " _Asset Purchase Agreement_ "), by and among the Companies, and CastlePoint Reinsurance Company, Ltd., a Bermuda corporation (the " _Guaranteed Entity_ "), the Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the due and punctual payment of all respective amounts due and payable by the Guaranteed Entity under the Asset Purchase Agreement, if and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms of and subject to the conditions contained in the Asset Purchase Agreement (the " _Obligations_ "). This is a guarantee of payment and not of collection. Capitalized terms used herein without definition have the meanings set forth for such terms in the Asset Purchase Agreement. 

  

 If for any reason whatsoever the Guaranteed Entity shall fail or be unable to perform or comply with any of the Obligations, the Guarantor will promptly upon receipt of notice thereof from any of the Companies pay or cause to be paid in lawful money of the United States the unpaid Obligations then due and payable (in the amounts and to the extent required of the Guaranteed Entity under the Asset Purchase Agreement). 

  

 2. _Changes in Obligations_. The Guarantor agrees that the Companies or any Person entitled to payment under the Asset Purchase Agreement (collectively, the " _Beneficiaries_ ") may at any time and from time to time, without notice to or further consent of the Guarantor, extend the time for payment of the Obligations owed to such Beneficiary, and may also make any agreement with the Guaranteed Entity for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release thereof, in whole or in part, or for any modification of the terms thereof or of any agreement between such Beneficiary and the Guaranteed Entity without in any way impairing or affecting this Guarantee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Guarantee, each Beneficiary may only exercise rights hereunder with respect to Obligations owed to that Beneficiary; provided, however, that TRM may and is hereby authorized to exercise all rights under this Guarantee on behalf of each Beneficiary. 

  

 3. _Extent of Liability; Availability of Defenses_. Except as provided herein or in the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Guarantors obligations hereunder shall not be greater than the Obligations (without giving effect to any change in such obligations as a result of any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement or other similar proceedings involving the Guaranteed Entity) and, therefore, performance by the Guarantor of the Obligations shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as would apply to performance by the Guaranteed Entity of the Obligations and the Guarantor shall be entitled to assert any defense to such 

   ##### 

  

    

performance that the Guaranteed Entity would be entitled to so assert (other
than a defense that results from any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization,
arrangement or other similar proceedings involving the Guaranteed Entity).
Upon any default of the Guaranteed Entity under the Asset Purchase Agreement,
the Beneficiaries, as applicable, may, without first proceeding against the
Guaranteed Entity, proceed directly against the Guarantor after giving notice
as required hereby and by the Asset Purchase Agreement to collect and recover
the full amount or any portion of or to secure the performance of the
Obligations and/or Guarantors obligations hereunder with respect to such
Beneficiary. 

  

 4. _Waivers_. Except for any demand and notice required hereby or by the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Guarantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert or take advantage of any defenses based upon diligence, protest, notice of discharge, notice of acceptance of this Agreement, indulgences, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of receivership or bankruptcy of the Guaranteed Entity, and all other notices and demands whatsoever. The Guarantor agrees that this Guarantee will not be discharged, except by complete performance and indefeasible satisfaction and discharge in full of the Obligations. The Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this Guarantee are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. 

  

 5. _Offsets_. The Guarantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert or take advantage of any rights or defenses based upon any right of offset or claimed offset by the Guarantor against any obligation now or hereafter owed to the Guarantor by the Guaranteed Entity, any of the Beneficiaries, or any of the Tower Entities. 

  

 6. _Subrogation_. The Guarantor hereby agrees to refrain from exercising any and all rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnity, exoneration, contribution or any other claim which the Guarantor may now or hereafter have against the Guaranteed Entity arising out of the existence or performance of this Guarantee for so long as any matured Obligation is outstanding and has not been indefeasibly satisfied and discharged in full. 

  

 7. _Bankruptcy_. The Guarantors obligations hereunder shall not be altered, limited or affected by any proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, liquidation or arrangement of the Guaranteed Entity, or by any defense which the Guaranteed Entity may have by reason of the order, decree or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding. 

  

 8. _Representations and Warranties_. The Guarantor hereby represents and warrants that: 

  

 (a) the Guarantor has full power and authority to enter into this Guarantee and to carry out the transactions contemplated hereby and the execution, delivery and performance of this Guarantee have been duly authorized by all necessary action; 

   

 (b) all consents, approvals authorizations, permits or filings with and notifications to, any governmental or regulatory body, agency, authority or official necessary for the due execution, delivery and performance of this Guarantee by the Guarantor have been 

    ##### 

  

 

obtained or made and all conditions thereof have been duly complied with, and
no other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental or
regulatory body, agency, authority or official is required in connection with
the execution, delivery or performance of this Guarantee; 

   

 (c) this Guarantee constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to ( _i_ ) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally, except as specifically provided herein, and ( _ii_ ) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); 

   

 (d) none of the execution, delivery and performance of this Guarantee by the Guarantor will, with or without the giving of notice or the passage of time, or both, conflict with, result in a default or right to accelerate or loss of rights under, any provision of its organizational documents or any franchise, mortgage, deed of trust, lease, license, agreement, understanding, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or any order, judgment or decree to which it is a party or by which it may be bound or affected; and 

   

 (e) there is no action, suit, investigation or proceeding pending against, or to the knowledge of the Guarantor, threatened against or affecting, the Guarantor or any of its properties before any court or arbitrator or any governmental or regulatory body, agency, authority or official which in any manner challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin or alter the transactions contemplated by this Guarantee or which would have a material and adverse effect on the ability of the Guarantor to perform its obligations hereunder. 

   

 9. _No Assignment_. This Guarantee shall not be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise. 

  

 10. _Notices_. Except as set forth in this paragraph, all notices hereunder shall be made in writing and shall be effective upon delivery, which shall be made ( _i_ ) by hand delivery, ( _ii_ ) by registered or certified United States mail, postage prepaid with return receipt requested or ( _iii_ ) by a nationally-recognized overnight courier service, to the addresses set forth below, or to such other address as the Guarantor or the Companies may request by giving written notice to the other party hereto. The Guarantor or Companies may also provide notice by electronic means (such as email or facsimile) or telephone in cases when immediate notice is required so long as it delivers separate written notice to be delivered within 24 hours. Notices shall be made in each case to the following addresses: 

 

If to the Guarantor: 

  

CastlePoint Holdings, Ltd. 
 Joel S. Weiner 
 Victoria Hall 
 11 Victoria Road 
 Hamilton HM 11 Bermuda 

  

If to any of the Companies: 

    ##### 

  

    

Francis M. Colalucci 
 c/o Tower Group, Inc. 
 31st Floor 
 120 Broadway 
 New York, NY 10271 

   

 11. _Continuing Guarantee_. This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and shall be binding on the Guarantor, its successors and assigns until the complete performance and indefeasible satisfaction and discharge in full of the Obligations and the Guarantors obligations hereunder. 

  

 12. _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Guarantee will be valid and binding unless it is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Guarantor and the Companies, or in the case of waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. 

  

 13. _Third Party Beneficiaries_. No party other than the Companies shall have any rights under this Guarantee, and there shall be no third party beneficiaries of this Guarantee, except that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are expressly intended as third-party beneficiaries hereunder. Recourse against the Guarantor under this Guarantee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Companies, all of their subsidiaries and stockholders, and the Beneficiaries, against the Guarantor in respect of any liabilities or obligations arising under, or in connection with, the Asset Purchase Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby. 

  

 14. _Governing Law_. This Guarantee shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the conflict or choice of law provisions of that or any other jurisdiction that would give rise to the application of the domestic substantive law of any other jurisdiction. 

  

 15. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS GUARANTEE OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 

  

 16. _Arbitration_. 

  

 (a) If any dispute arises between, and is not resolved by, the Guarantor, on the one hand, and any of the Companies or any Beneficiaries, on the other, with reference to the formation, interpretation, performance, or breach of this Guarantee, such dispute, must be submitted to non-binding mediation. If such dispute is not resolved by non-binding mediation within sixty (60) days it shall be finally settled by arbitration by a panel of three arbitrators in accordance with this Section 16\. Notice requesting arbitration will be in accordance with Section 10 hereof. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association in effect at the time of the arbitration, except as they may be modified herein or by mutual agreement of the Guarantor and the applicable Companies and Beneficiaries. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) One arbitrator shall be chosen by each of the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the applicable Companies and Beneficiaries, on the other hand, and the two arbitrators shall, before commencing the arbitration hearing, choose an impartial third arbitrator who shall preside at the hearing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this section 16(b), in the event that more than one Company and/or Beneficiary is involved in an arbitration, the Companies and/or Beneficiaries involved shall collectively be entitled to chose only one arbitrator. If either the Guarantor or the applicable Companies and Beneficiaries fails for any reason to appoint its arbitrator within thirty (30) days after being requested to do so by the other, the latter, after ten (10) days notice of its intention to do so, may appoint the second arbitrator. If the two arbitrators are unable to agree upon the third arbitrator within thirty (30) days of their appointment, the third arbitrator shall be selected from a list of six individuals (three named by each arbitrator) by a judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, or if that court declines to act, the state court in such area having general jurisdiction. 

   

 (c) All arbitrators shall be active or retired disinterested officials of insurance or reinsurance companies not under the control or management of either the Guarantor or the Companies and will not have personal or financial interests in the result of the arbitration. 

   

 (d) Within thirty (30) days after notice of appointment of all arbitrators, the panel shall meet and determine timely periods for briefs, discovery procedures, and schedules for hearings. 

   

 (e) Arbitration shall take place in New York, New York. Insofar as the arbitration panel looks to substantive law, it shall consider the law of the State of New York without giving effect to the choice of law or conflict of law provisions of that or any other jurisdiction. The decision of any two arbitrators shall be rendered in writing and shall be final and binding. The panel is empowered to grant interim relief as it may deem appropriate. 

   

 (f) Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. 

   

 (g) Punitive damages will not be awarded. The arbitrators may, however, at their discretion award such other costs and expenses as they deem appropriate, including attorneys fees, the cost of arbitration, and arbitrators fees, to the extent permitted by law. 

   

 17. _Counterparts_. This Guarantee may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

  

 18. _Entire Agreement_. This Guarantee constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes any and all prior discussions, negotiations, proposals, undertakings, understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, between the Guarantor and the Companies with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 _GUARANTEE_  

   

 Guarantee, dated as of [ _ _], 2008 (this " _Guarantee_ "), by Tower Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Guarantor_ "), in favor of CastlePoint Reinsurance Company, Ltd., a Bermuda corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

 1. _Guarantee_. To induce the Company to enter into that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of August ___, 2008 (the " _Asset Purchase Agreement_ "), by and among the Company, Tower Insurance Company of New York, a New York corporation (" _TICNY_ "), Tower National Insurance Company, a Massachusetts corporation (" _TNIC_ "), Preserver Insurance Company, a New Jersey corporation (" _PIC_ "), Mountain Valley Insurance Company, a New Hampshire corporation (" _MVIC_ "), Northeast Insurance Company, a Maine corporation (" _NIC_ "), and Tower Risk Management Corp., a New York corporation (" _TRM_ ," and, together with TICNY, TNIC, PIC, MVIC and NIC, the " _Guaranteed Entities_ "), the Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the due and punctual payment of all respective amounts due and payable by any of the Guaranteed Entities under the Asset Purchase Agreement, if and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms of and subject to the conditions contained in the Asset Purchase Agreement (the " _Obligations_ ").

 2. _Changes in Obligations_. The Guarantor agrees that the Company or any Person entitled to payment under the Asset Purchase Agreement (collectively, the " _Beneficiaries_ ") may at any time and from time to time, without notice to or further consent of the Guarantor, extend the time for payment of the Obligations owed to such Beneficiary, and may also make any agreement with the Guaranteed Entities for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release thereof, in whole or in part, or for any modification of the terms thereof or of any agreement between such Beneficiary and the Guaranteed Entities without in any way impairing or affecting this Guarantee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Guarantee, each Beneficiary may only exercise rights hereunder with respect to Obligations owed to that Beneficiary; provided, however, that the Company may and is hereby authorized to exercise all rights under this Guarantee on behalf of each Beneficiary. 

  

 3. _Extent of Liability; Availability of Defenses_.

 (d) none of the execution, delivery and performance of this Guarantee by the Guarantor will, with or without the giving of notice or the passage of time, or both, conflict with, result in a default or right to accelerate or loss of rights under, any provision of its organizational documents or any franchise, mortgage, deed of trust, lease, license, agreement, understanding, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or any order, judgment or decree to which it is a party or by which it may be bound or affected; and

 11. _Continuing Guarantee_. This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and shall be binding on the Guarantor, its successors and assigns until the complete performance and indefeasible satisfaction and discharge in full of the Obligations and the Guarantors obligations hereunder. 

  

 12. _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Guarantee will be valid and binding unless it is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Guarantor and the Company, or in the case of waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.

 14. _Governing Law_.

 15. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS GUARANTEE OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 

  

 16. _Arbitration_. 

  

 (a) If any dispute arises between, and is not resolved by, the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Company or any Beneficiaries, on the other, with reference to the formation, interpretation, performance, or breach of this Guarantee, such dispute, must be submitted to non-binding mediation. If such dispute is not resolved by non-binding mediation within sixty (60) days it shall be finally settled by arbitration by a panel of three arbitrators in accordance with this Section 16. Notice requesting arbitration will be in accordance with Section 10 hereof. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association in effect at the time of the arbitration, except as they may be modified herein or by mutual agreement of the Guarantor and the Company and/or the applicable Beneficiaries. 

  

 (b) One arbitrator shall be chosen by each of the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Company and/or the applicable Beneficiaries, on the other hand, and the two arbitrators 

   ##### 

  

    

shall, before commencing the arbitration hearing, choose an impartial third
arbitrator who shall preside at the hearing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this section 16(b), in the event that more than one of
the Company and the Beneficiaries is involved in an arbitration, the Company
and/or Beneficiaries involved shall collectively be entitled to chose
only one arbitrator. If either the Guarantor or the Company and/or the
applicable Beneficiaries fails for any reason to appoint its arbitrator
within thirty (30) days after being requested to do so by the other, the
latter, after ten (10) days notice of its intention to do so, may appoint the
second arbitrator. If the two arbitrators are unable to agree upon the third
arbitrator within thirty (30) days of their appointment, the third arbitrator
shall be selected from a list of six individuals (three named by each
arbitrator) by a judge of the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, or if that court declines to act, the state court in
such area having general jurisdiction. 

  

 (c) All arbitrators shall be active or retired disinterested officials of insurance or reinsurance companies not under the control or management of either the Guarantor or the Company and will not have personal or financial interests in the result of the arbitration. 

  

 (d) Within thirty (30) days after notice of appointment of all arbitrators, the panel shall meet and determine timely periods for briefs, discovery procedures, and schedules for hearings. 

  

 (e) Arbitration shall take place in New York, New York. Insofar as the arbitration panel looks to substantive law, it shall consider the law of the State of New York without giving effect to the choice of law or conflict of law provisions of that or any other jurisdiction. The decision of any two arbitrators shall be rendered in writing and shall be final and binding. The panel is empowered to grant interim relief as it may deem appropriate. 

  

 (f) Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. 

  

 (g) Punitive damages will not be awarded. The arbitrators may, however, at their discretion award such other costs and expenses as they deem appropriate, including attorneys fees, the cost of arbitration, and arbitrators fees, to the extent permitted by law. 

  

 17. _Counterparts_. This Guarantee may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

  

 18. _Entire Agreement_. This Guarantee constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes any and all prior discussions, negotiations, proposals, undertakings, understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, between the Guarantor and the Company with respect to the subject matter hereof.
