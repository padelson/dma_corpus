Agreement, on the Closing Date, TRM or the Purchasing Insurers will pay or cause to be paid to CPRE
or any Affiliate thereof, as CPRE may direct, an aggregate amount equal to $16,000,000 (the
&#147;<U>Purchase Price</U>&#148;), and CPRE or any Affiliate thereof, as applicable, will accept and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Subject to receipt of all Required Approvals, CPRE shall cause the Selling Insurers to
pay, to TRM an amount equal to 2.5% of the unearned premium reserve attributable to all Insurance

paid in four equal quarterly payments commencing at the end of the first calendar quarter following
the Closing Date.

allocation of the Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities (collectively, the &#147;<U>Allocable
Amount</U>&#148;) among the Transferred Assets. The proposed allocation shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with section 1060 of the Code. For purposes of such allocation, the Assumed Liabilities
included in the Allocable Amount shall be the assumed liabilities as determined for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. CPRE will have ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days from the receipt of the proposed
allocation to notify TRM if CPRE disputes the proposed allocation. If TRM has not received notice
of any such dispute within such ten (10)&nbsp;Business Day period, the proposed allocation will become
final and binding on the Parties (the &#147;<U>Allocation Schedule</U>&#148;). If, however, CPRE has
delivered notice of such a dispute to TRM within such ten (10)&nbsp;Business Day period, TRM and CPRE
shall discuss their differences with respect to the proposed allocation and attempt in good faith
to resolve such differences. If the Parties are unable to resolve such differences within ten (10)
Business Days of the delivery of the notice of dispute, then Ernst &#038; Young (the &#147;<U>Tax Dispute
Accountant</U>&#148;) shall be engaged to resolve such dispute; provided, that such dispute shall be
resolved in favor of TRM unless the Tax Dispute Accountant determines that there is no reasonable
basis for TRM&#146;s position. The allocation determined by the Tax Dispute Accountant shall become the
Allocation Schedule and will be final and binding on the Parties. The fees and expenses of the Tax
Dispute Accountant shall be borne equally by TRM and CPRE. CPRE, TRM and the Purchasing Insurers
shall prepare and file all returns and reports with respect to Taxes, including Internal Revenue
Service Form&nbsp;8594 (and any replacement or successor form), in a manner consistent with the
Allocation Schedule; provided that TRM&#146;s and the Purchasing Insurers&#146; cost may differ from the

any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an assignment or transfer
or an attempt to make such an assignment or transfer without the approval, authorization, consent

such approval, instrument, contract, lease, permit or other property, asset or right that requires
the approval, authorization, consent or permit of a third party shall be made subject to the same
being obtained. In the event any such approval, authorization, consent or permit is not obtained
on or prior to the Closing Date, CPRE shall, and shall cause the members of the HIG Group to,
continue to use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such approval, authorization,
consent or permit after the Closing Date until such time as such approval, authorization, consent
or permit has been obtained, and CPRE will cooperate, and will cause the members of the HIG Group
to cooperate, with the Tower Entities in any lawful arrangement to provide that the applicable
Tower Entity shall receive the interest of the members of the HIG Group in the benefits under any
such approval, instrument, contract, lease or permit or other property, asset or right, including
performance by CPRE and/or the member of the HIG Group as agents, <U>provided</U> that the
applicable Tower Entity shall undertake to pay or satisfy the corresponding Liabilities for the
enjoyment of such benefit to the extent such Tower Entity, would have been responsible therefor
hereunder if such approval, authorization, consent or permit had been obtained. Nothing in this
Section&nbsp;2.8 shall be deemed a waiver by TRM or any other Tower Entity of their respective rights to
have received on or before the Closing an effective assignment of all of the Transferred Assets nor
shall this Section&nbsp;2.8 be deemed to constitute an agreement to exclude from the Transferred Assets
any properties, assets or rights described in Section&nbsp;2.2(a).

arbitration will be in accordance with Section&nbsp;12.11. The arbitration shall be conducted in
accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association in effect at the
time of the arbitration, except as they may be modified herein or by mutual agreement of the

that more than one of TRM and/or the Purchasing Insurers is involved in an arbitration, TRM and/or
the Purchasing Insurers involved shall collectively be entitled to chose only one arbitrator. If
either Party fails for any reason to appoint its arbitrator within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after being
requested to do so by the other Party, the latter, after ten (10)&nbsp;days notice of its intention to
do so, may appoint the second arbitrator. If the two arbitrators are unable to agree upon the
third arbitrator within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of their appointment, the third arbitrator shall be
selected from a list of six individuals (three named by each arbitrator) by a judge of the United

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<U>Guarantee</U>. To induce the Companies to enter into that certain Asset Purchase
Agreement, dated as of August &#95;&#95;&#95;, 2008 (the &#147;<U>Asset Purchase Agreement</U>&#148;), by and among the
Companies, and CastlePoint Reinsurance Company, Ltd., a Bermuda corporation (the &#147;<U>Guaranteed
Entity</U>&#148;), the Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the due
and punctual payment of all respective amounts due and payable by the Guaranteed Entity under the
Asset Purchase Agreement, if and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the
terms of and subject to the conditions contained in the Asset Purchase Agreement (the
&#147;<U>Obligations</U>&#148;). This is a guarantee of payment and not of collection. Capitalized terms
used herein without definition have the meanings set forth for such terms in the Asset Purchase
Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If for any reason whatsoever the Guaranteed Entity shall fail or be unable to perform or
comply with any of the Obligations, the Guarantor will promptly upon receipt of notice thereof from
any of the Companies pay or cause to be paid in lawful money of the United States the unpaid
Obligations then due and payable (in the amounts and to the extent required of the Guaranteed
Entity under the Asset Purchase Agreement).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<U>Changes in Obligations</U>. The Guarantor agrees that the Companies or any Person
entitled to payment under the Asset Purchase Agreement (collectively, the &#147;<U>Beneficiaries</U>&#148;)
may at any time and from time to time, without notice to or further consent of the Guarantor,
extend the time for payment of the Obligations owed to such Beneficiary, and may also make any
agreement with the Guaranteed Entity for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or
release thereof, in whole or in part, or for any modification of the terms thereof or of any
agreement between such Beneficiary and the Guaranteed Entity without in any way impairing or
affecting this Guarantee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Guarantee,
each Beneficiary may only exercise rights hereunder with respect to Obligations owed to that
Beneficiary; provided, however, that TRM may and is hereby authorized to exercise all rights under
this Guarantee on behalf of each Beneficiary.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;<U>Extent of Liability; Availability of Defenses</U>. Except as provided herein or in the
Asset Purchase Agreement, the Guarantor&#146;s obligations hereunder shall not be greater than the
Obligations (without giving effect to any change in such obligations as a result of any insolvency,
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement or other similar proceedings involving the Guaranteed
Entity) and, therefore, performance by the Guarantor of the Obligations shall be subject to the
same terms and conditions as would apply to performance by the Guaranteed Entity of the Obligations
and the Guarantor shall be entitled to assert any defense to such

that results from any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement or other similar
proceedings involving the Guaranteed Entity). Upon any default of the Guaranteed Entity under the
Asset Purchase Agreement, the Beneficiaries, as applicable, may, without first proceeding against
the Guaranteed Entity, proceed directly against the Guarantor after giving notice as required
hereby and by the Asset Purchase Agreement to collect and recover the full amount or any portion of
or to secure the performance of the Obligations and/or Guarantor&#146;s obligations hereunder with
respect to such Beneficiary.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;<U>Waivers</U>. Except for any demand and notice required hereby or by the terms of the
Asset Purchase Agreement, the Guarantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert or take advantage of
any defenses based upon diligence, protest, notice of discharge, notice of acceptance of this
Agreement, indulgences, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event
of receivership or bankruptcy of the Guaranteed Entity, and all other notices and demands
whatsoever. The Guarantor agrees that this Guarantee will not be discharged, except by complete
performance and indefeasible satisfaction and discharge in full of the Obligations. The Guarantor
acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions
contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this Guarantee are
knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

any rights or defenses based upon any right of offset or claimed offset by the Guarantor against
any obligation now or hereafter owed to the Guarantor by the Guaranteed Entity, any of the
Beneficiaries, or any of the Tower Entities.

rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnity, exoneration, contribution or any other claim which
the Guarantor may now or hereafter have against the Guaranteed Entity arising out of the existence
or performance of this Guarantee for so long as any matured Obligation is outstanding and has not
been indefeasibly satisfied and discharged in full.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;<U>Bankruptcy</U>. The Guarantor&#146;s obligations hereunder shall not be altered, limited or

receivership, reorganization, liquidation or arrangement of the Guaranteed Entity, or by any
defense which the Guaranteed Entity may have by reason of the order, decree or decision of any
court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding.

Agreement, if and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms of and
subject to the conditions contained in the Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#147;<U>Obligations</U>&#148;).
This is a guarantee of payment and not of collection. Capitalized terms used herein without

bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement or other similar proceedings involving any of the
Guaranteed Entities) and, therefore, performance by the Guarantor of the Obligations shall be

performance and indefeasible satisfaction and discharge in full of the Obligations. The Guarantor
acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions
contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this Guarantee are
knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnity, exoneration, contribution or any other claim which
the Guarantor may now or hereafter have against any of the Guaranteed Entities arising out of the
existence or performance of this Guarantee for so long as any matured Obligation is outstanding and
has not been indefeasibly satisfied and discharged in full.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;<U>Bankruptcy</U>. The Guarantor&#146;s obligations hereunder shall not be altered, limited or
affected by any proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy, insolvency,
receivership, reorganization, liquidation or arrangement of any of the Guaranteed Entities, or by
any defense which any of the Guaranteed Entities may have by reason of the order, decree or
decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding.
