by (B) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that are issuable
upon the exercise of such Company Warrant (assuming that any shares of
Company Preferred Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Company Warrants

Effective Time) and (ii) the Per Share Escrow Consideration multiplied by

Effective Time), pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement (collectively, the "Warrant Consideration"). Payment of such amounts

evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

2.9 Exchange of Certificates. 

 2.9.1 At the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to LaSalle Bank,
N.A. or such other bank, trust company or other institution reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company (the "Payment Agent"), for payment in
accordance with this Article 2, an amount in cash equal to the sum of
all amounts payable at Closing to the holders of all shares of Company Common
Stock, all Company Options and all Company Warrants, pursuant to Section 2.8
(such aggregate amount of cash, less the amount deposited into the Escrow Fund
pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof, constituting the "Payment Fund").

 2.9.2 Promptly following the Effective Time, the Payment Agent shall
mail to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock, Company
Options and Company Warrants: (i) a notice of the effectiveness of the
Merger, (ii) a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
A_ (the "Letter of Transmittal"), and (iii) instructions for use in
surrendering the certificates representing the former shares of Company
Common Stock and/or the agreements representing the former Company Options and
Company Warrants (collectively, the "Certificates"), and for receiving the
applicable merger consideration in respect thereof. Upon surrender to the
Payment Agent of a Certificate, together with such Letter of Transmittal duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto (i) the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the merger consideration payable to such holder of Company Common Stock,
Company Option or Company Warrant, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.8 and
less any amounts due to the Company in respect of shareholder and employee
loans and (ii) the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The
Payment Agent shall, promptly following receipt of each properly surrendered
Certificate, cause the payment described in the preceding sentence to be made
to the holder of such Certificate by check or wire transfer to the account
designated by such holder in the Letter of Transmittal delivered with such
Certificate.

 2.9.3 Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 2.9, each outstanding Certificate (other than Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares or shares of Company Capital Stock to be
canceled pursuant to Section 2.8.5) will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to
receive the applicable portion of the Total Merger Consideration. No interest
will be paid or accrued on any portion of the Total Merger Consideration.



 

9 2.9.4 If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Person who is the record owner of such Certificate shall deliver to the
Surviving Corporation an affidavit with respect to such loss, theft or
destruction. The Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the delivery of any merger consideration to such owner,
require such Person to indemnify Parent and the Surviving Corporation against
any claim that may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
The Payment Agent shall not deliver to such Person any merger consideration
attributable to any such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate until such
Person shall have complied with this Section 2.9.4.

 2.9.5 Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains undistributed on
the date that is 180 days after the Effective Time will be delivered to
Parent, if requested; provided that such delivery shall not in any way relieve
Parent of its obligation to pay the merger consideration as set forth in
Section 2.6 and Section 2.8 hereof to any Company Shareholders that tender
their Company Capital Stock, Company Warrants or Company Options for payment
thereafter.

 2.9.6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
2.9, neither the Payment Agent, Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to a holder of Company Capital Stock for any amount properly paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

2.10 No Further Ownership Rights. The applicable portion of the Total
Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or payable
thereafter in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options and Company Warrants
formerly represented thereby or issuable upon exercise thereof. After the
Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of any shares of Company Capital Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 2. 

2.11 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, the officers and directors
of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the name and on behalf of the
Company to take all such lawful and necessary action. Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to perform all of its obligations relating to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

2.12 Dissenters Rights.

 2.12.1 Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary other than Section 2.12.2, any shares of Company Capital Stock held
by a holder who duly and validly demands appraisal of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Chapter 13 of the California Law and is in
compliance with all the provisions of Chapter 13 of the California Law
concerning the right of such holder to demand appraisal of such shares in
connection with the Merger and who, as of the Effective Time, has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such dissenters rights ("Dissenting Shares"),
shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive any
merger consideration pursuant to Section 2.8, but instead shall be converted
into the right to receive only such consideration as may be determined to be
due with respect to such Dissenting Shares under Chapter 13 of the California
Law. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall
not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of a
shareholder of the Surviving Corporation.

  

 

10 2.12.2 Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.8.1, if any
holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who demands appraisal or purchase of
such shares under Chapter 13 of the California Law shall effectively withdraw
or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal or
purchase, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of
such event, such holders shares shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and
shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive
the applicable merger consideration, as provided in Section 2.8, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares
in accordance with Section 2.9.

 2.12.3 The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal or purchase of any shares of Company Capital
Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant
to Chapter 13 of the California Law and received by the Company which relate
to any such demand for appraisal or purchase and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings which take place prior to the
Effective Time with respect to demands for appraisal or purchase under Chapter
13 of the California Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, either (y) voluntarily make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal or purchase of Company Capital Stock or
offer to settle or settle any such demands or (z) make any offer to buy, or
accept any offer to sell, any shares of Company Capital Stock.

there is not, under any of such leases, any existing default or event of
default (or event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default) that would result in a Company Material Adverse Change.
The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of all such
leases, which leases (i) permit the current occupation and use of such real
property by the Company, and (ii) will continue to be legal, valid and binding
in accordance with their respective terms immediately following the Effective
Time. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.7.2, the Leased Real Property

Section 3.7.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all real property used
by Company where there is no written lease agreement.

 3.7.3 Except as set forth in Section 3.7.3 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company has good and marketable title to or holds under valid

Company is in sufficiently good operating condition (except for ordinary wear
and tear) to allow the business of the Company to be operating in the ordinary
course of business and consistent with past practices of the Company.

16  with the terms of any license agreement governing such Intellectual

California as Management and Operations Contractor for the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory that is material to the business of the Company.

Intellectual Property for the Company have assigned all of their right, title,

17  otherwise relate to the Owned Intellectual Property, including license
agreements, development agreements, employee agreements, and contractor
agreements.

Subsidiaries to material liability taken as a whole. Each Employee Plan can be
amended, terminated, or otherwise discontinued after the Closing in

single employer plan within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of

welfare benefits to any Employee (or relative or dependent of any Employee),
except (i) as may be required by COBRA or other applicable federal, state or

insurance under one or more Company Employee Plans set forth on Section 3.13.1

retrospective premium adjustments) whereby the insurance company bears any
risk of loss with respect to such claims, (ii) covered under a contract with
a health maintenance organization (an "HMO") pursuant to which the HMO bears
the liability for claims, or (iii) reflected as a liability or accrued for on
the financial statements of the Company.

 3.13.8 No Company Employee Plan or Employee Agreement constitutes a
"non-qualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A

be, that the Companys Board of Directors reasonably determined in with
connection such grants, was not less than the fair market value of the
underlying shares on the date of

guidance promulgated thereunder (as in effect on the date hereof); (ii)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries are a party to any contract,

transactions contemplated hereby will not (either alone or upon the occurrence
of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under any Company
Employee Plan, Employee Agreement, trust or loan that will or may result in
any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration of vesting,
forgiveness of indebtedness, loss of rights, distribution of funds, increase
in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Employee.

Indemnitees") with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their
capacities as such or taken at the request of the Company at any time prior to
the Effective Time. All rights of the Company Indemnitees to indemnification

to the Effective Time as provided in the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws
of the Company as now in effect, and any indemnification agreements or
arrangements of the Company set forth in Section 6.4 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms. Such rights shall not be amended,
or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of
the Company Indemnitees. In addition, the Surviving Corporation shall pay any
expenses of any Company Indemnitee under this Section 6.4 as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, provided that the person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances to
the extent required by applicable Law. Parent, from and after the Effective
Time, shall unconditionally guarantee the timely payment of all funds owed by,
and the timely performance of all other obligations of, the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 6.4. Parent agrees that its payment obligations
hereunder are unconditional, irrespective of the validity or enforceability of
this Agreement against the Surviving Corporation or any other circumstance
which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of
a guarantor (other than the defenses of statute of limitations, which are not
waived). Parent hereby acknowledges that its obligations under this Section
6.4 constitute a guarantee of payment and not merely of collectability and

34 6.4.2 Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall cause the
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no
less favorable to the Company Indemnitees with respect to limitation of
liabilities of directors, officers, employees and agents and indemnification
than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Company Indemnitees.

 6.4.3 In the event any claim is asserted or made, any determination
required to be made with respect to whether a Company Indemnitees conduct
complies with the standards set forth under applicable law, the Article of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or any indemnification agreements or
arrangements of the Company, as the case may be, shall be made by independent
legal counsel. For purposes of this Section 6.4, "independent legal counsel"
shall mean legal counsel mutually agreeable to Parent and the Company
Indemnitee that has not previously represented Parent, the Company or the
Company Indemnitee. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Company
Indemnitees shall cooperate, and cause their respective affiliates
to cooperate, in the defense of any claim and shall provide access to
properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be
furnished records, documents, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 6.4.4 The parties acknowledge that, prior to the Closing, the Company
will purchase a six-year "tail" policy extending the Companys existing
directors and officers liability insurance policy, and each of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees not to terminate or modify in a manner
adverse to the beneficiaries thereof such "tail" policy.

 6.4.5 The provisions of this Section 6.4 are (i) intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnitee, his
or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. In the event that the
Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this Section 6.4. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 6.4 shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any Company Indemnitee to whom this
Section 6.4 applies without the consent of the affected Company Indemnitee (it
being expressly agreed that the Company Indemnitee to whom this Section 6.4
applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 6.4)
notwithstanding Section 10.4 hereof.

6.5 Section 280G. Other than with respect to Frank Ruderman, the
Company shall (i) seek shareholder approval that satisfies the requirements of
Q-7 of the regulations under Section 280G of the Code ("Section 280G"),
including seeking the waiver by all persons who are "disqualified individuals"
within the meaning of Section 280G, of all payments and benefits in the nature
of compensation that would, but for such waiver and approval be treated as
"parachute payments" under Section 280G (either alone or in conjunction with
any other event), including, to the extent applicable, any such payments,
benefits or accelerated vesting with respect to all equity awards or
employment agreements and any other arrangements (collectively, the
"Compensatory Arrangements"); and (ii) make disclosure of the Compensatory
Arrangements that satisfies the requirements of Q-7 of the regulations under
Section 280G to all shareholders of the Company entitled to vote under Section
280G.

employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective

such Continuing Employees employment with such entit(y)(ies) and (ii)(A)
December 31, 2007, with respect to existing base salary and bonus compensation

(ii) to continued employment with the Surviving Corporation, the Parent or
any of their respective Subsidiaries. After the Closing, except as expressly
required by this Section 6.6, nothing contained in this Agreement shall

program, policy or other arrangement currently or subsequently maintained by
the Surviving Corporation or the Company or to terminate the employment of
any employee of the Surviving Corporation or the Company for any or no reason.

to Section 2.8, subject to adjustment to correct any errors or omissions.

desirable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner

Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

shall deliver to the Shareholder Representative a copy of each such proposed
Tax Return for taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and for
taxable periods ending after the Closing Date but including periods prior to

Shareholders, shall have the responsibility for, and the right to control, at
the Company Shareholders expense, the audit and/or litigation (and
disposition thereof) of any Tax Return relating to taxable periods ending on
or prior to the Closing Date and shall have the right to participate in the
disposition of the audit of any Tax Return relating to the periods ending
after the Closing Date if and to the extent that such audit or disposition
thereof could give rise to a claim for indemnification under Article 7. Parent
shall have the right directly or through its designated representatives, to
review in advance and comment upon all submissions made by the
Shareholder Representative in the course of audits or appeals thereof to any
Governmental Entity relating to taxable periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date and to approve the disposition of any audit adjustment with
respect to such periods only if such disposition will or might reasonably be
expected to result in an adjustment to the Taxes of Parent or the Company for
any period beginning on  



 

37  or after the Closing; provided, however, that Parent shall not unreasonably
withhold or delay such approval.

6.14 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event of
which it has Company Knowledge that has caused any representation or warranty
of the Company to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect and (ii) the
failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant to be complied with by it hereunder. No such notification shall
affect the representations or warranties of the parties or the conditions to
their respective obligations hereunder. 

6.15 Access and Information. Until the Closing, the Company shall
afford to Parent and its representatives (including accountants and counsel)
reasonable access during normal business hours to all properties, books,

the Code on such Affected Option and (ii) use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain from each such Person an acknowledgement of deferral in
which such Person agrees to defer receipt of any merger consideration payable

specified date or dates no earlier than January 1, 2008. The Company shall
provide Parent with a reasonable and timely opportunity to review and comment

 7.2.1 Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of this
Article 7, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be
indemnified, from and after the Effective Time, solely from the Escrow Fund
(except as set forth in Section 7.3.5), against, and shall be compensated,
reimbursed and paid for, any Damages which are suffered or incurred by a
Parent Indemnified Party from any of the following: (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty of the Company in Article 3 hereof, in the Company
Compliance Certificate or in the Closing Certificate (without giving effect,
solely for the purposes of computing the amount of any Damages, to any
materiality qualification contained or incorporated in such representation or
warranty), (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company, prior
to the Effective Time, in this Agreement, (iii) the amount of any Transaction
Costs not deducted from the Total Merger Consideration, (iv) any assertion or
recovery by any holder of Company Capital Stock of the fair value, interest
and expenses or other amounts pursuant to dissenters rights exercised or
purportedly exercised pursuant to California Law (it being understood that any
such Damages will not include the pro rata share of the Total Merger
Consideration such asserting or recovering stockholder would have received
pursuant to this Agreement), (v) the amount of any Company Debt on the Closing
Date in excess of the amount of Company Debt on the date of this Agreement, to
the extent such amount is not deducted from the Total Merger Consideration
and is determined by Parent within 60 days of the Effective Time, (vi) any
Liability, including any penalties and remediation costs and expenses, related
to, arising out of or incurred in connection with the Companys failure to
ensure that the Company Options and Company Common Stock set forth on Annex
3.13.8 to the Company Disclosure Schedule at all times satisfied all
applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code and related guidance,
(vii) the loss of a tax deduction (such loss computed as the total amount of
Compensatory Arrangements that constitute "parachute payments" under Section
280G of the Code, multiplied by Parents combined federal and state income
tax rate) with respect to compensation payable to or for the benefit of Frank
Ruderman as a result of the application of Section 280G of the Code and
related guidance in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (viii) any Actions, demands or assessments incidental to
any of the matters set forth in clauses (i) through (vii) above (including any
proceeding commenced by any Parent Indemnified Party for the purpose of
enforcing its rights under this Article 7). For purposes of this Agreement,
the term "Parent Indemnified Parties" shall mean Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, and their affiliates and each of their respective directors,
officers, employees, and agents, and the term "Damages" shall mean any loss,
injury, claim, demand, settlement, judgment, award, fine, penalty, Liability,
damage, Tax, Encumbrance, charge, cost or expense of any nature (including
costs and reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements and other litigation
expenses), whether or not involving the claim of another Person, but excluding
any special, indirect, consequential, exemplary and punitive damages and also
excluding any damages associated with any lost profits or lost opportunities;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Damages may include any special, indirect,
consequential, exemplary and punitive damages awarded to any third party in
any Third-Party Claim or agreed upon in settlement of any Third-Party Claim;
_provided_ , _further_ , that for purposes of computing the amount of any
Damages incurred by a Parent Indemnified Party there shall be deducted an
amount equal to the amount of any insurance proceeds actually received or
receivable by a Parent Indemnified Party in connection with such Damages or
any of the circumstances giving rise thereto arising under an insurance policy
purchased by the Company prior to the Effective Time.

 7.2.2 The representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of
the Parties, and the rights and remedies that may be exercised by the Parent
Indemnified Parties, shall not be limited or otherwise affected by or as a
result of any information furnished to, or any investigation made by or
knowledge of, any of the Parent Indemnified Parties or any of their
representatives (except in each case as set forth on the Company Disclosure
Schedule). The Parties recognize and agree that the representations and
warranties also operate as bargained for promises and risk allocation devices
and  



 

39  that, accordingly, any Partys knowledge, and the waiver of any condition
based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the
performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, shall not
affect the right to indemnification or payment of Damages pursuant to this
Article 7.

 7.2.3 In the event the Surviving Corporation suffers, incurs or
otherwise becomes subject to any Damages as a result of or in connection with
any breach or alleged breach of any representation, warranty or covenant,
then (without limiting any of the rights of the Surviving Corporation as a
Parent Indemnified Party) Parent shall also be deemed, by virtue of its
ownership of the stock of the Surviving Corporation, to have incurred Damages
(without duplication) as a result of and in connection with such breach or
alleged breach.

7.3 Survival; Limitation of Liability.

 7.3.1 All representations and warranties made by any Party in this
Agreement and any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Closing, irrespective of any facts known to any Parent
Indemnified Party at or prior to the Closing or any investigation at any time
made by or on behalf of any Parent Indemnified Party (except to the extent set
forth on the Company Disclosure Schedule), and remain in full force and
effect until the fifteen-month anniversary of the Closing Date (the
"Representation Termination Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.2 ( _Company
Capitalization_ ) will survive indefinitely and (ii) if at any time prior to
the Representation Termination Date, Parent delivers to the Shareholder
Representative a notice in accordance with Section 7.4 stating the
existence of a breach of any of the representations and warranties made by
the Company, or a breach of a covenant made by the Company and asserting a
claim for recovery under this Article 7 based on such breach, then the claim
asserted in such notice shall survive the Representation Termination Date
until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. All obligations
of the Parties under the covenants contained herein shall survive (y) until
fully performed or fulfilled, unless non-compliance with such covenants,
agreements or obligations is waived in writing by the Party entitled to such
performance or (z) if not fully performed or fulfilled, until the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations.

 

 7.3.2 Except as set forth in Section 7.3.5, the right of
Parent Indemnified Parties to be indemnified pursuant to this Article 7 shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any (i) breach of any
representation or warranty of the Company and (ii) any breach of any covenant
or agreement of the Company. Subject to Section 7.3.5, no current or former
shareholder, director, officer, employee, affiliate or advisor of the Company
shall have any personal or individual liability of any nature to Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Parent Indemnified Party with respect to any
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in, or any other
breach of, this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge that except as expressly
provided in Article 3, the Company Compliance Certificate and the Closing
Certificate, the Company has not made and is not making any representations or
warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express
or implied; it being expressly understood that nothing herein shall be
construed to limit Parents remedies for fraud or intentional
misrepresentation.

 7.3.3 A Parent Indemnified Party may only seek indemnification under
Section 7.2 if a Parent Indemnified Party has given the Shareholder
Representative written notice of such Parent claim on or before the fifteen-
month anniversary of the Closing Date in the manner set forth in Section 7.4
below.

 7.3.4 Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
indemnification for claims under Section 7.2.1, unless the total amount of all
Damages exceeds $1,500,000 in the aggregate, in which case the Company
Shareholders indemnification obligations hereunder shall apply to the full  



 

40  amount of all such Damages in excess of such amount. In addition, the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification for any
Individual Claim not in excess of $100,000. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the limitations in this Section 7.3.4 shall not
apply to indemnification claims under Section 7.2.1(iii), Section 7.2.1(iv),
Sections 7.2.1(v)(vii) and Section 7.2.1(i) relating to a breach of the
representations set forth in Sections 3.2 ( _Company Capitalization_ ), 3.6 (
_Taxes_ ), 3.13 ( _Employee Benefit Plans_ ) and 3.15 ( _Environmental
Matters_ ) and any Damages incurred for such matters shall not be counted for
purposes of the $1,500,000 basket described above.

 7.3.5 Except with respect to breaches of Section 3.2 and with respect
to fraud or intentional misrepresentation, the Parent Indemnified Parties
sole and exclusive remedy shall be against the Escrow Fund. To the extent
that Damages for which the Parent Indemnified Parties may seek indemnity for a
breach of Section 3.2 or for fraud or intentional misrepresentation exceed the
amount of the Escrow Fund, the Parent Indemnified Parties must first proceed
against the Escrow Fund. After claims for breach of Section 3.2 or fraud or
intentional misrepresentation are finally resolved in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Article 7, the Parent Indemnified Parties will
then have the right to recover any remaining Damages from the Company
Shareholders (including holders of Company Options and Company Warrants) on a
several, but not joint, basis in proportion to the merger consideration
paid or payable to them pursuant to this Agreement up to a maximum amount
equal to the merger consideration actually received by such Company
Shareholder (including holders of Company Options and Company Warrants).
Nothing in this Article 7 shall limit any remedy Parent may have against any
Person for such Persons fraud or intentional misrepresentation. For purposes
of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby and in connection with
any Action arising from or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, "fraud" and "intentional misrepresentation" shall be
defined as a misrepresentation of material fact made by a person on behalf of
the Company that to such persons actual knowledge, at the time the statement
was made, was false and was made with the intent to defraud the Parent, and on
which statement Parent justifiably relied and suffered resulting damage.

 7.3.6 Promptly after Parent or any of the other Parent Indemnified
Parties becomes aware of any event or circumstance that could reasonably be
expected to constitute or give rise to any indemnification claim by a Parent
Indemnified Party under this Article 7, Parent or the Parent Indemnified Party
shall take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate and minimize all
Damages that may result from such event or circumstance; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any expenses and costs related to such steps to mitigate
shall be conclusively considered as Damages for the purposes of this
Agreement, to the extent that such event or circumstance is an indemnifiable
claim.

7.4 Process of Indemnification. Parent shall not be entitled to receive
any payment under Section 7.2 unless Parent shall have given the Shareholder
Representative written notice, on or before the fifteen-month anniversary of
the Closing Date of the existence of Damages for which Parent is seeking
indemnification. Such notice shall contain a reasonably detailed summary of
the basis for the claim, the provision or provisions of this Agreement
alleged to have been inaccurate or breached and, if known, the estimated
amount of the Damages incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by Parent
as a result of such inaccuracy or breach under which such indemnification
is sought. If the Shareholder Representative does not dispute in writing the
basis or amount of any Parent claim within 45 days of receiving written notice
thereof, Parent shall have the right promptly (and in any event within five
Business Days) to recover indemnity from the Escrow Fund as and to the extent
provided herein. If the Shareholder Representative disagrees with the basis
for or amount of the Parent claim specified in the notice, then within 45 days
of receiving written notice thereof, the Shareholder Representative shall
give written notice to Parent of such disagreement (which notice shall contain
a reasonably detailed summary of the basis for such disagreement) and, in that
case, Parent shall have the right promptly (and in any event within five
Business Days) to recover indemnity for any undisputed amount (subject to the
limitations  



 

41  contained in this Article 7) as and to the extent provided herein, but shall
have no right to recover indemnity for any disputed amount hereunder until
such time, if at all, as (i) a court of competent jurisdiction issues a final
and non-appealable order specifying Parents right to recovery hereunder and
the amount thereof, in which case Parent shall have the right promptly (and in
any event within five Business Days) to recover the amount so specified
(subject to the limitations contained in this Article 7), or (ii) Parent and
the Shareholder Representative agree in writing to the amount of Parents
recovery, in which case Parent shall have the right promptly (and in any
event within five Business Days) to recover the amount so agreed.

7.5 Defense of Third-Party Claims.

 7.5.1 Promptly after Parent obtains knowledge of any actual or
possible Action that has been or may be brought or asserted by a third party
against Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Party that may be subject to
indemnification hereunder (a "Third-Party Claim"), Parent shall promptly give
written notice of such Third-Party Claim to the Shareholder Representative,
stating the nature and basis of such Third-Party Claim and the dollar amount
of such Third-Party Claim, to the extent known. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no delay or deficiency on the part of Parent in so notifying the Shareholder
Representative will limit any Parent Indemnified Partys right to
indemnification under this Article 7 (except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the defense of such Action).

 7.5.2 Within 30 days of delivery of such written notice, the
Shareholder Representative may elect (by written notice delivered to Parent)
to take all necessary and proper steps to contest any Third-Party Claim or to
prosecute such Third-Party Claim to conclusion or settlement. If the
Shareholder Representative makes the foregoing election, (i) Parent will have
the right to participate at its own expense in all proceedings; (ii) the
attorneys fees of counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent (approval of such
counsel not to be unreasonably withheld), other professionals and experts
fees and court or arbitration costs incurred by the Shareholder
Representative in connection with defending such Third-Party Claim shall be
payable out of the Escrow Fund (subject to the limitation set forth in Section
7.6.7); (iii) Parent shall make available to the Shareholder Representative
all books, records and other documents and materials that are under the direct
or indirect control of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or other affiliates
and that the Shareholder Representative considers necessary or desirable for
the defense of such Third-Party Claim; (iv) Parent shall execute such
documents and take such other actions as the Shareholder Representative may
reasonably request for the purpose of facilitating the defense of, or
any settlement, compromise or adjustment relating to, such Third-Party Claim;
(v) Parent shall otherwise cooperate as reasonably requested by the
Shareholder Representative in the defense of such Third-Party Claim; (vi)
Parent shall not admit any liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim;
and (vii) the Shareholder Representative shall not enter into any settlement
agreement providing for the settlement of such Third-Party Claim without the
prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. If the Shareholder Representative does not make such
election within such period, then Parent shall be free to handle the
prosecution or defense of any such Third-Party Claim, and will take all
necessary steps to contest the Third-Party Claim or to prosecute such Third-
Party Claim to conclusion or settlement, and will notify the Shareholder
Representative of the progress of any such Third-Party Claim, will permit the
Shareholder Representative, at the sole cost of the Shareholder
Representative, to participate in such prosecution or defense and will provide
the Shareholder Representative with reasonable access to all relevant
information and documentation relating to the Third-Party Claim and the
prosecution or defense thereof.

 7.5.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may the Shareholder
Representative assume, maintain control of, or participate in, the defense of
any proceeding (i) involving Damages in excess of the amount remaining in the
Escrow Fund, (ii) involving criminal liability, (iii) involving claims
relating to any Intellectual Property, (iv) in which any relief other than
monetary  



 

42  damages is sought against a Parent Indemnified Party or (v) in which the
outcome of any judgment or settlement in the matter could materially
adversely affect the business of any Parent Indemnified Party.

 7.5.4 Upon the final resolution of such Third-Party Claim, the
Parent Indemnified Party shall submit such damages, if any, incurred by it to
the Shareholder Representative in accordance with Section 7.4 and the
determination of whether such damages constitute "Damages" for which the
indemnification obligations set forth in Section 7.2 apply, and if so, the
amount of such Damages shall be made in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 7.4 hereof. 

7.6 Shareholder Representative.

 7.6.1 In order to administer efficiently the defense and/or
settlement of any Parent claims for which the Company Shareholders may be
required to indemnify any Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to Article 7
hereof, and to administer efficiently the notice provisions under this
Agreement, all holders of shares of Company Capital Stock, by their
acceptance of merger consideration hereunder, irrevocably appoint the
Shareholder Representative as their agent, attorney-in-fact and representative
(with full power of substitution in the premises), and, by his
execution hereof, the Shareholder Representative hereby accepts such
appointment. For purposes of this Section 7.6, "Company Shareholder" shall
mean all holders of Company Capital Stock, Company Warrants and Company
Options.

 

 7.6.2 The Company Shareholders hereby authorize the
Shareholder Representative to (i) take all action necessary or desirable in
connection with the defense and/or settlement of any Parent claims for which
the Company Shareholders may be required to indemnify any Parent Indemnified
Party pursuant to Article 7 hereof, and (ii) give and receive all notices
required to be given under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the other
agreements contemplated hereby to which the Company Shareholders or their
respective properties or assets are subject. 

 7.6.3 Notwithstanding anything in Article 7 to the contrary, to the
extent that any Parent Indemnified Party makes a claim solely and directly
against any Party (and not from the Escrow Fund) for fraud or intentional
misrepresentation, such claim and any notices, negotiations, defense or
settlements of such claim may only be made to and against such particular
Company Shareholder and the Shareholder Representative shall have no authority
to receive notices, compromises or settlements or defend or take any other
action on behalf of such Company Shareholder.

 7.6.4 In the event that the Shareholder Representative dies, becomes
unable to perform his responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such
position, the Company Shareholders who held a majority of the voting power
represented by the shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall select another
representative to fill such vacancy, and such substituted representative shall
be deemed to be the Shareholder Representative for all purposes of this
Agreement. If the position of Shareholder Representative shall remain vacant
for more than 60 days, Parent may designate any Company Shareholder as the
Shareholder Representative, and such Company Shareholder shall serve as the
Shareholder Representative until the Company Shareholders shall elect a
successor pursuant to this Section 7.6.4.

 7.6.5 All decisions and actions by the Shareholder Representative,
including the defense and/or settlement of any Parent claims for which the
Company Shareholders may be required to indemnify any Parent Indemnified
Party pursuant to Article 7 shall be binding upon all of the Company
Shareholders, and no Company Shareholder shall have the right to object,
dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.



 

43 7.6.6 The Company Shareholders agree that:

7.6.6.1 Parent shall be able to rely conclusively on the instructions
and decisions of the Shareholder Representative as to the settlement of any
Parent claims for indemnification of any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to
Article 7 or any other actions required to be taken by the
Shareholder Representative hereunder, and no Party hereunder shall have any
cause of action against any Parent Indemnified Party for any action taken by
any Parent Indemnified Party in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of
the Shareholder Representative. Notices or communications to or from the
Shareholder Representative constitute notice to or from each of the Company
Shareholders for all purposes under this Agreement.

7.6.6.2 All actions, decisions and instructions of the Shareholder
Representative shall be conclusive and binding upon all Company Shareholders
and no Company Shareholder shall have any cause of action against the
Shareholder Representative for any action taken or not taken, decision made or
instruction given by the Shareholder Representative under this Agreement,
except for fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith by the
Shareholder Representative.

7.6.6.3 The Company Shareholders shall indemnify and hold harmless, in
proportion to their respective distributions of merger consideration, the
Shareholder Representative from all loss, liability or expense (including the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) arising out of or in connection with
the Shareholder Representatives execution and performance of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement, and his actions hereunder and thereunder, except
for fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence by the Shareholder
Representative.

7.6.6.4 The provisions of this Section 7.6 are independent and
severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be
enforceable notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Company
Shareholder may have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

7.6.6.5 The provisions of this Section 7.6 shall be binding upon the
heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns of each Company
Shareholder, and any references in this Agreement to a Company Shareholder
shall mean and include the successors to the rights of such Company
Shareholder hereunder, whether pursuant to testamentary disposition, the laws
of descent and distribution, assignment or otherwise.

7.6.6.6 The Shareholder Representative shall be paid a fee of $100,000
for the performance of his duties and responsibilities under this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement and that such fee shall constitute a Transaction Cost
pursuant to Section 2.6.7.

 7.6.7 All fees and expenses incurred by the Shareholder
Representative in connection with this Agreement in an amount up to $250,000
shall be paid directly from the Escrow Fund within five business days
following a written request by the Shareholder Representative.

 7.6.8 From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide the Shareholder Representative with
reasonable access during normal business hours to specifically identified
information about the Surviving Corporation solely for purposes of objecting
to or verifying or resolving any disputed indemnification claims under this
Agreement, provided that the Shareholder Representative shall treat all such
information at all times as confidential  



 

44  (except in connection with the performance by the Shareholder Representative
of his duties or the exercise of his rights under this Agreement).

 

7.6.9 The Shareholder Representative is hereby authorized by the
Company Shareholders to enter into the Escrow Agreement on the behalf of each
of the Company Shareholders.

7.7 No Right of Indemnity or Contribution. No Company Shareholder has
any right of indemnification or contribution against the Company with respect
to any breach by the Company or the Surviving Corporation of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement or any
Transaction Document, whether by virtue of any contractual or statutory right
of indemnity or otherwise, and all claims to the contrary are hereby waived
and released.

7.8 Exercise of Remedies by Parent Indemnified Parties other than
Parent. No Parent Indemnified Party (other than Parent or any successor or
assignee of Parent) is entitled to assert any indemnification claim or
exercise any other remedy under this Agreement unless Parent (or any successor
or assignee of Parent) consents to the assertion of the indemnification claim
or the exercise of any other remedy.

7.9 Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Any payment made for
indemnification of a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article 7 shall
be treated as an adjustment to the Total Merger Consideration for all Tax
purposes.

Agreement unless otherwise indicated. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The words "include," "includes" and
"including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The headings contained in this Agreement are
only for reference purposes and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. When reference is made herein to "the

the Subsidiaries of an entity shall be deemed to include all direct and
indirect subsidiaries of such entity. Reference to an agreement herein is to
such agreement as amended in accordance with its terms up to the date hereof.
Reference to a statute herein is to such statute, as amended.

10.3 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Shareholder Representative and
delivered to Parent and the Company, it being understood that all such Parties
need not sign the same counterpart.

10.4 Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement, its
Exhibits, Schedules and the documents and instruments and other agreements
among the Parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including
the Company Disclosure Schedule (i) constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof; and (ii) are not intended to confer upon
any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except as set forth in
Section 6.4 hereof (Indemnification; Exculpation; Insurance) or as otherwise
expressly set forth herein.

10.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or
the application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties hereto. The Parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

10.6 Other Remedies; Specific Performance. Except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The
Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that, subject to the terms of Section 10.7, the Parties shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each Party
expressly waives any requirement that any other Party obtain any bond or
provide any indemnity in connection with any action seeking injunctive relief
or specific enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement.

10.7 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and any Actions arising from or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of  



 

51  California, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under
applicable principles of conflicts of law of the State of California or any
other jurisdiction. The Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal
courts located San Mateo County, California for any Actions arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger) (and the Parties agree not to commence any Action
relating thereto except in such courts), and further agree that service of any
process, summons, notice or document by certified mail shall be effective
service of process for any Action brought against the Parties in any such
court. The Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection
to the laying of venue of any Action arising out of this Agreement in the
state or federal courts located in the Northern District of California, and
hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or
claim in any such court that any such Action brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum.

10.8 Rules of Construction. The Parties agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will
be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or document.

10.9 Assignment. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and, at any time after the Required
Shareholder Vote has been taken, holders of Company Capital Stock who hold
such number of shares of Company Capital Stock sufficient to take the Required
Stockholder Vote; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such consent shall be
required for an assignment by Parent of this Agreement and its rights and
obligations (i) to any entity which directly or indirectly owns all of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of Parent or (ii) other than with respect
to Parents obligations under Sections 2.8 and 2.9 hereof, to any entity to
which a material portion of the assets of the Celera Group of Parent are
transferred (which shall include all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company); _provided_ , _however_ , that at the time of any assignment
of Parents obligations, Parent must own less than 70% of such entity and
such entity must have a net book value equal to at least $400 million. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment in violation of this Section
10.9 shall be void.

10.10 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and
the Shareholder Representative hereby irrevocably waives all right to trial by
jury in any Action (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub, the
