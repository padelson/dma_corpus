fractional shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive promptly in exchange
therefor (x) a certificate representing that number of whole Parent Shares
and (y) a check representing the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares,
if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions with respect to the Parent
Shares as provided for in Section 3.3(c), if any, that such holder has the
right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the
provisions of this Article III, after giving effect to any required
withholding Tax. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable to
holders of Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a
certificate representing the proper number of Parent Shares, together with a
check for the cash to be paid pursuant to this Section 3.3 may be issued to
such a transferee if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and the transferee shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Parent or the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code or under any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.   (c) Dividends. No dividends
or other distributions declared with a record date after the Effective Time
on Parent Shares shall be paid with respect to any Shares represented by a
Certificate until such Certificate is surrendered for exchange as provided
herein or a Person claiming a Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed has
complied with the provisions of Section 3.6. Promptly following surrender of
any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates
representing whole Parent Shares issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable
with respect to such whole Parent Shares and not paid, less the amount of any
withholding Taxes which may be required thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender
payable with respect to such whole Parent Shares, less the amount of any
withholding Taxes which may be required thereon. Parent will, no later
than the applicable dividend or distribution payment dates, provide the
Exchange Agent with the cash necessary to make the payments contemplated by
this Section 3.3(c).   -10-     (d) No Fractional Securities. No
fractional Parent Shares shall be issued pursuant hereto. In lieu of the
issuance of any fractional share of Parent Shares, cash adjustments will be
paid to holders in respect of any fractional share of Parent Shares that
would otherwise be issuable, and the amount of such cash adjustment shall be
equal to the product obtained by multiplying such stockholder\'s fractional
share of Parent Shares that would otherwise be issuable by the closing price
per share of Parent Shares on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape on
the Closing Date as reported by The Wall Street Journal (Northeast edition)
(or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source).   (e) No
Further Ownership Rights in Shares. All Parent Shares issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of
this Article III (including any cash paid pursuant to this Section 3.3) shall
be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article III.  
(f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments thereof and any Parent Shares) which remains
undistributed to the holders of Shares for six months after the Effective
Time may be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who
have not theretofore complied with this Article III and the instructions set
forth in the letter of transmittal mailed to such holders after the Effective
Time shall thereafter look only to Parent or its agent (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar laws) for payment of their Parent Shares,
cash and unpaid dividends and distributions on Parent Shares deliverable in
respect of each Share such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to
this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.   (g) No
Liability. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.   Section 3.4 Tax Consequences. It is intended by the parties hereto
that the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, and the parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization" for such purposes.   Section 3.5 Adjustment of
Exchange Ratio. In the event that Parent changes or establishes a record date
for changing the number of Parent Shares issued and outstanding as a result
of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision,
reclassification, combination or similar transaction with respect to the
outstanding Parent Shares and the record date therefor shall be prior to the
Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio applicable to the Merger and any
other calculations based on or relating to Parent Shares shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination or similar
transaction.   -11-     Section 3.6 Lost Certificates. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the
Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against them with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Parent Shares,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Shares to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(b) and any dividends or other
distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section
3.3(c).   Section 3.7 Further Assurances. If at any time after the Effective
Time the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are
necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to
or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties,
permits, licenses or assets of either of the Constituent Corporations, or (b)
otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving
Corporation and its proper officers and directors or their designees shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either of the
Constituent Corporations, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and
assurances and to do, in the name and on behalf of either Constituent
Corporation, all such other acts and things as may be necessary, desirable or
proper to vest, perfect or confirm the Surviving Corporation\'s right, title
or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers,

each material Benefit Plan (including each ERISA Benefit Plan) maintained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as required by law, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has adopted or amended in any
material respect any Benefit Plan since the date of the most recent audited
financial statements included in the Company Filed SEC Documents. None of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any trade or business which has been, during the
six-year period preceding the date hereof, treated as a single employer with

plan years, (iv) any discrimination or coverage tests performed during the
last two (2) plan years and (v) the current summary plan description. True
and complete copies of all written Compensation Commitments and of all
related insurance and annuity policies and contracts and other documents with
respect to each Compensation Commitment have been made available to
Parent.   (c) Each Benefit Plan listed in Item 4.13(a) of the Company Letter
which is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS that such plan is so qualified
under the Code or has been established pursuant to a prototype plan that has
received a favorable opinion letter from the IRS, and no circumstance exists
which might cause such plan to cease being so qualified except for any
circumstance that would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
Each Benefit Plan listed in Item 4.13(a) of the Company Letter complies and
has been maintained in all respects   -18-    with its terms and all
requirements of law and regulations applicable thereto, and there has been no
notice issued by any Governmental Entity questioning or challenging such
compliance, except for any noncompliance or other circumstance that would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has taken any action to take corrective action or make a
filing under any voluntary correction program of the IRS, Department of Labor
or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any Benefit Plan or
Compensation Commitment, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries

of the Company Letter sets forth a list (without specifying the identity of
any customer listed thereon) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 of
the top 25 revenue producing network services customers and the top 25
revenue producing payment services customers, in each case of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Key Customers"), including the amount of

of the Company, threatened termination, cancellation or limitation of, or any
modification or change in, the business relationship of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries with any one or more of the Key Customers, other than as
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the Knowledge of
the Company, there exists no present condition or state of facts or
circumstances involving any Key Customer and their  
-20-    relationships with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which
would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or prevent the conduct of
its business after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in essentially the same manner in which such business has
heretofore been conducted.   Section 4.18 Material Contracts. Except as
filed as exhibits to the Company Filed SEC Documents prior to the date of
this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
or bound by any Contract that (i) is a "material contract" (as such term is
defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC) or (ii)
materially limits or otherwise materially restricts the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or that would, after the Effective Time, materially limit or
otherwise materially restrict Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) or any successor thereto,
from engaging or competing in any material line of business in any geographic
area or that contains most favored nation pricing provisions or exclusivity
or non-solicitation provisions with respect to customers. Each Contract of
the type described in this Section 4.18, whether or not set forth in Item
4.18 of the Company Letter, is referred to herein as a "Company Material
Contract." Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has Knowledge of,
or has received notice of, any violation of or default under (or any
condition which with the passage of time or the giving of notice would
cause such a violation of or default under) any Company Material Contract or
any other Contract to which it is a party or by which it or any of its
properties or assets is bound, except for violations or defaults that would
not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or, after giving effect to
the Merger, Parent. As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any standstill or similar agreement
with any Person which relates to any transaction that could constitute a
Takeover Proposal.   Section 4.19 Required Vote of Company Stockholders. The
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock approving this Agreement is the only vote of the holders
of any class or series of the Company\'s capital stock necessary to approve
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
Section 4.20 State Takeover Statutes. The action of the Board of Directors of
the Company in approving the Merger and this Agreement is sufficient
to render inapplicable to Parent, Sub, the Merger and this Agreement the
provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL. To the Knowledge of the Company, no
"fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other similar
anti-takeover statute or regulation or any anti-takeover provision in the
Company\'s Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws is, or at the
Effective Time will be, applicable to the Company, the Company Common Stock,
the Parent Shares, Parent, Sub or the Merger.   Section 4.21 Brokers. No
broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person, other than
William Blair and Company, L.L.C. ("William Blair") and Goldman, Sachs and Co.
("Goldman Sachs"), the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Company
(and are reflected in an agreement between William Blair and the Company and
an agreement between Goldman Sachs and the Company, complete copies of which
have been furnished to Parent), is entitled to any broker\'s, finder\'s,
financial advisor\'s or other similar fee or commission in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made
by or on behalf of the Company.   -21-     Section 4.22 Opinions of
Financial Advisors. The Company has received the opinions of William Blair
and Goldman Sachs to the effect that, as of the date thereof, the Exchange
Ratio is fair to the Company\'s holders of the Company Common Stock from a
financial point of view.   ARTICLE V  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
PARENT AND SUB   Parent and Sub represent and warrant to the Company as
follows, except as set forth in the Parent Letter or as disclosed in the
Parent Filed SEC Documents (it being understood that any matter set forth in
the Parent Filed SEC Documents shall be deemed to qualify any representation
or warranty in this Article V only to the extent that the description of such
matter in the Parent Filed SEC Documents would be reasonably inferred to be a
qualification with respect to such representation or warranty):   Section
5.1 Organization. Parent and each of its Significant Subsidiaries are duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction of their respective organization and have the requisite
corporate power and authority to carry on their respective businesses as now
being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in
good standing or to have such power and authority would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent and each of its Significant Subsidiaries are
duly qualified or licensed to do business and in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of their respective businesses or the
ownership or leasing of their respective properties makes such qualification
or licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be
so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent has delivered to the Company complete and
correct copies of its Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws and the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of
Sub.   Section 5.2 Subsidiaries. As of the date of this Agreement, Exhibit
21 to Parent\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2002, as filed with the SEC, is a true, accurate and complete statement in

the date of this Agreement, except for the exercise of any Parent Stock
Options referred to in clause (iii) above, Parent has not issued any Parent
Shares or made any grant of awards under the Parent Stock Incentive Plans or
authorized or entered into any Contract to do any of the foregoing. There are
no outstanding stock appreciation rights with respect to the capital stock of

created, additional shares of capital stock, Parent Stock Options or other
voting securities or Parent Stock Equivalents of Parent or of any of its
Significant Subsidiaries or obligating Parent or any of its Significant

other transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of each of Parent and Sub, subject to
approval by Parent\'s stockholders of the issuance of Parent Shares in the
Merger. This Agreement has been approved by Parent as the sole stockholder of

and Sub and (assuming the valid authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company) constitutes the valid and binding obligation of
each of Parent and Sub enforceable against it in accordance with its terms,
except that such enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to the enforcement of
creditors\' rights generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of

Act, the HSR Act, the DGCL, the laws applied by the Bank Regulatory
Authorities, state takeover laws and foreign and supranational laws relating
to antitrust and anticompetition clearances, and except as may be required in
connection with the Taxes described in Section 7.7, neither the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement by Parent or Sub nor the
consummation by Parent or Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby will

any of them or any of their properties or assets may be bound or (iv) violate
any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable
to Parent, Sub, any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any of their

Adverse Effect on Parent.   Section 5.6 SEC Documents and Other Reports.
Parent has timely filed with the SEC all documents required to be filed by it
since December 31, 2000 under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (the
"Parent SEC Documents"). As of their respective filing dates, the Parent SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, each as in effect on
the date so filed, and at the time filed with the SEC none of the Parent SEC
Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC
Documents complied as of their respective dates in all material respects with
the then applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles (except in the case of the unaudited
statements, as   -24-    permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated therein or in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated

respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of its capital stock or
(iv) any change in accounting methods, principles or practices by Parent.  
Section 5.8 Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by Parent or Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement, will, in
the case of the Registration Statement, at the time it becomes effective,
and, in the case of the Proxy Statement, at the time it is first mailed to
the stockholders of the Company or Parent or at the time of the
Stockholders Meetings, contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading or necessary to correct any statement in
any earlier communication by Parent or Sub with respect to the solicitation
of proxies for the Stockholders Meetings which has become false or
misleading. The Registration Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Proxy Statement
will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act, except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent or
Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement based on information supplied
by the Company or any of its representatives specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein or based on information which is not made
in or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or Proxy
Statement but which should have been disclosed by the Company pursuant to
Section 4.8.   Section 5.9 Compliance with Laws; Permits. (a) The businesses
of Parent and its Subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of any
law, ordinance or regulation of any Governmental Entity, except for possible
violations that would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Each of
Parent and its Subsidiaries is in possession of all franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Entity
necessary for Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its
properties or to carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the
"Parent Permits"), except where the failure to have any of the Parent Permits
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, and, as of the date of
this Agreement, no suspension or cancellation of any of the Parent Permits is
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, except where the
suspension or cancellation of any of the Parent Permits would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   -25-     (b) Parent and each of its
officers and directors have complied in all material respects with (i) the
applicable provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley and (ii) the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE. Parent has previously
disclosed to the Company any of the information required to be disclosed by
Parent and certain of its officers to Parent\'s Board of Directors or any
committee thereof pursuant to the certification requirements contained in
Form 10-K and Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act. From the period beginning
January 1, 2000 through the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley, neither Parent nor
any of its Affiliates made any loans to any executive officer or director of
Parent equal to or in excess of $60,000. Since the enactment of Sarbanes-
Oxley, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has made any loans to any
executive officer or director of Parent.   (c) Each executive officer and
director of Parent has complied with all Applicable Laws in connection with
or relating to or actions within the scope of Parent\'s business, except
where the failure to comply would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. No executive officer or director of Parent is a party to or the
subject of any pending or threatened suit, action, proceeding
or investigation by any Governmental Entity that would have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent, except as disclosed in the Parent Filed SEC
Documents.   Section 5.10 Parent Shares. All of the Parent Shares issuable
in exchange for Shares in the Merger in accordance with this Agreement have
been duly authorized and will be, when so issued, validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable and free of preemptive or other similar rights. The
issuance of such Parent Shares will be registered under the Securities Act
and registered or exempt from registration under applicable state securities
laws. The Parent Shares that will become subject to options to purchase
Parent Shares pursuant to Section 7.2(a) have been duly authorized. Upon
payment to Parent of the appropriate exercise price, those Parent Shares will
be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.   Section 5.11
Reorganization. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has taken or agreed
to take any action that, to the Knowledge of Parent, will (or will be
reasonably likely to) prevent the Merger from qualifying as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. To
the Knowledge of Parent, the representations set forth in the Parent Tax
Certificate attached to the Parent Letter, if made on the date hereof
(assuming the Merger were consummated on the date hereof and based on
reasonable estimates in the case of certain information not available on the
date hereof), would be true and correct in all material respects.   Section
5.12 Litigation. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no suit, action,
proceeding or investigation pending against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
that would have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Neither Parent nor any

writ, injunction or decree that would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.   Section 5.13 Parent Benefit Plans. Except for any circumstance

Benefit Plan of Parent has been maintained and operated in substantial
compliance with its terms, the applicable requirements of the Code and ERISA
and the regulations issued thereunder; (ii) no material litigation or
asserted claims against Parent exist with respect to any such ERISA Benefit
Plan other than claims for benefits in the normal course of business; and
(iii) no such ERISA Benefit Plan is a "multi-employer   -26-    plan"
as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. With respect to each ERISA
Benefit Plan of Parent which is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code, no accumulated funding deficiencies under Title IV of ERISA
or the Code have been incurred or are reasonably likely to be incurred by
Parent or by any trade or business that together with the Parent would be
deemed a "single employer" under Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA
Affiliate"), except for any potential liability which would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent or any ERISA Affiliate.   Section 5.14
Liabilities. Since December 31, 2002, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred any liabilities or obligations of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), other than
liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business since
December 31, 2002 and liabilities or obligations which would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   Section 5.15 Interim Operations of
Sub. Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated hereby, has engaged in no business or other activities, has
incurred no liabilities or obligations, other than as contemplated hereby,
and will conduct its activities only as contemplated hereby.   Section 5.16

provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, no "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover
statute or regulation or any anti-takeover provision in Parent\'s Second
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws is, or at the
Effective Time will be, applicable to the Parent Shares, Parent, Sub or the
Merger.   Section 5.17 Required Vote of Parent Stockholders. The affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the Parent Shares represented at the
Parent Stockholder Meeting (provided that at least a majority of the Parent
Shares are represented in person or by proxy at such meeting) approving the
issuance of Parent Shares in the Merger is the only vote of the holders of
any class or series of Parent\'s capital stock necessary to approve this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Section
5.18 Brokers. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other
Person, other than Merrill Lynch and Co. ("Merrill Lynch") and J.P.
Morgan Securities, Inc. ("J.P. Morgan"), the fees and expenses of which will
be paid by Parent, is entitled to any broker\'s, finder\'s, financial
advisor\'s or other similar fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of Parent or Sub.   Section 5.19 Opinions of Financial Advisor.
Parent has received the opinions of each of Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan to
the effect that, as of the date of such opinions, the Exchange Ratio is fair
to Parent from a financial point of view.   ARTICLE VI  COVENANTS RELATING

(iv), (v) and (vi).   Section 6.2 No Solicitation. (a) As of the date
hereof, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, nor shall it or its Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries
regarding, or the making of any proposal which constitutes, any Takeover
Proposal, (ii) enter into any letter of intent or agreement related to any
Takeover Proposal other than a confidentiality agreement (each, an
"Acquisition Agreement") or (iii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or take any other action knowingly to facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal; provided, however,
that if, at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, and without
any breach of the terms of this Section 6.2(a), the Company receives
a Takeover Proposal from any Person that in the good faith judgment of
the Company\'s Board of Directors is, or is reasonably likely to lead to the
delivery of, a Superior Proposal, the Company may (x) furnish information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company to any such
Person pursuant to a confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality
provisions no more favorable to such Person than those in the Confidentiality
Agreement and (y) participate in negotiations with such Person regarding such
Takeover Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "Takeover Proposal" means
any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent and its
Affiliates) relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 25%
or more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of
the voting power of the capital stock of the Company or the capital stock of
such Subsidiaries then outstanding, any tender offer or exchange offer that
if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 25% or more of
the voting power of the capital stock of the Company or the capital stock of
such Subsidiaries then outstanding, or any merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company, other than the transactions with Parent
and Sub contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a
"Superior Proposal" means any bona fide Takeover Proposal made  
-31-    by any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates) to acquire,
directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash and/or
securities, more than 50% of the voting power of the Shares then outstanding
or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and otherwise on terms
which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith would,
if consummated, result in a transaction that would, or would be reasonably
likely to, be more favorable to the stockholders of the Company (taking into
account such factors as the Company\'s Board of Directors in good faith deems
relevant, including the identity of the offeror and all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, including the terms of any
financing and the likelihood that the transaction will be consummated) than
the transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) Except as set forth in Section
9.1(e), neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent, the approval or recommendation by such Board of
Directors or such committee of the Merger or this Agreement; (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal; or
(iii) authorize or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into any Acquisition Agreement.   (c) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2
shall prohibit the Company from complying with Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to a Takeover Proposal.  
(d) The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company
shall direct its and its Subsidiaries\' respective officers,
directors, employees, representatives and agents to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Persons with respect to any Takeover Proposal. The Company agrees that it
will notify Parent promptly (but no later than 24 hours) if, to the
Company\'s Knowledge, any Takeover Proposal is received by, any information
is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations relating to a Takeover
Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company, its
Subsidiaries, or their officers, directors, employees, representatives or
agents. The notice shall indicate the name of the Person making such Takeover
Proposal or taking such action and the material terms and conditions of any
proposals or offers, and thereafter the Company shall keep Parent informed,
on a current basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers
and the status of any such discussions or negotiations. The Company also
agrees that it will promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed
a confidentiality agreement in connection with any Takeover Proposal to
return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such
Person by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries.   Section 6.3
Disclosure of Certain Matters; Delivery of Certain Filings. The Company shall
promptly advise Parent orally and in writing if there exists a material
breach of a representation or warranty contained herein or if there occurs,
to the Knowledge of the Company, any change or event which results in the
executive officers of the Company having a good faith belief that such change
or event has resulted in, or is reasonably likely to result in, a material
breach of a representation or warranty contained herein. Parent
shall promptly advise the Company orally and in writing if there exists a
material breach of a representation or warranty contained herein or if there
occurs, to the Knowledge of Parent, any change or event which results in the
executive officers of Parent having a good faith belief that such change
or   -32-    event has resulted in, or is reasonably likely to result
in, a material breach of a representation or warranty contained herein. The
Company shall provide to Parent, and Parent shall provide to the Company,
copies of all filings made by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, with
any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 6.4 Conduct of Business of Sub
Pending the Merger. During the period from the date of this Agreement through
the Effective Time, Sub shall not engage in any activity or incur any
liabilities or obligations of any nature except as expressly provided in or
contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 6.5 NYSE Listing. Promptly after
the date of this Agreement, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Parent Shares issuable in the Merger to be approved for listing on
the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance.   ARTICLE VII 
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   Section 7.1 Employee Benefits. (a) Parent agrees
that, following the Effective Time, the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries will be eligible to participate in the employee benefit plans of
Parent on substantially the same terms and conditions of similarly situated
employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries, as applicable. Parent will cause
such employee benefit plans to take into account for purposes of benefit
accrual, eligibility and vesting thereunder service by employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as if such service were with Parent to the same
extent that such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company;
provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
such employees shall not receive such credit for purposes of determining
Service Related Contributions under the First Data Incentive Savings Plan or
any defined benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates and
provided, further, that with respect to those employees of the Company who
are, prior to the Effective Time, eligible for and receiving a fifty percent
(50%) employer matching contribution between 3% and 6% of such employee\'s
compensation under the Company\'s 401(k) Plan (the "Employer
Match"), following the Effective Time Parent shall increase the compensation
of such employees in an amount to compensate such employees given that
their participation in the First Data Incentive Savings Plan following the
Effective Time will not allow for the Employer Match. Any restriction on
coverage for pre-existing conditions or requirement for evidence of
insurability under the employee benefit plans of Parent shall be waived, and
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall receive credit under the
employee benefit plans of Parent for co-payments and payments under a
deductible limit made by them and for out-of-pocket maximums applicable to
them during the plan year of the applicable Benefit Plan of the Company or
any such Subsidiary in accordance with the corresponding employee benefit
plans of Parent, provided that the amounts of such co-payments and payments
and out-of-pocket maximums as of the Closing Date with respect to such
employees shall be provided by the Company to Parent on the Closing Date.
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all binding
compensation and employee benefit obligations to current and former employees
under the Benefit Plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the
extent set forth in the Company Letter, all employee severance plans
(or policies) in existence on the date hereof and set forth in the Company
Letter and all employment or severance agreements entered  
-33-    into by the Company or adopted by the Board of Directors of the
Company prior to the date hereof and, in each case, previously disclosed to
Parent. The severance benefits to be provided by Parent to employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time shall be substantially
as set forth in the Severance Plan attached in Item 7.1 of the Parent
Letter.   (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting
the power of the Surviving Corporation or Parent to amend or terminate
any particular Benefit Plan or Compensation Commitment or any other
particular employee benefit plan, program, agreement or policy or as
requiring the Surviving Corporation or Parent to offer to continue the
employment of any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries for any period
of time or to offer to continue (other than as required by its written terms)
any Compensation Commitment.   (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company\'s Board of Directors shall adopt resolutions terminating the
Company\'s 401(k) Plan effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.
After the Effective Time, employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
be entitled to elect to roll over any distributions they are eligible to
receive from the Company\'s 401(k) Plan (including outstanding loans) to the
First Data Corporation Incentive Savings Plan.   (d) The Company may
implement a retention plan (the "Retention Plan") for the benefit of those
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries selected by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, which Retention Plan
shall involve aggregate benefits to such employees equal to $10,000,000 (the
"Retention Plan Amount"); provided, however, that not less than seventy-five
percent (75%) of such retention benefits shall be in the form of cash and the
remaining portion of such retention benefits shall be in the form of Parent
Stock Options (the value of which shall be determined by the Black-Scholes
valuation model on the date of grant) which shall be granted within 90 days
after the Closing Date; and provided, further, that the allocation of such
benefits among such employees shall be proposed by the Compensation Committee
of the Board of Directors of the Company and shall be subject to the approval
of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld); and provided, further,
that up to fifty percent (50%) of the Retention Plan Amount (consisting of
cash) shall be payable to such employees on the Closing Date and the
remaining portion of the Retention Plan Amount shall be payable no earlier
than the six month anniversary of the Closing Date.   Section 7.2 Options.
(a) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option, whether
or not exercisable and whether or not vested, under the Company Stock Plans,
shall be converted into an option to purchase Parent Shares. Each Company
Stock Option so converted shall be exercisable upon the same terms and
conditions as under the applicable Company Stock Plan and the applicable
option agreement issued thereunder, except that (i) each Company Stock Option
shall vest and become immediately exercisable at the Effective Time, (ii)
each such Company Stock Option shall be exercisable for that whole number of
Parent Shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the number of
Shares subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, and (iii) the option
price per Parent Share shall be an amount equal to the option price per Share
subject to such Company Stock Option in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio (the option price per share, as
so determined, being rounded to the nearest whole cent).   -34-     (b)
Parent shall (i) on or prior to the Effective Time, reserve for issuance the
number of Parent Shares that will become subject to options to purchase
Parent Shares ("Parent Options") pursuant to Section 7.2(a), (ii) from and
after the Effective Time, upon exercise of the Parent Options in
accordance with the terms thereof, make available for issuance all Parent
Shares covered thereby, (iii) at the Effective Time, assume the Company Stock
Plans, with the result that all obligations of the Company under the Company
Stock Plans, including with respect to Company Stock Options outstanding, at
the Effective Time, shall be obligations of Parent following the Effective
Time, and (iv) as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, issue to
each holder of an outstanding Company Stock Option a document evidencing the
foregoing assumption by Parent.   (c) Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities
Act covering the Parent Shares issuable upon the exercise of Parent Options
created upon the assumption by Parent of Company Stock Options under Section
7.2(a), and will maintain the effectiveness of such registration, and the
current status of the prospectus contained therein, until the exercise or
expiration of such Parent Options. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Parent Shares issuable upon the exercise of Parent options
created upon the assumption by Parent of Company Stock Options under Section
7.2(a) to be approved for listing on the NYSE promptly after the Effective
Time.   Section 7.3 Stockholder Approval; Preparation of Proxy Statement;
Other Actions. (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, each of the Company and Parent will duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold meetings of their respective stockholders (including any
adjournments or postponements thereof, the "Company Stockholders Meeting" and
the "Parent Stockholders Meeting", respectively, and collectively, the
"Stockholders Meetings") for the purpose, in the case of the Company, of
obtaining approval of the Agreement ("Company Stockholder Approval") and, in
the case of Parent, of obtaining approval of the issuance of Parent Shares in
the Merger ("Parent Stockholder Approval"). Parent and the Company will use
their reasonable best efforts to hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting and the
Company Stockholders Meeting on the same date. The Company shall, through its
Board of Directors (but subject to the right of the Company to terminate this
Agreement as set forth in Section 9.1(e)), recommend to its stockholders that
the Company Stockholder Approval be given. Parent shall, through its Board of
Directors, recommend to its stockholders that the Parent Stockholder Approval
be given. This Agreement shall be submitted to the Company\'s stockholders at
the Company Stockholders Meeting whether or not the Board of Directors of the
Company determines at any time that this Agreement is no longer advisable and
recommends that stockholders reject it.   (b) The Company and Parent shall
promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement and Parent shall
prepare (in consultation with the Company) and file with the SEC the
Registration Statement which will include the Proxy Statement as a
prospectus. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and
use reasonable best efforts to keep the Registration Statement effective as
long as is necessary to consummate the Merger. As promptly as practicable
after the Registration Statement shall have become effective and the Proxy
Statement shall have been cleared by the SEC, each of Parent  
-35-    and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to distribute
the Proxy Statement to its respective stockholders.   (c) No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement, and no correspondence with the SEC with respect thereto, will be
made by Parent or the Company without providing the other party the
opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent will advise the Company,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration
Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed,
the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the
Parent Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the
Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests
by the SEC for additional information. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent
or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any
of the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement, so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law,
disseminated to the stockholders of Parent and the Company.   (d) Each of
the Company and Parent each shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause to be delivered a letter of its independent auditors, dated (i) the
date two business days prior to the date on which the Registration Statement
shall become effective and (ii) the Closing Date, and addressed to the other
party and its directors, in form and substance customary for "comfort"
letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements similar to the Registration Statement.   Section 7.4
Access to Information. Upon reasonable notice and subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of February 18, 2003, between the Company
and Parent, as the same may be amended, supplemented or modified (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), each of Company and Parent shall, and shall
cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the other party, and
its respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel and
other representatives all reasonable access, during normal business hours
during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all their respective
properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and, during such
period, each of Company and Parent shall (and shall cause each of its
respective Subsidiaries to) make available to the other party or its
designated advisors (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of the federal or state securities laws or the
federal Tax laws and (b) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as the other party may reasonably request. Subject
to Applicable Law, the Company further agrees to, and shall direct its
Subsidiaries to, reasonably assist and cooperate with Parent in
any integration planning to take effect after consummation of the Merger. In
the event of a termination of this Agreement for any reason, each party
shall promptly return or destroy, or cause to be returned or destroyed, all
nonpublic information so obtained from the other party or any of its
Subsidiaries.   -36-      Section 7.5 Fees and Expenses. Except as
provided in this Section 7.5, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not
the Merger is consummated; provided, however, that Parent and the Company
shall share equally all fees and expenses (other than attorneys\' and
accounting fees and expenses) incurred in relation to the printing and filing
of the Proxy Statement (including any related preliminary materials) and the
Registration Statement (including financial statements and exhibits) and any
amendments or supplements thereto.   Section 7.6 Public Announcements;
Employee Communications. Parent and the Company will consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by Applicable Law, fiduciary duties
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange.   Section 7.7 Transfer Taxes. The Company and Parent
shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property
transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and
stamp Taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any
similar Taxes which become payable by the Company, Parent or Sub in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together
with any related interest, penalties or additions to Tax, "Transfer Taxes").
All Transfer Taxes shall be paid by the Company and expressly shall not be a
liability of any holder of Company Common Stock.   Section 7.8 State
Takeover Laws. If any "fair price" or "control share acquisition" statute or
other similar statute or regulation shall become applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby, Parent, Sub and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act
to minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 7.9 Indemnification; Directors
and Officers Insurance. (a) To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable
Law, for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time (or, in
the case of matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time that have not
been resolved prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, until
such matters are finally resolved), Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor and indemnify under, and shall itself honor and
indemnify under as if it were the Surviving Corporation, all rights
to indemnification or exculpation (including rights relating to advancement
of expenses and indemnification rights to which such persons are entitled
because they are serving as a director, officer, agent or employee of another
entity at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), existing in
favor of a director, officer, employee or agent (an "Indemnified Person") of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, the Bylaws of the Company or any
indemnification agreement (copies of which agreements, if any, have been
furnished to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement), in each case, as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, and relating to actions or events
through the Effective Time; provided,   -37-    however, that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to indemnify any Indemnified
Person in connection with any proceeding (or portion thereof) to the extent
involving any claim initiated by such Indemnified Person unless
the initiation of such proceeding (or portion thereof) was authorized by the
Board of Directors of the Company or unless such proceeding is brought by
an Indemnified Person to enforce rights under this Section 7.9; provided
further that any determination required to be made with respect to whether
an Indemnified Person\'s conduct complies with the standards set forth under
the DGCL, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, the
Bylaws of the Company or any such agreement, as the case may be, shall be
made by independent legal counsel selected by such Indemnified Person and
reasonably acceptable to Parent; and provided further that nothing in this
Section 7.9 shall impair any rights of any Indemnified Person. Without
limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, in the event that any
Indemnified Person becomes involved in any actual or threatened action, suit,
claim, proceeding or investigation covered by this Section 7.9 after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
promptly advance to such Indemnified Person his or her legal and other
expenses (including the cost of any investigation and preparation incurred in
connection therewith), subject to the providing by such Indemnified Person of
an undertaking, which shall not be required to be secured, to reimburse all
amounts so advanced in the event of a nonappealable determination of a court
of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled
thereto.   (b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, maintain the Company\'s existing officers\' and directors\' liability
insurance ("DandO; Insurance") for a period of six years after the Effective
Time so long as the annual premium therefor is not in excess of 300% of the
last annual premium paid prior to the date hereof (the "Current Premium");
provided, however, that if the existing DandO; Insurance expires, is terminated
or cancelled during such six-year period or is at an annual premium in excess
of 300% of the Current Premium, the Surviving Corporation will use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain as much DandO; Insurance as can be obtained
for the remainder of such period for a premium not in excess of 300% (on an
annualized basis) of the Current Premium. Item 7.9 of the Company Letter sets
forth the last annual premium paid prior to the date hereof.   (c) The
provisions of this Section 7.9 are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or
her personal representatives and shall be binding on all successors and
assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation.   Section 7.10
Appropriate Actions; Consents; Filings. (a) The Company and Parent shall
cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) reasonable best efforts to take or cause to
be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary,
proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and Applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable, including preparing
and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all
necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as
practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any administrative
or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted),   -38-    including by a private party, to prohibit the
Merger, the Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to
avoid the institution of any such action or proceeding and to contest and
resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any temporary, preliminary or permanent decree, judgment,
injunction or other order that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents,
delays or restricts consummation of the Merger (it being understood that the
foregoing obligation of the parties hereto will cease in the event a
permanent decree, judgment, injunction or other order is issued or is
in effect that is non-appealable and prohibits, prevents, delays or
restricts consummation of the Merger).   (b) Subject to Applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will
consult the other on, all the information relating to Parent or the Company,
as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in
any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable.   (c) Subject to Applicable Laws relating to the exchange
of information, the Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the
other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its

Statement, the Registration Statement or any other statement, filing, notice
or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (d) The Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised
of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notice or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case
may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent each shall give prompt
notice to the other of any change that is reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent, respectively. Neither the
Company nor Parent shall permit any of its officers, employees or any other
representatives or agents to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to
the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat.   (e) Parent does not intend to become, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to avoid becoming, a bank holding company or
financial holding company under the Bank Act on an ongoing basis as a result
of the Merger. The Company shall assist and cooperate with Parent (i) in the
preparation and submission of any regulatory applications and filings with
applicable Bank Regulatory Authorities that are reasonably necessary to give
effect to such intent and (ii) in the pursuit of any other actions that are
reasonably necessary to give effect to such intent, including without
imitation assisting in obtaining consents and approvals for transfers and  
-39-    assignments of assets and liabilities of Concord EFS National
Bank. The parties agree that such efforts may include, if necessary to
effectuate the foregoing intent, the transfer of assets and liabilities of
Concord EFS National Bank or other reorganization or restructuring of Concord
EFS National Bank (collectively, a "Bank Restructuring") either after or
immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that the parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the Bank Restructuring to be
consummated after the Effective Time. In no event shall the Company be
obligated to transfer any asset or liability of Concord EFS National Bank or
otherwise consummate any Bank Restructuring prior to the Effective Time
unless and until all other conditions set forth in Article VIII have been
satisfied or waived and the closing of the Merger will be completed
immediately thereafter.   Section 7.11 Section 16 Matters. The Board of

to deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, prior to the Effective Time,
an Affiliate Letter in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A from each such
Person.   Section 7.13 Board of Directors Representative. At or prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall expand its Board of Directors by one member

any Governmental Entity in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby by the Company, Parent and Sub shall have been made or

Obligations of the Company to Effect the Merger. The obligation of the
Company to effect the Merger shall be subject to the fulfillment at or prior
to the Effective Time of the following additional conditions:   (a)

warranties of Parent and Sub set forth in Sections 5.3 (Capital
Structure) and 5.4 (Authority) shall be true and correct with respect to
those matters that are qualified by Material Adverse Effect or materiality
and shall be true and correct in all material respects with respect to those
matters that are not so qualified, in each case as of the Effective Time as
though made on and as of the Effective Time (except to the extent any such

other than those listed in the preceding sentence, shall be true and correct
at the Effective Time unless the inaccuracies (without giving effect to any
materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifications or exceptions contained
therein) in respect of such representations and warranties, taking all the
inaccuracies in respect of all such representations and warranties together
in their entirety, do not result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent;
provided, however, that representations and warranties that expressly speak

Parent and Sub by a duly authorized officer of Parent to such effect.

of Kirkland and Ellis, special counsel to the Company, or other law firm of
national standing, to the effect that the Merger will be treated for federal

of the Code, and that each of Parent, Sub and the Company will be a party to
that reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code. In
rendering such opinion, Kirkland and Ellis (or other law firm of national
standing) may rely upon representations contained herein and representations
from the Company substantially to the effect of the representations in the
Parent Tax Certificate attached to the Parent Letter and representations from
the Company substantially to the effect of the representations in the Company

that are qualified by Material Adverse Effect or materiality and shall be
true and correct in all material respects with respect to those matters that
are not so qualified, in each case as of the Effective Time as though made on
and as of the Effective Time (except to the extent any such representation
and warranty expressly speaks as of a specified date). The representations
and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement, other than those
listed in the preceding sentence, shall be true and correct at the Effective
Time unless the inaccuracies (without giving effect to any materiality or
Material Adverse Effect qualifications or exceptions contained therein) in
respect of such representations and warranties, taking all the inaccuracies
in respect of all such representations and warranties together in their
entirety, do not result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company;

consent required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, no Governmental Entity shall have imposed or shall have sought to

the consent or approval of each Person whose consent or approval shall be
required under any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party, except those for which the failure to obtain such consent of
approval would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or, after
giving effect to the Merger, Parent.   (f) Tax Opinion. Parent shall have
received an opinion dated the Closing Date, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, of Sidley Austin Brown and Wood, special counsel to
Parent, or other law firm of national standing, to the effect that the Merger
will be treated for federal income Tax purposes as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that each of Parent, Sub and
the Company will be a party to that reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(b) of the Code. In rendering such opinion, Sidley Austin Brown and
Wood (or other law firm of national standing) may rely upon representations
contained herein and representations from Parent substantially to the effect
of the representations in the Parent Tax Certificate attached to the Parent
Letter and representations from the Company substantially to the effect of

its recommendation of, this Agreement and the   -43-    Merger or (ii)
the Board of Directors of the Company (or any committee thereof) shall have
approved or recommended any Takeover Proposal;   (e) by the Company if (A)
the Board of Directors of the Company authorizes the Company, subject to
complying with the terms of this Agreement, to enter into a definitive
agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal and
the Company notifies Parent in writing that it intends to enter into such an
agreement, (B) Parent does not make, within three business days of receipt of
the Company\'s written notification of its intention to enter into a
definitive agreement for a Superior Proposal, an offer that the Board

its financial advisors, is at least as favorable, in the aggregate, to
the stockholders of the Company as the Superior Proposal and (C) the Company
prior to or concurrently with such termination pays to Parent in immediately
available funds the Termination Fee. The Company agrees (x) that it will not
enter into a definitive agreement referred to in clause (A) above until at

by the Company if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement made by Parent or Sub in this Agreement, or any
such representation and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of
this Agreement, in each case such that Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b)
would not be satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable or, if
curable, is not cured within 30 days after written notice thereof is given by

VIII other than Section 8.1(e) shall have been satisfied, or are capable of
being satisfied, by such date, January 31, 2004 (the "Extended End
Date"); provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 9.1(i) shall not be available to any party whose failure to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of or resulted
in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before the End Date or Extended
End Date, as applicable.   Section 9.2 Effect of Termination. (a) In the
event of a termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as
provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company
or their respective officers or directors, except with respect to Section
4.21, Section 5.18, Section 7.5, this Section 9.2 and Article X and the last

breach hereof.   (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by
Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(ii) or (ii) by the Company pursuant to

Fee").   (c) In the event that (i) after the date hereof a Takeover
Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed or any Person shall have publicly
disclosed that, subject to the Merger being disapproved by the Company\'s
stockholders or otherwise rejected, it will make a Takeover Proposal with
respect to the Company and thereafter, in each case, this Agreement is
terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(h)(i) or (ii)
this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(i), and, in
the case of both clause (i) and clause (ii), concurrently with such
termination or within nine months of such termination the Company enters into
a definitive agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal or consummates a
Takeover Proposal, then the Company shall, upon the earlier of entering into
a definitive agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal or consummating a
Takeover Proposal, pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the Termination Fee.   (d) In the event that this Agreement is
terminated by the Parent or Company: (i) pursuant to Section 9.1(b) due to
the entry of a permanent order, decree or ruling enjoining, restraining or
otherwise prohibiting the Merger on antitrust grounds; or (ii) pursuant to
Section 9.1(i) in the event that the Merger shall not have been consummated
by the Extended End Date solely as a result of the failure to obtain
necessary antitrust approvals, then, in either case, Parent shall, one
business day after the date of such termination by the Company or on the date
of such termination by Parent, pay the Company, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, a fee equal to $25,000,000.   (e) The Company
and Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained in Sections 9.2(b),
9.2(c) and 9.2(d) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent or the Company, as
applicable, would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Parent or
the Company, as applicable, fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to
Section 9.2(d) or Sections 9.2(b) and 9.2(c), as the case may be, and, in
order to obtain such payment, the Company or Parent, as applicable, commences
a suit which results in a judgment against Parent or the Company,
as applicable, for any of the fee set forth in Section 9.2(d) or the
Termination Fee set forth in Sections 9.2(b) and 9.2(c), as the case may be,
Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall pay to the Company or Parent, as
applicable, its costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amount of such fee or
Termination Fee, as the case may be, at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made.   Section 9.3
Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time
prior to the Effective Time (either before or after obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval), but if (i)
the Company Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained, thereafter no
amendment shall be made which by law requires further  
-45-    approval by the Company\'s stockholders without obtaining such
further approval or (ii) the Parent Stockholder Approval shall have been
obtained, thereafter no amendment shall be made which by law requires further
approval by Parent\'s stockholders without obtaining such further approval.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of the parties hereto.   Section 9.4 Extension; Waiver.
At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken
or authorized by their respective Board of Directors, may, to the extent
legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein; provided, however, that such
extension or waiver shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Any agreement on the part
of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of
any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement
or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.   ARTICLE X 
GENERAL PROVISIONS   Section 10.1 Non-Survival of Representations and
Warranties and Agreements. None of the representations and warranties in this
