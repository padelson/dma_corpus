acceptances until such time;

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SCHEME 

| 
---|--- 

7.1

|

Where the Acquisition is being implemented by way of the Scheme, MMC BidCo
undertakes that before the Sanction Hearing, it shall deliver a notice in
writing to JLT either: 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

confirming the satisfaction or waiver of all Conditions (other than the Scheme
Condition); or 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

confirming its intention to invoke one or more of the Conditions (if permitted
by the Panel) and providing reasonable details of the ground on which it
intends to invoke such Condition(s), which MMC BidCo reasonably considers
entitles it to invoke such Condition or treat it as unsatisfied or incapable
of satisfaction, 

and, in circumstances where MMC BidCo confirms the satisfaction or waiver of
all Conditions (other than the Scheme Condition), MMC BidCo agrees that JLT
shall be permitted to take the necessary steps to procure that the Sanction
Hearing is duly held as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.

| 
---|--- 

7.2

|

If the Acquisition is being implemented by way of the Scheme, and to the
extent that all Conditions (other than the Condition set out in paragraph 2(C)
of Part A of Appendix 1 to the Announcement) have been satisfied or waived
prior to or on the date of the Sanction Hearing, MMC BidCo shall instruct
counsel to appear on its behalf at the Sanction Hearing and undertake to the
Court to be bound by the terms of the Scheme in so far as it relates to MMC
BidCo to the extent that all the Conditions have been satisfied or waived
prior to or on the date of the Sanction Hearing. 

| 
---|--- 

7.3

|

If MMC BidCo becomes aware of any fact, matter or circumstance that it
reasonably considers would allow any of the Conditions to be invoked (applying
the test set out in Rule 13.5 of the Code and the Panel would permit it to so
invoke), MMC BidCo (subject to any restriction under applicable law) shall
inform JLT promptly. 

|

Schedule. 

| 
---|--- 

8.2

The parties agree that if the Acquisition is implemented by way of the Scheme,
the timetable for its implementation shall be fixed so as to enable options
and awards under the relevant JLT Share Plans which provide for exercise
and/or vesting upon the sanction of the Scheme by the Court to be exercised or
vest in sufficient time to enable the resulting JLT Shares to be bound by the
Scheme on the same terms as the JLT Shares held by JLT Shareholders. 

| 
---|--- 

8.3

|

On and from the Effective Date, the MMC Group undertakes not to take any
action which would prevent or restrict JLT from complying with its obligations

advance expenses, and provide all reasonable assistance to the current JLT
Directors and officers to the extent they need to make a claim against the
existing JLT directors\' and officers\' insurance policy (including an
associated run off cover), in each case with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Date. 

| 
---|--- 

9.2

|

officers\' liability insurance cover for both current and former directors and

whose employment is terminated as a result of the Acquisition, for acts and
omissions up to and including the Effective Date, in the form of runoff cover
for a period of six years following the Effective Date and such insurance

directors\' and officers\' liability insurance as at the date of this
Agreement.

SCHEDULE 2 
EMPLOYEE RELATED MATTERS

MMC and JLT agree that the following arrangements will, subject to the Scheme
becoming effective in accordance with its terms, apply to the JLT Share Plans
and Employees.

In the event that the Acquisition is effected as an Offer, references to the
date on which the Scheme is sanctioned by the court ("Court Sanction Date")
and the Effective Date will be read as if they referred to the date on which
the Offer becomes or is declared unconditional in all respects.

PART 1 
JLT SHARE PLANS

Provisions of general application

| 
---|--- 

1.

|

MMC acknowledges that, before the Effective Date, JLT may operate the JLT
Share Plans in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan and consistent
with normal JLT practice, particularly in relation to the value of awards
granted. For the avoidance of doubt, this includes (without limitation):
granting awards, determining the extent to which awards vest and satisfying
the vesting of awards and exercise of options. 

| 
---|--- 

2.

|

MMC and JLT agree that: 

| 
---|--- 

2.1

|

the Scheme will apply to any JLT Shares acquired by participants in the JLT
Share Plans prior to the Scheme Voting Record Time; 

| 
---|--- 

2.2

|

JLT may amend the rules of the JLT Share Plans if the JLT Directors are of the
opinion that such amendments are necessary or desirable to implement the
Scheme, facilitate the administration of the JLT Share Plans or obtain or
maintain favourable tax treatment for participants or for JLT. However before
doing so they will consult with MMC and take into account any representations
made by MMC; 

| 
---|--- 

2.3

|

MMC and JLT shall co-operate to write to participants in the JLT Share Plans
to inform them of the impact of the Scheme on their outstanding options and
awards under the JLT Share Plans ("Awards") and the extent to which their
Awards will vest and become exercisable as a result of the Scheme. These
communications will be agreed between MMC and JLT before they are sent to
participants on the date that the Scheme Document is posted; and 

| 
---|--- 

2.4

|

JLT Shareholder approval will be sought for an amendment to the articles of
association of JLT so that any JLT Shares issued or transferred after the
Effective Date will be automatically transferred to, or to the order of, MMC
in exchange for the provision by MMC of the same consideration payable per JLT
Share under the Scheme (or such other consideration as may be agreed between
MMC and JLT and disclosed in the Scheme Document).

the rules of the relevant JLT Share Plan) vest as follows: 

| 
---|--- 

3.1

|

in the case of Awards granted before the Announcement, in full on the Court
Sanction Date; and 

| 
---|--- 

3.2

in the case of Awards granted on or after the Announcement, on the Court
Sanction Date but time pro rated to reflect the period from the grant date to
the Court Sanction Date as a proportion of the normal vesting period.

JLT Shares that it holds to satisfy outstanding Awards as far as possible. 

| 
---|--- 

6.

To the extent there are insufficient JLT Shares in the Trust to satisfy

Shares to satisfy outstanding Awards.
