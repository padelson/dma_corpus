(e) _Escrow_.

  

(i) At Closing, the Buyer shall (in accordance with Section 2.1(d)(ii)(B))
deliver the Escrow Amounts to the Payments Administrator for payment of the
same to the Escrow Agent, to be held in escrow pursuant to the Escrow
Agreements and to be disbursed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreements. The Escrow Accounts, together with any interest and
earnings thereon, shall be held by the Escrow Agent and released by the Escrow
Agent to the Surviving Corporation, the Payments Administrator or the Buyer,
as applicable, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreements. The
Escrow Agent shall maintain the General Escrow Account and the Venezuela
Escrow Account separately and shall not commingle any of the Escrow Funds in
such accounts.

  

(ii) The General Escrow Amount shall be held and disbursed in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the General Escrow Agreement and shall be

Party prior to the expiration of the Venezuela Escrow Period.

the terms of the Escrow Agreements for payment to the holder thereof. A

represented by each Company Equity Award (less any portion of the aggregate
exercise price of any Company Option required to be subtracted from such Pro
Rata Share pursuant to Section 2.5(a)) shall be paid by the Escrow

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-5-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

Agent to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreements for payment to the holder thereof (which amount shall be paid by
the Surviving Corporation to such holder with the first payroll payment after
the Surviving Corporation's receipt of such amount and shall be subject to any
applicable withholding as provided in Section 2.8). A portion of such
disbursed amount which constitutes Company Transaction Expenses shall be paid
by the Escrow Agent to the Payments Administrator pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreements for payment to such Persons to whom such Company Transaction
Expenses are owed. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer shall (in accordance
with the Closing Date Allocation Schedule) cause (A) the Surviving Corporation
to use any funds distributed to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this
Section 2.1(e)(iv) and (B) the Payments Administrator to use any funds
distributed to the Payments Administrator pursuant to this Section 2.1(e)(iv)
to make the payments provided for in this Section 2.1(e)(iv), and such funds
shall not be used for any other purpose except as provided in this Agreement.

  

(v) Any funds held in the Escrow Accounts shall not be deemed to be merger
consideration unless and until released for the benefit of the Company
Equityholders in accordance with Section 2.1(e)(iv).

  

(f) _Certain Adjustments to Per Share Amounts_. All per share amounts payable
to the Company Equityholders pursuant to this Article II shall be adjusted, as
applicable and appropriate, to reflect fully the effect of any
reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company
Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time (with any such actions to be
subject to the provisions of Section 5.1).

  

2.2 _Payment Fund_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding shares of
Company Stock for the consideration to be paid to the holders of such Company
Stock in connection with the Merger are as follows:

  

(a) _Payments Administrator_. At the Closing Date, pursuant to Section
2.1(d)(ii), the Buyer shall (in accordance with Section 2.1(d)(ii) deposit the
Payment Fund with the Payments Administrator for payment to the Company
Shareholders in accordance with this Section 2.2 and the Closing Date
Allocation Schedule. The Payments Administrator shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions from the Buyer in accordance with the Payments Administration
Agreement and the Closing Date Allocation Schedule, deliver the Closing Stock
Consideration out of the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund shall not earn
interest. Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that, at all times, the Payment Fund includes cash
sufficient to satisfy the Buyer's obligation to pay the aggregate Closing
Stock Consideration. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than as specified in this Section 2.2(a).

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the date of this Agreement and
in any event prior to two (2) Business Days after the Effective Time, the
Buyer shall cause the

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-6-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

Payments Administrator to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a
Letter of Transmittal and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of
such Certificate in exchange for the applicable Aggregate Consideration that
is or may become payable with respect thereto pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement; _provided_ , that the Buyer shall assist the Company in developing
arrangements for the delivery of such materials at Closing to significant
holders of Company Stock to facilitate the payment of Closing Stock
Consideration to such shareholders within one (1) Business Day following the
Effective Time. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Payments Administrator and delivery of a duly executed Letter of Transmittal,
the Buyer shall cause the Payments Administrator to pay promptly (and in any
event within two (2) Business Days) to the holder of such Certificate in
exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Closing Stock Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Company Stock represented by such
Certificate, as determined in accordance with Section 2.1 and reflected on the
Closing Date Allocation Schedule attached to the Closing Payment Certificate.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the applicable Closing
Stock Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is
presented to the Payments Administrator, accompanied by all documents required
to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
applicable Closing Stock Consideration and the applicable portion of the
Future Payments that become payable pursuant to this Agreement.

  

(c) _Allocation Schedules; Payments of Future Payments_. The Initial
Allocation Schedule attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ sets forth a summary of the
allocation (estimated as of the date hereof) of the amounts payable at the
Closing to the Company Equityholders. Pursuant to Section 2.7(a), the Company
shall deliver to Buyer and the Payments Administrator, at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing, the Closing Date Allocation Schedule
(attached as an exhibit to the Closing Payment Certificate). The Payments
Administrator shall make all payments constituting the Closing Stock
Consideration to the applicable Company Equityholders in accordance with the
Closing Date Allocation Schedule and the Letters of Transmittal. The Buyer
shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the information set forth on the
Closing Date Allocation Schedule and shall have no Liability to any Company
Equityholder or otherwise based on any errors or omissions in the Closing Date
Allocation Schedule and the Letters of Transmittal shall include a statement
to that effect.

  

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. All consideration paid
following the surrender for exchange of Certificates evidencing shares of
Company Stock (including any Future Payments payable with respect thereto) in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Stock, and
from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Stock which were outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-7-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Payments Administrator for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
as provided in this Article II.

  

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any amount deposited with the Payments
Administrator that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Stock one
year after the later of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) such time that such
amount is so deposited shall be delivered to the Buyer (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law), upon demand, and any holder of Company
Stock who is entitled to such amount under this Section 2.2 shall be entitled
to receive such amount from the Buyer.

  

(f) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the
Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Payments Administrator shall be liable to any Company Equityholder for any
amount delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

  

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact (in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer) and a customary indemnification of the Company and the
Buyer Indemnified Parties (in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer) by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Payments Administrator shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Aggregate Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_.

  

(a) To the extent available under the MBCA, any share of Company Stock that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
Company Shareholder who (i) was a Company Shareholder as of the record date,
if any, that is established for approval of the Merger, (ii) did not consent
to or vote (by a valid and enforceable proxy or otherwise) in favor of the
approval of this Agreement and (iii) otherwise complies with all of the
provisions of the MBCA relevant to the exercise and perfection of appraisal
rights (such share being a " _Dissenting Share_ " and such Company Shareholder
being a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ "), shall not be converted into the right
to receive a portion of the Aggregate Consideration in accordance with Section
2.1 but rather shall be converted into the right to receive such consideration
as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Share pursuant
to the applicable provisions of the MBCA.

  

(b) If any Dissenting Shareholder fails to perfect such shareholder's
appraisal rights under the MBCA or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses
such rights with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares
shall be automatically treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the portion of Aggregate
Consideration, if any, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.1, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate formerly
representing such shares.

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-8-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

(c) The Company shall give the Buyer (i) notice of any demand for payment of
the fair value of any shares of Company Stock or any attempted withdrawal of
any such demand for payment and any other instrument served pursuant to the
MBCA and received by the Company relating to any Company Shareholder's
appraisal rights as promptly as possible and in any event within 48 hours
after receipt of such demand, withdrawal or other instrument and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to
any such demands for payment under the MBCA. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned,
then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's
Dissenting Shares pursuant to the applicable provisions of the MBCA shall
cease.

  

2.4 _Company Equityholder Representative_.

  

(a) By their execution of the Letter of Transmittal and/or Shareholder Support
Agreements, approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement and/or their
acceptance of any consideration pursuant to this Agreement, the Company
Equityholders hereby irrevocably (subject only to Section 2.4(f)) appoint the
Company Equityholder Representative as the representative, attorney-in-fact
and agent of the Company Equityholders in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Payments Administration Agreement and the
Escrow Agreements and in any litigation or arbitration involving this
Agreement, the Payments Administration Agreement or the Escrow Agreements. In
connection therewith, the Company Equityholder Representative is authorized to
do or refrain from doing all further acts and things, and to execute all such
documents as the Company Equityholder Representative shall deem necessary or
appropriate, and shall have the power and authority to:

  

(i) act for some or all of the Company Equityholders with regard to all
matters pertaining to this Agreement, the Payments Administration Agreement or
the Escrow Agreements;

  

(ii) act for the Company Equityholders to transact matters of litigation;

  

(iii) execute and deliver all amendments, waivers, ancillary agreements,
certificates and documents on behalf of Company Equityholders that the Company
Equityholder Representative deems necessary or appropriate in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Payments Administration Agreement or the Escrow Agreements, including
delivering any update to or correction, amendment or modification of the
Closing Date Allocation Schedule permitted by Section 2.7(a);

  

(iv) receive funds, make payments of funds, and give receipts for funds;

  

(v) do or refrain from doing, on behalf of the Company Equityholders, any
further act or deed that the Company Equityholder Representative deems
necessary or appropriate in the Company Equityholder Representative's
discretion relating to the subject

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-9-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

matter of this Agreement, the Payments Administration Agreement or the Escrow
Agreements, in each case as fully and completely as the Company Equityholders
could do if personally present;

  

(vi) give and receive all notices required to be given or received by the
Company Equityholders under this Agreement, the Payments Administration
Agreement or the Escrow Agreements;

  

(vii) give any written direction to the Payments Administrator or the Escrow
Agent;

  

(viii) agree to, negotiate and/or comply with the determination of the Closing
Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Company Transaction
Expenses and the Final Purchase Price Adjustment pursuant to Section 2.6; and

  

(ix) receive service of process in connection with any claims under this
Agreement, the Payments Administration Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreements.

  

(b) All decisions and actions of the Company Equityholder Representative on
behalf of the Company Equityholders shall be deemed to be facts ascertainable
outside of the Merger Agreement and shall be binding upon all Company
Equityholders, and no Company Equityholder shall have the right to object,
dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

  

(c) At the Closing Date, the Buyer shall pay the Company Equityholder
Representative Expense Amount to the Payments Administrator. Immediately
following the Effective Time, the Payments Administrator shall pay the Company
Equityholder Representative Expense Amount to the Company Equityholder
Representative, which Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount shall
be maintained by the Company Equityholder Representative in a segregated
client account separate from the Company Equityholder Representative's
corporate funds. The Company Equityholder Representative shall not use these
funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and shall not
voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. The Company Equityholders shall not receive any interest or
earnings on the Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount and
irrevocably transfer and assign to the Company Equityholder Representative any
ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or
earnings. The Company Equityholder Representative shall not be liable for any
loss of principal of the Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount
other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. For Tax
purposes, the Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount shall be
treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by the Company
Equityholders at the time of Closing. The Company Equityholder Representative
shall be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the
performance of the Company Equityholder Representative's duties (including the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) under this Agreement from the Company
Equityholder Representative Expense Amount and, if the remaining Company
Equityholder Representative Expense Amount

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-10-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

is insufficient to pay such expenses, from the first proceeds from Future
Payments otherwise available for distribution to the Company Equityholders.
Upon the determination of the Company Equityholder Representative that
retaining any portion of the Company Equityholder Representative Expense
Amount is no longer necessary, the Company Equityholder Representative shall
deliver any then remaining portion of the Company Equityholder Representative
Expense Amount (the " _Company Equityholder Representative Account Payment_ ")
to the Buyer, which shall promptly pay (i) a portion thereof equal to the Pro
Rata Share that is represented by each share of Company Stock converted
pursuant to Sections 2.1(c)(i)(Y), 2.1(c)(ii)(Y) or 2.1(c)(iii) to the
Payments Administrator for payment to the holder thereof and (ii) a portion
thereof equal to the Pro Rata Share that is represented by each Company Equity
Award to the Surviving Corporation for payment to the holder thereof (which
amount shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation to such holder with the
first payroll payment after the Surviving Corporation's receipt of such amount
and shall be subject to any applicable withholding as provided in Section
2.8). The Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount shall not be used
for any other purpose and shall not be available to the Buyer to satisfy any
claims hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer shall (in accordance
with the Closing Date Allocation Schedule) cause (A) the Surviving Corporation
to use any funds distributed to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this
Section 2.4(c) and (B) the Payments Administrator to use any funds distributed
to the Payments Administrator pursuant to this Section 2.4(c) to make the
payments provided for in this Section 2.4(c), and such funds shall not be used
for any other purpose except as provided in this Agreement.

  

(d) The Company Equityholder Representative shall act for the Company
Equityholders on all of the matters set forth in this Agreement, the Payments
Administration Agreement and the Escrow Agreements in the manner the Company
Equityholder Representative believes to be in the best interest of the Company
Equityholders. The Company Equityholder Representative is authorized to act on
behalf of the Company Equityholders notwithstanding any dispute or
disagreement among the Company Equityholders. In taking any action as Company
Equityholder Representative, the Company Equityholder Representative may rely
conclusively, without any further inquiry or investigation, upon any
certification or confirmation, oral or written, given by any Person whom the
Company Equityholder Representative reasonably believes to be authorized
thereunto. The Company Equityholder Representative may, in all questions
arising hereunder, rely on the advice of counsel, and the Company Equityholder
Representative shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any
Company Equityholder for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by
the Company Equityholder Representative based on such advice. The Company
Equityholder Representative undertakes to perform such duties and only such
duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement and no implied
covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Company
Equityholder Representative. The Company Equityholder Representative shall not
have any Liability to any of the parties hereto or the Company Equityholders
for any act done or omitted hereunder as Company Equityholder Representative
while acting in good faith. The Company Equityholder Representative shall be
indemnified by the Company Equityholders from and against any loss, liability,
expense, damage, claim, penalty, fine, forfeiture, action, fee or costs

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-11-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

(including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and
all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "
_Representative_ _Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Company Equityholder Representative's
duties hereunder and under any agreement ancillary hereto, in each case as
such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event
that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly
caused by the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company
Equityholder Representative, the Company Equityholder Representative shall
reimburse the Company Equityholders the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Any such Representative Losses shall be
recovered by the Company Equityholder Representative first from any then
available portion of the remaining Company Equityholder Representative Expense
Amount and, if such amount is insufficient to satisfy any such Representative
Loss, from the first proceeds from Future Payments otherwise available for
distribution to the Company Equityholders or from the Company Equityholders;
provided, that while this Section 2.4(d) provides for the Company Equityholder
Representative to be paid from the Company Equityholder Representative Expense
Amount and any Future Payments, this does not relieve the Company
Equityholders from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses
as they are suffered or incurred to the extent the Company Equityholder
Representative Expense Amount is insufficient for the Representative Loss to
be fully recovered, nor does it prevent the Company Equityholder
Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.
In no event shall the Company Equityholder Representative be required to
advance its own funds on behalf of the Company Equityholders or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions
or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of the Company
Equityholders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be
applicable to the indemnities provided to the Company Equityholder
Representative under this Section 2.4. The foregoing indemnities shall survive
the Closing, the resignation or removal of the Company Equityholder
Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

  

(e) The Company Equityholder Representative shall have reasonable access to
relevant information about the Company and the Buyer and the reasonable
assistance of the Company's and the Buyer's employees for purposes of
performing the Company Equityholder Representative's duties and exercising the
Company Equityholder Representative's rights hereunder; _provided_ , that the
Company Equityholder Representative shall treat confidentially and not
disclose any nonpublic information from or about the Company to anyone except
(i) in connection with any disputes arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement and (ii) as required by law or to employees, advisors, agents or
consultants of the Company Equityholder Representative and to the Company
Equityholders, in each case who have a need to know such information, provided
that such persons either (A) agree to observe the terms of this Section 2.4(e)
or (B) are bound by obligations of confidentiality to the Company Equityholder
Representative of at least as high a standard as those imposed on the Company
Equityholder Representative under this Section 2.4(e).

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-12-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

(f) In the event the Company Equityholder Representative becomes unable to
perform the Company Equityholder Representative's responsibilities hereunder
or resigns from such position, the Company Equityholders (acting by a written
instrument signed by holders of Company Stock who held, as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, a majority (by voting power) of the then
outstanding shares of Company Stock) shall select another representative to
fill the vacancy of the Company Equityholder Representative, and such
substituted representative shall be deemed to be the Company Equityholder
Representative for all purposes of this Agreement. The Company Equityholder
Representative may be removed only upon delivery of written notice to the
Buyer signed by Persons who, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
held a majority (by voting power) of the then outstanding shares of Company
Stock.

  

(g) For all purposes of this Agreement:

  

(i) the Buyer shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the instructions and
decisions of the Company Equityholder Representative as to the settlement of
any disputes or claims under this Agreement, or any other actions required or
permitted to be taken by the Company Equityholder Representative hereunder,
and no party hereunder or any Company Equityholder shall have any cause of
action against the Buyer for any action taken by the Buyer in reliance upon
the instructions or decisions of the Company Equityholder Representative;

  

(ii) the provisions of this Section 2.4 are independent and severable, are
irrevocable (subject only to Section 2.4(f)) and coupled with an interest and
shall be enforceable notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Company
Equityholder may have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and

  

(iii) the provisions of this Section 2.4 shall be binding upon the executors,
heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successor trustees and
successors of each Company Equityholder, and any references in this Agreement
to a Company Equityholder shall mean and include the successors to the rights
of each applicable Company Equityholder hereunder, whether pursuant to
testamentary disposition, the Laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

2.5 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

  

(a) As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option that is
then outstanding (whether such Company Option is vested or unvested, but not
to the extent it has theretofore been exercised) shall be converted, in
settlement and cancellation thereof, into the right to receive an amount equal
to (A) such Company Option's Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Common Stock
Closing Consideration, less the aggregate exercise price of such Company
Option (but not less than zero) plus (B) such Company Option's Pro Rata Share
of the portion of all Future Payments less the aggregate exercise price of
such Company Option to the extent in excess of the Company Option's Pro Rata
Share of the Aggregate Common Stock Closing Consideration, that become payable
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, in each case subject to withholding
as provided in Section 2.8.

  

(b) At the Effective Time, each Other Company Equity Award that is then
outstanding, whether vested or unvested, shall automatically be converted into
the right to receive (A) such Other Company Equity Award's Pro Rata Share of
the Aggregate Common Stock Closing Consideration, less (if applicable) the
aggregate exercise price or measurement price of such Other Company Equity
Award, plus (B) such Other Company Equity Award's Pro Rata Share of the
portion of all Future Payments, that become payable pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, in each case subject to withholding as provided in Section
2.8.

  

(c) Upon the conversion and cancellation of any Company Equity Award pursuant
to this Section 2.5, such Company Equity Award shall no longer represent the
right to acquire any shares of Company Stock or other Equity Interests, but
shall entitle the holder thereof to receive only the consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Section 2.5.

  

(d) The Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation or the Payments
Administrator, as the case may be, to pay as promptly as practicable (and in
any event no later than the next payroll date of the Surviving Corporation
that occurs at least five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date) to
each holder of Company Equity Awards the portion of the Aggregate Common Stock
Closing Consideration payable to such holder pursuant to this Section 2.5,
subject to any applicable withholding as provided in Section 2.8, in
accordance with the Closing Date Allocation Schedule. The Buyer shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to pay to each holder of Company Equity Awards any
amounts payable with respect to each Future Payment (subject to any applicable
withholding as provided in Section 2.8) (i) concurrently with the payment of
such Future Payments to the holders of Company Stock and (ii) in accordance
with the Closing Date Allocation Schedule. The Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to at all times from and after the Effective Time maintain
sufficient liquid funds to satisfy its payment obligations to the holders of
Company Equity Awards pursuant to this Section 2.5. In addition, at the time
of payment of any Future Payment related to any Company Equity Award, the
Company Equityholder Representative and the Buyer shall execute and deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to disburse from the General

Expenses, Closing Venezuela Receivables and Closing Venezuela Inventory, as
applicable; and the Neutral Accountant shall be required to resolve such
differences within 20 Business Days after the completion of such presentations
to the Neutral Accountant. Absent fraud or manifest error, the Neutral
Accountant's determination of (1) the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Company Transaction Expenses shall be deemed
for all purposes of this Agreement to be the " _Final Adjustment Statement_ ",
and (2) the Closing Venezuela Receivables and Closing Venezuela Inventory

proposed by the Buyer in the Preliminary Net Working Statement or the
Preliminary Venezuela Escrow Statement or the Company Equityholder

Representative (on behalf of the Company Equityholders) or the Buyer based on
whose overall position on the issues in dispute are furthest from the
determinations of the Neutral Accountant and, accordingly, the Neutral
Accountant (1) shall, in its discretion, assign a greater portion of any such
fees and expenses to the Company Equityholder Representative or the Buyer, as
applicable, and (2) shall provide to the Company Equityholder Representative
and the Buyer a written explanation of its reasons for making such a
determination and such determination shall be final and binding on the Company
Equityholder Representative and the Buyer, absent fraud or manifest error.

thereof equal to the Pro Rata Share that is represented by each share of
Company Stock converted pursuant to Sections 2.1(c)(i)(Y), 2.1(c)(ii)(Y) or

payment to the holder thereof and (2) a portion thereof equal to the Pro Rata

and shall be subject to any applicable withholding as provided in Section
2.8). For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer shall (in accordance with the
Closing Date Allocation Schedule) cause (x) the Surviving Corporation to use
any funds distributed to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section
2.6(b)(vi) and (y) the Payments Administrator to use any funds distributed to

payment of any amount thereof which is owed to the Buyer (or, if so directed
by Buyer, an Affiliate of the Buyer), funds remain in the General Escrow
Account in an amount greater than four million dollars ($4,000,000), the
Company Equityholder Representative and the Buyer shall promptly prepare,
execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to disburse
an amount equal the product of (a)(i) all funds remaining in the General
Escrow Account, minus (ii) four million dollars ($4,000,000), multiplied by
(b) fifty percent (50%), for the benefit of the Company Equityholders pursuant
to Section 2.1(e)(iv), by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

(A) If the Final Venezuela Escrow Adjustment is greater than zero (0), then
the Company Equityholder Representative and Buyer shall issue joint written
instructions to transfer an amount equal to the Final Venezuela Escrow
Adjustment to the Venezuela Escrow Fund from (a) any amounts to be paid to the
Company Equityholders pursuant to Section 2.6(b)(vi)(B) and, solely to the
extent such amounts are insufficient, from (b) the General Escrow Fund.

  

(B) If the Final Venezuela Escrow Adjustment is less than zero (0), then an
amount equal to the Final Venezuela Escrow Adjustment shall be disbursed
pursuant to the Venezuela Escrow Agreement for the benefit of the Company
Equityholders in accordance with Section 2.1(e)(iv), and the Company
Equityholder Representative and the Buyer shall promptly prepare, execute and
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to disburse such
amounts to the Payments Administrator and the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the Venezuela
Escrow Account in accordance with the Venezuela Escrow Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Buyer shall (in accordance with the Closing Date
Allocation Schedule) cause (x) the Surviving Corporation to use any funds
distributed to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section 2.6(b)(viii)
and (y) the Payments Administrator to use any funds distributed to the
Payments Administrator pursuant to this Section 2.6(b)(viii) to make the
payments provided for in this Section

extent requested by the Company Equityholder Representative, for purposes of
(A) evaluating the information in the Preliminary Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement and (B) preparing any Objection Statement.

  

(x) The parties agree that the procedures set forth in this Section 2.6 shall

the determination of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness, Company Transaction Expenses, Closing Venezuela Receivables,
Closing Venezuela Inventory, the Final Purchase Price Adjustment and the Final
Venezuela Escrow Adjustment; _provided_ , that this provision shall not
prohibit the Buyer or the Company Equityholder Representative from instituting

(d) Each Company Employee Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code is and has
been in compliance with Section 409A of the Code in both form and operation.
All Company Options and stock appreciation rights granted by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries were granted using an exercise price of not less than
the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant as
determined in accordance with applicable guidance under Section 409A of the
Code. The treatment of Company Options and Other Company Equity Awards
described in Section 2.5 of this Agreement is permitted by, and in compliance
with, the terms of the plan or agreement under which such Company Options and
Other Company Equity Awards were granted without the consent of any party.
Other than the Company Options and Other Company Equity Awards, there are no
outstanding equity or equity-based awards.

  

(e) With respect to each Company Employee Plan, there are no material benefit
obligations for which timely contributions have not been made or, to the
extent required by GAAP, properly accrued. All benefit obligations under any
Company Employee Plan which provide pension benefits to employees employed in
Sweden are fully insured.

  

(f) Each Company Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a determination or opinion letter from the IRS
to the effect that such Company Employee Plan is qualified and the plans and
trusts related thereto are exempt from federal income Taxes under Sections
401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, or is based on prototype or
volume submitter documents that have received such letter, or the period for
obtaining such letter is still open, and as of the date of this Agreement (i)
no such determination or opinion letter has been revoked and revocation has
not been threatened and (ii) no event has occurred or circumstance exists that
could reasonably be expected to give rise to

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-45-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

disqualification or loss of Tax-exempt status of any such Company Employee
Plan or related trust. Each other Company Employee Plan that is intended to
qualify for Tax-preferential treatment under applicable law so qualifies and
has received, where required, approval from the applicable Governmental Entity
that it is so qualified and no event has occurred or circumstance exists that
may give rise to disqualification or loss of Tax-preferential treatment.

  

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has within the past
six (6) years (i) maintained a Company Employee Plan that was subject to
Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA or (ii) obligated to contribute

of ERISA). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material
Liability under (i) Title IV of ERISA, (ii) Sections 412 or 430 of the Code or
Section 302 of ERISA, or (iii) Section 4971 of the Code. No amendment has been
made, or is reasonably expected to be made, to any Company Employee Plan that
has required or could require the provision of security under Section 307 of
ERISA or Section 401(a)(29) of the Code. The Company and its Subsidiaries have
paid all amounts due to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation pursuant to
Section 4007 of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
filed a notice of intent to terminate any Company Employee Plan that is
subject to Title IV of ERISA or has adopted any amendment to treat any such
Company Employee Plan as terminated. The US Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation has not instituted Proceedings to treat any Company Employee Plan
as terminated. To the Company's Knowledge, no event has occurred or
circumstance exists that may constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA
for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any
Company Employee Plan. No Company Employee Plan which provides benefits
primarily to employees employed outside the United States is a defined benefit
pension plan or final salary plan or provides any death, disability or
retirement benefits calculated by reference to age, salary or length of
service.

  

(h) None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides post-termination
medical or other post-termination welfare benefits to any person, except as
required by (i) applicable Law, (ii) contractually required subsidies for
COBRA coverage during severance or (iii) the terms of any plan qualified under

has any material Liability for any Taxes under Code Section 4980B or 4980H of
the Code.

the terms of which are altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction involving
the Company of the nature of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or providing material severance benefits or other material benefits
after the termination of employment of such director, executive officer or
employee. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made or has
become obligated to make, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement become obligated to make, any payments that shall be nondeductible
by reason of Section 280G of the Code (without regard to subsection (b)(4)

4.4 _Operations of the Transitory Subsidiary_. The Transitory Subsidiary was
formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, has engaged in no other business activities and has conducted

(a) The Buyer has delivered to the Company a complete and correct, as of the

Commitment Letter_ ") from the financial institutions identified therein
(collectively, the " _Lender_ "), pursuant to which the Lender has committed
to provide, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein
debt financing in the amount set forth therein (such debt financing, any
alternative financing or any notes or term loans issued in lieu thereof, in
each case, obtained in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Debt Financing_
").

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-58-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and
effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of the Buyer and,
to the knowledge of the Buyer, each of the other parties thereto, enforceable
against the Buyer, and to the knowledge of the Buyer, each of the other
parties thereto in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception. As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter has not
been amended, modified or terminated and no such amendment, modification or
termination is contemplated by the Buyer. Except for a fee letter relating to
fees with respect to the Debt Financing (a redacted form of which has been
provided to the Company) (the " _Fee Letter_ ") and an engagement letter,
there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or written
arrangements related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the Debt
Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
delivered to the Company on or prior to the date of this Agreement.

  

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or
without due notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or
default on the part of the Buyer under the Debt Commitment Letter. All
commitment fees required to be paid prior to the date hereof under the Debt
Commitment Letter have been paid in full.

  

(d) There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than as set forth in
or contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter. Assuming the representations
and warranties set forth in Article III are true and correct, neither the
Buyer nor the Transitory Subsidiary (i) is aware of any fact, occurrence or
condition that would cause the commitments provided in any Commitment Letter
to be terminated or ineffective or (ii) has any reason to believe that any of
the conditions to the Debt Financing shall not be satisfied or the Debt
Financing shall not be consummated, available, and accessible as contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter.

  

(e) The aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter,
together with (i) available or accessible cash and cash equivalents of the
Buyer and its Subsidiaries and (ii) the principal amount of any undrawn
commitments under a credit facility available to the Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries (the amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii), together, "
_Available Cash_ "), shall be in the aggregate sufficient to enable the
payment in cash of all amounts required to be paid by the Buyer and the
Transitory Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Aggregate Consideration in accordance with Article II
and all payments, fees and expenses related to or arising out of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Required
Amount_ ").

  

(f) Neither the obligations of the Buyer nor the obligations of the Transitory
Subsidiary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are contingent
on the ability to obtain any financing (including the Debt Financing).

  

4.6 _Solvency_. Immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Debt Financing, the Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation shall (a) be able to pay their respective debts as they
become due and shall own property having a fair saleable value

greater than the amounts required to pay their respective debts (including a
reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent Liabilities) and (b) have
adequate capital to carry on their respective businesses. No transfer of
property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Debt Financing with
the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of
the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation.

acquiring the Company Stock in connection with the Merger subject only to the
specific representations and warranties set forth in Article III, as limited
by the specifically bargained for survival periods set forth in Article IX.

Company in Article III, as limited by the specifically bargained for survival
periods set forth in Article IX, (a) Buyer and Transitory Subsidiary represent

representation or warranty, expressed or implied, at law or in equity, in
respect of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any of the Company's or its

made available to Buyer and its representatives in any "data rooms," "virtual
data rooms," management presentations or in any other form in expectation of,
related to, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, or in respect of any other matter or thing whatsoever,
and (b) each of Buyer and Transitory Subsidiary specifically disclaims that it
is relying upon, has relied upon, or was induced to enter into this Agreement
based upon, (i) the implied authority of any shareholder, officer, manager,
agent, representative or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
make any representations, warranties or agreements not specifically set forth
in this Agreement and subject to the specifically bargained for survival
periods set forth in Article IX, and the Company has specifically disclaimed
any such authority of any Person, and (ii) any Person providing or not
providing any information not specifically required pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement and subject to the specifically bargained for survival period
set forth in Article IX.

  

4.8 _Brokers_. No agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other
Person is or shall be entitled, as a result of any action, agreement or
commitment of the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, to any broker's, finder's,
financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection with any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Buyer, in writing, of any decision of the Company Board as to whether to
consider any Acquisition Proposal or to enter into discussions or negotiations
concerning any Acquisition Proposal or to provide non-public information with
respect to the Company to any Person, which notice shall be given as promptly
as practicable after such determination was reached (and in any event no later
than twenty-four (24) hours after such determination was reached). The Company
shall (i) keep the Buyer informed as promptly as practicable with respect to
any changes to the material terms of an Acquisition Proposal submitted to the
Company (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours following any such
changes), (ii) contemporaneously with the provision of any non-public
information of the Company to any such Person, provide such information to the
Buyer and (iii) promptly (and in any event within twenty four (24) hours of
such determination) notify the Buyer of any determination by the Company Board
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.

  

(d) Subject to Section 6.1(e), neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall, directly or indirectly, (A) (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, in
a manner adverse to the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary, the Company Board
Recommendation, or (ii) approve, adopt, declare advisable or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal (any action described in clause (i) or (ii) being
referred to as a " _Change of Recommendation_ ") or (B) approve, recommend or
declare advisable, or allow the Company to execute or enter into, any letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement, or other similar agreement, arrangement, or
understanding (i) constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) requiring
it to

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-65-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

abandon, terminate, or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Company Shareholder Approval,
the Company Board may, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the
failure to take such action would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties
of the Company's directors under applicable law, approve or recommend a
Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.1;
_provided_ , that:

  

(i) the Company has provided to the Buyer at least three (3) calendar days
prior written notice that it intends to take such action, which notice must
specify the reasons for taking such action and, a written copy of the relevant
proposed transaction agreements with the party making such potential Superior
Proposal, and a summary description of the material terms and conditions of
such potential Superior Proposal; and

  

(ii) the Buyer shall not have made a proposal that, if accepted, would be
binding on the Buyer and that has not been withdrawn, within three (3)
calendar days (during which period the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, negotiate with the Buyer in good faith regarding any
proposal by the Buyer) after receipt of such notice from the Company, to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of
any revisions to the Superior Proposal (including any revision in the amount,
form or mix of consideration the Company's shareholders would receive as a
result of such potential Superior Proposal), the Company shall be required to
provide the Buyer with notice of such material amendment and there shall be a
new three (3) day period following such notification during which the Company
shall negotiate with the Buyer and otherwise comply again with the
requirements of this Section 6.1(e) and the Company Board shall not make a
Change of Recommendation prior to the end of any such period as so extended.

  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from making any
disclosure to the shareholders of the Company that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that the failure to make such disclosure would be a breach of the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ , that any such disclosure
referred to in this Section 6.1(f) shall be deemed to be a Change of
Recommendation unless the Company Board expressly reaffirms the Company Board
Recommendation in such disclosure; _provided_ , _further_ , that this Section
6.1(f) shall not be deemed to permit the Company Board to make a Change of
Recommendation or to take any of the actions referred to in Section 6.1(e),
except, in each case, to the extent expressly permitted by Section 6.1(e).

  

(g) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall (and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to), and the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries shall cause their respective directors, officers and employees
to, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
other Representatives to, (i) cease and terminate immediately all activities,

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-66-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

discussions, communications and negotiations that commenced prior to the date
of this Agreement regarding any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably
be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) take such action as is
necessary to enforce any confidentiality provisions or provisions of similar
effect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or of which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a beneficiary relating to any such
activities, discussions, communications and negotiations, and (iii) not
terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any provision of any standstill
agreement (including any standstill provision contained in any confidentiality
or other agreement) to which it or any of its Affiliates or Representatives is
a party, unless, solely, with respect to this clause (iii), the Company Board
has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would constitute a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company's directors under applicable
law. The Company shall promptly after the date of this Agreement instruct each
Person which has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement relating to
any Acquisition Proposal with or for the benefit of the Company to promptly
return or destroy all confidential information, documents and materials
relating to an Acquisition Proposal or to the Company, its Subsidiaries or its
businesses, operations or affairs heretofore furnished by or on behalf of the
Company or any of its Representatives to such Person or any of its
Representatives in accordance with the terms of any confidentiality agreement
with such Person and terminate any "data room" or similar access of such
Persons and their Representatives.

  

6.2 _Shareholder Approval_. The Company shall inform its shareholders of the
Company Board Recommendation and take all lawful action to hold, as
expeditiously as possible, and in any event within ten (10) calendar days
following the execution of this Agreement, a shareholder meeting (the "
_Meeting_ ") to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall have the right to postpone the date of the
Meeting to a date not later than 15 calendar days after the execution of this
Agreement following receipt of an Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, that the failure to take such action would constitute
a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company's directors under applicable
law. Within two (2) Business Days following the date hereof, the Company shall
deliver an information statement and all information that may be required to
be given to the Company Equityholders pursuant to the MBCA in connection with
the Merger, including, to the extent applicable, adequate notice of the Merger
and information concerning dissenters' rights under the MBCA (the "
_Shareholder Materials_ ") to all Company Equityholders entitled to receive
such materials under the MBCA. The Shareholder Materials transmitted to
Company Equityholders in connection with the approval of this Agreement and
the Merger shall include the Company Board Recommendation, shall be in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer and its counsel, and shall
not contain, at the time of the mailing or presentation of the Shareholder
Materials and at the time of the meeting of the Company Equityholders to
consider approval of this Agreement and the Merger, any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Subject to Section
6.1, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from the
Company

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-67-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

Shareholders their votes or proxies in favor of Company Shareholder Approval
and shall take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure
the vote or of the Company Shareholders required by the MBCA to obtain Company
Shareholder Approval. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall be
required to hold the Meeting and present this Agreement for Company
Shareholder Approval at such Meeting whether or not the Company Board has made
a Change of Recommendation.

  

6.3 _Access to Information_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall
(and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to the Buyer's officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, Financing Sources, prospective Financing
Sources and other representatives, reasonable access, upon reasonable notice,
during normal business hours and in a manner that does not materially disrupt
or interfere with business operations, to all of its properties, books,
contracts, commitments, management personnel and records as the Buyer shall
reasonably request, and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the Buyer the
information concerning its business, properties, assets and personnel (other
than personnel or medical records) as the Buyer may reasonably request,
subject in all events to appropriate confidentiality restrictions. Any access
provided to the Buyer or its representatives, its Financing Sources or
prospective Financing Sources, or information provided by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, shall not constitute any expansion of or additional
representations or warranties of the Company beyond those specifically set
forth in this Agreement. The Buyer and its representatives, Financing Sources,
and prospective Financing Sources shall hold any such information which is
nonpublic in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement (or,
in the case of persons not party to the Confidentiality Agreement, such
persons shall be made aware of such confidentiality obligations and the Buyer
shall be responsible for any breaches thereof). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
but subject to Section 6.12(d), the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be
required to provide the Buyer access to or disclose information where such
access or disclosure would result in the loss of any attorney-client privilege
or be prohibited under applicable Law or by the terms of any Contract to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the date of this
Agreement. In any such event, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use its
reasonable efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable
information in a way that would not risk waiver of such privilege or violate
such applicable Law or Contract, including entering into a joint defense
agreement, common interest agreement or other similar arrangement. To the
extent the Company or its Subsidiaries conducts any physical count of
Inventory during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to afford the Buyer's designated employees or other
representatives the opportunity to be present and observe such physical count
of Inventory and shall provide the Buyer with at least 72 hours' prior notice
of any such physical counts of Inventory.

  

6.4 _Closing Efforts; Legal Conditions to the Merger; Third-Party Consents_.

  

(a) Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 6.4(b), the Company and the
Buyer shall each:

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-68-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

(i) use its commercially reasonable efforts (A) to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and (B) do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other parties in doing, in each case, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
hereby as promptly as practicable;

  

(ii) within five (5) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, make all
necessary filings under the HSR Act and request early termination of the
waiting period with respect to such filings, and thereafter make any other
required submissions under the HSR Act and satisfy any related governmental
request thereunder in each case as promptly as practicable;

  

(iii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to make, as promptly as
practicable, all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required
submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under any
other applicable Law;

  

(iv) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as promptly as
practicable, from any Governmental Entity or any other third party any
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or Orders
required to be obtained or made by the Company or the Buyer or any of their
Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
it being understood that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
be required to make any payments in connection with the fulfillment of its
obligations under this paragraph; and

  

(v) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

  

The Company and the Buyer shall cooperate with each other in connection with
the making of all such filings, including providing copies of all such
documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing and, if
requested, accepting reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in
connection therewith. The Company and the Buyer shall furnish to each other
all information required for any application or other filing to be made
pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer and the
Company agree that nothing contained in this Section 6.4(a) shall modify or
affect their respective rights and responsibilities under Section 6.4(b).

  

(b) Subject to the terms hereof, the Buyer and the Company agree, and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to (i) obtain any government
clearances or approvals required for Closing under applicable Antitrust Laws,
(ii) respond to any government requests for information under any Antitrust
Law and (iii) contest and resist any action, including any legislative,
administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any Antitrust Order that restricts, prevents or prohibits the
consummation of the Merger or any other transaction

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-69-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. Except to the extent
prohibited by applicable Law, the parties hereto (other than the Company
Equityholder Representative) shall consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and
provide to the other parties in advance, any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with Proceedings
under or relating to any Antitrust Law, and the parties shall provide to each
other the opportunity to attend, or for their respective counsel to attend,
any meetings or telephone calls with any Governmental Entity with respect to
such government clearances or approvals unless prohibited or otherwise
requested by such Governmental Entity. The foregoing shall not be deemed to
require the Buyer or any of its Affiliates to litigate with any Governmental
Entity or any other Person, enter into any agreement, consent decree or other
commitment requiring the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including for this
purpose the Company and its Subsidiaries) to divest (including through the
granting of any license rights) any assets or to take any other action that
would have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, properties,
Liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise), operating results, operations
or prospects of the Buyer and its Affiliates (including for this purpose the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole). The Company may not, and shall
not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, agree to any divesture or disposal of
any material assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or enter into
any agreement with any Governmental Entity as a condition for obtaining any
government clearances or approvals in connection with this Section 6.4 without
the prior written consent of the Buyer.

  

(c) Without limiting any of the parties' respective obligations set forth in
any of Section 6.4(a) and Section 6.4(b), each of the Company and the Buyer
shall give (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices
to third parties, and use, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to use,
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third party consents
required in connection with the Merger that are (i) necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) disclosed or required to be
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or (iii) required to prevent the
occurrence of an event that would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect prior to or after
the Effective Time, it being understood that neither the Company nor the Buyer
shall be required to make any payments, other than the payment of customary
filing fees, in connection with the fulfillment of its obligations under this
Section 6.4.

  

6.5 _Public Disclosure_. The Buyer and the Company shall issue a joint press
release announcing the execution of this Agreement in such form as shall be
mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Buyer. Except as may be required
by Law or stock market regulations, the Buyer and the Company shall consult
with the other party before issuing any other press release or otherwise
making any public statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and the Buyer shall be permitted to
make public statements and disclosures consistent with the content of the
press release announcing the transaction contemplated by this Agreement from
and after the issuance of such press release. With respect to communications
prior to the Closing, the Buyer and the Company shall consult

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-70-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

with each other concerning the means by which employees, customers, suppliers
and others having dealings with the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be
informed of the Merger, and the Buyer has the right to be present if any such
communications are given at an in-person meeting and must be given reasonable
prior notice thereof.

  

6.6 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

  

(a) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation and the Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless each of the present and former directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (" _D andO Indemnified Parties_")
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was
an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
predecessor thereof, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under the MBCA for officers
and directors of Massachusetts corporations if and to the extent such officers
and directors would have been provided with such rights in the applicable
Organizational Documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date of
this Agreement and provided that that any such person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to the Surviving Corporation to the extent
then required by the MBCA or applicable governing Law, to repay such advances
if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification.

  

(b) The articles of organization and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain, and the Buyer shall cause the articles of organization and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present
and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any
predecessor thereof than are set forth in the Company Articles of Organization
and bylaws of the Company immediately prior to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement.

  

(c) Subject to the following sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall, at no
expense to the beneficiaries, either (i) maintain, and the Buyer shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain, in effect for six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time the Current DandO Insurance with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) of the DandO Indemnified Parties or
(ii) purchase a six (6) year extended reporting period endorsement with
respect to the Current DandO Insurance (a " _Reporting Tail Endorsement_ ") and
maintain such endorsement in full force and effect for its full term (provided
that the full amount of all premiums payable for such Reporting Tail
Endorsement shall be paid in full by the Buyer on behalf of the Company prior
to the Effective Time and the amount of such premiums shall not constitute
Company Transaction Expenses); _provided_ , _however_ , that in complying with
its obligations pursuant to the terms of this Section 6.6(c), the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay annual insurance

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-71-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

premiums in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid by the Company
for its existing coverage in the aggregate; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ ,
if the Surviving Corporation cannot obtain such insurance coverage without
paying annual premiums in excess of such limit, the Surviving Corporation
shall purchase such insurance with the maximum coverage available by paying
annual premiums equal to such limit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement (including the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.6(c)),
the Company may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a Reporting Tail
Endorsement, in which case the Buyer shall be relieved from its obligations
pursuant to this Section 6.6(c) so long as the Buyer maintains, or causes the
Surviving Corporation to maintain, as applicable, such Reporting Tail
Endorsement in full force and effect for its full term. The cost of any
Reporting Tail Endorsement purchased by the Company pursuant to the foregoing
sentence (whether or not paid prior to the Effective Time) shall not
constitute Company Transaction Expenses.

  

(d) If the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of the Company's
Subsidiaries (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successor and assigns of the Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall assume all
of the obligations of this Section 6.6.

  

(e) To the extent required by Section 6.6(a), the Surviving Corporation shall
pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be
incurred by the parties obtaining indemnification in connection with the
enforcement of their rights provided in this Section 6.6.

  

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to the DandO Indemnified Parties by Law, charter,
bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their
representatives.

  

6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give
prompt notice to the Buyer, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any
event, which occurrence or failure to occur would reasonably be expected to
cause the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.3(a), as the
case may be, not to be satisfied or (b) any failure of the Buyer and the
Transitory Subsidiary or the Company, as the case may be, to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement, which failure would reasonably be expected to
cause the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7.2(b) or 7.3(b), as the
case may be, not to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall not limit or otherwise affect
the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the
conditions to such party's obligation to consummate the Merger.

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-72-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

6.8 _Employee Matters_.

  

(a) Beginning on the Closing Date and continuing until the first anniversary
of the Closing Date, or for such greater period as shall be required by
applicable Law, the Buyer shall provide each Continuing Employee with total
cash compensation (including base salary and bonus opportunity) that is no
less favorable in the aggregate than such Continuing Employee's total cash
compensation immediately prior to the Closing Date.

  

(b) Following the Closing, the Buyer shall comply, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to comply, with the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under each employment agreement with each employee of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date and
made available to Buyer, and shall give each Continuing Employee full credit
for prior service with the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of (i)
eligibility and vesting under any Buyer Employee Plans and (ii) determination
of benefit levels under any Buyer Employee Plan or policy relating to vacation
or severance, in each case for which the Continuing Employee is otherwise
eligible and in which the Continuing Employee is offered participation, but
not where such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition,
the Buyer shall waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits
relating to pre-existing conditions to the same extent such limitations are
waived under any comparable plan of the Company and recognize for purposes of
annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans,
deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Continuing Employees in the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.

  

(c) Nothing in this Section 6.8 shall require the Buyer to provide any
Continuing Employee with compensation (including cash compensation or
benefits) in excess of that permitted by Law or any collective bargaining
agreement applicable to the Continuing Employee. Nothing in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries from amending, modifying
or terminating, or shall be construed as an amendment or modification to, any
or all compensation or benefit plans, programs, policies, practices,
agreements and arrangements sponsored or maintained by the Company, the Buyer
or any of their Subsidiaries, including each Company Employee Plan and Buyer
Employee Plan, and nothing in this Agreement shall require the Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries to continue any particular compensation or benefit plan,
program, policy, practice, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time
or to employ any particular person on any particular terms. Notwithstanding
the foregoing the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay all bonus
or benefit amounts accrued or otherwise included in the calculation of Closing
Net Working Capital or Company Transaction Expenses and not otherwise paid at
Closing in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Employee Plans.

  

6.9 _Bonus Plans; Company Transaction Expenses_ _; 280G Vote_.

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the
Effective Time, the Company may (X) (i) establish, terminate, amend and/or
otherwise modify one or more Transaction Bonus Plans and (ii) award, declare,
amend, revoke, modify and/or pay

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-73-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

any bonuses under any such Transaction Bonus Plan, in each case, solely to the
extent any Liabilities resulting from such action are required to be fully
paid and settled prior to the 90th calendar day after the Effective Time and
are included in Company Transaction Expenses and (Y) terminate the Directors'
Phantom Stock Plan and the Crane and Co., Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for
Directors and pay any amounts due thereunder. Prior to any action pursuant to
this Section 6.9 other than an increase in cash bonus payments payable at the
Closing, the Company shall provide to Buyer ten (10) calendar days' written
notice of the proposed action for Buyer's review and consent (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld).

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall pay, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay, from time to time as and when due, (i) all
Company Transaction Expenses, to the extent not paid on the Closing Date in
accordance with Section 2.1(d)(ii)(F), and (ii) all bonuses under any
Transaction Bonus Plan that are accrued and unpaid as of the Effective Time.

  

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall submit to a shareholder vote
(in compliance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury
regulations issued thereunder) the right of any individual who is a
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) at the
time of such vote to receive payments and benefits from the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company pursuant to arrangements in effect as of the Closing
Date and any other payments and benefits of which the Company has actual
knowledge as of the date of this Agreement, in each case, that could
reasonably be expected to be deemed a "parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in a manner reasonably designed to cause the
payments and benefits that would otherwise constitute a "parachute payment" to
be exempt from the definition of "parachute payment" by reason of the
exemption provided under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, including
requirements that such disqualified individual execute a waiver in advance of
such shareholder vote waiving the right to any such payment or benefit if the
requisite shareholder approval is not obtained to the extent necessary so that
no such payment or benefit to such disqualified individual would constitute a
"parachute payment". Prior to delivery to the shareholders and disqualified
individuals of documents in connection with the shareholder approval
contemplated under this paragraph, the Company shall provide Buyer and its
counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all documents
to be delivered to the shareholders and disqualified individuals in connection
with the vote.

  

6.10 _Payoff and Release Letters_. No later than the three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide the Buyer with payoff
letters from each of the creditors to whom the Payoff Indebtedness is owed
pursuant to the Company Debt Agreements (other than the Malta Debt Agreements
and the portions of the Multi Option Facility not specified as being paid off
pursuant to the definition of Company Debt Agreements), containing the name
and account number of each Person to which any portion of such Indebtedness
shall be due and payable at the Closing and containing the portion of such
Indebtedness to be paid to each such Person at the Closing (collectively, the
" _Payoff Letters_ "). Each of the Payoff Letters shall (i)

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-74-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

state that, upon payment at the Closing of the amounts set forth therein, such
portion of such Indebtedness shall be fully paid, satisfied and discharged in
its entirety and (ii) if applicable, provide for the release of all Liens over
the properties and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing the
obligations pertaining to such Indebtedness underlying such Indebtedness. If
applicable, the Company shall prepare for filing all agreements, instruments,
certificates, releases, termination statements and other documents, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, that are necessary,
appropriate or advisable to effect the releases of all Liens relating to such

or cause to be delivered to the Buyer a certification that the shares of

efforts to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and subject only to the
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and shall not amend, alter
or waive, or agree to amend, alter or waive, any term of the Debt Commitment
Letter without the prior written consent of the Company if such amendment,
alteration or waiver is reasonably likely to materially impair, delay or
prevent the Buyer's ability to consummate the Closing as contemplated by this
Agreement on the Closing Date; _provided_ that (x) the Buyer shall be
permitted to amend, alter or waive the Debt Commitment Letter to (1) reduce
the amount of the Debt Financing to the extent such reduction is offset by the
receipt of (A) net cash proceeds in exchange for debt securities and/or equity
financing in lieu thereof or in addition thereto _provided_ that any such
proceeds must be actually received by and available to the Buyer prior to any
reduction in the Debt Financing and through the Closing (with proceeds held in
an escrow account and subject to release upon the Closing being deemed to be
actually received by and available to the Buyer) and/or (B) other Available
Cash or (2) add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the
date of this Agreement and (y) the exercise of "market flex" provisions in the
Fee Letter shall not constitute an amendment,

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-75-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

alteration or waiver of the Debt Commitment Letter. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary shall (except to the extent
the Debt Financing is reduced as a result of the receipt of (A) net cash
proceeds in exchange for debt securities and/or equity financing in lieu
thereof or in addition thereto _provided_ that any such proceeds must be
actually received by and available to the Buyer prior to any reduction in the
Debt Financing and through the Closing (with proceeds held in an escrow
account and subject to release upon the Closing being deemed to be actually
received by and available to the Buyer) and/or (B) other Available Cash) use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment
Letter and negotiate a definitive agreement (the " _Debt Financing Agreement_
") with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter based upon on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (as may be
modified by any "market flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter) (or on
terms not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to the Buyer than the
terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (as may be modified by any
"market flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter)) and (ii) consummate the
Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, in no event shall "commercially reasonable efforts" of the Buyer
and the Transitory Subsidiary under this Section 6.12(a) be deemed or
construed to require the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary to instigate or
pursue any Proceeding against any of the Financing Sources.

  

(b) The Buyer shall keep the Company reasonably informed with respect to all
material activity concerning the Debt Financing. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Buyer agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any event
within two (2) Business Days, if at any time prior to the Closing Date the
Buyer becomes aware that (i) the Debt Commitment Letter or Debt Financing
Agreement expires or is terminated for any reason, (ii) the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary becomes aware of any material breach or default (or any
event or circumstance that, with or without due notice, lapse of time or both,
would reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or default)
by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or Debt Financing Agreement, (iii)
the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary receives any written notice or other
written communication from any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or Debt
Financing Agreement with respect to any (A) actual or potential breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter
or Debt Financing Agreement or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or
among any parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or Debt Financing Agreement
(it being understood and agreed that customary negotiations with respect to
the Debt Financing and the Debt Financing Agreement (or any agreement related
thereto) shall not constitute a material dispute or disagreement), (iv) the
lender refuses to provide, or expresses an intent to refuse to provide, all or
any of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the
terms set forth therein (assuming satisfaction of the obligations set forth in
Section 7.2), or (v) for any reason (other than as a result of the failure or
potential failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 to be satisfied),
the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary, no longer believes in good faith that
it shall be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on
substantially the terms described in the Debt Commitment Letter (except to the
extent the Debt Financing is reduced as a result of the receipt of (A) net
cash proceeds in exchange for debt securities and/or equity financing in lieu
thereof or

in addition thereto _provided_ that any such proceeds must be actually
received by and available to the Buyer prior to any reduction in the Debt
Financing and through the Closing (with proceeds held in an escrow account and
subject to release upon the Closing being deemed to be actually received by
and available to the Buyer) and/or (B) other Available Cash). As soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any event within five (5) Business Days after
the date the Company delivers to the Buyer a written request therefor, the
Buyer shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company
relating to any circumstance referred to in any of clauses (i), (ii), (iii),
and (iv) of the immediately preceding sentence; provided that the Buyer shall
not be required to provide any such information to the extent (w) disclosure
would be prohibited under applicable Law, (x) the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates is bound to keep such requested information confidential under any
Contract in existence as on the date hereof, (y) such disclosure could
reasonably be expected to result in a waiver of attorney-client privilege or
(z) such information consists of attorney work product.

  

(c) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter or Debt
Financing Agreement (as may be modified by the exercise of any "market flex"
contained in the Fee Letter), the Buyer shall (i) promptly notify the Company
of such unavailability and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to
promptly obtain such Debt Financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient, together with the gross proceeds of any debt securities and/or
equity financing in lieu thereof or in addition to any other Available Cash,
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
payment of the Required Amount. For purposes of this Agreement, (x) references
to " _Debt Financing_ " shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as permitted or required by this Section 6.12 to be amended,
modified or replaced, and (y) references to " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " shall
include such commitment letter (or other definitive agreement), including all
annexes, exhibits and schedules thereto, with respect to any such amended,
modified or replacement financing, in each case, from and after such
amendment, modification or replacement, and the applicable provisions of this
Section 6.12 shall apply to any such amended, modified or replacement
financing.

  

(d) The Company agrees to provide, and to cause its Subsidiaries to provide,
the Buyer with such cooperation in connection with arranging and obtaining the
Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by the Buyer, including, (i)
promptly providing the Financing Sources with all financial information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably required to prepare
customary bank information memoranda and lender presentations, registration
statements and offering memoranda in connection with the Debt Financing,
including, without limitation, the financial statements required to be
provided pursuant to paragraph (d) of Exhibit C of the Debt Commitment Letter
and paragraph (f) of Exhibit D of the Debt Commitment Letter, which financial
statements shall be Compliant (the " _Required Financial Information_ "); (ii)
participating (including by making members of senior management with
appropriate seniority and expertise available to participate) in a reasonable
number of road shows, meetings, due diligence sessions, presentations,
drafting sessions and sessions with the rating agencies in connection with the
Debt Financing, at reasonable times and locations; (iii)

reasonably cooperating with the Financing Sources' due diligence, including
access to documentation reasonably requested by persons in connection with
bank financings; (iv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts for
any portion of the Debt Financing; (v) reasonably cooperating with the
preparation of bank information memoranda (including, to the extent necessary,
an additional bank information memorandum that does not include material non-
public information and customary authorization letters), prospectuses,
offering memoranda and similar documents, rating agency presentations, road
show presentations and written offering materials used to complete the Debt
Financing, to the extent information contained therein reasonably relates to
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (vi) reasonably cooperating
with the Buyer in procuring a public corporate credit rating and a public
corporate family rating in respect of the relevant borrower under the Debt
Financing and public ratings for any of the tranches of the Debt Financing;

accountants for use of their auditor opinions in any materials relating to the
Debt Financing, as reasonably requested by Buyer on behalf of the Financing
Sources, (y) reasonably assisting the Buyer in obtaining accountants' comfort
letters, including customary negative assurance from the Company's independent
accountants on customary terms and (z) reasonably assisting the Buyer in the
preparation of pro forma financial information; (viii) provide the Buyer at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date all customary
documentation and other information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as is reasonably requested in writing by the Buyer or its
Financing Sources, _provided_ that the Buyer or its Financing Sources make
such request for documentation and/or other information at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date in connection with the Debt Financing
to comply with applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules
and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act; and (vii) cooperating with
respect to the payoff of existing Indebtedness of the Company, whether in the
form of a tender offer, change of control offer, redemption, satisfaction and
discharge, consent solicitation, or otherwise; provided, however, that (A) no
liability or obligation (including any liability or obligation to pay any
commitment or other similar fee) of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof
under any certificate, document or instrument shall be effective until the
Closing and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary thereof shall be required
to take any action under any certificate, document or instrument that is not
contingent upon the Closing (including the entry into any agreement that is
effective before the Closing) or that would be effective prior to the Closing
(other than with respect to customary authorization letters referred to in
clause (v) above), and (B) nothing herein shall require such cooperation to
the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the ongoing business or
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, the condition set forth in Section 7.2(b), as it applies to the
Company's obligations under this Section 6.12(d), shall be deemed satisfied
unless there has occurred a Company Willful Breach of the Company's
obligations under this Section 6.12(d). The Buyer shall, promptly upon request
by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or any Subsidiary thereof in
connection with such cooperation. All non-public or otherwise confidential
information regarding the Company or any Subsidiary thereof obtained by the
Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or any of their respective representatives
pursuant to this Section 6.12(d) shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement. The

misconduct by the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives.

  

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, each of the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of any financing is not
a condition to the Closing and each of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary
shall remain obligated, subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

6.13 _Termination of Affiliate Transactions_. Prior to the Closing Date, the

ARTICLE VIII 
  
  TAX MATTERS

  

8.1 _Covered Tax Returns_. The Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns of the Company and the
Subsidiaries of the Company for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods which were not
filed on or prior to the Closing Date, and for all Straddle Periods (such Tax
Returns, collectively, " _Covered Tax Returns_ "). All Covered Tax Returns
shall be prepared in accordance with the past practices of the Company or a
Subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, except as required by changes in
applicable Tax Laws or changes in fact. The Buyer shall provide a copy of any
Covered Tax Returns prepared pursuant to this Section 8.1 to the Company
Equityholder Representative (together with any additional information
reasonably requested by the Company Equityholder Representative) for its
review and comment as soon as reasonably practicable but in any event at least
30 days prior to the due date for such Tax Returns. The Buyer, on the one
hand, and the Company Equityholder Representative, on the other hand, agree to
consult and resolve in good faith any dispute with respect to any Covered Tax
Returns prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return. The Buyer
shall be entitled to indemnification from the General Escrow Fund under
Section 8.7 for the amount of Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shown as due and owing on such Covered Tax Return, to the extent such Taxes
have not been taken into account for purposes of determining the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment or otherwise in determining the Aggregate Closing
Consideration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
parties agree that (i) any net operating losses of the Company and the
Subsidiaries of the Company that are attributable to and arise in a Pre-
Closing Tax Period (including, for the avoidance of doubt, net operating
losses that arise as a result of any tax deduction that is permitted by
applicable Law to be claimed in connection with the Venezuela Receivables) ("
_Pre-Closing NOLs_ ") may be used to offset taxable income of the Company and
the Subsidiaries of the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period; and (ii) in no
event shall the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company) be obligated to pay the
Company Equityholders or the Company Equityholder Representative for any Tax
benefit realized by the Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company) that arises from any
carryforward of Pre-Closing NOLs to a Post-Closing Tax Period.

  

8.2 _Straddle Periods_. In the case of any taxable period of the Company or a
Subsidiary of the Company that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date
(a " _Straddle Period_ "), (i) the amount of any Taxes (or any refund or
credit of Taxes) based on or measured by income, receipts, payroll or sales
for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing
of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date provided, that,
in determining such amount, exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on a periodic basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall
be taken into account on a pro-rated basis in the manner described in clause
(ii) below; and (ii) the amount of other Taxes (or any refund or credit of
such other Taxes) for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the
amount of

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-83-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle
Period. Any Taxes that are attributable to transactions that occur on the
Closing Date but after the Closing and that are not incurred in the ordinary
course of business of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be considered to
be attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the
Closing Date.

  

8.3 _Transfer Taxes_. The Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company
Equityholders (in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares), on the other hand,
shall jointly pay, in equal amounts, all transfer Taxes, if any, relating to
the transactions herein. Each party hereto shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to avail itself and make available to the other parties any available
exemptions from any such transfer Taxes, and to cooperate with the other
parties in providing any information and documentation that may be necessary
to obtain such exemptions. The Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation
and filing of all Tax Returns relating to transfer Taxes that are required to
be filed by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company after the Closing Date
(the " _Transfer Tax Returns_ "). To the extent required by applicable Law,
the Company Equityholder Representative (on behalf of the Company
Equityholders) shall cooperate with the Buyer in the preparation and filing of
such Transfer Tax Returns. The parties agree to consult and resolve in good
faith any dispute with respect to any Transfer Tax Returns prior to the due
date for the filing of such Transfer Tax Return. All expenses incurred in
preparation and filing of any Transfer Tax Returns shall be borne equally by
the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company Equityholders, on the other hand.

  

8.4 _Cooperation and Tax Record Retention_.

  

(a) The Buyer and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation and any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation), on the one hand,
and the Company Equityholder Representative (on behalf of the Company
Equityholders), on the other hand, shall cooperate in good faith in connection
with (i) the preparation and timely filing of any Tax Return of the Company,
the Surviving Corporation and their Subsidiaries, or any Tax Return relating
to transfer Taxes; and (ii) any Tax audit, contest, examination or Proceeding.

  

(b) The Company Equityholders shall be entitled to any refund (including any
interest actually received thereon) of Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (a " _Tax Refund_ ")
to the extent (i) a Tax Refund is not attributable to the carryback of a net
operating loss of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company from a Post-
Closing Tax Period and (ii) a Tax Refund was not taken into account for
purposes of determining the Final Purchase Price Adjustment or otherwise in
determining the Aggregate Closing Consideration. Any Tax Refund for any
Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the Company Equityholders and the
Buyer in accordance with the principles set forth in Section 8.2. The Buyer
and its Affiliates shall cooperate with the Company Equityholder
Representative in obtaining any Tax Refund to which the Company Equityholders
are entitled under this Section 8.4(b), and the reasonable out-of-pocket costs
of obtaining such Tax Refund (other than costs incurred in filing an initial
Covered Tax Return which gives rise to a Tax

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-84-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

Refund) shall be borne by the Company Equityholders. The Surviving Corporation
shall promptly after the date of receipt of a Tax Refund (or after the date of
filing a Covered Tax Return on which any amounts of overpaid Taxes shown on
such Covered Tax Return are credited to estimated Taxes for a subsequent Tax
year in lieu of being treated as a Tax Refund) by the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Affiliates (and in no event no later than twenty (20) Business Days

the Surviving Corporation's receipt of such amount and shall be subject to any
applicable withholding as provided in Section 2.8). For the avoidance of
doubt, the Buyer shall (in accordance with the Closing Date Allocation
Schedule) cause (x) the Surviving Corporation to use any funds distributed to
the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section 8.4(b) and (y) the Payments
Administrator to use any funds distributed to the Payments Administrator
pursuant to this Section 8.4(b) to make the payments provided for in this
Section 8.4, and such funds shall not be used for any other purpose except as
provided in this Agreement.

  

8.5 _Tax-Sharing Agreements_. All Tax allocation, Tax sharing or similar
agreements to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party,
on the one hand, and the Company Equityholders or any of their Affiliates is a
party, on the other hand, shall be terminated as of the Closing Date, and
after the Closing Date, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and their
Subsidiaries shall not be bound thereby or have any Liability thereunder.

applicable Laws with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods; and (iii) any and all
Liability for Taxes payable by the Company Equityholders pursuant to Section

or otherwise in determining the Aggregate Closing Consideration.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification for any

ARTICLE IX

9.1 _Indemnification by Company Equityholders from the Escrow Accounts_.
Subject to the limitations expressly set forth in Section 9.6, the Buyer and
its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries) and each of the their respective Representatives
(collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be entitled to
indemnification from the General Escrow Account with respect to claims for
indemnification pursuant to Sections 9.1(a), 9.1(b) and 9.1(c) and from the
Venezuela Escrow Account for claims pursuant to Sections 9.1(c), for the
monetary value of any and all Losses incurred or suffered by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties directly or indirectly arising out of, relating to or
resulting from any of the following:

  

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty or other
statement of the Company contained in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure
Schedule, any Ancillary Agreement or in any certificate, instrument or other
document delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement;

  

(b) any nonfulfillment, nonperformance or other breach of any covenant or
agreement of the Company required to be fulfilled or performed prior to the
Closing contained in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule, any
Ancillary Agreement or in any certificate, instrument or other document
delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement;

  

(c) any Venezuela Escrow Claim Event.

  

This Section 9.1 shall not apply to Liabilities relating to Taxes, as to which
Section 8.7 shall govern.

  

9.2 _Indemnification by the Buyer_. Subject to the limitations expressly set
forth in Section 9.6, the Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company
Equityholders from and against, and shall pay to the Company Equityholders the
monetary value of any and all Losses incurred or suffered by the Company
Equityholders directly or indirectly arising out of, relating to or resulting
from any of the following:

  

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty or other
statement of the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary contained in this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or in any certificate, instrument or other
document delivered by the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary pursuant to this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement;

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-86-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) any nonfulfillment, nonperformance or other breach of any covenant or
agreement of the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary contained in this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or in any certificate, instrument or other
document delivered by the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary pursuant to this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; and

  

(c) any and all Liability for Taxes payable by the Buyer pursuant to Section
8.3.

  

9.3 _Claim Procedure_.

  

(a) Any party hereto that seeks indemnity under Article VIII or this Article
IX (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give written notice (a " _Claim Notice_
") to the party hereto from whom indemnification is sought (an " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") containing (i) a description and the estimated amount of any Losses
incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the Indemnified Party only
if and to the extent such Loss can be estimated, (ii) a reasonably detailed
explanation of the basis for the Claim Notice to the extent of the facts then
known by the Indemnified Party and (iii) a demand for payment of those Losses
in accordance with the terms hereof, the General Escrow Agreement and the
Venezuela Escrow Agreement, as applicable.

  

(b) Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party
shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response in which the
Indemnifying Party shall either:

  

(i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Losses
at issue in the Claim Notice; or

  

(ii) dispute the Indemnified Party's entitlement to indemnification by
delivering to the Indemnified Party a written notice (an " _Objection Notice_
") setting forth in reasonable detail each disputed item, the basis for each
such disputed item and certifying that all such disputed items are being
disputed in good faith.

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party fails to take either of the foregoing actions
within 30 days after delivery of the Claim Notice, then the Indemnifying Party
shall be deemed to have irrevocably accepted the Claim Notice and the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have irrevocably agreed to pay the
Losses at issue in the Claim Notice.

  

(d) If the Indemnifying Party delivers an Objection Notice to the Indemnified
Party within 30 days after delivery of the Claim Notice, then the parties
hereto shall use their reasonable efforts to resolve the disputed items. If
they are unable to do so within 15 Business Days of the date of receipt by the
Indemnified Party of the Objection Notice or such longer period as may be
agreed between the parties hereto, then the amount of the Losses at issue in
the Claim Notice (less the amount, if any, acknowledged in the Objection
Notice by the Indemnifying Party as due the Indemnified Party), shall be
treated as a disputed claim to be settled pursuant to Section 12.10.

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-87-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

(e) Any payments required to be made to a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to
Article VIII or this Article IX (other than with respect to indemnification
claims made by a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.1(c)) by the
Company Equityholders shall be made solely by resort to the General Escrow
Fund. Any payments required to be made to a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant
to Section 9.1(c) by the Company Equityholders shall be made solely by resort
first to the Venezuela Escrow Fund, and if insufficient to satisfy the entire
amount of such payment, then to the General Escrow Fund. Any indemnification
of the Company Equityholders pursuant to this Article IX shall be effected by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Payments Administrator. All indemnification payments to be received by the
Company Equityholders in accordance with this Article IX shall be allocated
among the Company Equityholders in accordance with their Applicable Pro Rata
Indemnification Percentage as set forth on the Closing Date Allocation
Schedule.

  

(f) The indemnification payments referenced in Section 9.3(e) shall be made
within five Business Days after the date on which (i) the amount of such
payments are determined by mutual agreement of the Buyer and the Company
Equityholder Representative, (ii) the amount of such payments are determined
pursuant to Section 9.3(c) if an Objection Notice has not been timely
delivered in accordance with Section 9.3(b) or (iii) both such amount and the
Indemnifying Party's obligation to pay such amount have been determined by a
final Order of a court having jurisdiction over such Proceeding as permitted
by Section 12.10 if an Objection Notice has been timely delivered in
accordance with Section 9.3(b).

  

(g) Upon expiration of the General Escrow Period, the Company Equityholder
Representative and the Buyer shall promptly prepare, execute and deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to disburse to the Payments
Administrator for distribution to the Company Equityholders (in accordance
with their Applicable Pro Rata Indemnification Percentage) the remainder of
the General Escrow Fund (if any), less any Pending Claims Amount. Amounts
remaining in the General Escrow Fund after the expiration of the General
Escrow Period on account of a disputed or otherwise outstanding claim shall be
released from time to time by the Escrow Agent to the Buyer Indemnified
Parties or the Payments Administrator for distribution to the Company
Equityholders (in accordance with their Pro Rata Share), as applicable, within
five (5) Business Days after the date on which (i) the amount of any payment
required to be made on account of such disputed claim is determined by mutual
agreement of the Buyer and the Company Equityholder Representative or (ii)
both such amount and the Indemnifying Party's obligation to pay such amount
have been determined by a final Order of a court having jurisdiction over such
Proceeding as permitted by Section 12.10. Any cash payments to be made as a
result of this Section 9.3(g) shall be paid within five (5) Business Days of
the final determination of such amounts by wire transfer of immediately
available funds.

  

(h) For purposes of this Section 9.3 and Section 9.4, (i) with respect to
indemnification from the Escrow Accounts pursuant to Section 9.1, any
references to the Indemnifying Party (except provisions relating to an
obligation to make (which for the avoidance of doubt shall be limited to the
Escrow Accounts) or a right to receive any payments) shall be

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-88-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

deemed to refer to the Company Equityholder Representative and (ii) if the
Company Equityholders comprise the Indemnified Party, any references to the
Indemnified Party (except provisions relating to an obligation to make or a
right to receive any payments) shall be deemed to refer to the Company
Equityholder Representative.

  

(i) Notwithstanding any provision in this Article IX to the contrary, the
Buyer shall not be required to provide a Claim Notice to the Company
Equityholder Representative, permit the Company Equityholder Representative to
assume the defense of or obtain the Company Equityholder Representative's
consent in connection with the settlement or other resolution of any claim to
be satisfied exclusively under the Policy.

  

9.4 _Third Party Claims_.

  

(a) Without limiting the general application of the other provisions of this
Article IX, if another Person not a party to this Agreement alleges facts
that, if true, would mean that a party hereto has breached its representations
and warranties in this Agreement, the party hereto for whose benefit the
representations and warranties are made shall be entitled to indemnity for
those allegations and demands and related Losses under and pursuant to this
Article IX. If the Indemnified Party seeks indemnity under Article VIII or
this Article IX in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand,
whether or not involving a Proceeding, by another Person not a party to this
Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), then the Indemnified Party shall
include in the Claim Notice (i) notice of the commencement or threat of any
Proceeding relating to such Third Party Claim and (ii) the facts constituting
the basis for such Third Party Claim and the amount of the damages claimed by
the other Person, in each case to the extent known to the Indemnified Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no delay or deficiency on the part of the
Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any Liability or obligation under this Agreement except
to the extent the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual Losses directly
caused by the delay or other deficiency.

  

(b) Subject to any consent rights of any insurer or other limitations in the
Policy, within 30 days after the Indemnified Party's delivery of a Claim
Notice under this Section 9.4, the Indemnifying Party may assume control of
the defense of such Third Party Claim by giving to the Indemnified Party
written notice of the intention to assume such defense, but if and only if the
Indemnifying Party further:

  

(i) acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified Party that any Losses that may
be assessed in connection with the Third Party Claim constitute Losses for
which the Indemnified Party shall be indemnified pursuant to Article VIII or
this Article IX without contest or objection and that the Indemnifying Party
shall advance all expenses and costs of defense; and

  

(ii) retains counsel for the defense of the Third Party Claim satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld).

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-89-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

However, with respect to claims for indemnification under Article VIII or
Section 9.1, in no event may the Indemnifying Party assume, maintain control
of, or participate in, the defense of any Third Party Claim (A) involving any
criminal or quasi-criminal Proceeding or Liability or any Proceeding by any
Governmental Entity (other than a Proceeding related to Taxes for Pre-Closing
Tax Periods, in which case (I) the General Escrow Fund on behalf of the
Company Equityholders as the Indemnifying Party shall bear all costs
associated with their control, assumption or defense of, or participation in,
such Proceeding, and (II) the Buyer Indemnified Party may at its option
participate (at its expense) in any such Proceeding controlled, assumed or
defended by the Indemnifying Party), including any Proceeding related to any
Venezuela Contract, (B) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes an adverse
determination with respect to such Third Party Claim would be materially
detrimental to or materially injure the relationships of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries with any customer set forth on Section 3.20 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, (C) the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel
that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, (D) the Indemnified Party
reasonably believes that the Losses relating to such Third Party Claim would
(1) not exceed the Basket or (2) exceeds the maximum amount that the
Indemnified Party could then be entitled to recover from the General Escrow
Fund, (E) in which any relief other than monetary damages is sought against
the Indemnified Party (including injunctive relief, specific performance or
any other equitable relief), or (F) (1) the assumption of the defense by the
Indemnifying Party could cause any Buyer Indemnified Party to lose coverage
under the Policy or (2) a Buyer Indemnified Party or any insurer is required
to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim pursuant to the Policy
(collectively, clauses (A) through (F), the " _Special Claims_ "). An
Indemnifying Party shall lose any previously acquired right to control the
defense of any Third Party Claim if for any reason the Indemnifying Party
ceases to actively, competently and diligently conduct such defense.

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not, or is not able to, assume or maintain
control of the defense of a Third Party Claim in compliance with Section
9.4(b), the Indemnified Party shall have the right to control the defense of
the Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party controls the defense of the
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party agrees to pay to the Indemnified
Party promptly upon demand from time to time all attorneys' fees and other
costs and expenses of defending the Third Party Claim, subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 9.6. To the extent that the Third Party Claim
does not constitute a Special Claim described in clauses (A) or (C) of such
definition, the party hereto not controlling the defense (the "
_Noncontrolling Party_ ") may participate therein at its own expense. However,
if the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense as permitted above
and the Indemnified Party concludes that the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party have conflicting interests or different defenses available
with respect to the Third Party Claim, then the fees and expenses of counsel
to the Indemnified Party shall be considered and included as "Losses" for
purposes of this Agreement. The party hereto controlling the defense (the "
_Controlling Party_ ") shall reasonably advise the Noncontrolling Party of the
status of the Third Party Claim and the defense thereof and, with respect to
any Third Party Claim that does not relate to a Special Claim described in
clauses (A) or (C) of such definition, the Controlling Party shall consider in
good

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-90-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

faith recommendations made by the Noncontrolling Party. The Noncontrolling
Party shall furnish the Controlling Party with such information as it may have
with respect to such Third Party Claim and related Proceedings (including
copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been served
on such Party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other
document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall otherwise cooperate with
and assist in the defense of the Third Party Claim.

  

(d) Neither the Company Equityholders nor the Company Equityholder
Representative shall agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment
arising from, any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
_provided_ that the consent of the Buyer shall not be required if the Company
Equityholder Representative, on behalf of all of the Company Equityholders,
agrees in writing that any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or
judgment shall be paid out of the applicable Escrow Account and such
settlement or judgment includes a complete release of the Buyer from further
liability and has no other adverse effect on the Buyer. The Buyer may agree to
any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Company Equityholder
Representative; provided that such compromised or settled amount shall not
constitute evidence of the actual amount of Losses for which the Company
Equityholders shall be liable unless such compromise or settlement is entered
into with the consent of the Company Equityholder Representative (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Notwithstanding the forgoing, in no event shall the Indemnified Party have any
Liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of, or the entry of any
Order arising from, any Third Party Claim effected without its consent.

  

9.5 _Survival_.

  

(a) All representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the
Company Disclosure Schedule, any Ancillary Agreement or in any certificate,
instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Closing, irrespective of any facts known to any Indemnified Party
at or prior to the Closing or any investigation at any time made by or on
behalf of any Indemnified Party, for a period of twelve (12) months from the
Closing Date. The right of an Indemnified Party to assert a claim for
indemnification relating to the breach of any covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement to the extent required to be performed or complied with on
or prior to the Closing Date shall survive the Closing, irrespective of any
facts known to any Indemnified Party at or prior to the Closing or any
investigation at any time made by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party, for a
period of twelve (12) months from the Closing Date.

  

(b) All claims for indemnification under Section 8.7, Section 9.1(a), Section
9.1(b) or Section 9.2 must be asserted prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period set forth in Section 9.5(a) and all claims for
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(c) shall survive until the final
disbursement of all remaining funds in the Venezuela Escrow Account to the
Buyer pursuant to Section 2.6(c)(v); _provided_ , _however_ , that if an
Indemnified Party delivers to

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-91-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

an Indemnifying Party, before expiration of the applicable survival period,
either a Claim Notice based upon a breach of any such representation or
warranty, or a notice that, as a result of a claim or demand made by a Person
not a party to this Agreement, the Indemnified Party reasonably expects to
incur Losses, right to indemnification shall survive until, but only for
purposes of, the resolution of the matter covered by such notice.

  

(c) All of the covenants, agreements and obligations of the parties hereto
contained in this Agreement that by their terms apply or are to be performed
subsequent to the Closing shall survive in accordance with their terms or
until fully performed, fulfilled or otherwise waived.

  

9.6 _Limitations of Liability_.

  

(a) For the avoidance of doubt, a Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
recover 100% of any Losses with respect to which such Buyer Indemnified Party
is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement from the General Escrow
Fund or the Venezuela Escrow Fund, as applicable, in accordance with Section
2.1(e) without regard to the Applicable Pro Rata Indemnification Percentage of
any Company Equityholder or application of concepts of several liability. From
and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties for any matter arising out of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification obligations set forth in
Section 8.7 and Article IX , and, other than the General Escrow Amount and the
Venezuela Escrow Amount, the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties with respect to the indemnification obligations set forth
in Section 8.7 and Article IX shall be limited to the Policy.

  

(b) Subject to this Section 9.6, the indemnification obligations (i) under
Section 9.1(a) shall not apply unless and until the aggregate Losses for which
they would otherwise be applicable under this Agreement exceed four million
dollars ($4,000,000) (the " _Basket_ ") in which case they shall only apply
for the amount by which such aggregate Losses exceeds the Basket and shall be
recoverable (subject to the other limitations contained herein) and (ii) under
Sections 8.7 and 9.1(a) shall not exceed $4,000,000 except the Specified
Liabilities, which shall not exceed the General Escrow Amount (the " _Cap_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Basket shall not apply to any
indemnification obligations with respect to a breach of the Company
Fundamental Representations. For the avoidance of doubt, (A) the Basket shall
not apply to any claims under Section 8.7 and (B) subject to Section 9.6(d),
no Company Equityholder shall have any liability under this Agreement beyond
the amounts contained in the Escrow Accounts.

  

(c) For purposes of (i) determining whether a breach of a representation and
warranty has occurred and (ii) calculating the amount of Losses recoverable by
an Indemnified Party as a result of a breach of a representation or warranty
of a party hereto set forth herein, all "Material Adverse Effect," "in all
material respects," "material", "materially" or other similar qualifiers set
forth in the applicable representation and warranty shall be disregarded.

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-92-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement limits the liability of any Company Equityholder for fraud in the
event that such Company Equityholder has willingly and knowingly committed
fraud against the Buyer, with the specific intent to deceive and mislead the
Buyer, regarding the representations and warranties in this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties to make claims against the Policy.

  

9.7 _No Right of Indemnification or Contribution_. No Company Equityholder has
any right of indemnification or contribution against the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any breach by the Company of any of
its representations, warranties, statements, covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule, any Ancillary Agreement or
in any certificate, instrument or other document delivered by or on behalf of
the Company pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, whether by
virtue of any contractual or statutory right of indemnity or otherwise, and
all claims to the contrary are hereby waived and released.

  

9.8 _Effect of Knowledge_. A Buyer Indemnified Party's right to
indemnification or other remedies based upon the representations and
warranties and covenants and agreements of the Company shall not be affected
by any investigation or knowledge of the Buyer Indemnified Party or its
representatives or any waiver by the Buyer Indemnified Party of any condition
based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or compliance with
any covenant or agreement. Such representations and warranties and covenants
and agreements shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of the fact
that the Buyer Indemnified Party knew or should have known that any
representation or warranty might be inaccurate or that Company failed to
comply with any agreement or covenant. Any investigation by any Buyer
Indemnified Party shall be for its own protection only and shall not affect or
impair any right or remedy hereunder.

  

9.9 _Representations and Warranties Policy_. The Company Equityholder
Representative, for itself and on behalf of the Company Equityholders,
acknowledges that the Buyer is entering into the Policy and that, in
connection therewith, a Buyer Indemnified Party may make claims for the same
Loss or series of related Losses under this Article IX or Article VIII,
subject to the limitations set forth in this Article IX or Article VIII, and
the Policy. The Company Equityholder Representative for itself and on behalf
of the Company Equityholders, further acknowledges and agrees that the denial
of any claim by any Buyer Indemnified Party under the Policy shall not be
construed as, or used as evidence that, such Buyer Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification under Article VIII or this Article IX, subject to
the limitations set forth in Article VIII or this Article IX.

Approval:

  

(a) by mutual written consent of the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and the
Company; or

  

(b) by either the Buyer or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated by the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(b) shall not be available to
a party if the failure of the Merger to have been consummated on or before the

its material obligations under this Agreement; or

  

(c) by either the Buyer or the Company if a Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a nonappealable final Order or taken any other
nonappealable final action, in each case having the effect of permanently

(d) by the Buyer, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set
forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would cause
the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) not to be satisfied and
(ii) shall not have been cured or waived, or cannot be cured, within 15
calendar days following receipt by the Company of written notice of such
breach or failure to perform from the Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(d) shall not be
available to the Buyer if the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary is then in
breach of this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would cause the
conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) not to be satisfied; or

event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that shall
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.

  

12.6 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2)
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered by electronic transmission.

  

12.7 _Interpretation_. Except where expressly stated otherwise in this
Agreement, the following rules of interpretation apply to this Agreement: (a)
"either" and "or" are not exclusive and "include," "includes" and "including"
are not limiting; (b) "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement;
(c) "date of this Agreement" refers to the date set forth in the initial
caption of this Agreement; (d) "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means
the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase does not
mean simply "if"; (e) the descriptive headings and table of contents included
herein are included for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any provision hereof; (f)
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well
as the plural forms of such terms; (g) references to a contract or agreement
mean such contract or agreement as amended or otherwise

supplemented or modified from time to time; (h) references to a Person are

the Company's electronic data room no later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on
the second (2nd) Business Day prior to the date of this Agreement and remained
available to Buyer through the Closing (ii) delivered to the Buyer or its

parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any party hereto. No summary of this
Agreement prepared by any party shall affect the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. If any date on which a party is required to make a payment or
a delivery pursuant to the terms hereof is not a Business Day, then such party
shall make such payment or delivery on the next succeeding Business Day. Time

12.8 _Governing Law_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 12.13, this
Agreement, the legal relations between the parties, and all claims or causes
of action (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of Laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

  

12.9 _Remedies_.

  

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such party, and
the exercise by a party of any one (1) remedy shall not preclude the exercise
of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
or threatened to be breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or
undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it waives all
objection to, and shall not oppose, the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to the extent of any breach of the
terms hereof.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, if prior to the Closing a court of
competent jurisdiction declines to specifically enforce the obligations of the
Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary under this Agreement, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the Company Equityholders may have the right to
pursue claims for damages (which damages the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-
pocket costs and shall include damages based on loss of the economic benefits
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to such Company
Equityholders) and other relief (including equitable relief) for any breach of
this Agreement by the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary, whether or not this
Agreement has been validly terminated pursuant to Article X. The rights
granted pursuant to the foregoing sentence of this Section 12.9(b) shall only
be enforceable on behalf of the Company Equityholders by the Company, in its
sole and absolute discretion, as agent for the Company Equityholders, it being
understood and agreed that any and all interests in such claims shall attach
to the shares of Company Stock and the Company Equity Awards held by such
Company Equityholders and shall subsequently transfer therewith and,
consequently, any damages, settlements or other amounts recovered or received
by the Company with respect to such claims (net of expenses incurred by the
Company in connection therewith) may, in the Company's sole and absolute
discretion, be (i) distributed, in whole or in part, by the Company to Company
Equityholders of record as of any date determined by the Company or (ii)
retained by the Company for the use and benefit of the Company on behalf of
the Company Equityholders in any manner the Company deems fit.

  

(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or otherwise, the parties
to this Agreement agree on their own behalf and on behalf of their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates that, except as set forth in Section 9.6(d) and to
the extent expressly agreed to in writing by a specific Non Recourse Party,
including the Shareholder Support Agreements, no Non Recourse Party of a party
to this Agreement shall have any liability relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated herein, and no claims or causes of action
(whether in contract, in tort, in law, or in equity) that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, may be made against any such Non-Recourse
Party. " _Non Recourse Party_ " means, (i) with respect to any Person, any of
such Person\'s or any of such Person\'s Affiliates' former, current and future
equityholders, controlling Persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
representatives, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners,
or assignees (or any heir, successor, executor, administrator or assignee of
any of the foregoing) and (ii) with respect to the Buyer, the Financing
Sources.

  

12.10 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Except as otherwise provided in Section
12.13, each of the parties to this Agreement (a) consents to submit itself to
the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Business Litigation Session of the
Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts (or, if and only if the
Business Litigation Session of the Superior Court of Suffolk County,
Massachusetts lacks jurisdiction, another Massachusetts state court located in
Suffolk County, or, if and only if all such state courts lack jurisdiction,
the federal district court for the District of Massachusetts), (b) agrees that
all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-129-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

and determined in any such court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court and (d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding
so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be
required of any other party with respect thereto. Any party hereto may make
service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the
party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of
notices in Section 12.1. Nothing in this Section 12.10, however, shall affect
the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
Law.

  

12.11 _Disclosure Schedules_. The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
arranged in Sections corresponding to the numbered Sections contained in
Article III or other relevant Sections of this Agreement, and the disclosure
in any Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall qualify (a) the
corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) the other Sections of this
Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of such
disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other Sections. The
inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be
deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such
information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has
had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
or is outside the ordinary course of business.

  

12.12 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Non-Assertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege_ (c) .

  

(a) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer hereby waives and agrees not to assert,
and Buyer agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries to waive and not to assert, any conflict of interest arising out
of or relating to any representation after the Closing (any " _Post-Closing
Representation_ ") of the Company Equityholder Representative, any Company
Equityholder, any of their respective Affiliates or any officer, employee or
director of the Company Equityholder Representative, any Company Equityholder,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (any such Person, a " _Designated
Person_ ") in any matter involving this Agreement or any agreement,
certificate, instrument or other document executed or delivered pursuant to
this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby (including
any Proceeding and including any matter regarding the negotiation, execution,
performance or enforceability hereof or thereof) by Wilmer Cutler Pickering
Hale and Dorr LLP and any other legal counsel currently representing the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement or any
agreement, certificate, instrument or other document executed or delivered
pursuant to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby
(including the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof) (the "
_Current Representation_ ").

  

(b) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer hereby agrees not to control or assert,
and Buyer agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries not to control

  

 

 


 

  


 

  


 

 

  

-130-   

 


 

  


 

 

 

  


 

  

or assert, any attorney-client privilege, work product protection or other
similar privilege or protection applicable to any communication that occurred
prior to the Closing between any legal counsel and any Designated Person with
respect to the Current Representation in connection with any Post-Closing
Representation, including in connection with a dispute between a Designated
Person and Buyer or its Affiliates, it being the intention of the parties
hereto that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 1.3 or the
MBCA, all rights of any Person under or with respect to such attorney-client
privilege, work product protection or other similar privilege or protection,
including the right to waive, assert and otherwise control such attorney-
client privilege, work product protection or other similar privilege or
protection, shall be (and are hereby) transferred to or retained by (as
applicable), and vested solely in, such Designated Person. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between any Buyer Indemnified
Party and a Person other than a Designated Person after the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation and or its Subsidiaries shall retain all rights under or
with respect to such attorney-client privilege, work product protection or
other similar privilege or protection, including the right to waive, assert
and otherwise control such attorney-client privilege, work product protection
or other similar privilege or protection; provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries may not waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of the Company Equityholder Representative.

  

12.13 _Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of the parties hereto on behalf of itself and each of its
Affiliates hereby: (a) agrees that any Proceeding, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the Financing
Sources, arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Debt Financing or
any of the agreements (including the Debt Commitment Letter and any Debt
Financing Agreement) entered into in connection with the Debt Financing or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any
services thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, so
long as such forum is and remains available, and any appellate court thereof
and each party hereto irrevocably submits itself and its property with respect
to any such Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court, (b) agrees
that any such Proceeding shall be governed by the laws of the State of New
York (without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that would
result in the application of the laws of another state), (c) agrees not to
bring or support or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or support any
Proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source in any way
arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt
Commitment Letter, any Debt Financing Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder
in any forum other than any federal or state court in the Borough of
Manhattan, New York, New York, (d) agrees that service of process upon such
party in any such Proceeding or proceeding shall be effective if notice is
given in accordance with Section 12.10, (e) irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent that it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of such Proceeding in any such court, (f) knowingly,
intentionally and voluntarily waives to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law trial by jury in any Proceeding brought against the Financing
Sources in any

way arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the
Debt Commitment Letter, any Debt Financing Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services
thereunder, (g) agrees that none of the Financing Sources shall have any
liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives any of their respective current, former or
future officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, stockholders,
limited partners, managers, members or partners or the Company Equityholder
Representative, in its individual capacity and on behalf of the Company
Equityholders relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt
Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter, any Debt Financing Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any
services thereunder and (h) agrees that the Financing Sources are express
third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the provisions in this
Agreement reflecting the foregoing agreements in this Section 12.13 (and such
provisions shall not be amended in any way material to the Financing Sources
without the prior written consent of the any lenders under the Financing
Documents).
