business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which it owns or
leases real property and each other jurisdiction in which the conduct of its
business or the ownership of its properties requires such qualification or
authorization, except where the failure to be so qualified, authorized or in

that relates to the consummation of the Transactions.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(ii) Except as set forth in Section 8(b)(iv), the Purchaser's receipt of

Section 9(a)(ii)), (B) operate as a waiver of or otherwise affect the
Purchaser's right to require that the conditions set forth in Section 2(a)

Transactions required to be made by such Party under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act") or any other
applicable Law. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take
such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice period
under the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as possible.
The Parties hereto shall not willfully take any action that will have the
effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any required
consents, authorizations, orders and approvals.

Parent and Seller

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25

all obligations and burdens thereunder.

 

 

(v) All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of
any Party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any
Governmental Authority, in connection with the Transactions (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions between Parent, Seller or
the Company with any Governmental Authorities in the ordinary course of
business thereof, any disclosure which is not permitted by Law, or any
disclosure containing confidential information) shall be disclosed to the
other Parties, or indirectly to them and restricted to their outside counsel
to the extent that the information's highly confidential nature reasonably
requires, in advance of any filing, submission or attendance, and, to the
extent reasonably possible, the Parties will consult and cooperate with one
another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection
with any such analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of the Parties, unless prohibited or
restricted by Law or any Governmental Authority, shall promptly notify the
other Parties of any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from
any Governmental Authority relating to a Proposed Exercise and permit the
other Parties to review in advance any proposed communication by such Party
to any Governmental Authority. No Party shall agree to participate in any
meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings,
investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other Parties in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives
the other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting.

 

 

(vi) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6(d)
shall require, or be construed to require, the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates to agree to (A) sell, hold, divest, discontinue or limit, before
or after the Closing Date, any assets, businesses or interests of the
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates; (B) any
conditions relating to, or changes or restrictions in, the operations of any
such assets, businesses or interests which, in either case, could reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or materially and
adversely impact the economic or business benefits to the Purchaser of the
Transactions; or (C) any material modification or waiver of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

 

 

(e) Approval of Parent's Stockholders.

 

 

(i) As promptly as reasonably practicable, to the extent the approval of
the stockholders of Parent is required pursuant to applicable Law in order to
permit the sale of the Purchased Shares hereunder, Parent shall prepare and
file with the SEC within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement
the notices to stockholders and proxy materials necessary to solicit the
requisite vote of such stockholders at an annual or special meeting of Parent
(the "Proxy Materials"), which meeting shall be scheduled for no more than
twenty-two (22) Business Days following the date on which the Proxy Materials
are sent to Parent's stockholders. The Company, Parent, Seller and the
Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation
of the Proxy Materials. Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to have the Proxy Materials cleared by any Governmental Authority from
which clearance is

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26  

 

 

 

 

 


 

required by Law as promptly as practicable. Parent shall as promptly
as practicable notify the other Parties of the receipt of any oral or
written comments to the Proxy Materials from any applicable
Governmental Authority. Parent shall cooperate and provide the other Parties
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the draft of the
Proxy Materials (including each amendment or supplement thereto). If, at any
time prior to the Closing Date, any information should be discovered by
any Party that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Materials so that the Proxy Materials would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties
and, to the extent required by applicable Law, an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed by Parent with
any applicable Governmental Authority and disseminated by Parent to the other
Parties.

 

 

(ii) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, to the extent the
approval of the stockholders of Parent is required pursuant to Delaware Law
in order to permit the sale of the Purchased Shares hereunder, Parent shall
(A) take all action necessary in accordance with Parent's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws and applicable Law to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the mailing of the Proxy Materials for the purpose of
obtaining the requisite approval of Parent's stockholders to consummate the
Transactions, and (B) use its best efforts to solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of the approval of the Transactions.

 

 

(f) Settlement of Working Capital. The Company, the Purchaser, Parent and
Seller each acknowledge and agree that (x) the Company owes Parent $2.5
million in principal amount (plus interest accrued thereon) under that
certain Working Capital and Intercompany Agreement dated June 27, 2009, by
and between Parent and the Company, as amended on June 30, 2010 and subject
to that certain forbearance letter dated July 13, 2010 (as amended and
subject to the forbearance letter, the "Working Capital Agreement"), which
shall be repaid by the Company to Parent no later than August 30, 2010, and
(y) no further borrowing by the Company from Parent shall occur after the
date hereof under the Working Capital Agreement or otherwise under any of the
2009 Transaction Documents.

shall cause the Company to, reasonably facilitate communication by the
Purchaser with the Company's employees to enable the Purchaser to communicate
to the Company's employees (including, if requested by the Purchaser, at a
meeting with the Company's employees) the Purchaser's views and intentions
with respect to the operation of the Company's business after the Closing.

 

 

7. CERTAIN POST-CLOSING COVENANTS.

that are filed after the Closing Date, except for Consolidated Tax Returns
(as defined in the Stockholders' Agreement)

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27  

 

 

 

 

 


 

that are required to be filed by Parent pursuant to Section 10 of the
Stockholders' Agreement, which Consolidated Tax Returns shall be prepared and
filed by Parent in accordance with Section 10 of the Stockholders' Agreement.
At least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date of any Tax Return that

to this Section 7(a)(i) for filing the Tax Return (the "Filing Party")
(i.e., either the Purchaser or Parent) shall deliver to the other party (the
"Reviewing Party") (i.e., Parent in the case of a Tax Return to be filed by
the Purchaser and to the Purchaser in the case of a Tax Return to be filed
by Parent) for their review a draft of such Tax Returns (or in the case of
a Consolidated Tax Return, those portions of such Tax Return relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries). The Filing Party shall consider in
good faith any comments that the Reviewing Party may have with respect
to such Tax Returns (or portions thereof).

 

 

(ii) Cooperation on Tax Matters. Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any other Party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 7(a) and

Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable period beginning prior to
the Closing Date. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the reasonable request of Purchaser or Parent, as the case may be) the
provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such
audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. The Company and its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and on the other, Seller and Parent, agree (A) to retain all

thereto (and, to the extent notified by Purchaser or Parent, any extensions
thereof), and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with
any taxing authority, and (B) to give Parent or Purchaser, as applicable,
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records and, if requested by Parent or Purchaser, as the case
may be, Purchaser, Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and on the
other, Seller and Parent, shall allow Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, to
take possession of such books and records. Purchaser and Parent further
agree, upon the request of the other Party, to provide such other Party with
all information that Parent, Seller or the Company may be required to report
pursuant to Sections 6043 or 6043A of the Code or the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.

 

 

(iii) Tax Sharing Agreements. Any tax allocation, tax sharing, tax indemnity
or other similar agreement or arrangement (including Section 10 of
the Stockholders' Agreement), whether written or oral, between the Company
(or any of its Subsidiaries) and Parent (or any of its other Affiliates)
shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be bound thereby or
have any liability thereunder.

 

 

(b) Non-competition; Non-solicitation.

 

 

(i) For a period of two (2) years commencing on the Closing Date (the

world, compete with the Company with respect to the business of
development, distribution, sale, provision, license and maintenance of

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28  

 

 

 

 

 


 

multimedia software and related technology, services and equipment for home
and/or mobile devices as currently conducted by the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the "Restricted Business").

 

 

(ii) During the Restricted Period, Parent and Seller shall not, and shall not
permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, hire
or solicit any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
encourage any such employee to leave such employment or hire any such
employee who has left such employment, except pursuant to a general
solicitation which is not directed specifically to any such employees;
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 7(b) shall prevent Parent or
Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries from hiring (A) any employee
whose employment has been terminated by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or the Purchaser or (B) after 90 days from the date of
termination of employment, any employee whose employment has been terminated
by the employee.

 

 

(iii) During the Restricted Period, Parent and Seller shall not, and shall
not permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
solicit or entice, or attempt to solicit or entice, any client or customer of
the Company to terminate or materially modify its relationship with the
Company with respect to the Restricted Business;

 

 

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7(b) shall
be deemed to restrict Parent or Seller or any of their respective
Subsidiaries from managing, operating, marketing or selling the wireless
spectrum assets as described in Parent's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 2, 2010 or from
otherwise engaging in any activity related to the provision of wireless
services utilizing such wireless spectrum assets.

 

 

(v) If Parent or Seller breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any of
the provisions of this Section 7(b), the Purchaser and the Company shall
have the right to pursue the following rights and remedies, each of which
rights and remedies shall be independent of the others and severally
enforceable, and each of which is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any
other rights and remedies available to the Purchaser or the Company under Law
or in equity:

 

 

(A) the right and remedy to have such provision specifically enforced by any
court having jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such
breach or threatened breach may cause irreparable injury to each of the
Purchaser and the Company and that money damages may not provide an adequate
remedy to the Purchaser or the Company; and

 

 

(B) the right and remedy to recover from Parent and Seller, jointly and
severally, all monetary damages suffered by the Purchaser and/or the Company
as the result of any acts or omissions constituting a breach of this
Section 7(b).

 

 

(vi) Each of Parent and Seller acknowledges that the restrictions contained
in this Section 7(b) are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate
interests of the Purchaser and constitute a material inducement to the
Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and consummate the Transactions. In
the event that any covenant or agreement contained in this Section 7(b)
should ever be adjudicated to exceed the time or other limitations
permitted by

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29  

 

 

 

 

 


 

applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is expressly empowered to
reform such covenant, and such covenant or agreement shall be deemed
reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time or other limitations
permitted by applicable Law. The covenants and agreements contained in this
Section 7(b) and each provision hereof are severable and distinct covenants
and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or
provision as written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable
the remaining covenants or agreements or provisions hereof, and any such
invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such covenant or agreement or provision in any
other jurisdiction.

 

 

(c) Confidentiality. For a period of two (2) years after the Closing, Parent
and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates (excluding the
Company and its Subsidiaries) to, hold, and shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective representatives to hold, in confidence any
and all proprietary and confidential information, whether written or oral,
concerning the Company, except to the extent that Parent or Seller can show
that such information (i) is generally available to or known by the public
through no fault of Parent or Seller, or their respective Affiliates
(excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries); (ii) is or has been
independently conceived by Parent, Seller and their respective Affiliates
(excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries) without use of confidential
information of the Company; or (iii) is lawfully acquired by Parent or
Seller, any of their respective Affiliates or their
respective representatives from and after the Closing from sources without a
breach of any obligation of confidentiality that such source may have to the
Company; provided, however, that Parent and Seller and their respective
Affiliates may disclose confidential and proprietary information concerning
the Company (A) to its attorneys, accountants, consultants, advisors,
employees, directors and other professionals, provided that they are bound by
contract, fiduciary duty or otherwise to maintain the confidentiality of such
confidential information or (B) as may otherwise be required to be disclosed
by Law, provided that, to the extent reasonably practicable, Parent notifies
the Company of such proposed disclosure to enable the Company to seek an
appropriate protective order and, upon the reasonable request of the Company,
Parent agrees to take reasonable steps to cooperate with the Company, as
applicable, in connection therewith.

 

 

(d) Company Information and Parent and Seller Information. For a period of
two (2) years commencing on the Closing Date, (i) upon reasonable request of
the Company, Parent and Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to

within the custody and control of Parent or Seller, respectively, and (ii)
upon reasonable request of Parent or Seller, the Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Parent or Seller, as

the contrary in this Section 7(d), no Party shall be required to provide
copies of or otherwise disclose any financial or business records or other
documents or information where such provision or disclosure would violate or
contravene the rights of employees, customers or vendors of the Party
receiving the request or any of its Subsidiaries, jeopardize any attorney-
client privilege, work product privilege or other similar privilege, or
violate or contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or Contract entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement, provided that a Party withholding
such records, documents or information shall deliver to the requesting Party
a written log notifying the

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30  

 

 

 

 

 


 

requesting Party of the existence of, and the basis for withholding or
denying access to, such records, documents or information.

actual knowledge of such breach, facts or circumstances was otherwise
acquired by the Purchaser pursuant to Sections 6(b) or 6(c).

 

 

(c) Indemnification Provisions for Parent and Seller's Benefit. The Purchaser

Agreement and there has been a material breach, inaccuracy in or failure to
perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Parent,

Purchaser; or

 

 

(B) any of the conditions set forth in Section 2(a) shall not have been, or

Section 11(h) will be binding upon the Purchaser, Parent, the Company and

(i) Reporting and Publicity. Except as otherwise required by Law or
applicable stock exchange rules, press releases and other publicity
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be made only
with the prior agreement of the Company and Parent, on the one hand, and the
Purchaser, on the other hand (and in any event, the Parties hereto shall use

the content of any such required press release or other publicity).
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Purchaser agrees that

treatment of portions of this Agreement.

 

 

(j) Waivers. The waiver by a Party of any breach of any of the terms,
covenants or conditions of this Agreement or of any right or privilege
conferred by this Agreement shall not be construed as a subsequent waiver of

be effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized
representative of the waiving Party.

 

 

(k) Replacement of Shares. If any certificate or instrument evidencing
any Purchased Shares is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company

satisfactory to the Company of such loss, theft or destruction and customary
and reasonable indemnity, if requested.

 

 

(l) Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
unenforceable under applicable Law, such provision will be excluded from this
Agreement and the balance of the Agreement will be interpreted as if such
provision were so excluded and will be enforceable in accordance with its
terms. Further, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
replace such unenforceable provision of this Agreement with an enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such unenforceable provision.

Stockholders' Agreement and all exhibits and schedules hereto and thereto,

set forth an exhaustive list.

 

 

(p) No Presumption Against Drafting Party. Each of the Parties acknowledges
that each Party has been represented by counsel in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions and that the Parties have participated jointly
in the drafting of this Agreement. Accordingly, in the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 

 

(q) No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is not intended, and shall
not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, to create
any agreement of employment with any Person, or to otherwise create any
third-party beneficiary hereto.
