ARTICLE III

 

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

 

Section 3.1 _Surrender_ _and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the
purpose of exchanging shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent
to send, to each holder of record of one or more Certificates as of the
Effective Time, whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_
(Effect on Capital Stock), a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent) in such form as Parent may specify subject to the Companys reasonable
approval prior to the Effective Time, including instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be deposited with the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry
form) to be issued pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ (Effect on Capital Stock)
and an amount of cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to be paid pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 3.5_ (No Fractional Shares), payable to holders of the Book-
Entry Shares or payable to the holders of Certificates upon due surrender of
the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), in
each case, pursuant to the provisions of _Article II_ and this _Article III_.
Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange
Agent, from time to time as needed, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay
any dividends pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(f)_ (Dividends). All cash and
book-entry shares representing Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange
Agent shall be referred to in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". The
Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration (and any cash to be paid
in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.5_ (No Fractional Shares) or cash to be paid for dividends
in accordance with Section 3.1(f)) out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and
paid to, Parent.

(b) Each holder of one or more Certificate(s) representing shares of Company
Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of such Certificate(s) (or
effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (i) the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
(which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form unless a physical
certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ (Effect on Capital Stock), (ii) if
applicable, any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ (No Fractional
Shares) and (iii) if applicable, any dividends in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 3.1(f)_ (Dividends), in each case, without interest (less any required Tax
withholding). Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall, after the
Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive such (A)
Merger Consideration, (B) cash in lieu of any fractional shares and (C)
unpaid dividends. No holder of Book-Entry Shares shall be required to deliver
a Certificate or completed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent to
receive (1) the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be
in non-certificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ (Effect on Capital Stock), (2) if
applicable, any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Parent
Common Stock in accordance

 



16

    

 with _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ (No Fractional Shares) and (3) if applicable, any
dividends in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.1(f)_ (Dividends), in each
case, without interest (less any required Tax withholding). No interest shall
be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional
shares or unpaid dividends payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares.

 

(c) With respect to Certificate(s), in the event of a transfer of ownership of
any Certificate that is not registered in the transfer books of the Company
as of the Effective Time, (i) any Merger Consideration, (ii) if applicable,
any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ (No Fractional Shares) and (iii) if
applicable, any dividends in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.1(f)_
(Dividends), in each case, may be issued or paid to such a transferee if the
Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer, accompanied by all documents required
to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each case, in form
and substance, reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent. With respect to
Book-Entry Shares, issuance or payment of (1) any Merger Consideration, (2) if
applicable, any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ (No Fractional Shares)
and (3) if applicable, any dividends in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.1(f)_ (Dividends), in each case, shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer books of the
Company as of the Effective Time.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance
with the procedures set forth, in _Article II_ and this _Article_ __ _ III_.

 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be
returned to Parent, and any such holder who has not exchanged his or her
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to
Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such holders
shares of Company Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent,
Merger Sub, nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares
or any unpaid dividends delivered to any Governmental Entity pursuant to
applicable abandoned property Laws. Any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
fractional shares or any unpaid dividends remaining unclaimed by holders of
shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

(f) No dividends with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock issued in the
Merger shall be paid to the holder of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
until such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are surrendered or transferred,
as applicable, as provided in this  _Section_ __ _ 3.1_. Following such
surrender, subject to the effect of escheat or abandoned property (in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.1(e)_), Tax or other applicable Law, shall
be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender,
all dividends payable in respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the
date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the dividends payable with respect to such shares of Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment
date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of dividends in respect of
shares of Parent Common Stock, all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time.

 



17

    

Section 3.2 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration, any cash to be paid in lieu of any
fractional share of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.5_ (No Fractional Shares) and, if applicable, any dividends in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 3.1(f)_ (Dividends) to be paid in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate as contemplated by
this _Article III_.

 

Section 3.3 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to
deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted or withheld and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity or
Taxing Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 

Section 3.4 _Further Assurances_. After the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, as applicable, any other actions and
things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger

Section 3.5 _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrips representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in exchange for
shares of Company Common Stock, no dividends of Parent shall relate to such
fractional share interests and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent.
In lieu of such fractional share interests, Parent or the Exchange Agent shall
pay to each holder of Company Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (a) the fraction of a share (after taking into
account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder at the
Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one thousandth when expressed
in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise
be entitled to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ (Effect on Capital
Stock) by (b) the average of the volume weighted average price per share
of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Market (as reported in The Wall
Street Journal or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source
mutually selected by Parent and the Company) on each of the 20 consecutive
trading days ending with the second complete trading day prior to the Closing
Date.

The Company is qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing
as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties or assets or conduct of its business requires such
qualification or license, except where any failure to be so qualified or
licensed and in good standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of
its Constituent Documents, as amended and in effect on the date of this

Section 4.7 _SEC Reports; Company Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The Company has timely filed or furnished all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents required to be filed or furnished by it with
or to the SEC since January 1, 2017 (together with all exhibits, financial
statements and schedules thereto, all information incorporated therein by
reference and all documents filed with the SEC during such period by the
Company on a voluntary basis, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of its
filing (or furnishing) date or, if amended prior to the date of this
Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment, each Company SEC
Document complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be. As of its
filing date or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date
of the last such amendment, each Company SEC Document filed pursuant to the
Exchange Act did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Each Company SEC Document that is a
registration statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed
pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or
amendment became effective prior to the date of this Agreement, did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. None of the Company Subsidiaries are required to make
any filings with the SEC.

 

(b) The Company Financial Statements, which have been prepared, in all
material respects, from the books and records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto and have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods presented, except as otherwise noted therein. The
Company Financial Statements (including the related notes) present fairly in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and their
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended
(subject to normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments in the case of any
unaudited interim financial statements).

 



22

    

(c) As of the date hereof, there are no material outstanding or unresolved
written comments from the SEC with respect to the Company SEC Documents. As
of the date hereof, none of the Company SEC Documents are, to the knowledge of
the Company, the subject of ongoing SEC review.

 

(d) The audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company has
established "whistleblower" procedures that meet the requirements of Exchange
Act Rule 10A-3, and has delivered or made available to Parent true, complete
and correct copies of such procedures in effect as of the date of this
Agreement. Since January 1, 2017, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has received any "complaints" (within the meaning of Exchange Act
Rule 10A-3) in respect of any accounting, internal accounting controls or
auditing matters. To the knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2017, no
complaint seeking relief under Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has been
filed with the United States Secretary of Labor and no employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary has threatened to file any such complaint.

(e) To the extent required by the Exchange Act, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that
material information relating to the Company, including the Company
Subsidiaries, is made known to the Companys principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer by others within those entities, including
during the periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange
Act are being prepared. Each of the principal executive officer of the Company
and the principal financial officer of the Company (or each former principal
executive officer of the Company and each former principal financial officer
of the Company, as applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule
13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the
statements contained in such certifications are true and accurate in all
material respects as of the date on which they were made. For purposes of
this  _Section_ __ _ 4.7_, " _principal executive officer_ " and "
_principal financial officer_ " shall have the meanings given to such terms in
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Since January 1, 2017, the Company has complied in
all material respects with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(f) The Company maintains a system of "internal control over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Companys
financial reporting and the preparation of the Companys financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Companys principal
executive officer and principal financial officer have disclosed, based on
their most recent evaluation of such internal controls prior to the date of
this Agreement, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Board
of Directors of the Company "(i) all significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses" in the design or operation of internal controls which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in internal controls. The Company has made available to
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement a true and complete (in all
material respects) summary of any disclosure of the type described in the
preceding sentence made by management to the Companys auditors and audit
committee during the period beginning January 1, 2017 and ending as of the
date hereof.

 

(g) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to, or
has any commitment to become a party to, any off-balance sheet joint venture,
off-balance sheet partnership or other "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act).

Section 4.8  _Absence of_ _Undisclosed Liabilities_. The Company and the
Company Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities, obligations or commitments,
whether or not accrued, known or unknown, contingent or otherwise, that would
be required by GAAP to be reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, except for (i) liabilities, obligations
and commitments that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the

 



23

    

 aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) liabilities, obligations or
commitments disclosed and provided for in the consolidated balance sheet (or
the notes thereto) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of June 30,
2019 and (iii) liabilities, obligations or commitments incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2019
that are not material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

Section 4.9 _Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) (i) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries holds (A) all
authorizations under the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938
(the " _FDCA_ "), the Public Health Service Act (the " _PHSA_ "), and the
regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration (the " _FDA_ ")
promulgated thereunder, and (B) authorizations of any applicable Governmental
Entity that are concerned with the development, testing, packaging, labeling,
storage, import, export, marketing, sale, pricing, use, handling and control,
strength, purity, quality, safety, efficacy, reliability, distribution or
manufacturing of any of the Company Products (any such Governmental Entity, a
" _Company Regulatory Agency_ ") necessary for the lawful operation of the
businesses of the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries as currently
conducted (the " _Company Regulatory Permits_ "); (ii) all such Company
Regulatory Permits are valid and in full force and effect and will continue to
be in full force and effect immediately following the Closing; and (iii) the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material
respects with the terms of all Company Regulatory Permits. There are no
material Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
against the Company or any Company Subsidiary that could reasonably be
expected to result in, the revocation, cancellation, suspension or any other
adverse modification of any Company Regulatory Permit held by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary.

(b) _S_ _ection 4.9(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the
date hereof, licenses or other registrations, marketing authorizations or
other permits held by the Company issued by or pending with any Governmental
Entity or other Company Regulatory Agency, as applicable, in connection with
the clinical and other development, manufacture, marketing, promotion,
distribution, sale or other use of any Company Product by or on behalf of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or any other Person in any jurisdiction (the
" _Product Registrations_ "). The Company and/or any Company Subsidiary are
the sole and exclusive owners of the Product Registrations. All Company
Products sold under the Product Registrations are manufactured, promoted, and
marketed in accordance with the specifications and standards contained
in such Product Registrations.

(c) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is party to any
corporate integrity agreements, monitoring agreements, consent Orders or
similar agreements with or imposed by any Governmental Entity or Company
Regulatory Agency.

(d) All pre-clinical and clinical investigations in respect of a Company
Product conducted or sponsored by or on behalf of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries are being, and since January 1, 2017 have been,
conducted in compliance in all material respects with (i) all applicable Laws
administered or issued by any Company Regulatory Agency, including (A) FDA
standards for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring,
auditing, recording, analysis and reporting of clinical trials contained in
Title 21 parts 50, 54, 56, 312, 314 and 320 of the Code of Federal
Regulations, (B) applicable federal, state and provincial applicable Laws
restricting the collection, use and disclosure of individually identifiable
health information and Personal Information and (C) applicable Healthcare
Laws, and (ii) experimental protocols, procedures and controls pursuant to
Healthcare Laws and, where applicable, accepted professional and scientific
standards. No pre-clinical or clinical testing conducted by or on behalf of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary has been terminated or suspended due to
safety or other non-business reasons, and, to the knowledge of the Company,
there are no facts that could give rise to such a determination. No Company
Regulatory Agency, clinical investigator, institutional review board
or independent monitoring committee has provided notice that it has initiated
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened to initiate any action to
place a hold order on, or otherwise terminate, delay, suspend or modify any
such ongoing testing, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no
facts that would reasonably be expected to give rise to such a determination.

 



24

    

(e) Since January 1, 2017, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has received any written notice from the FDA or the European
Medicines Agency (the " _EMA_ ") or any foreign agency with jurisdiction over
the development, marketing, labeling, sale, use handling and control, safety,
efficacy, reliability or manufacturing of the Company Products which would
reasonably be expected to lead to the denial, limitation, revocation or
rescission of any of the Company Regulatory Permits or of any application for
marketing approval currently pending before the FDA or such other Company
Regulatory Agency.

(f) Since January 1, 2017, all reports, documents, claims, Permits and
notices required to be filed, maintained or furnished to the FDA or any other
Company Regulatory Agency by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
been so filed, maintained or furnished. All such reports, documents, claims,
Permits and notices were true and complete in all material respects on the
date filed (or were corrected in or supplemented by a subsequent filing).
Since January 1, 2017, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any officer, employee,
agent or distributor of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, has
made an untrue statement of a material fact or a fraudulent statement to the
FDA or any other Company Regulatory Agency, failed to disclose a
material fact required to be disclosed to the FDA or any other Company
Regulatory Agency, or committed an act, made a statement or failed to make a
statement, in each such case, related to the business of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries, that, at the time such disclosure was made, would
reasonably be expected to provide a basis for the FDA to invoke its policy
respecting "Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal
Gratuities" set forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September 10, 1991) or for the
FDA or any other Company Regulatory Agency to invoke any similar policy. Since
January 1, 2017, (i) neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any officer, employee, agent or
distributor of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, has been
debarred or convicted of any crime or engaged in any conduct for which
debarment is mandated by 21 U.S.C. § 335a(a) or any similar applicable Law

in other jurisdictions in which any of the Company Products are sold or
intended by the Company to be sold, and (ii) neither the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any officer,
employee, agent or distributor of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, has been excluded from participation in any federal health care
program or convicted of any crime or engaged in any conduct for which such
Person could be excluded from participating in any federal health care program
under Section 1128 of the Social Security Act of 1935 or any similar
applicable Law or program.

 

(g) As to each Company Product subject to the FDCA and the regulations of the
FDA promulgated thereunder or any similar applicable Law in any foreign
jurisdiction in which any of the Company Products are sold or intended by the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to be sold that is or has been
developed, manufactured, tested, distributed or marketed by or on behalf of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, each such Company Product is
being or has been developed, manufactured, processed, stored, distributed,
labeled, tested, sold or marketed in compliance in all material respects with
all applicable Laws, including those relating to investigational use,
marketing approval, current good manufacturing practices, packaging, labeling,
advertising, record keeping, reporting and security (and further including the
Physician Payment Sunshine Act (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7h)). Neither the Company
nor any of the Company Subsidiaries have received any written notice from any
Governmental Entity (including any Company Regulatory Agency) threatening any,
and there is no pending, Proceeding alleging any material violation
applicable to any Company Product by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries of any applicable Law, including any Healthcare Law.

 



25

corrections, market withdrawal or replacement, safety alert, warning, "dear

of limitations (including any waivers or extensions) has not yet expired.

(o) None of the Indebtedness of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
constitutes (i) "corporate acquisition indebtedness" (as defined in Section

disallowed under Section 279 of the Code or (ii) an "applicable high yield
discount obligation" under Section 163(i) of the Code.

in good repair and operating condition, and are adequate and suitable for the
purposes for which they are presently being used or held for use, and to the
knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or conditions affecting any of
the Company Improvements that, in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected
to interfere with the current use, occupancy or operation thereof. Except as
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, no portion of such Company Leased
Real Property has suffered any damage by fire or other casualty loss which
has not heretofore been completely repaired and restored to its original
condition (ordinary wear and tear excepted).

of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter
from the IRS as to its qualification and, to the knowledge of the Company, no
event has occurred that could reasonably be expected to result in
disqualification of such Company Benefit Plan.

(d) Each of the Company Benefit Plans has been operated and administered in
all material respects in accordance with its terms and all applicable Laws,

who has performed services for the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
has been improperly excluded from participation in any Company Benefit Plan.

(e) Except as would not be material, there are no pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened claims in respect of or relating to any

with respect to any Company Benefit Plan.

 

(f) Except as would not be material, neither the Company, any Company
Subsidiary, any ERISA Affiliate, any Company Benefit Plan, any trust created
thereunder, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any trustee or administrator
thereof has engaged in a transaction in connection that could reasonably be

beneficiary.

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, shareholder or
other approval of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions
would, either alone or in combination with another event, including a
termination of employment, to the extent such other event alone would not 

 



30

    

 trigger such benefit, (i) entitle any employee, director, officer or

pay or any material increase in severance pay, (ii) accelerate the time of

Software, in each of the foregoing, which are owned by the Company or a

date issued (or filed) for each of the foregoing. The Company has made
available to Parent a true and complete list, as of the date of this
Agreement, of all Patents and Trademarks, in each case, including Patents and
Trademarks that are Company Owned Intellectual Property and Patents and
Trademarks that are in licensed Intellectual Property that are material and
necessary to any Company Product (including the exercise of any Covered
Rights) (the " _Covered Product IP_ ").

 

(b) The Company has included correct and complete inventorship information for
each Patent filing in the Company Owned Intellectual Property. All documents,
recordations and certificates in connection with the registration or
application for registration of the Company Owned Intellectual Property have
been filed with the relevant patent, copyright, trademark or other authorities
in any relevant jurisdictions, as the case may be, for the purposes of
prosecuting, maintaining and perfecting such Company Owned Intellectual
Property. The Company and all Company Subsidiaries have complied with all
applicable notice and marking requirements for, and none of the labels or
other packaging or marketing materials with respect to the Company Products
contain any false, inaccurate or incorrect marking for, the Company Owned
Intellectual Property. No inequitable conduct, nor any on-sale bar or public
use or improper disclosure activity or violation, has been engaged in or
committed with respect to any Company Owned Intellectual Property or in the
prosecution of any Patent in any Company Owned Intellectual Property, and no
material information was withheld from any entity requiring disclosure of such
information during prosecution of such Patents. All filings, payments and
other actions required to be made or taken to maintain each item of

 only Intellectual Property granted, licensed or provided by the Company or a
Company Subsidiary is to contractors or vendors, in the ordinary course of
business and on a non-exclusive basis, to enable such contractors or vendors
to provide services for the Company or a Company Subsidiary (the agreements
required to be listed in _Section_ __ _ 4.18(c_ _)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, collectively, the " _Company License Agreements_ "). No
material royalties, honoraria or other fees are payable to any third parties
for the use of or right to use any Company Owned Intellectual Property except

Transactions will result in any limitation on the Companys and/or a
Company Subsidiarys right, title or interest (to the extent applicable) in
any Company Owned Intellectual Property, Covered Product IP or Company License
Agreements.

 

(d) The Company or a Company Subsidiary is the sole and exclusive owner of,
free and clear of all Liens (except Permitted Liens) and further subject to

has not been cancelled, expired or abandoned. The Company or a Company
Subsidiary has a valid right and enforceable right to use the Covered Product
IP that is not Company Owned Intellectual Property, and, to the knowledge of
the Company, the Covered Product IP is valid and enforceable. The Covered
Product IP together with any other Intellectual Property that the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is otherwise permitted to use (including by way of
release, covenant not to sue or immunity from suit) constitutes all of the
Intellectual Property necessary to, or used or held for use in the conduct of
the respective businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as
currently conducted and as currently planned to be conducted prior to the
Closing (including as may be necessary to exercise the Covered Rights with
respect to any Company Product).

(e) Within the past six years, there have been no asserted, pending, or to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened (including in the form of offers or
invitations to obtain a license) Proceedings alleging that the activities or
conduct of the business of the Company or a Company Subsidiary infringe upon,
misappropriate, or otherwise violate or constitute the unauthorized use of the
Intellectual Property of any third party or challenging the Companys or a
Company Subsidiarys ownership, use, validity, enforceability
or registrability of any Company Owned Intellectual Property (but excluding
routine prosecution Proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark
Office or equivalent foreign Governmental Entities).

 

(f) The conduct of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries by
the Company as conducted in the past six years and as currently conducted
does not infringe upon (either directly or indirectly, such as through
contributory infringement or inducement to infringe), misappropriate or
otherwise violate, and has not infringed upon (directly or indirectly),
misappropriated or otherwise violated, any Intellectual Property of any other
Person (or will, to the knowledge of the Company, infringe, misappropriate or
otherwise violate the Intellectual Property rights of any other Person through
the exercise prior to or after the Closing of any Covered Rights with respect
to any Company Product).

(g) To the knowledge of the Company, no third party is misappropriating,
infringing, diluting or violating any Company Owned Intellectual Property and
no claims, suits, arbitrations or other adversarial Proceedings have been
brought or threatened against any third party with respect thereto by
the Company or a Company Subsidiary.

access thereto to execute valid, written nondisclosure agreements requiring
such individuals to hold all such Trade Secrets and other confidential
information in confidence both during and after their employment and/or
engagement. To the knowledge of the Company, no such material Trade Secrets or
confidential information have been disclosed or authorized to be disclosed to
any third party other than pursuant to a nondisclosure agreement. To the
knowledge of the Company, no third party to any nondisclosure agreement with
the Company or a Company Subsidiary is in breach, violation or default
thereof.

 

(i) Each current and former employee, consultant, contractor and/or individual
that has delivered, developed, contributed to, modified or improved material
Intellectual Property owned or purported to be owned by the Company or a
Company Subsidiary has executed an agreement assigning to the Company or such
Company Subsidiary all of such employees, consultants, contractors and/or
individuals rights in such development, contribution, modification or
improvement. To the knowledge of the Company, it will not be necessary to use
any inventions owned by any of its employees, contractors or consultants (or
Persons it currently intends to hire) made prior to their employment and/or
engagement by the Company.

(j) With respect to any material Software that is owned by the Company or a
Company Subsidiary, such Software was either developed (i) by employees of the
Company or such Company Subsidiary within the scope of their employment or
(ii) by independent contractors who have assigned their rights in such
Software to the Company or such Company Subsidiary pursuant to written
agreements.

(k) No Open Source Software (i) has been modified by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, (ii) has been embedded in or otherwise combined by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary with any other Software or (iii) has been
distributed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any third party
either independently or as part of a Company Product, in each case, in a
manner that would condition the license governing such Open Source Software on
the Companys or a Company Subsidiarys (A) disclosing or distributing any
Software owned by the Company or a Company Subsidiary in source code form, (B)
licensing any Software owned by the Company or a Company Subsidiary for the
purpose of making derivative works or (C) redistributing any Software owned
by the Company or a Company Subsidiary at no or minimal charge. No current or
former director, officer or employee of the Company (or any of its
predecessors in interest) will, after giving effect to the Transactions, own
or retain any rights to use any of the Company Owned Intellectual Property.

(l) All Software, Technology, systems, servers, computers, hardware,
firmware, middleware, networks, data communications lines, routers, hubs,
switches and other information technology equipment owned by the Company or
used in the operation of the business of the Company and Company Subsidiaries
as currently conducted (collectively, the " _Company IT Assets_ ") are
reasonably adequate for, and operate and perform in accordance with their
documentation and functional specifications and otherwise as required in
connection with, the operation of such business. The Company and Company
Subsidiaries have implemented commercially reasonable backup, security and
disaster recovery procedures and, to the knowledge of the Company, during the
three years prior to the date of this Agreement, no Person has gained
unauthorized access to any Company IT Assets and there has been no material
failure of any Company IT Asset.

 

(m) The Company and each Company Subsidiary have established and maintained
commercially reasonable privacy policies and have been in compliance with (i)
such policies and (ii) all (A) Contracts and (B) applicable federal, state,
local and foreign Laws relating to privacy, data protection, data security,
export, and the collection, use, disclosure, retention, security and
processing of Personal Information gathered, used, processed, held for use or
accessed in the course of the operations of its business. No claims or
investigations have been asserted or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened 

 



34

    

 against the Company or any Company Subsidiary alleging a violation of any
Law or Contract relating to a Persons privacy, Personal Information or data
rights. The consummation of the Transactions will not breach or otherwise
cause any violation of any Contract or policy of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary related to the privacy or data security of the Personal Information
gathered, used, held for use or accessed on, or on behalf of, the Company or
any Company Subsidiary in the conduct of their respective businesses. The
Company and each Company Subsidiary have not notified in writing, or been
required by applicable Law or Contract to notify in writing, any Person
of any privacy or technology security incidents.

(n) The Company and each Company Subsidiary have implemented commercially
reasonable security regarding (i) the collection, use, disclosure, retention,

Intellectual Property in the possession, custody or control of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, and there has been no security incident that has
compromised the integrity or availability of the information technology

collectively referred to herein as the " _Company Contracts_ ". Subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium
and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights and to general equity principles, each Company Contract is a valid and
binding agreement of the Company or a Company Subsidiary, as the case may be,

Contract. True, correct and complete copies of each such Company Contract
(including all modifications and amendments thereto and waivers thereunder)
have been made available to Parent.

(c) The replacement or removal of one or more members of the Board of
Directors of the Company will not result, after the giving of notice, with

the Company or any Company Subsidiary under, or permit the acceleration or
termination of any obligation under or require any consent or notice under,
any Company Contract.

(measured by gross expenditures by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on
a consolidated basis) suppliers (each, a " _Material Supplier_ ") to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the period from January 1, 2019 to
the date hereof. No Material Supplier has terminated or cancelled, or
delivered written notification to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries that it intends to terminate or cancel, or decreased materially
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened to decrease or limit
materially, its relationship with the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2017, (a) neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has been engaged adversely in a Proceeding with any
Material Supplier and (b) there has been no change in the pricing or other
terms under any Contract with any Material Supplier that is material and
adverse to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

Section 4.21 _Environmental Laws and Regulations_. The Company and each
Company Subsidiary is in compliance, and since January 1, 2017 has complied,

individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (a) no notice of
violation, notification of liability, demand, request for information,
citation, summons or Order relating to or arising out of any Environmental

knowledge of the Company, is threatened and no Proceeding is pending or,
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by any Person involving the

Environmental Law. No Release or threatened Release of Hazardous Substances
has occurred at, on, above, under or from any properties currently or, to the
knowledge of the Company, formerly owned, leased, operated or used by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary that, in each case, has resulted in or would
reasonably be expected to result in any material cost, liability or
obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under any Environmental
Law. The Company has made available to Parent all material environmental site
assessments, audits, reports, investigations and studies in the
possession, custody or control of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
relating to properties or assets currently or formerly owned, leased, operated
or used by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or otherwise relating to the
Companys or any Company Subsidiarys compliance with Environmental Laws.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is required by applicable Law
or any Governmental Entity to provide financial assurance for the
decommissioning of any manufacturing facility.

 

Section 4.22 _Insurance Coverage_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries
maintain insurance coverage with reputable insurers in such amounts and
covering such risks as the Company reasonably believes, based on past
experience, is adequate for the businesses and operations of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries (taking into account the cost and availability of
such insurance). Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiaries has received
any written notice of any pending or threatened cancellation (other than in
connection with ordinary renewals) or material premium increase (other
than premium increases in the ordinary course) with respect to any such
material insurance policy, and each Company Subsidiary is in compliance in all
material respects with all conditions contained therein. Except as has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (a) all such insurance policies are in
full force and effect and (b) will not be affected by, or terminated or lapse
by reason of, this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger. There is no
material claim pending under any of the Companys insurance policies as to
which coverage has been denied by the underwriters of such policies.

Sanctions_. Neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor any of their
respective directors or officers, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any of
their respective agents, employees or any other Persons acting on their behalf
has, in connection with the operation of their respective businesses, (a)
made, promised, offered or authorized

 



38

    

 any direct or indirect unlawful contributions, payments, gifts,
entertainment or any unlawful expenditures relating to political activity to
government officials, candidates or members of political parties or

government from time to time, including the U.S. Treasury Departments Office
of Foreign Assets Control (" _OFAC_ "), which prohibit transactions involving
parties located in countries, regions or territories that are, or whose
governments are, the subject or target of comprehensive economic sanctions
maintained by OFAC (as of the date of this Agreement, Crimea, Cuba, Iran,
North Korea and Syria) and any similar Laws of those jurisdictions in which
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries do business, or parties identified on
OFACs Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (collectively,

their respective directors, officers, agents, employees or any other Persons

Company Subsidiary has conducted their businesses in compliance in all

to the Company, and may continue to make available, estimates, projections and

projections, forecasts, plans and budgets and the assumptions on which they
are based were prepared for specific purposes and may vary significantly from
each other. Further, the Company acknowledges that there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans

ARTICLE V

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 

Except as (i) set forth in the corresponding Sections or Subsections of a
disclosure letter delivered to the Company by Parent prior to, or
concurrently with, the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure
Letter_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any Section or
Subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed a disclosure
with respect to any other Section or Subsection to which the relevance of
such item is reasonably apparent on its face) or (ii) other than with respect
to the Parent Identified Representations, disclosed in the Parent SEC
Documents filed with, or furnished to, the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act
since January 1, 2017 and at least two Business Days prior to the date of this
Agreement, excluding any disclosures set forth in any Section entitled "Risk
Factors" or "Forward-Looking Statements" or in any other Section to the
extent they are forward-looking statements or cautionary, nonspecific,
predictive or forward-looking in nature (it being agreed that any matter
disclosed in any such Parent SEC Document shall be deemed to be disclosed in
a Section or Subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter only to the extent
that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure in such Parent
SEC Document that such disclosure is applicable to such Section or Subsection
of the Parent Disclosure Letter), Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally
represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

 

Section 5.1 _Organization_. Parent is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware, Merger
Sub is a corporation duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the State of Delaware, and each of Parent and Merger Sub has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted,
except where any failure to be in good standing has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Parent has made available to the Company true,
correct and complete copies of its and Merger Subs Constituent Documents, as
amended and in effect on the date of this Agreement, and neither Parent nor
Merger Sub is in violation in any material respect of their respective
Constituent Documents.

Section 5.2  _Subsidiaries_.

(a) Each Subsidiary of Parent (individually, a " _Parent Subsidiary_ " and,
collectively, the " _Parent Subsidiaries_ ") is a corporation duly
incorporated or a limited liability company, company limited by shares,
partnership or other entity duly organized and is validly existing and, to the
extent such concept or a similar concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction,
in good standing under the Laws of the

 



40

    

 jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as the case may be, and
has all requisite corporate or other power and authority, as the case may be,
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as currently conducted, except where any failure to be in good
standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each
Parent Subsidiary is qualified or licensed to do business in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or
assets or conduct of its business requires such qualification or license,
except where any failures to be so qualified or licensed have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. No Parent Subsidiary is in violation in any
material respect of its Constituent Documents.

 

(b) Parent is, directly or indirectly, the record holder and Beneficial Owner
of all of the outstanding Securities of each Parent Subsidiary, free and
clear of any Liens and free of any other limitation or restriction (including
any limitation or restriction on the right to vote, sell, transfer or
otherwise dispose of the Securities), except for such restrictions imposed by
applicable Law. All of such Securities have been duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and, where applicable, are nonassessable (and no such
shares have been issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights).

 

(c) The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are validly issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is,
and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent. Merger Sub has not
conducted any business prior to the date of this Agreement and has no, and
prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations
of any nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this
Agreement and the Merger and the other Transactions.

 

Section 5.3 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized Securities of Parent

"). At the Reference Time: (i) 39,229,308 shares of Parent Common Stock were
issued and outstanding, (ii) no shares of Parent Preferred Stock were issued
and outstanding, (iii) no shares of Parent Common Stock were held by Parent in
its treasury, (iv) 272,224 shares of Parent Common Stock were issuable upon

vesting restricted stock awards, 227,503 shares of Parent Common Stock
covered by performance-vesting restricted stock awards (payable at the target

pursuant to the Parent Stock Plans. All shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in connection with the Merger will be, when issued in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and are subject to no preemptive or similar rights. Parent has
sufficient authorized, but unissued, shares of Parent Common Stock required
to be issued in connection with the Merger. From the Reference Time through
the date hereof, there have been no issuances by Parent of Securities, other
than the issuance of Parent Common Stock upon the exercise of the Equity
Rights of Parent outstanding at the Reference Time and in accordance with
their terms in effect at such time.

 



41

    

(b) There are no preemptive or similar rights on the part of any holder of any
class of Securities of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. Neither Parent nor
any Parent Subsidiary has any outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or which are
convertible into or exercisable for Securities having the right to vote) with
the holders of any class of Securities of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary on
any matter submitted to such holders of Securities. Other than as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_, there are no other outstanding Equity Rights with
respect to Securities of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. There are no
outstanding contractual obligations of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Securities of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary. There are no proxies, voting trusts or other agreements or

Section 5.4 _A_ _uthorization; Board Approval; Voting Requirements_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and, subject to the Parent Stockholder Approval and the adoption of
this Agreement by Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which will be
effected by Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution
of this Agreement by the Parties), to consummate the Transactions. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of either
Parent or Merger Sub are necessary for it to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the Transactions, except for, in any such case, the adoption of
this Agreement by the Parent Stockholder Approval and the adoption of this
Agreement by Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which will be
effected by Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution
of this Agreement by the Parties). This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by the other Parties, is a legal,
valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable
against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject
to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights and to general equity principles.

(i) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions (including the Parent
Share Issuance) are fair to and in the best interests of Parent and its
stockholders, (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable this Agreement and
the Transactions (including the Parent Share Issuance), (iii) directed that
the Parent Share Issuance be submitted to a vote at a meeting of Parents

Parent Capital Stock necessary in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions.

 

Section 5.5 _Takeover Statute; Ownership of Company Common Stock_.

 

(a) Assuming the representations and warranties in _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ are
true and correct, no state "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or similar anti-takeover statute is applicable to the
Transactions.

(b) None of Parent or Merger Sub is, or at any time since January 1, 2017 has
been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203 of
the DGCL. Neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries has taken,
or authorized or permitted any of its Representatives to take, any action
that would cause Parent or any of its "affiliates" or "associates" (each as
defined in Section 203 of Delaware Law) thereof to be deemed an "interested
stockholder" as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL

 



42

    

 or otherwise render Section 251 of the DGCL inapplicable to the Merger.
Neither Parent nor any of Parents Affiliates directly or indirectly owns, and
at all times since January 1, 2017, neither Parent nor any of Parents
Affiliates has owned, whether Beneficially Owned or otherwise, any Securities
of the Company, Equity Rights of the Company or any Contracts convertible into
or exercisable or exchangeable for Securities of the Company (through
derivative securities or otherwise).

Section 5.6 _No Violations; Consents and Approvals_.

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger
Sub does not and the consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the
Transactions will not: (i) assuming the receipt of the Parent Stockholder
Approval, conflict with any provisions of the Constituent Documents of Parent
or Merger Sub; (ii) violate any Law or rules of any Self-Regulatory
Organization (assuming the receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval and
compliance with the matters set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)_ (Consents and
Approvals)); (iii) result, after the giving of notice, with lapse of time or
otherwise, in any violation, default or loss of a benefit under, or permit the

notice under, any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party; (iv)
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any properties or assets
of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary; or (v) cause the suspension or revocation

, _(iv)_ and _(v)_ , as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) No clearance, consent, approval, Order, license or authorization of, or
declaration, registration or filing with, or notice to, or Permit issued by
any Governmental Entity or Self-Regulatory Organization is required to be made
or obtained by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the execution or

listing of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as Merger
Consideration; and (vi) any such other clearance, consent, approval, Order,
license, authorization, declaration, registration, filing, notice or Permit,
the failure of which to make or obtain would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.7 _SEC Reports_ _; Parent Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Parent has timely filed or furnished all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents required to be filed or furnished by it with
or to the SEC since January 1, 2017 (together with all exhibits, financial
statements and schedules thereto, all information incorporated therein by
reference and all documents filed with the SEC during such period by Parent on
a voluntary basis, the " _Parent SEC Documents_ "). As of its filing (or
furnishing) date or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the
date of the last such amendment, each Parent SEC Document complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and
the Securities Act, as the case may be. As of its filing date or, if amended
prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such
amendment, each Parent SEC Document filed pursuant to the Exchange Act did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in

 



43

    

 order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. Each Parent SEC Document that is a
registration statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed
pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or
amendment became effective prior to the date of this Agreement, did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

 

(b) The Parent Financial Statements, which have been prepared, in all material
respects, from the books and records of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries,
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods presented, except as otherwise noted therein.
The Parent Financial Statements (including the related notes) present fairly
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and their consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject to
normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments in the case of any
unaudited interim financial statements.

(c) As of the date hereof, there are no material outstanding or unresolved
written comments from the SEC with respect to the Parent SEC Documents. As of
the date hereof, none of the Parent SEC Documents are, to the knowledge of
Parent, the subject of ongoing SEC review.

 

(d) The audit committee of the Board of Directors of Parent has established
"whistleblower" procedures that meet the requirements of Exchange Act Rule
10A-3, and has delivered or made available to the Company true, complete and
correct copies of such procedures in effect as of the date of this Agreement.
Since January 1, 2017, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has received
any "complaints" (within the meaning of Exchange Act Rule 10A-3) in respect of
any accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters. To Parents
knowledge, since January 1, 2017, no complaint seeking relief under Section
806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has been filed with the United States Secretary
of Labor and no employee of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has threatened to
file any such complaint.

(e) To the extent required by the Exchange Act, Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that
material information relating to Parent, including the Parent Subsidiaries,
is made known to Parents principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those entities, including during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared. Each of the principal executive officer of Parent and the
principal financial officer of Parent (or each former principal executive
officer of Parent and each former principal financial officer of Parent, as
applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14
under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with
respect to the Parent SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications are true and accurate in all material respects as of the date
on which they were made. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_, "
_principal executive officer_ " and " _principal financial officer_ " shall
have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Since January
1, 2017, Parent has complied in all material respects with the provisions of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 

(f) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, Parent
maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting" (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of Parents financial reporting and the preparation
of Parents financing statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP. Parents principal executive officer and principal financial officer
have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation of such internal
controls prior to the date of this Agreement, to Parents auditors and the
audit committee of the Board of Directors of Parent "(i) all

 



44

    

 significant deficiencies and material weaknesses" in the design or operation
of internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in internal controls. Parent has made
available to the Company prior to the date of this Agreement a true and
complete (in all material respects) summary of any disclosure of the type
described in the preceding sentence made by management to Parents auditors
and audit committee during the period beginning January 1, 2017 and ending as
of the date hereof.

(g) Neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries is a party to, or has
any commitment to become a party to, any off-balance sheet joint venture,
off-balance sheet partnership or other "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act).

 

Section 5.8 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. Parent and the Parent

(a) (i) Each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries holds (A) all
authorizations under the FDCA, PHSA, and the regulations of the
FDA promulgated thereunder, and (B) authorizations of any applicable
Governmental Entity that are concerned with the development, testing,
packaging, labeling, storage, import, export, marketing, sale, pricing, use,
handling and control, strength, purity, quality, safety, efficacy,
reliability, distribution or manufacturing of any of the Parent Products (any
such Governmental Entity, a " _Parent Regulatory Agency_ ") necessary for the
lawful operation of the businesses of Parent and each of the Parent
Subsidiaries as currently conducted (the " _Parent Regulatory Permits_ ");
(ii) all such Parent Regulatory Permits are valid and in full force and effect
and will continue to be in full force and effect immediately following the

Agency, failed to disclose a material fact required to be disclosed to the FDA
or any other Parent Regulatory Agency, or committed an act, made a statement,
or failed to make a statement, in each such case, related to the business of
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, that, at the time such disclosure
was made, would reasonably be expected to provide a basis for the FDA to
invoke its policy respecting "Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts,
Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities" set forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September
10, 1991) or for the FDA or any other Parent Regulatory Agency to invoke any

(f) As to each Parent Product subject to the FDCA and the regulations of the

developed, manufactured, tested, distributed or marketed by or on behalf of
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, each such Parent Product is being or

the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger shall be the
only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required
by applicable Law to be voted on by Parents stockholders in connection with
this Agreement and the Transactions, including any adjournment proposal) that
Parent shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of Parent at the
Parent Stockholders Meeting. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.19(d)_, neither the

information, or (ii) would contravene any applicable Law or Contract to which
the applicable party is a subject or bound; _provided_ that the Company and
Parent shall, and each shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best

or any inquiry, offer or proposal in connection therewith and shall enforce,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any
such agreement (other than any standstill provision therein). Without
limiting the foregoing, any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.5_ by any Representative of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section_ __ _
7.5_ by the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may, in response to a bona fide
written Takeover Proposal that was first received after the date hereof, was
unsolicited and did not result from a breach of _Section_ __ _ 7.5(a)_:

 

(i) furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives pursuant to and in accordance with a confidentiality agreement
containing provisions no less restrictive in any substantive respect than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that
such confidentiality agreement need not contain a standstill provision;
_provided_ , _further_ , that all such information provided to such Person has
previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or
substantially concurrently with (and in any event on the same calendar day
as) the time it is provided to such Person; and

 



68

    

(ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person or
its Representatives regarding such Takeover Proposal;

_provided_ , in each case, that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation), that (i) after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation (it being understood that the Company
Financial Advisor is a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation),
such Takeover Proposal is, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Superior Proposal and (ii) after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
the failure to furnish such information or participate in such discussions or
negotiations with respect to such Takeover Proposal would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the receipt, directly or
indirectly, by the Company of any Takeover Proposal or any proposal, offer or
inquiry with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Takeover Proposal, and in any case within 24 hours after the receipt thereof,
the Company shall provide oral and written notice to Parent of (i)
such Takeover Proposal, proposal, offer or inquiry, (ii) the identity of the
Person making any such Takeover Proposal, proposal, offer or inquiry and (iii)
the economic and other material terms and conditions of any such Takeover
Proposal, proposal, offer or inquiry (including an unredacted copy of all
written materials provided by such Person to the Company in connection with
such Takeover Proposal, proposal, offer or inquiry and any amendments or
modifications thereto). The Company shall promptly (and in any event within
24 hours) keep Parent reasonably informed of any material developments with
respect to any such Takeover Proposal, proposal, offer or inquiry (including
any material changes thereto and copies of any additional written materials
received by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives from the Person that submitted such Takeover Proposal or such
proposal, offer or inquiry or such Persons Representatives).

 

(d) Except as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ _(d)_ , neither the Board
of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall, directly or
indirectly, effect a Change in Recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of the Company may, in response to a Superior Proposal (that has
not been withdrawn) or an Intervening Event, effect a Change in
Recommendation; _provided_ that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure
to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company may not
effect such a Change in Recommendation unless:

(i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have first provided four
Business Days prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to effect a
Change in Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening
Event (it being understood that delivery of such notice shall not in and of
itself constitute a Change in Recommendation), which notice shall (A) in the
case of a Superior Proposal, include the material terms and conditions of the
Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action of the Board of
Directors of the Company (including the identity of the Person making such
Superior Proposal and a written summary of any material terms and conditions
communicated orally), and shall attach the most current unredacted version of
the relevant Alternative Acquisition Agreement (if any) with the Person
making such Superior Proposal and unredacted copies of any other documents
evidencing or specifying any other terms and conditions of such Takeover
Proposal received from, or provided by, the Person making such Superior
Proposal and (B) in the case of an Intervening Event, state in reasonable
detail the material facts underlying, and the rationale and basis for, the
determination that an Intervening Event has occurred (it being understood and
agreed that 

 



69

    

 an amendment to the material terms of such Superior Proposal or a material
change to the facts and circumstances that are the basis for such Intervening
Event shall require an updated notice and a new three Business Day period
pursuant to this _clause_ __ _ (i)_ during which period the Company shall be
required to comply with this _Section_ __ _ 7.5(d)_ anew with respect to such
additional notice);

 

(ii) during such four Business Day period, the Company and its
Representatives, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, engaged in
good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner
(A) in the case of a Superior Proposal, that the Takeover Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal or (B) in the case of an Intervening Event, to
obviate the need to effect a Change in Recommendation; and

(iii) after taking into account any revised terms offered in writing by
Parent, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (A) in
the case of a Superior Proposal, after consultation with its legal counsel and
financial advisor, that such Takeover Proposal continues to constitute
a Superior Proposal and (B) in the case of a Superior Proposal or Intervening
Event, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
make a Change in Recommendation would continue to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ shall prohibit the Company
from complying with Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act in respect of any Takeover Proposal or
making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such action taken or
statement made that relates to a Takeover Proposal shall not be deemed to be a
Change in Recommendation if the Board of Directors of the Company reaffirms
the Company Recommendation in such statement or in connection with such
action; _provided_ , _further_ , that neither the Board of Directors of the
Company nor any committee thereof shall, except as expressly permitted by
_Section_ __ _ 7.5(d)_ (Change in Recommendation), effect a Change in
Recommendation.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Intervening Event_ " means a Change that is material to the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which was not known by, or if
known, the effect of which was not reasonably foreseeable by, the Board of
Directors of the Company as of or prior to the date hereof (which Change does
not relate to a Takeover Proposal), and which becomes known to the Board of
Directors of the Company prior to the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_
, _however_ that none of the following shall constitute, be deemed to
contribute to or otherwise be taken into account in determining whether there
has been a Intervening Event: (A) any changes in the market price or trading
volume of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, in and of itself; (B)
the fact that, in and of itself, the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts,
estimates or predictions in respect of revenues, earnings or other financial
or operating metrics for any period ending after the date of this Agreement
(it being understood that the underlying facts giving rise or contributing to
events described in _clauses_ __ _ (A)_ and _(B)_ may be taken into account
in determining whether there has been an Intervening Event if such facts are
not otherwise excluded under this definition); (C) any regulatory or clinical
Changes relating to any Company Product (including (1) any regulatory actions,
requests, recommendations or decisions of any 

 



70

    

 Governmental Entity relating to any Company Product or any other regulatory
or clinical development relating to any Company Product, and (2) any clinical
trials, studies, tests or results or announcements thereof with respect to
any Company Product); and (D) the research, development, testing,
distribution, sale, supply, license, marketing, promotion, manufacturing or
commercialization of any Company Product.

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited bona fide written Takeover
Proposal that was first received after the date hereof that (x) did not
result from a breach of _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ and (y) the Board of Directors of
the Company determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and its financial advisor, (A) is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms (if accepted), taking into account
all legal, regulatory and financing aspects (including certainty of closing
and, to the extent third party financing is required, that such financing is
then fully committed on customary terms and conditions) of such Takeover
Proposal and the Person making the proposal and other aspects of the Takeover
Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company deems relevant, and (B)
if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable from a financial
point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock (solely in their capacity
as such) than the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for the
purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," the term "Takeover
Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term herein, except that
references to "15%" in such definition shall be deemed to be references to
"50%".

(iii) " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any Person, other than Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, relating to any
(A) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a
series of related transactions) of assets of the Company or any of the Company

or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and the Company

Company Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis are attributable for the most
recent fiscal year in which audited financial statements are then available,

similar transaction or series of related transactions involving the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries, under which (1) such Person would,
directly or indirectly, acquire assets equal to 15% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, or to which
15% or more of the revenues of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis are attributable for the most recent fiscal year in which
audited financial statements are then available, or (2) the stockholders or
equityholders of such Person immediately after giving effect to such
transaction(s) would Beneficially Own 15% or more of any class of equity or

(b) Except to the extent necessary to avoid the duplication of benefits, the
Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize
the service of each Continuing Employee with the Company or its Affiliates
before the Effective Time as if such service had been performed with Parent or
its Affiliates (i) for purposes of eligibility and vesting under any employee
benefit plans (including Parents 401(k) plan) and programs of the Parent, of
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates (the "
_Surviving Corporation Plans_ ") in which the Continuing Employee
participates after the Effective Time, and (ii) for benefit accrual purposes

Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the
extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such
employees under the welfare plans maintained by the Company or its Affiliates

Person is or was a director (including in a capacity as a member of any board
committee), officer, employee or agent of the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors prior to the Effective
Time (including with respect to any acts, facts, events or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement or any of the

on or after the Effective Time against any expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such
threatened or actual Claim. The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall

_Section_ __ _ 7.8_.

 

(b) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Claim for

and each of its Subsidiaries (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) regarding
elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors,

less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding
provisions in the Constituent Documents of the Company in existence on the
date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
individuals. From and after the Effective Time, any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries regarding
elimination of liability, indemnification or advancement of expenses shall be
assumed by the Surviving Corporation, shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions) (" _D_ __ _ and O
Insurance_"); _provided_ that the Company shall not pay, and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay, for such "tail" policy more than
300% of the current annual premium paid by the Company for such D and O
Insurance. If the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall for any reason
fail to obtain such "tail" policy, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall
maintain for a period of six years after the Effective Time such D and O
Insurance ( _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation or Parent (or any
successor) may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less
advantageous to the insured); _provided_ that in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation or Parent be required to pay in any one year more than 300% of the
current annual premium paid by the Company for such D and O Insurance;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such D and O Insurance
exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such

(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the

assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the applicable successor, assign or transferee shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ (including this  _Section_
__ _ 7.8(_ _e_ _)_ ).

(f) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.8_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as
to adversely affect any Indemnified Person to whom this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_
applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Person (it being

7.8_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_).

affect the remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice;

comply with this _Section_ __ _ 7.10_ _(a)_ shall not constitute the failure
of any condition set forth in _Article VIII_ to be satisfied unless the

condition set forth in _Article_ __ _ VIII_ to be satisfied.

 

(b) The Company shall (i) promptly notify Parent of receipt by the Company of

to enforce or assign any provisions of, any confidentiality agreement (other
than any standstill provision therein) to which it is a party relating to any
Parent Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, offer or proposal in connection
therewith and shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, the provisions of any such agreement (other than any standstill provision

set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.19_ by any Representative of Parent or

Proposal that was first received after the date hereof, was unsolicited and
did not result from a breach of _Section_ __ _ 7.19_ _(a)_ :

 

(i) furnish information with respect to Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries to
the Person making such Parent Takeover Proposal and its Representatives
pursuant to and in accordance with a confidentiality agreement containing
provisions no less restrictive in any substantive respect than those contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that such confidentiality
agreement need not contain a standstill provision; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that all such information provided to such Person has previously been provided
to the Company or is provided to the Company prior to or
substantially concurrently with (and in any event on the same calendar day
as) the time it is provided to such Person; and

(ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person or its
Representatives regarding such Parent Takeover Proposal;

_provided_ , in each case, that the Board of Directors of Parent determines
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation), that (i) after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation (it being understood that the Parent
Financial Advisor is a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation),
such Parent Takeover Proposal is, or would reasonably be expected to lead to,
a Parent Superior Proposal and (ii) after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, the failure to furnish such information or participate in such
discussions or negotiations with respect to such Parent Takeover Proposal
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

 



77

    

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the receipt, directly or
indirectly, by Parent of any Parent Takeover Proposal or any proposal, offer
or inquiry with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Parent Takeover Proposal, and in any case within 24 hours after the
receipt thereof, Parent shall provide oral and written notice to the Company
of (i) such Parent Takeover Proposal, proposal, offer or inquiry, (ii) the
identity of the Person making any such Parent Takeover Proposal, proposal,
offer or inquiry and (iii) the economic and other material terms and
conditions of any such Parent Takeover Proposal, proposal, offer or inquiry
(including an unredacted copy of all written materials provided by such Person
to Parent in connection with such Parent Takeover Proposal, proposal, offer
or inquiry and any amendments or modifications thereto). Parent shall promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours) keep the Company reasonably informed of any
material developments with respect to any such Parent Takeover Proposal,
proposal, offer or inquiry (including any material changes thereto and copies
of any additional written materials received by Parent, the Parent
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives from the Person that
submitted such Parent Takeover Proposal or such proposal, offer or inquiry or
such Persons Representatives).

(d) Except as provided in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.19(d)_, neither the Board
of Directors of Parent nor any committee thereof shall, directly or
indirectly, effect a Parent Change in Recommendation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval,
the Board of Directors of Parent may, in response to a Parent Superior
Proposal (that has not been withdrawn) or a Parent Intervening Event, effect a
Parent Change in Recommendation; _provided_ that the Board of Directors of
Parent determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Board of Directors of
Parent may not effect such a Parent Change in Recommendation unless:

 

(i) the Board of Directors of Parent shall have first provided four Business
Days prior written notice to the Company that it is prepared to effect a
Parent Change in Recommendation in response to a Parent Superior Proposal or a
Parent Intervening Event (it being understood that the delivery of such notice
shall not in and of itself constitute a Parent Change in Recommendation),
which notice shall (A) in the case of a Parent Superior Proposal, include the
material terms and conditions of the Parent Superior Proposal that is the
basis of the proposed action of the Board of Directors of Parent
(including the identity of the Person making such Parent Superior Proposal
and a written summary of any material terms and conditions communicated
orally), and shall attach the most current unredacted version of the relevant
Parent Alternative Acquisition Agreement (if any) with the Person making such
Parent Superior Proposal and unredacted copies of any other documents
evidencing or specifying any other terms and conditions of such Parent
Takeover Proposal received from, or provided by, the Person making such
Parent Superior Proposal and (B) in the case of a Parent Intervening Event,
state in reasonable detail the material facts underlying, and the rationale
and basis for, the determination that a Parent Intervening Event has
occurred (it being understood and agreed that an amendment to the material
terms of such Parent Superior Proposal or a material change to the facts and
circumstances that are the basis for such Parent Intervening Event shall
require an updated notice and a new three Business Day period pursuant to
this _clause_ __ _ (i)_ during which period Parent shall be required to
comply with this _Section_ __ _ 7.19_ _(d)_ anew with respect to such
additional notice);

 

(ii) during such four Business Day period, Parent and its Representatives, to
the extent reasonably requested by the Company, engaged in good faith
negotiations with the Company to amend this Agreement in such a manner (A) in
the case of a Parent Superior Proposal, that the Parent Takeover Proposal
ceases to constitute a Parent Superior Proposal or (B) in the case of a
Parent Intervening Event, to obviate the need to effect a Parent Change in
Recommendation; and

 



78

    

(iii) after taking into account any revised terms offered in writing by
the Company, the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith (A) in
the case of a Parent Superior Proposal, after consultation with its legal
counsel and financial advisor, that such Parent Takeover Proposal continues to
constitute a Parent Superior Proposal and (B) in the case of a Parent
Superior Proposal or a Parent Intervening Event, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Parent Change in
Recommendation would continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.19_ shall prohibit Parent
from complying with Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act in respect of any Parent Takeover Proposal
or making any disclosure to the stockholders of Parent if the Board of
Directors of Parent determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such action taken or
statement made that relates to a Parent Takeover Proposal shall not be
deemed to be a Parent Change in Recommendation if the Board of Directors of
Parent reaffirms the Parent Recommendation in such statement or in connection
with such action; _provided_ , _further_ , that neither the Board of Directors
of Parent nor any committee thereof shall, except as expressly permitted by
_Section_ __ _ 7.19_ _(d)_ (Parent No Solicitation), effect a Parent Change
in Recommendation.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Parent Intervening Event_ " means a Change that is material to Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which was not known by, or if
known, the effect of which was not reasonably foreseeable by, the Board of
Directors of Parent as of or prior to the date hereof (which Change does not
relate to a Parent Takeover Proposal), and which becomes known to the Board
of Directors of Parent prior to the Parent Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ that none of the following shall constitute, be deemed to contribute
to or otherwise be taken into account in determining whether there has been a
Parent Intervening Event: (A) any changes in the market price or trading
volume of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, in and of itself; (B)
the fact that, in and of itself, Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries
exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or
predictions in respect of revenues, earnings or other financial or operating
metrics for any period ending after the date of this Agreement (it being
understood that the underlying facts giving rise or contributing to events
described in _clauses_ __ _ (A)_ and _(B)_ may be taken into account in
determining whether there has been a Parent Intervening Event if such facts
are not otherwise excluded under this definition); (C) any regulatory or
clinical Changes relating to any Parent Product (including (1) any regulatory
actions, requests, recommendations or decisions of any Governmental Entity
relating to any Parent Product or any other regulatory or clinical
development relating to any Parent Product, and (2) any clinical trials,
studies, tests or results or announcements thereof with respect to any Parent
Product); and (D) the research, development, testing, distribution, sale,
supply, license, marketing, promotion, manufacturing or commercialization of
any Parent Product.

outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, (A) is reasonably likely to
be consummated in accordance with its terms (if accepted), taking into account
all legal, regulatory and financing aspects (including certainty of closing
and, to the extent third party financing is required, that such financing is
then fully committed on customary terms and conditions) of such Parent
Takeover Proposal and the Person making the proposal and other aspects of the
Parent Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of Parent deems
relevant, and (B) if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable
from a financial point of view to the holders of Parent Common Stock (solely
in their capacity as such) than the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, for the purposes of this definition of "Parent Superior Proposal," the
term "Parent Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term
herein, except that references to "15%" in such definition shall be deemed to
be references to "50%".

from any Person, other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, relating
to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or
a series of related transactions) of assets of Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries (including Securities of any Parent Subsidiaries) equal to 15% or
more of the consolidated assets of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, or to
which 15% or more of the revenues of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis are attributable for the most recent fiscal year in which
audited financial statements are then available, (B) direct or indirect
acquisition from Parent or issuance (whether in a single transaction or a
series of related transactions) of 15% or more of any class of equity or

transaction or series of related transactions involving Parent or any of the

of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis are attributable
for the most recent fiscal year in which audited financial statements are then
available, or (2) the stockholders or equityholders of such Person
immediately after giving effect to such transaction(s) would Beneficially Own
15% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Parent or the
surviving or resulting entity in such transaction(s).

Company Subsidiaries to, deliver all customary notices and take all other
reasonably necessary actions to facilitate the termination on the Closing Date

all such repayments at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that, no
such repayment shall be required to be made prior to the Effective Time.

 (other than a Parent Takeover Proposal subject to Regulation 14D) shall have
been publicly announced or disclosed (other than by the Company, its
Affiliates or its Representatives), fail to recommend against such Parent
Takeover Proposal or fail to reaffirm the Parent Recommendation on or prior to
the earlier of (I) 10 Business Days after such Parent Takeover Proposal shall
have been publicly announced or disclosed and (II) five Business Days prior
to the Parent Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ , that the Company shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.1(d)(iii)(A)_, _(B)_ or _(D)_ if the Parent Stockholder Approval has been
obtained.

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of any termination of
this Agreement as provided in _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ (Termination), the
obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate and there shall be no
liability on the part of any Party with respect thereto, except for the
confidentiality provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ (Access to Information;
Confidentiality) and the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ (Effect of
Termination), _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ (Termination Fees),  _Section_ __ _ 9.4_
(Parent Expenses) and _Article X_ (General Provisions), each of which shall
remain in full force and effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to the
final sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ _(_ _c_ _)_ , no Party shall be
relieved or released from any liability or damages arising from a Willful
Breach of any provision of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that in
the event of a Willful Breach of this Agreement by the Company (as finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), following any termination of
this Agreement, unless the Company has previously paid the Company Termination
Fee pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_, Parent shall be entitled to
$18,340,000 (the " _Willful Breach Damages_ "). Each of the Parties
acknowledges that the Willful Breach Damages are an integral part of this
Agreement, and that the Willful Breach Damages are not a penalty, but rather
is a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub in the
circumstances in which such payment is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. In addition, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the
Willful Breach Damages when due and payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
9.2_ (Effect of Termination), then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent and
Merger Sub for all costs and expenses (including disbursements and fees of
counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amount, including in
connection with any related Proceedings commenced and (ii) the Company shall
pay to Parent and Merger Sub interest on the unpaid Willful Breach Damages
from and including the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding
the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus 2%.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, upon payment of
the Willful Breach Damages pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ (Effect of
Termination), none of the Company, any of their respective former, current or
future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members,
Affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. In the event that the
Willful Breach Damages have been actually paid by the Company pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, no Company Termination Fee shall be payable at any
time pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)(ii)_.

(c) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this 
_Section_ __ _ 9.3_ (Termination Fees) are an integral part of this
Agreement, and that (i) the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but

Section 10.3 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or
Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation". The words "made available" shall be deemed to mean that such
information was included in the Companys electronic data room or Parents
electronic data room, as applicable, or was otherwise provided to the
applicable Party (as demonstrated by reasonable documentation), prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement. The definitions contained in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such
terms. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting
of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as drafted jointly by
the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this
Agreement. The words "hereby," "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and words
of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole (including any Exhibits
hereto and Schedules delivered herewith) and not merely to the specific
section, paragraph or clause in which such word appears. Whenever the context
may require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine
and neuter forms. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all
references to "Dollars" or "$" shall be deemed references to the lawful money
of the United States of America. Any reference in this Agreement to a date or
time shall be deemed to be such date or time in the City of New York, New
York, U.S.A., unless otherwise specified. Any reference to a number of days
shall refer to calendar days unless Business Days are specified. Any
reference to "ordinary course of business" or any similar concept refers to
the ordinary course of business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
in each case, consistent with past practices. References to any statute, rule
or regulation are to the statute, rule or regulation as amended, modified,
supplemented or replaced from time to time (and, in the case of
statutes, include any rules and regulations promulgated under said statutes)
and to any section of any statute, rule or regulation including any successor
to said section. All terms defined in this Agreement have the defined meanings
when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant
hereto, unless otherwise defined therein. When reference is made herein to a
Person, such reference shall be deemed to include all direct and indirect
Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated or the context
otherwise requires. The terms "or", "any" and "either" are not exclusive. The
word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if".
The word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect as the
word "shall".

 

Section 10.4 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but
all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement
shall become effective when each Party shall have received counterparts
thereof signed and delivered by the other Parties. Signatures transmitted
electronically shall be accepted as originals for all purposes of this
Agreement.

 

Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the Exhibits and the Parties disclosure letters hereto) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party, and
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any Person not a party to this Agreement any rights, benefits or
remedies of any nature

 



89

    

 whatsoever, other than, after the Effective Time, (a) _ Section_ __ _ 7.8_
(Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance) (which is intended to
be for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons covered thereby and may be
enforced by such Indemnified Persons), (b) the right of holders of Company
Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration and (c) the right of the
holders of Company Stock Options to receive such amounts as provided for in
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_.

Section 10.6  _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or
public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

Section 10.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties,
in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise), without the
prior written consent of the other Parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

 

Section 10.8 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company or the stockholders of Parent,
but, after such approval, no amendment shall be made which by Law or in
accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further
approval by such stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each of the Parties.

Section 10.9 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any
of the agreements or, except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)_
(Stockholder Approvals), conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of
any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement
or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

 

Section 10.10 _G_ _overning Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS RULES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW THAT WOULD
CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY STATE OTHER THAN THE STATE OF
DELAWARE. The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, in the event (but only
in the event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over
such action or Proceeding, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware
(Complex Commercial Division) or, if the subject matter jurisdiction over the
action or Proceeding is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United
States of America, the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware in respect of all matters arising out of or relating to this
Agreement the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement, and

 



90

    

 of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the
Transactions, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any
Proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such
document, that it is not subject thereto or that such Proceeding may not be
brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may
not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not
be enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties irrevocably agree that all
claims with respect to such action or Proceeding shall be heard and determined
exclusively in such courts. The Parties hereby consent to and grant any such
court jurisdiction over the person of such Parties solely for such purpose
and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process
or other papers in connection with any such action or Proceeding in the manner
provided in  _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ (Notices) or in such other manner as may
be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 10.10(B)_.

Section 10.11 _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement was not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that (a) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in
equity and (b) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have
entered into this Agreement. The Parties agree not to assert that a remedy of
specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable
for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would
provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate
remedy at Law. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this  _Section_ __ _ 10.11_ shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.
